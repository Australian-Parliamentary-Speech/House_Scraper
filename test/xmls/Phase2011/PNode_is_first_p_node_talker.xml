        <talk.start><para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave.)</inline> - I desire to announce an alteration in the personnel of the Government. As honorable members are aware, the honorable member for Calare <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Neville Howse),</inline> suffered, last year, a very serious illness which necessitated his relinquishing the portfolio of Minister for Defence. In the consequent reallotment of offices, the honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr),</inline> who had been an Honorary Minister, became Minister for Home and Territories. I am glad to say that the health of the honorable member for Calare has been completely restored, and that he has again accepted a portfolio. He will administer the Department for Home and Territories and the Department of Health, and the honorable member for Parkes will resume his previous position as an Honorary Minister. </para></talk.start>
