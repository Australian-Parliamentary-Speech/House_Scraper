As honorable members are aware, the honorable member for Calare (Sir Neville Howse), suffered, last year, a very serious illness which necessitated his relinquishing the portfolio of Minister for Defence. In the consequent reallotment of offices, the honorable member for Parkes (Mr. Marr), who had been an Honorary Minister, became Minister for Home and Territories. I am glad to say that the health of the honorable member for Calare has been completely restored, and that he has again accepted a portfolio. He will administer the Department for Home and Territories and the Department of Health, and the honorable member for Parkes will resume his previous position as an Honorary Minister.","N/A","N/A","/root/speech/talk.start/para"
