We understand that, which is why we are undertaking measures to take pressure off the cost of living. It is why we introduced cheaper pharmaceuticals, why we've introduced fee-free TAFE and why we will have cheaper child care on 1 July. Many Australians who do have fixed rates will be impacted when those fixed rates end, whenever the particular arrangements that they have as individuals with their financial institutions end. So we know that this is an issue, and that is why we are doing all that we can, just as we did last October, to produce a responsible budget.","N/A","N/A","/root/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]"

That's why, in particular in the lead-up to the May budget, we will continue to put forward a responsible economic policy, because interest rates began to increase on your watch.","N/A","N/A","/root/answer/talk.text/body/p[12]"
