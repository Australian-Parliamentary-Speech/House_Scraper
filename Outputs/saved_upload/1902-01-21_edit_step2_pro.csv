Mr. White, the Charge d Affaires, was instructed by his Government to ask that on expression of the sincere and heartfelt gratitude, with which these messages have been received by the President of the United States, should be conveyed to the House of Representatives. 3. Mr. White explains, on behalf of his Government, that pressure of public business, attendant upon the death of President McKinley, has alone, prevented on earlier message of appreciation of these evidences of friendship and deep feeling.","N/A","DEATH OF PRESIDENT McKINLEY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech/quote/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

I know that three honorable members voted for 20 per cent, rather than for 15 per cent, in view of what was termed the exemption clause that they were prepared to accept 20 per cent, with that clause if it were satisfactory, but failing its being satisfactory, they were in favour of 15 per cent, all round. It is only fair that we should know definitely whether the Government intend proceeding upon the lines indicated. If the exemption clause is not acceptable to the majority of the committee, there will be no other course but to move the recommittal of the whole item ; and, if the Government have abandoned the idea of the Treasurer, we can only vote for N.E.I, at 15 per cent., as an indication of what we propose doing with the whole of the item. When the division was taken, there was a majority of only one or two, and, as I have said, there are at least three honorable members who prefer a duty of 15 per cent, all round, though, with a big exemption clause, they were prepared to agree to 20 per cent.

In view of the indication of the Government that an exemption clause of that character would be made, I was prepared to vote for a duty of 20 per cent, on those articles in common use which can easily be manufactured in Australia. I hardly think it would be wise to make the amendment now moved a test question as to the advisability of having 15 per cent, all round. Before I face that situation, I desire to see what class of machinery it is proposed to exempt, and I am not certain that it is possible to get a satisfactory list. It is difficult, because some classes of machinery, which are properly in the exemption list, may compete with other classes of machinery which are not in the list, and which can be manufactured here. I admit that the whole matter is full of difficulty ; but if the Government, as indicated by the honorable member for Barrier, has abandoned the idea of drawing out some such list of machinery which it is impossible or difficult to manufacture here, I shall be prepared to vote on this amendment as a test question. I should prefer that we waited until we saw what class of machinery the Government propose to exempt. I do not think that, intrinsically, it is good to vote for the amendment. We shall have the more important classes of machinery. such as, for instance, are useful to the mining community, rated at 20 per cent, under this proposal, while machinery  N.E.I. which is made up of a vast number of miscellaneous articles, will be charged at a lower rate. I think it would be wise for those who previously voted in favour of the imposition of a 20 per cent, duty, to Vote for a similar rate in this instance, and to await the proposal which the Government intend to make. If the Government do not come forward with a proposal which is satisfactory to a majority of the committee in connexion with the exemptions, I take it that some honorable members will be at liberty to change their attitude in regard to a 20 per cent. rate.

80,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"TURNER, George","KWT","N/A","Protectionist","N/A",8961,"I do not know why the honorable member for Bland assumes that the Government have in any way changed their opinions, or that they desire to deal with this item in a particular manne. In attempting to meet the fair and legitimate demands made on behalf of mining machinery great difficulties arose, looking at the matter from the point of view of those who had to use that machinery, and also from the standpoint of the very large number of people engaged in its manufacture in the various States. We therefore suggested that a certain duty should be imposed, and intimated that where articles could not reasonably be manufactured within the Commonwealth, we should be prepared to place them upon the free list absolutely. We asked honorable members who have had a larger experience in regard to some of these articles than we could possibly have had to supply us with lists of them. Up to the present time, however, only two or three articles have been mentioned. We asked that lists should be given to us. We stated that we would examine any lists supplied to us, and ascertain whether the articles which they contained ought to be placed upon the schedule of exemptions. We also declared that, in order to meet the difficulty that would arise in regard to new patented articles, we were prepared to insert words which would give the Minister power, subject to the control of Parliament, to put those articles upon the free list from time to time. That, I think, was a very fair proposal, and it appeared to me to meet with the approval of the committee. To urge now that we should impose a 15 per cent, rate upon everything, irrespective of whether it is made within the Commonwealth or not, is not fair to the manufacturers or to those employed by them, and can scarcely be said to be in the interests of the mining companies, whom we desire to assist as much as possible. We see no reason why we should go back upon the articles which have already been dealt with. They were discussed very fully for two or three days, and the committee arrived at certain decisions. We shall presently deal with the exemption list, and if honorable members will supply us with the information in their possession in regard to articles, or portions thereof, which they desire to see admitted free, we shall be glad to meet them in every way that we possibly can. But we cannot consent to the proposition that all patented articles shall be admitted either at 1 5 per cent, or free. That would be injurious to the importers. They import patented articles and articles which are not patented, whilst the manufacturers make a large number of articles locally which are not patented, and compete with those which are. There is no doubt that if we attempted to say that all patented mining machinery should be admitted at a lower rate or free, we should be doing something which would be injurious to those whom we desire to protect. The Government have no intention of receding from the position which they took up upon a previous occasion.  Mr. SYDNEY SMITH (Macquarie).I cordially support the amendment submitted by the honorable member for North Sydney. We have already decided that springs shall be admitted at 15 per cent., and that mixed metalware shall come in at the same rate. Yet it is now proposed to charge 20 per cent, upon articles  N.E.I., which includes a number that we would be more justified in admitting at 15 per cent, than many others which we have already decided should bear that duty. I think that the committee should be placed in possession of a list of the articles which will come under the heading of N.E.I. At present we are working very much in the dark. Then, again, we have decided to admit screws free, although I am thoroughly satisfied that if we had a list of the articles covered by N.E.I. we should find many which might be admitted free with more justification than exists in the case of screws. I fancy that there will be a great difficulty in enumerating all the machinery which should be included in the schedule of exemptions. The Minister for Trade and Customs should, I think, place the committee in possession of the fullest information in connexion with this item. Many honorable members voted upon. Friday last under an altogether wrong impression. Had they been aware of the class of machinery included under  N.E.I., I feel sure that a very different vote would have been recorded. I recognise that there is a difficulty in particularizing the various articles which should be included in the schedule of exemptions. Let us take electrical machinery as an example. I have no doubt that there are 60 or 70 different parts of these machines alone, all of: which should be specified under the free list. How are we to particularize every article? I think it would be far better if the Government could see their way to postpone dealing with the items included under N.E.I., or accept the proposed duty of 15 per cent, until the exemption list comes to be dealt with by the committee. If that is not done a number, of inconsistencies: will be found to exist, because while the original proposal of the Government was to have the duty upon all these articles fixed at 25 per cent., after the information supplied by honorable members respecting the various items under discussion, we had some put upon the free list, others fixed at 15 per. cent., and then the Government came down with a proposal to include the whole of the remainder at 20 per. cent. Honorable members were told that they should fix the duty at 25 per cent. on. the items of mixed metalware, and plated cutlery, because they were luxuries ; but it has been pointed out that many of the articles included in these lines are used by the poorest people in the community. That has been admitted by the Government. If we had a list of the articles included under  n.e.i., and upon which the Government propose that the duty should be 20 per cent., we should find that there are a. number of them which ought to be on the free list, as being used by numbers of the poorer classes of the people. Those are the people to whom we should give every consideration, as they are the least able to bear the burden of taxation, and we should have a list of these articles so that the committee may be able to deal with the matter in an intelligent way.","In Committee of Ways and Means :","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In the first place the number of patented articles is very considerable, and in addition to that we could not have a complete list, because so far as mining in Western Australia is concerned the treatment of ores there is still really in the experimental stage. There are several problems in connexion with the treatment of ores which have not yet been solved ; almost every week something new arises, and those having the management of some of the big, mines in Western Australia endeavour to solve these problems, by the introduction of .the latest machinery. Another point is that the machinery in connexion with those mines is continually being improved. Fresh patents are being taken out every day. What would; be the position of those who require machinery patented subsequently to the passage of this Tariff? It would be very, unfair to allow machinery patented up to the present time to be admitted free and to compel the most recent type of patented machinery to pay a duty of 20 per cent.

If we had no duty on patented machinery or anything that has a patent attached to it, honorable members must see the advantage, in addition to his patent rights, which that would confer on the patentee. He would be the only one who could manufacture the machinery here, and if he did not choose to exercise that right he could send in the machinery at . 20 per cent. or whatever the duty might be lower than the price charged by any other competitor. What I put to honorable members is this, and it is the basis upon, winch we dealt with the question of agricultural machinery, and upon which we are proceeding right through : We ought to know, and we do know, the nature of the machinery that can be constructed here, and which cannot be made here. We have been able to deal with the matter on these very lines so far as agricultural machinery is concerned, and, I believe, to deal with it satisfactorily. But the difficulty which arises is that there are very few machines which cannot be manufactured here, and so it would be impossible for honorable members generally to put a list of them on the file, as we have asked them time and again to do.  Tell us what you consider we cannot manufacture, and we will have the matter investigated and bring down a report on the subject, to enable you to deal with it. That is what we said last week. When I made inquiries this morning, and found that little or nothing had been sent in, I could_ hardly believe it ; but I am informed by the Treasurer that the honorable member for Kooyong supplied a list a few minutes ago. If I remember aright, I suggested that honorable members should send in their lists. We do not want to do anything to the disadvantage of the country, and, while we believe in protection, we do not believe in exacting an exorbitant rate for the importation of machinery, when no machinery of the kind, or similar in character, can be constructed here. It may be, that where protection is not required, a revenue duty may, under the special circumstances of the Commonwealth, fairly be asked for ; but, however that may be, we should differentiate between the two things. Honorable members opposite say that >  Australians cannot make these things. We say that they can make them as well as any one else can do so. At the very least, honorable members opposite should prove, or attempt to prove, their assertions. Let them tell us in respect to what machinery they make their allegation, so that we can investigate their  statements. I ask them not to continue to indulge in these vague assertions against the capability of Australians to do what the members of other industrial communities can do. When honorable members state their special cases, those cases will be given the fullest consideration, and they will be advised of the result. There has been no departure from the course which we originally intimated that we intended to follow ; and I trust that the Government, in dealing with the committee, will never alter its attitude so as to place any honorable member in a false position. We stick to the  offer that we made. Tell us what articles cannot be made here. Let us have an opportunity to investigate the facts, and, over and above that investigation, we will give the matter the benefit of the advice tendered by our expert advisors as to any machinery or manufacture of metal which requires specially lenient treatment. We shall apply the information we receive, whether it comes from honorable members or from sources specially at our command.","In Committee of Ways and Means :","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[10]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We are not in a position now, even if we desired to do so, to consider the reversal of the vote which we have already given ; that is a matter for future consideration, if it is to be entered upon at all. It seems to me that the position is this : We desired, and the Government acquiesced in the view, that patented mining machinery which could not reasonably be made in the Commonwealth should not be taxed, because to tax it would really be to tax and hamper the mining industry. It was recognised that there are exceptional circumstances connected with the prosecution of the mining industry in Australia, and that the conditions are not the same in every part of the continent, so that we cannot make one rigid rule which will meet all cases. The Government seem to me prepared to reasonably meet the position reasonably stated by honorable  I members. But it would be to go to an illogical and improper extreme to say that, because in certain exceptional cases it is right in the interests of mining to allow machinery to be imported free of duty, although it could be manufactured here since, as the Minister says, it is conceivable that we could manufacture it all here all patented machinery should be imported free. If honorable members were able to enumerate at the present moment every piece of machinery which should properly be exempted, it would not be proper to confine the exemptions to the list so made up, because every day new inventions are made. It is necessary, therefore, to provide a description rather than an enumeration ; to lay down a principle which will embrace all cases as they arise. In doing that we must trust largely to the proper administration of the Customs department, and we might lay down the rule in this way : that articles which are patented and cannot reasonably be made in Australia shall come in free. Even that description may be too large under circumstances which we have not now in view ; but, applying it to mining machinery it appears to cover the ground. Honorable members are aware that there is an enormous difference between a patented invention which may consist of a bearing or valve used in connexion with machinery which otherwise is not patented at all, and could be, and should be, profitably made in Australia, and a complicated, heavy, expensive piece of patented machinery, the demand for which is so small and the cost of making so large, that we could not reasonably expect any one to set up a foundry in Australia to make it. In the first case I do not think the machinery should be exempt, but I think that in the second case it should. It seems to me that the Government made a very fair promise, and that they are adhering to it. The time for the reconsideration of the matter will be, I apprehend, when the Government submit their list of exemptions, which may be extended or amended. It is too late and too early to consider the question now. It is too late in view of the vote which has been given in regard to mining machinery.","In Committee of Ways and Means :","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We should see that in the future we are not landed in the difficulty which apparently we are in now. It is a matter for very grave consideration. At present we have to deal with things as they are. I think we should proceed with the consideration of the particular proposal before the Chair, independently of the promise which the Government made the other day, and which I have no doubt they will honorably abide by, and if they do not the remedy is in the hands of the State.  Mr. KNOX (Kooyong). I do hot propose to go into the merits or demerits of our patent laws. The mining industry has distinctly been advantaged by very useful patents which have been introduced. My suggestion that a duty of 15 per cent, all round would save a great deal of trouble will, I think, force itself more on the minds of honorable members when they come to consider the individual items, and I claim to be as distinctly desirous of seeing as much of our mining machinery manufactured within the Commonwealth as is any honorable member. Where deep sinking is carried on, all mines that use air require compressors. A large number of mining companies use what is known as the Reidler Compressor. Its whole merit consists in the application of a certain valve for forcing in the air or keeping it in. It would be an injustice to manufacturers of machinery in Victoria alone, not to speak of those in the other States, to say that they cannot build an ordinary air compressor. They can do it satisfactorily, and are doing it every day. Would it be just to say that a compressor which had a special Reidler valve attached should be introduced free? It would be an injustice to the local manufacturers, and that is where the difficulties arise. You will find that it is a very small portion of the machinery which cannot be satisfactorily manufactured here.","In Committee of Ways and Means :","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[11]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

First, from the freetrade point of view, all the freetraders are desirous of having the duty taken away. Secondly, from the point of view of the revenue tariffists, I think it will be generally admitted that a duty of from 10 to 12½ per cent, would yield the maximum of revenue with the minimum of inconvenience. Now we have the Government going still further, and asking us to impose a protective duty. They say that they will make a concession to us if we will state what articles we desire to be placed on the free list. What a subversion of the ordinary way of doing things ! Surely, if they wish to see that an article is protected, they ought to name it. They ought to be the very first to bring forward a list of the articles which are being manufactured here, and say  We want a duty imposed, and we can show that the industry is already established. No list of that sort has been brought forward by them, but they ask us to enumerate not only the articles which are used at the present time, but those which will be used in the future, as if in fact we could pry into minds of inventors and tell exactly what is likely to be invented. Because we do not happen to know what has been invented this year, or what will be invented next year, it all has to pay 20 per cent, duty ; but all articles which can be named Ministers will allow to come in free. If the Ministry will consider the matter, they will see what a curious position they are placing themselves in. They are making this assertion, that all the knowledge concerning machinery is known to them, and ought to be known to us, and we ought to be able to supply them with a list. I hope that the Ministry will reconsider the matter and see that they have taken up an utterly indefensible position, and one which certainly from a protectionist point of view they cannot defend. If, as they say, a duty is absolutely necessary in Victoria for some of these articles, and at the same time the articles are being manufactured in New South Wales, it is perfectly clear that the Victorian manufacturer cannot exist at all now that the InterState duties have been swept away.

Mining and agriculture may be regarded as the main primary industries of the Commonwealth, and as we have already fixed the duty on agricultural machinery at 15 per cent., it will be reasonable to place the mining industry upon the same footing with regard to machinery. In the case of mining and agricultural machinery, great improvements are being made daily. The Ministry have intimated their readiness to make some concession in the direction of admitting patented machinery free of duty if it can be shown that such machinery cannot be manufactured here, but it will be very difficult to give that proof. Almost anything can be produced here if the question of cost is not taken into account, but the expense involved in the local manufacture of machinery should receive the fullest consideration. I agree to some extent with the honorable and learned member for Indi that some concession should be given to local as distinguished from foreign inventors, but we should not give to any individual a complete monopoly with respect to an invention. Inventors should reap every reasonable reward, but when their inventions become important factors, in production, the State should step in and by a fair system of compensation make them available for the benefit of the whole community. That, however, is a question that we shall have to consider when we deal with the patent laws. I hope the Ministry will agree to the suggestion that the duty should be reduced to 15 per cent.  Mr. G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney).The Government will act wisely and facilitate business if they suspend the consideration of the duty upon articles, N.E.I., until the exemptions are dealt with. We can hardly be expected to enter into the details of the proposal before us until we know what articles are to be placed upon the free list. Although a good case has been made out for the special exemption of patent mining machinery, I hold that other interests are worthy of consideration equally with the mining community. The manufacturers of Victoria would stand in a far better position today if patented machinery had been admitted free of duty from the beginning. I have seen many instances in which the want of uptodate machinery has retarded manufacturers in Victoria, and we should make a general exemption of machinery or impose only a low rate of duty. I shall be strongly opposed to any special legislation in favour of the mining industry. The country generally will benefit from the admission of the latest forms of machinery at as low a rate of duty as possible, consistently with the collection of sufficient revenue to carry on the Government, but until we know what articles are to be placed upon the free list we cannot very well deal with the proposal now before us.

This item applies to machinery used in all classes of industries and the proposal of the Government is a tax on improvements. It has been pointed out by several honorable members on the Government side, that many industrial enterprises in Victoria have failed to result} in satisfactory balancesheets owing to the want of up to date machinery; the absence of which, I have no doubt, is largely owing to the heavy duties on machinery which cannot be made in the State. Without the most modern appliances we cannot keep pace with the rapid march of events in other countries. We should not depend on our own markets for the progress of this community, but largely on our export trade ; and to create and retain thats, trade we must have the advantage of the latest inventions. In many cases, thamanufacturer of woollens and other pro* ducts has a natural protection in the dis1tance which separates London from A us tralia:. . They admit that they cannot profitably export any of their goods to the old country when they ask for a heavy protective duty to prevent the imported article from competing with them. But what is a natural protection to, say, a woollenmill constitutes a natural drawback to many of our primary industries, which depend for their success upon an export trade. Our producers have to deliver their produce in London, and to compete with all the other nations of the world, and therefore we must make the cost of production as low as possible. If we impose a heavy tax upon all the machinery which is used in production, we shall be placing our farmers, our miners, and our stockowners, who depend for their success upon an export trade, under a serious disability. Take for example the dairying industry. If we had to supply only the requirements of the Commonwealth, what would become of all our dairy farmers ? Their success depends upon their export trade with the old country, just as Denmark depends upon a similar trade in butter. To enable these people to successfully carry on their operations, we must allow them to obtain the machinery used in production as cheaply as possible. The same remark is applicable to the case of the miners. We know very well that the requirements of the Commonwealth in regard to lead, copper, tin, Ac, constitute a mere bagatelle. The success of our mines depends upon the price of metals at home. One of the chief reasons for the stagnation of the mining industry today is the drop in the price of metals, and yet it is now proposed to place a heavy impost upon nearly all classes of mining machinery. By adopting such a course we shall be unduly taxing this great industry and rendering it less able to produce at anything like a remunerative price. Is that a fair course to pursue in view of what has been done in the case of other industries 1 . The committee have already decided that the machinery employed in many other industries which do not depend for their success upon an export trade shall be admitted free. They have also imposed a duty of 15 or 20 per cent, upon the articles produced in those industries. Despite these facts, however, it is now proposed to still further handicap the agriculturalist by compelling him to pay an additional 1 5 per cent, upon all the machinery which he requires. I hope that the committee will not sanction this injustice. Even if those who think with me are not successful on the present occasion, I hope that a straightout vote will be taken to determine whether mining machinery generally is to be included under the heading of  N.E.I. Personally, I should like all this machinery placed on the free list. The Government urged that all the articles mentioned in this item should be dutiable at 25 per cent., and yet after discussion they reduced the rate to 20 per cent. They also put screws upon the free list. ","In Committee of Ways and Means :","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[14]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If the honorable and learned member for Bendigo were here, he would probably ask that rails should be placed on the free list, because a few mines happen to be in his electorate.

The matter was not discussed very much in the convention. The basis of the decisions in America was that if power were given to the Federation to tax State property, the Federation could really paralyze the States by confiscating their property. Of course that does not apply to the placing under a general Customs law of the States as States. If it would paralyze the States to pay a duty upon imported goods it would similarly paralyze an individual or a company Consequently the logic of American decisions ought not to apply to the case of ordinary importations. It is quite open to consideration whether the words of section 114 of the Constitution are equivalent to declaring that State goods or State property shall be exempt from the general law. I say that it may not mean that. It may simply mean that no special law is to be passed whereby State property is subject to taxation. Of course there are considerations which tell even against this construction, because section 51 prevents special taxation of State property. On the whole I am inclined to agree with the opinion offered by the leader of the Opposition, that the section means that no taxation is to be imposed upon State property that it does not only mean that a special Act should not be passed in respect to State property. Nevertheless, as the matter is so doubtful and so important, we ought not, by our Customs regulations and Act, to exempt State property from taxation, but ought to leave the  Constitution to operate in respect to State property. Then, if Customs duties are collected in respect of the imports of a particular State, and that State objects, it can appeal to the High Court of Australia to test the question. Mr. KIRWAN (Kalgoorlie). I should like to draw the attention of the committee to the extraordinary action of the Government in connexion with this .particular item. In the first place, they proposed that rails should be placed upon the free list. Then, because two honorable members representing Queensland got up and talked about certain syndicate railways in that State the existence of which we all regret the Government have calmly gone back upon their original proposal and have agreed that a duty of 15 per cent, should be imposed. That simply means that all the mines in Australia which use these rails for ore tramways, not only on the surface but underground, are to be penalized because of certain syndicate railways in Queensland. The action of the Government is a most extraordinary one, and I feel so strongly upon this matter that I intend to move that rails shall be included in the list of exemptions. I agree with what has been said by one or two honorable members upon this side of the House, namely, that rails might very well be regarded as a commodity which should be taxed for revenue purposes. But in considering this Tariff, we have to consider each item in relation to every other item. When, therefore, mining machinery is taxed at the rate of 20 per cent., we may reasonably ask that rails should be placed on the free list. That is a perfectly consistent attitude for a revenue tariffist to adopt, and, under the circumstances, I trust that the honorable member for Parramatta will withdraw his amendment, so that I may move in the direction I have indicated. Mr. REID (East Sydney). Before that is done, I should like to mention for the information of the committee, that the AttorneyGeneral has informed the Municipal Corporation of Sydney that under section 114 of the Constitution Act it is impossible for the municipal authorities to impose even municipal rates upon Commonwealth buildings in that city.

My feeling is that this is an item from which the Government are justified in expecting a considerable revenue, and they can secure it if they adhere to what I am advised is their legal position.

But the Government in power in Queensland when the honorable member was in the State Parliament there declined to construct these railways, and I contend that, when a State Government are not prepared to construct a line themselves, they should not interfere with private enterprise when private investors are prepared to take the risks attending such undertakings. What I have said applies to New South Wales in connexion with the railway constructed there to connect Broken Hill with the South Australian border. It applies to the railway in Tasmania which connects the Mount Lyell mine with the port, and it applies also to another line recently approved of by the South Australian State Parliament, and which has been rapidly constructed. These lines are proving of public convenience, and of the greatest benefit to the States in which they are constructed, as well as to the enterprises with which they are connected. I make this statement in order that there may be no misapprehension on the part of any honorable member that the question as to whether these rails are going to be supplied to the owners of syndicate railways or not does not affect the question now under discussion in the least degree. In my judgment, the question before us is whether the Commonwealth revenue may be benefited by the imposition of the duty proposed, and, incidentally, whether it may not lead to a benefit to the Commonwealth through the establishment of new works within it. I believe that, with the incidental assistance of a 10 per cent, duty, large works of this kind will be established, and successfully carried on, to the benefit of this great community.

All I can say upon that point is that I have no sympathy with the tendency to condemn private enterprise, when it happens to take the form of a railway, because it happens to be started in its initial form by a syndicate. We know very well that the word  syndicate, like the word  capital, has terrors for a certain class of politicians. Every one of us knows, however, that the promoters of every company in the world may fairly be called a  syndicate, and in that way stigmatized as an undesirable body. They are merely a group of nien coming together in the preliminary stage of a great enterprise before it can be brought under a Companies Act. The point I wish to bring before the committee is this : It is proposed under the exemption clause to allow the States to import all their railway iron without paying any duty upon it. I understand that the Minister for Trade and Customs, backed, I believe, by the AttorneyGeneral, has expressed the opinion that under the section of the Constitution referred to, the States would be entitled to have this commodity introduced free. I may be wrong, but I did understand from one honorable, member that the Minister for Trade and Customs had expressed the opinion that there was so much doubt about it that it was better to put it in the Tariff in this form.

That raises the much broader question as to whether it is advisable that the Commonwealth should take duty from the States, and I am bound to say that, in my private opinion, there is no reason why the Commonwealth should not be paid duty by them in the same way as by any other corporation. I think we should, above all things, require all the entities, whether constitutional or legal, connected with the Commonwealth, to stand upon their own feet. There is a very oldfashioned practice of allowing one particular department of State to set off some favour against another, in return for some favour from it.  For instance, in the past, it has been the habit of the States to carry members of Parliament free over the railways, merely because they are members of Parliament ; but I am quite sure we have all been very glad to see that since the Commonwealth has come into existence, a more businesslike practice has been adopted, and that the Commonwealth is now going to pay for having its members carried over the State railways.","Majority ... ... 4","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[15]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We know also that according to the form which the Property Acquisition Bill has taken it is provided that when under the Constitution the Commonwealth takes over any public buildings, the property of a State, it shall pay the State outright for them. I should like to draw the attention of the committee to the fact that not only in New South Wales, but in all the States it was the custom to allow the departments to modify their accounts in some way or other when dealing with the State. For instance, water and sewerage boards were not allowed to charge the Government departments for water supplied to them, although it was recognised as essential that as water and sewerage board should stand upon its own footing, and show, in an accurate form, at the end of each year, how much it had paid away and how much it had earned. The particular question is whether the Commonwealth, the States, and the municipalities throughout the Commonwealth ought not to pay their way. Ought they not to charge one another whenever they afford some benefit to some other of these local or Constitutional entities 1 If we are going to make this unmeaning exception in favour of the States, shall we not be entering upon a loose system of conducting our political business ? Even if we admit that the people of the Commonwealth and the people of the States, are identical, is it not better that the States should pay their way? If we are bent on obtaining revenue under this Tariff, is. it not better that we should supplement our revenue in a legitimate way by calling upon the States to pay duty on railway iron according to the quantities they import ? Under a particular clause in the Constitution, the Commonwealth will be called upon, probably in a few years time, to purchase the railways of the different States. That may or may not be. My own opinion is that within the next quarter of a century at least, the whole of the railways of Australia will be under the Commonwealth. If that is the case, the Commonwealth will have to pay for these railways. If they are to be paid for according to a valuation, there is no reason why the States should not, at this period, pay the market value for their commodities, and pay the duties upon them just as every other corporation is required to do. Again, if a State at the present time called for tenders for railway material from a local agent, he would have to add to the cost of the article itself the duty which he would be required to pay before he could deliver it to the State. But if the State happened to call for tenders in England for the same commodity the tender could be minus duty, because the State would be able to say We have no duty to pay on this article, because it is State property.  The result of this would be that no local manufacturer, no local importer, would have the same opportunity of tendering for an article for a State in competition with any manufacturer in America, or in England, because in the one case the duty would have to be paid, while in the other it would not.

At the same time, I trust that in these matters of protection and freetrade, especially in matters of protection, we shall consider and deal with the item as far as we possibly can on general principles, and not have any regard to how it affects a particular district or State. I think I have only to mention that matter to induce honorable members to give it the fullest recognition. It is a matter which any one of us may forget at the moment in consideration for a particular State, but when an honorable member is asked to think of it he will come to the conclusion that whatever State is concerned the principle is. the same, and wherever it is possible to apply it it should be applied. We should have been ashamed, indeed, to apply a. principle to Victorian industries and not to New South Wales industries, or to natural resources of Western Australia and not to. natural resources of Queensland. We ought to do all we can on the principle for the various States in an equal degree, finding out those cases in which it can properly be applied, and there applying it within reason. On the subject of this proposal for a 10 per cent, duty on rails, what do we find ? We find that rails are being manufactured in New South Wales already. Some one suggests that they are, or shortly will be, manufactured in Victoria, and we have from various quarters of the Chamber an assurance that the supply will be equal to the demand. Under these circumstances, rails are undoubtedly entitled to a protective duty. What has been considered by the committee a protective duty in this connexion? Ten per cent, has never been considered a protective duty. I remember that we selected cotton goods for revenue duties of the lightest description, and even as regards the exceptions it was not suggested that they were not sufficiently low, and there was an arrangement made whereby there was no duty placed on a certain portion of those goods. What is there about the iron industry, which is in existence and can be fairly encouraged, to necessitate that we should deny to the people of New South Wales that protection which we have accorded hitherto to a number of the States ? Ten per cent, is not a protective duty ; it is purely a revenue duty. As regards those who are undoubtedly freetraders, well and good. But as regards those who are protectionists, and who have voted on protectionist principles in this connexion, let us at least apply our principles to the consideration of this industry, and do what we can for the purpose of encouraging it. We are not doing that. We are not applying the same principle if we give as protection only a 10 per cent, duty, when we know perfectly well that it is a revenue duty pure and simple.

I am inclined to think that it may very fairly be argued that that does give the exemption suggested. But honorable members have pointed out that by the particular specification of goods imported by and for the use of a State we are hardly leaving the point open, and they suggest that we should remove the special exemption which is conveyed by the later words in the Tariff, and leave the matter to be interpreted by the federal courts. There is a good deal to be said in favour of that course. It will come up for discussion when we come to that part of the Tariff. Honorable members will notice that it does not make much difference what we do in this respect, at least during the bookkeeping period; for every penny that we collect, whether it is on the goods of private people or on the goods of a State will be accounted for, and, less certain deductions, returned to the State. Later on there may be different principles provided for. Without expressing any definite opinion I would say that this matter has troubled us a good deal, and we shall ask the House to give its best consideration to the question of whether or not the matter should be finally decided, so far as we can do it by ourselves, in a free gift to the States in the Tariff, or left to the construction of the Constitution. We are more deeply impressed with the importance of a question of this sort since we introduced the Tariff, because in a number of little matters brought under our notice attempts are being made to stretch the interpretation of the provision we inserted in a degree we hardly believe in, and there is a strong argument undoubtedly in favour of some alteration of it. There is also the argument that we should not provide for many exemptions, and it is hardly desirable to provide for exemptions that have nothing to do with questions of national policy, but which might well be left to the States to decide for themselves after the receipt of the money. If we provide in a national Tariff for a number of matters of State concern which are generally decided by the States themselves, we shall be making a mistake, and there is no doubt also that the less complicated we make the exemptions in favour of a particular class the better it will be for the simplicity of administration, and the less liable we shall be to abuses. I have made this statement to indicate how we. feel at this particular moment regarding the exemption of States, classes, or bodies, and I do not propose to go any further just now. I hope we shall deal with this New South Wales industry in the same liberal manner as we have treated other matters which have come under our consideration.  Mr. THOMSON (North Sydney) Referring to the remarks of the Minister for Trade and Customs as to whether the Commonwealth has the right to tax the imported property of a State, I think that this is not the right stage at which to discuss the matter, except incidentally. The Minister has not yet sounded by any means the loss of revenue that this provision is going to cause to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. In New South Wales goods consumed by the Government have been practically free of duty, and the Treasurer cannot know and has not reckoned the value of the goods which have come into New South Wales free in the past, but which will not come in free under the new conditions when the State Government adopts to the fullest extent the practice of carrying out its own work and of importing the goods required for that work. Prior to federation it made no great difference to the State Government if they had to pay duty, because if they bought, say, cement or similar goods in the open market at a price which included the duty added to the cost, they knew that they got the duty back in the form of revenue. If the section in the Constitution to which reference has been made was meant to cover what some honorable members seem to think it was designed to embrace a mistake was made, because its application under the new conditions will be very different from its effect under the operation of State laws. If the State paid duty on imported goods, they received that duty back. If the State has to pay the the duty now, it will not under the possible future distribution of Customs receipts get back the full amount that it has paid. The Minister for Trade and Customs stated that it would not make very much difference to the States during the bookkeeping period, but I think it will make a great difference, because the Treasurers of the States will look to the Treasurer of the Commonwealth to provide the revenue that they were previously in receipt of, although in that revenue there was included a considerable amount of duty which the State Government actually paid by buying goods duty paid in the open market instead of importing direct for themselves.","Majority ... ... 4","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[15]/continue[23]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is not a difference of £ s. d. so far as taking money out of one pocket and putting it in the other is concerned, but it is the difference that it will make to the Treasurers of the States, who will look for the full amount of revenue they have previously been receiving. There will be a tendency on the part of the States Governments to import their goods direct, and thus save the amount that would otherwise be paid in duty, and thereby be able to spend the saving. The State Treasurers will, at the same time, resist any reduction in the amount of duty returned to them by the Commonwealth Treasurer. I should like to direct attention to what the Ministry have, done in connexion with this item. First of all, the committee were requested to consent to rails being placed on the free list. The Government must have been perfectly aware that rails were being manufactured within the Commonwealth. Then when representations were made with reference to the rails required by syndicates, the Ministry at once stated that a duty ought to be imposed and afterwards they pointed out that a 10 per cent, duty would not afford sufficient protection to the local manufacturer, absolutely overlooking the fact that the manufacture of these rails which they were anxious to protect had proceeded for ten or twelve years without any duty whatever. Surely a 10 per cent, duty is the most the Ministry could ask for, and certainly the most the manufacturer would require. How can it be argued that a 10 per cent, duty will be absolutely insufficient where it has been shown that the industry can be carried on without any protection ? If the committee, cannot agree to admit these rails free, I hope that in the interest of the various industries in which rails are used they will agree to the reduction of the impost to 10 per cent.

I have listened to the debate from all sides, and I should like to have some indication as to what articles are likely to be placed on the free list. Having regard to the Tariff as a whole, I think the most useful vote the committee could record would be one in favour of a duty of 15 per cent, all round on machinery, unless there be some special case wherein it is shown that the machinery cannot be made within the Commonwealth. But, so far as I can gather, a great deal of machinery is going to be made in Australia ; stud under the circumstances, a duty of 15 per cent., which is the duty we fixed on agricultural machinery, is not exceptionally high. We have since reassembling, been debating at great length what the duties are to be, and we have had from fifteen to twenty divisions, but it appears to me that we are not one iota nearer completing the Tariff than we were this day week, and it is time there was some finality. The honorable member for Barrier said he had gone very carefully into this matter, and, having received promises from the Minister for Trade and Customs, he thought a definite under, standing had been come to as to what the Tariff should be. Desiring to get some idea as to what we are likely to arrive at, I asked the honorable member what the understanding was, and he replied  If we fix on a duty of 20 per cent., the Government will decide, when proposals are made to introduce certain machinery, whether or not that machinery can be made here. Fancy leaving such a question as that to the decision of any Government ! We should be in a constant state of argument with manufacturers in regard to every item of machinery ic was proposed to introduce. I pointed this out to a friend of mine in Sydney the other day, who had expressed much anxiety as to the Tariff on machinery, because he and others who desired to import, were in a state of uncertainty as to what to do. I told him that I had voted for a. duty of 1 5 per cent, on mining, machinery, as well as on agricultural machinery, and I went so far as to say that I should like to see machinery which could not be made here, under reasonable conditions placed on the free list. That gentleman wrote me a letter today, in which he states that about fifteen months ago he was instrumental in forming the Federal Coke Company Limited, at Wollongong, with a capital of £13,000, and that the works were designed after a principle used in America and Wales.

Personally, I see no reason why we should be parties to any agreement that happens to be made between a State Legislature and large contractors in that particular State. At the present time I feel that we are somewhat in a maze. I should like to see an understanding arrived at between the Opposition and the Government as to the sources from which we are to derive our revenue. I know that the honorable member for Robertson was elected as a revenue tariffist, but I have never yet seen him vote for the raising of revenue in any shape or form. Other members of the Opposition have acted similarly, although the leader of that party when speaking in Sydney claimed that he could raise all the money required for the purposes of government some £8,500,000 or £9,000,000 by adopting two rates of duty only, namely, 7£ per cent, and 15 per cent. To my mind, however, if members of the Opposition had their way, we should not receive more than £3,000,000 annually, because apart from stimulants and narcotics, I have never seen them vote in favour of any revenue duties. Indeed, they are not revenue tariffists at all. In reality they are single taxers. How they would raise £8,500,000 by pursuing the course of action which they have hitherto followed is to me inexplicable. I appeal to honorable members opposite to recall their hustings pledges and to remember that they have some share of responsibility.  Mr. G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). There may be something in what the honorable member for Gwydir has said, but if so, both sides of the House are culpable. The Government have placed the Opposition in such a position that its members do not know what course they ought to follow in regard to some of the items. A decision as to the duty to be imposed upon tea has been deferred, and as a result honorable members are in doubt as to what duties should be imposed upon machinery. So far as the duty upon rails is concerned, I should be willing to vote for 10 per cent, or 15 per cent., but I would point out that less than halfanhour ago the Government themselves proposed to admit this particular, article free. So far as the Opposition are concerned, they have all along been under the great responsibility of seeing how revenue is to be obtained, and I believe that in connexion with many of the items, the ultimate effect of the reduction of the duties will be to increase rather than to decrease the revenue. With regard to, this particular item, I cannot see the slightest reason in the world why it should be allowed to pass as free, seeing to use the argument of the other side that these are industries which exist, and that, in the light of the Maitland speech, we were promised revenue, with incidental protection. Though I should be the last in the world to advocate protection, we need revenue, and a certain amount of revenue can be obtained from this item, and a very large amount, if it is ultimately decided to tax State importations. For these reasons, from whatever side of the committee the proposal comes, I am prepared to vote for a duty of 10 per cent, upon this item. Mr. HENRY WILLIS (Robertson).The honorable member for Gwydir made a long speech in which he was good enough to refer to rae as one who had not voted in favour of a revenue Tariff. In that the honorable member was quite wrong, because the right honorable the Treasurer has repeatedly twitted me for having voted for a duty of 20 per cent.","Majority ... ... 4","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[18]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Personally, I have been strongly opposed to revenue duties. I believe with Henry George that we want a Tariff to protect, or we want no Tariff at all. This 15 per cent, proposed on such articles as are mentioned here rails, fish plates, tie plates, switches, points, crossings and intersections is an absurdly small protection, because these industries are in existence and are able to do all we require. I think that it is gross inconsistency on the part of the States, and especially of States which profess to believe in the principle of protection, to ask to have material of this kind brought in free. Look at the gigantic workshops which have been established under the policy of protection in Victoria. When we in Victoria were constructing railways we borrowed the money from home, we got all the raw material, fittings, and rolling stock and other requisites for the making of the railway from home, and all we had to do was to put them down and pay interest. We did not make a bolt, a bar, a rail, a switch, or a point. I say that for a State or country which believes in protection to adopt a policy which gives the foreign trader the advantage in connexion with material which we 1 largely use, and which we can make ourselves, is gross and flagrant inconsistency. In regard to iron working, when we look back to the history of the old country, to the early thirties, we find that there was great railway construction going on, and the iron shipbuilding trade was then in its infancy. Scotland started these works and foundries when there was protection, and took full advantage of it, and during the ten or twenty years preceding the advent of freetrade in the old country the greatest industrial activity existed and the most marvellous progress was made. The old country is now living on the impetus which manufacturing received at that period. Australia is in a far better position now than Scotland was then to establish an extensive iron industry. We have any amount of iron in this country, and we have any number of skilled workmen.

Beyond all doubt I am prepared on every occasion to vote against a revenue Tariff, and I am prepared also to stand up for a protectionist duty. This I maintain is a protectionist duty. It is a very moderate one, but still amply sufficient for the needs of the industry here ; and if we are going to have a protectionist Tariff, it is certainly high time that we made a stand, and stood up for the workmen in these branches of industry. They are in a state even more deplorable than that of the workers in Ireland. The industrial world is in such a condition of unrest the manufacturers not knowing what the Tariff is going to be that many men are refusing to employ their hands, and it is impossible to get men on to these works. It is high time that the manufacturing portion of Australia made it perfectly plain that they mean to stand by those privileges which they have enjoyed hitherto in this State. The workmen can see, and it must be patent to all, that, unless they have some protection against the sweated cheap slave labour of the foreign world, we must cease to manufacture many of the things which hitherto we have been enabled to make for our own people. These articles are much in demand. The day may come when the railways of this continent will be taken over by the Commonwealth Parliament, and I suppose every ardent federalist looks forward to that event. Then we shall be great users of these rails. If we refuse this moderate, reasonable duty of 15 per cent, upon them now, we shall be face to face with the glaring inconsistency of refusing to deal with our own people, even if it were a little cheaper to do so, preferring always the foreign trader. I should like to point out that this proposal for a 15 per cent. duty is somewhat like that which was made under the dragnet policy. We have had today a proposal from an outandout freetrader that all machinery should be placed under one comprehensive duty of 15 per cent., and that there should be no exemptions. I maintain that that duty would be far too high in relation to some articles, and far too low in regard to others. It would be far too high as a revenue duty on any part of machinery which is indispensable to the manufacturing industry, and it would be far too low for those things which we can with great facility I manufacture here. It is high time that wo made a stand for this moderate proposal. It seems to me that the more moderate we become in our proposals to those who stand at the opposite extreme, and demand freetrade on every occasion, the less likely are we to carry those proposals. This j.s an extremely moderate duty. I can understand revenue Tariftists cavilling at some things, but I cannot understand and I am sure .the country will fail to see why revenue Tariftists have cavilled at u moderate duty of 15 per cent, on such things as these which can be made here, and the manufacture of which forms a considerable part of the industries of Australia. I sincerely hope that the proposal will be carried without any diminution, not as a revenue duty, but as a protectionist duty, for such it is, save that it might be higher. Certainly it could not be lower.  Mr. REID (East Sydney). It is quite refreshing to see how thoroughly the honorable member for Southern Melbourne has responded to the slight castigation that he received last week. On this item of iron rails he has vindicated his orthodoxy by a brilliant and rapid review of all the protectionist features of the whole fiscal question during the last 100 years. The honorable member has spoken of the manufacture of iron rails as a great Australian industry. I guarantee that he could not have mentioned one single spot where iron rails are produced if he had not happened to know Mr. Sandfords works at Lithgow. It shows how loosely honorable members talk of great national industries. The honorable member calls upon freetraders to vote for what he himself calls a protective duty. That is rather a cool thing to do. He must not think that we can imitate his example so easily. We are face to face with the extraordinary fact that the only man in Australia who manufactures iron rails, and who has done so for years, has expressed himself as being perfectly satisfied with a 10 per cent., duty. I wish that fact to be impressed upon the minds of the public, as well as on the minds of honorable members.","Majority ... ... 4","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[20]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The speeches which some of them have made tonight remind me of the old times when I was fighting in South Africa, and the cry was  Rally, boys, rally. For the information of Victorians, I should like to point out that rails have been made at the Victorian Iron Rolling Mills and at Formans South Melbourne Mills, in the electorate of the honorable member for Southern Melbourne. Rails are also made in New South Wales at the Eskbank works, where 250 tons were manufactured last year, and at Brown and Browns mills at Pyrmont. I think that some protection should be given to this industry, but I believe with the leader of the Opposition, that a fair thing is enough, and that if the manufacturers are satisfied with a duty of 10 per cent., that is all they should have. If the man to whom the leader of the Opposition referred was a Victorian he would not have been satisfied with 50 per cent. I think that Victorians should put their own house in order before they condemn their neighbours. But I find that under the present Minister, Mr. Trenwith whom I always looked upon as the champion protectionist of Victoria the Victorian Government are getting . their railway supplies, not from Commonwealth manufacturers, but from other parts of the world. They buy in the cheapest market, but the Victorian representatives want us, who have to sell our products in the markets of the world, to spend our money in the Commonwealth, so that they may fleece us.

Honorable members know perfectly well that protectionists generally differentiate between the raw material and the manufactured article. We are dealing here, not with the raw material, but with the manufactured article, and we propose a duty of 15 per cent. In division 6a we are dealing with the raw material, and there we impose a duty of 10 per cent., but on the manufactured articles we propose a 15 per cent, duty. So I venture to put it to honorable members that applying the very principle which generally regulates protectionist proceedings in making the difference, we are only doing that which is absolutely necessary in giving a 5 per cent, difference between the raw material and the manufactured article. What is attempted on the other side is to tax the raw material and the manufactured article at the same rate, which is utterly indefensible. The thing has only to be mentioned, I am sure, to enable honorable members to see the fallacy of it.  Mr. REID (East Sydney). I wish to point out to the Minister for Trade and Customs that he arrives at a fallacious conclusion, by supposing that we are guided by the same principles as he is. From his own point of view it seems an extraordinary thing that there should be a difference of only 5 per cent, between the duty on the raw material, out of which a man here has to make the finished article, and the duty on the imported finished article. Instead of his remarks being at all happy they are most unhappy, because he directs the attention of the committee to this fact, that whilst he proposes a duty of only 15 per cent, on finished rails, he intends to put a duty on the user of the raw material, pig iron. Will any one say that a difference of only 5 per cent, will be enough to help the colonial producer of iron rails against the importer of iron rails ? In this Tariff there are a number of instances where there has been a singular disproportion which has excited a great deal of dissatisfaction, I believe, amongst the manufacturers. There are a number of duties on the raw materials they use, which practically make the duties on the finished article of no good to them, and of no good probably to any one else. Here is a flagrant instance of the same fault, but I understand that the Ministry have withdrawn division 6a for the present.","Majority ... ... 4","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[22]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We cannot do both. We cannot admit the things free for the benefit of all the manufacturing industries, and yet give a protection upon them.

They say  If we could get protection for our own industries, and if nobody who manufactured the things which we require were protected, it would be a good thing for us, but by the time that every one is protected on the material used in producing our article there is nothing left for us. On this side of the committee we all feel that when protection is going to so many people in Australia it is very hard that we should not get some of it for our own people men of industry and enterprise, who have established a number of industrial departures. On the other hand, it is very difficult for us to sacrifice our principles even in view of this state of things, and especially serious does it become when the duty will handicap every conceivable industry, whether manufacturing or producing, in Australia. These articles enter into the construction of an inconceivable number of things that are required in the development . of our own industries and manufactures, and in promoting the comfort of our people in their homes. Consequently, there is a great difficulty in the matter, and I should be very glad if it could be put off for a little while in order to give the Government time to consider what can can be done.  Mr. WATKINS (Newcastle). I have no desire to harass the Government or any honorable member in considering this matter. So far as the complaint is concerned that I failed to give the Government notice of my intention to move this amendment, I can say, like other honorable members, that possibly there are other industries such as this that have not been approached in this matter. It was only when the Tariff came along that these manufacturers found that they had been left out. I do not say that that has been done intentionally, but that is the real position. As to the information that I have supplied, I can only say that I have been informed by men in the business that last year there were from 18,000 to 20,000 tons of this material produced within the Commonwealth. This production was not confined to New South Wales, but portion of it was produced in other States. If I have a clear opportunity to move my amendment later on, I shall be glad to postpone it, but I wish it to be understood that that opportunity will be given to me before the Tariff is passed. I should like the Minister, if he will, to indicate, by a reference to the schedule, the stage at which my proposal can be reconsidered.","Item 76","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[5]/speech[6]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Thus, if we place a duty of 10 or 15 per cent, on pig iron, which from their point of view is raw material, although from the point of view of the manufacturer of it, it is a manufactured article, pig iron will be very much cheaper.

It would be a pity to bring the duty down to 10 per cent., and to have boats carrying nuts and bolts to these States.

When I remember that the Prime Minister at Maitland alleged that so much care, thought, and attention had been bestowed by the Ministers on the Tariff that some of them were seriously ill from overwork, and now observe Ministers varying their proposals as they are doing, I am reminded of a quotation from Phaedrus Gratis anhelans, multa agendo, nihil agens which means that they have, in fact, been  Out of breath to no purpose ; very busy doing nothing.

We have in New South Wales extensive works in which nuts and bolts are manufactured from the raw material, which is locally produced, and the manufacturers ask that they should be allowed to share in the benefits of a protective Tariff. If the committee consider that certain industries should be protected, why should the bolt and nut industry be denied the same advantage 1 I cannot understand the position taken up by some of the leading Victorian protectionists, who contend that a duty should be imposed upon certain goods, and then decline to similarly protect another manufactured article because it forms part of the raw material used in certain protected industries. I have every sympathy with the gentleman who is carrying on the Esk Bank works. I know, from the conversations I have had with his workmen, that he is one of the few employers who believe in giving labour a fair return for its energies. I wish to see the iron industry encouraged as much as possible, because it is a natural one, and with a little assistance at the initial stages it can be placed upon a basis which will enable it to defy the competition of the outside world. Although the founder of the bolt and nut industry in New South Wales has had considerable difficulties to contend with, he will no doubt be prepared to accept the amendment, which is a reasonable one, in view of the duties which we have already agreed to impose. One of the difficulties in considering the amount of protection to be given is that in protecting one industry to a certain extent, other industries are placed at a disadvantage, as was shown in connexion with the manufacture of agricultural implements. It was stated in a circular that while the manufacturer of a complicated piece of agricultural machinery received protection to the extent of something like 15 percent., a quantity of his raw material was protected up to 25 per cent., and he was thus penalized. These bolts and nuts are the manufactured article of the big iron industry at Lithgow, but they are the raw material of a number of other manufactures. That is the great trouble protectionists have in trying to frame a comprehensive policy that in protecting one industry they protect the raw material of another just as important to the community. I should prefer to see the whole of these articles free, because they are the very basis of manufacturing. Industries, in my opinion, ought to be established and encouraged in some other direction, but we have got away from that point ; and I trust the reasonable suggestion which has been made by the honorable and learned member for South Australia, Mr. Glynn, will prove acceptable to the committee.

For a considerable time past the minds of legislators, especially in South Australia, have been very much exercised in endeavouring to determine what are the best methods to adopt for the reclamation of the vast areas of pastoral lands which of late years have gone out of occupation. One of the chief reasons for this abandonment of leases has been the rapid spread of vermin. The rabbits and wild dogs have multiplied to such an extent that hundreds of miles of country which at one time was profitably occupied, thus giving employment to a large number of hands, have become absolutely deserted. Of so much importance do the Government of South Australia consider this matter that they have actually gone to the length of advancing loans to pastoral lessees to enable them to enclose their holdings with verminproof fencing. Those who are familiar with the habits of the wild dog know that he will not jump. Experience has shown that a fence which is from 4 feet to 4ft. 6in. high, which has two barbed wires on top and one at the bottom, and to which is attached 3ft.6in. of wire netting, is one within which pastoralists can keep lambing flocks and obtain good percentages. The advances which have been made in the State which I represent are repayable in twenty annual instalments, and carry interest at the rate of5 per cent. Under the proposal which we are now discussing, the cost of every mile of verminproof fencing erected in South Australia will be enhanced by £3 4s. 6d. Having made a special study of the pastoral question, I have no hesitation in saying that the country to which I refer cannot be successfully occupied unless it is enclosed by verminproof fencing. No State of the Union has done more in this connexion than has South Australia. So much has been done in this respect that at the present time Ayres Peninsula is practically partitioned into 600mile blocks, and it is by this means that the pastoralists are grappling with this terrible pest. The most successful dog proof fences are those in which three barbed wires are used in connexion with wire netting. I find that wire netting, which is a much more complicated thing to make, is on the free list, and wire netting is made in New South Wales, whilst this barbed wire, which is made in Victoria, has a duty of 20 per cent, imposed upon it. I have some particulars, taken from a recent report of the inspector of factories in Victoria, showing that there are engaged in this industry in Melbourne sixteen boys and sixteen men.

If we speak of the wire industry in Victoria, it will be found that there are something like 70 persons employed, but that includes the manufacture of wire nails, rasps, and other articles. I find that in November of this year the price quoted for American imported barbed wire was £16 10s. per ton for No. 12 gauge, and the price of the colonialmade wire was also £16 10s. It may be argued that, because colonialmade wire is quoted at the same price as imported wire, we have no reason to complain, but I desire to show how we are handicapped in the use of the colonial wire. I have here a sample of No. 12 gauge colonial wire, and I ask any honorable member who knows anything about barbed wire to compare it with the sample I have here of No. 12 gauge imported barbed wire. One of the virtues of barbed wire is the number of barbs upon it, and in that respect the colonial wire signally fails, because it has not as many barbs as the imported wire. That, however, is not its worst feature, because a ton of the colonial barbed wire, which is quoted at the same price as the imported article, does not go so far as the imported wire by 1 mile and 29 chains. When it is remembered that we are erecting, and must continue to erect, not hundreds, but thousands of miles of this class of fencing, it will be seen how important this matter really is, and it affects a large part of New South Wales and Queensland, as well as South Australia. The actual distance which a ton of the imported wire will cover is 6 miles 27 chains, and the actual distance which is covered by a ton of the colonial wire is 5 miles 18 chains, showing a difference of 1 mile 29 chains. Taking the next size, No. 14 gauge, honorable members will find that the difference is 1 mile 39 chains in favour of the imported wire. The difference is brought about because of the clumsy wire used in the colonialmade article. Some honorable members will understand what I mean when I say that the wire used is almost as clumsy as No. 8 wire, or No. 6 plain wire, which was used in older times.

A little more than a month ago barbed wire was £17 10s. a ton in Queensland, but the Victorian manufacturers have been sending their wire into Queensland since then with the result that there is already a reduction of 10s. per ton. If the duty is carried, and the manufacturers are assured that it will remain, they will be prepared at once to lay down machinery sufficient to enable them to supply the needs of the Commonwealth. One manufacturer,, of whom I know, Ls prepared to expend £2,000 on coloniallymade machinery as soon as this duty is fixed, and he calculates that this will enable him to manufacture an output sufficient to supply the requirements of at least two of the States. There are at present five manufacturers of barbed wire in Victoria. If they all increase their output in the same way it is clear that in a very short space of time the whole of the Commonwealth can be supplied by local manufacturers. I am inclined to think that the probability is that they will begin the manufacture of barbed wire in each State. One of the Victorian firms to which I have referred contemplates starting in South Australia, at any rate, for the reason that the Government there have by their legislation induced such an enormous consumption of barbed wire that it would probably pay the company better to establish its manufactory in South Australia rather than to send the wire there from Victoria. However, I make the assertion that in all the other States the price of barbed wire today is greater than it is in Victoria, and that the Victorian price is 7s. 6d. per ton lower than the next best price in the Commonwealth. That is due to the fact that the article is made here, and not in the other States, and because the manufacturer comes into competition more closely and more keenly here with the importer than he does in the other States.

This can be proved by reference to price lists issued by firms who deal in this commodity. I wish to follow one or two of the statements made by the honorable member for South Australia, Mr. Poynton. In the first place, I should like to say, in regard to his exhibits of wire, that while I do not wish to doubt his belief, I am very much afraid that he has not been supplied with coloniallymade wire. My own view is that the barbed wire which he has exhibited to us was made in Germany, for the reason that he asserts, that . it does not contain so many barbs to the mile as does the imported article. I am prepared to stake my reputation on the statement that there are exactly the same number of barbs in a mile of colo.niallymade barbed wire as there is in a mile of American wire, which is the next best in this market. Further than that, the honorable member asserts that a ton of wire made in the Commonwealth will not cover the same extent of ground as a ton of American wire. The only answer I have to make to that assertion is that if he can prove that it will not, I will vote with him to put this item on the free list. But I want to make this bargain with him, that, if I can prove that the Victorian wire will go further than the American wire, he will vote with me in placing this article on the 20 per cent. list. I am prepared to prove, by any test the honorable member likes to make, that in fencing the Victorian wire will actually go further than the American wire. Then the honorable member made the astounding assertion that this duty means an impost of £3 4s. 6d. per mile. At the very outside computation the impost will not amount to more than lis. 6d.

How could they do so ? If they believed that it would make the wirenetting cheaper, as he says the duty has made barbed wire cheaper, why is a duty not proposed ? Surely it is not a matter as between State and State I refuse to believe that.. The Ministry did not propose a duty because they recognised that it would lead to an increase in the price, and that it was undesirable to increase the price of an article such as wirenetting used in the back districts of our States, where vermin is causing serious trouble to the pastoralists and even to the agriculturists, and used under those unfavorable conditions against which the settlers have to struggle all the time. They recognised that they ought to deal leniently with those settlers who are struggling under hard conditions, and that for that reason they should not put a duty on wirenetting. It was not overlooked. Why was it specially exempted if it was _ not done for that very good reason ? That being so, why has a very considerable duty, 20 per cent., been placed on barbed wire, used practically under similar conditions t It cannot be justified. If there was a justification for that duty there is an infinitely greater justification for a duty in the case of the more difficult process of wirenetting. I believe it is desirable to leave both articles free to encourage in every way we can that fight with the foes of the agriculturists and the pastoralists, and not try to handicap the settlers in difficult country by imposing duties on either of the articles. I am quite sure that if the Minister will think over the facts which the honorable member for Rourke has laid before the committee, he will not support an industry of this sort, seeing that he has already declined to protect the produce of a much more extensive and difficult industry in another State. In only two States before federation was there a duty levied on barbedwire. In Victoria and Tasmania, in which latter State barbed wire is not made, and is of much less importance to the settlers than it is in some parts of our extensive pastoral territory.

The honorable member for Bourke shows that under a 20 per cent, duty the imported article is being sold at within 7s. 6d. of the price of the Australian production. Does not that show that the price is raised? The Australian production ought to be from £2 10s. to £3 less, but it is only 7s. 6d. less. Where is the difference % It must be an additional price secured to the manufacturer.
