6,0,0,0,1,1,"Templeman, Susan MP",181810,"Macquarie","ALP","N/A",5684," Mr Speaker, each year the House of Representatives receives hundreds of petitions from Australian citizens and residents. If the Petitions Committee finds that a petition meets the requirements as set out in the standing orders, the petition is published on the parliaments website and is presented to the House. Once presented, a petition becomes part of the official record of the House and its terms are included in the Hansard for that day.In addition to this, the Petitions Committee may also refer a petition to the minister responsible for the matters raised, for a written response. Under the standing orders, a minister is expected to provide the response within 90 days.Almost all petitions received by the House are referred to a minister for a written response. However, the Petitions Committee is currently seeking feedback on this approach from petitioners and other interested community members.The introduction of electronic petitioning in 2016 has influenced the volume and nature of petitions received by the House. Given the ease of electronic petitioning, its not surprising that there has been a significant increase in the number of petitions received in recent years. The total number of petitions presented to the House has jumped from 263 in the 44th Parliament, to 799 in the 45th Parliament, to 1,761 in the last Parliament. So far in this parliament 644 petitions have been presented.There has also been an increase in the number of petitions received with a very small number of signatures; and more people are choosing to submit multiple petitions.Mr Speaker, the ministerial referral process is a valuable part of the House petitions system. What we are seeking feedback on is whether petitions with only a small number of signatures should be referred. In our discussions, the committee has considered the benefits of providing ministerial responses to petitioners, as well as the allocation of resources needed to coordinate and prepare a considered written response. We also want to ensure that petitions with a large amount of community support continue to receive responses of substance from the relevant minister, in a timely manner.As part of its review, the committee has looked at procedures in other Westminster parliaments. In the House of Commons in the United Kingdom, petitions with 10,000 or more signatures receive a government response. In the Canadian House of Commons, petitions must receive 500 signatures to be presented in the house and referred to a minister. Some Australian state and territory parliaments also have a signature threshold for the referral of petitions for ministerial response, and others dont.In the spirit of petitioning, the Petitions Committee has decided to ask the Australian people for their views. An electronic survey is currently available on the House of Representatives petitions homepage on the parliaments website. It will be on the website for four weeks and we look forward to hearing from as many people as possible. The results of the survey will inform our approach to referring petitions moving forward and I look forward to updating the House in due course.I thank the House.","Statements","PETITIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) ","(10:01):"

8,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation","HVO","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr NEUMANN: The Set the standard report was the culmination of a comprehensive review, led by former sex discrimination commissioner Ms Kate Jenkins, into Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces.It made 28 recommendations aimed at ensuring the parliament is safe and respectful. Two of its recommendations fell within the remit of the Procedure Committee. The committee undertook to:1. review the practices and procedures of the House, with a view to improving safety, respect and inclusiveness, and,2. examine the Houses sitting pattern and hours, considering the wellbeing and work/life balance of parliamentarians and workers.The committee made six recommendations, based on the evidence received and in the spirit of the Set the standard report.The parliamentary chambers are unique work environments. Freedom of speech and the robust exchange of ideas are core principles of parliamentary democracy. But that doesnt mean that our debates shouldnt be respectful.The use of offensive language and disorderly conduct are already prohibited by the standing orders.However, the committee recognises that specifying discriminatory language as offensive under standing order 89 would strengthen the Speakers ability to rule such language out of order and set more explicit expectations.Accordingly, the committee has recommended amending standing order 89 to specify that offensive language includes words that are sexist, racist, homophobic and otherwise exclusionary or discriminatory.The codes of conduct developed separately by the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Standards, once adopted, will also contain specific prohibitions against bullying, harassment and discrimination in the chamber.Our second recommendation is for an additional option to assist the Speaker to manage disorderly behaviour.Currently, the Speaker can direct a member to leave the chamber for one hour under standing order 94(a). The alternative is to name the member—a much more serious sanction.The committee heard throughout the inquiry that the one-hour withdrawal is not a significant deterrent to poor behaviour. We have therefore recommended changing standing orders so the Speaker can exclude a member for three hours for continued or more serious disorderly conduct.A three-hour penalty would mean a badly behaved member is more likely to miss speaking opportunities and important votes, and should help the Speaker address disorderly conduct swiftly and proportionally in instances where naming is not appropriate or warranted.Our third recommendation is for a review of the training and guidance material available to members on the standing orders relating to language and behaviour in the chamber, and the avenues available for members to draw the Speakers attention to potentially disorderly conduct.Our report acknowledges the need to balance several competing priorities when setting the days and hours of sitting. Australias diverse demography and geography means that some members spend significant time travelling to Canberra and long periods away from their families.Given the improvements made in successive parliaments, the committee has not recommended changes to sitting hours, but we will maintain a watching brief to monitor the careful balance between making the most of members time in Canberra and maintaining wellbeing and safety.The committee agreed that there would be benefits in establishing a House standing committee on gender equality, diversity and inclusion.Such a committee would not only be able to scrutinise potential legislation referred to it and the work of the Public Service from a gender, diversity and inclusion perspective, but would provide an important forum for debate on these matters.Finally, the committee considers that it would be timely for the House to consider making the language in the standing orders gender-neutral during the next major review. This would help bring the standing orders into line with modern drafting practices.On behalf of the committee, Id like to thank everyone who made a submission or met the committee publicly or privately, particularly:Speakers past and presentother parliamentary office holderspresiding officers from state parliamentsMs Kate Jenkins andthe academics and experts who contributed.Set the standard built a case for change across Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces. The recommendations in our report aim to create change in the chamber itself—by strengthening the Speakers powers, clarifying expectations and improving members understanding—and to raise the standard in the House.I commend the report to the House.","Procedure Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"
9,0,0,0,1,1,"Vasta, Ross MP","E0D","Bonner","LNP","N/A",5686," I rise to present my report as Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Procedure. I would firstly like to thank the chair, the honourable member for Blair, for his leadership and guidance of the committee. Ive known the member for member for Blair for over 15 years, and I respect him greatly. I would also like to acknowledge all members of the committee, especially the work of my coalition colleagues, the member for Longman and the member for Flynn. Id also like to acknowledge the professionalism and courtesy of the secretariat. They have done an incredible job of working with all the members, and I would like to thank them personally for their excellent work.The Raising the standard report builds on the work and recommendations from the previous committees report, A window on the House, which is—as you are aware, Speaker—the report that I chaired with you when you were the deputy. The coalition has no issue with the first four recommendations of this report. However, recommendations 5 and 6 are not accepted by the coalition members; therefore, I am presenting a dissenting report.Recommendation 5 is that the House consider establishing a standing committee on gender equality, diversity and inclusion. The coalition rejects this recommendation, especially pertaining to scrutinising the Public Service from a gender, diversity and inclusion perspective. The coalition also does not agree to scrutinise the potential effects of proposed legislation on gender equality, diversity and inclusion, as it is clearly unworkable and would prevent the efficient passage of legislation through the parliament.In addition, the coalition notes that all legislation is prepared in accordance with a statement of compatibility with human rights, which considers, amongst other things, protection and discrimination on the grounds of sex. It is noted that members currently have the opportunity to speak to topics of their choosing on several occasions each sitting week. This includes the adjournment debates, members statements, the grievance debate and private members motions. It is open to members to discuss matters of gender equality, diversity and inclusion if they wish.The coalition rejects recommendation 6, which recommends that, during the next major review of the standing orders, the removal of masculine and feminine pronouns from the standing orders be considered. There is already gender-neutral language that naturally exists in the Australian parliament, as noted in the Set the standard report. The member of an electorate, when given the call, is already gender neutral, as well as the use of Speaker, Deputy Speaker, Chair, Deputy Chair, Minister or even Prime Minister.I wish to reiterate that the coalition has no issue with the first four recommendations of this report; however, we believe that recommendations 5 and 6 would not improve the working order of the parliament, and we believe them to be unnecessary.","Procedure Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VASTA (Bonner) ","(10:10):"

16,0,0,0,1,1,"Chaney, Kate MP",300006,"Curtin","IND","N/A",5686," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.The fairness and transparency of our elections underpins every other issue addressed in this House.We cant trust our politicians to make decisions about gambling harm if they are secretly beholden to gambling providers.We cant trust them to make decisions about climate if they are financed by fossil fuel companies.And if we dont know where their money is coming from, we dont have all the information we need before we decide who to trust with our vote.In commerce we need competition to drive innovation and prevent big companies from using their market power to dominate.In politics we also need competition so if communities dont feel that their values or priorities are shared by their representatives, they can find a different representative.This bill lays out 13 reforms to improve transparency, reduce financial influence and level the playing field. These changes have the broad support of the crossbench, democracy think tanks, civil society organisations and academics, some of whom are here in the chamber today.These reforms build on the work of many other crossbenchers, including the members for Mayo, Clark, Warringah and Indi and the Greens.These reforms are also likely to be supported by the one-third of Australians who didnt cast their primary vote for a major party last year and anyone who thinks transparency and a level playing field are good for democracy.The first five changes relate to the current lack of transparency. Over the last 20 years, only 21 per cent of major parties private funding has been disclosed donations. We need to fix disclosure requirements and ban lies so voters can make an informed choice about their representatives.The bill proposes to lower the disclosure threshold from more than $16,000 to $1,000 and require disclosure within five business days. I ran a completely transparent real-time campaign. Ninety per cent of donors chose to reveal their names on my website. We didnt find out anything about where my opponents funds came from until 10 months after the election and then we were only told about the source of 21 per cent of the Liberal Partys private revenue, for the whole party. We will never know who donated how much to my opponents campaign or where it came from.The bill also proposes changes to broaden the gift definition and improve the so-called Transparency Register. This would mean that $14,000 dinners and $35,000 business roundtable subscriptions could not be hidden. It would also mean we could see exactly how much revenue the Labor Party earns from pokies. Over the last 20 years, 21 per cent of all private funding to the major parties came from undisclosed sources.The bill bans lies in political ads, using the approach proposed by the member for Warringah. The 2016 Mediscare incident and the 2019 death tax incident showed that both major parties are guilty of this and Australians deserve better.The next three changes are aimed at reducing financial influence. Australians worry that politicians make decisions for vested interests, not for all of us. We need to reduce financial influence so we trust governments to make decisions in the best interests of the country.The bill proposes banning donations from companies inflicting social harm. Last year gambling and alcohol companies contributed $2 million to major parties, including $19,000 from Sportsbet to Minister Rowland, who is in charge of regulating gambling, in the week of the election.It also proposes banning donations from current or potential substantial government contractors. The big four accounting firms contributed $4.3 million in donations to major parties in the last 10 years. During this time, the value of their government contracts has increased by at least four times. Three-quarters of OECD countries dont allow these types of donations, and its time Australia joined them.The bill requires member approval for corporate and union donations. Australians are concerned about unions and companies having disproportionate influence in politics. The unions contributed $16 million to the Labor Party last year.Corporate donations are banned completely in half the OECD countries. While this may face constitutional challenges in Australia, requiring member approval is a modest governance requirement that enhances transparency.The remaining five changes are about levelling the playing field. Last year, voters decided they wanted more political choice, with one-third casting their primary vote outside the major parties.Its an uphill battle for community candidates, who face at least 13 party advantages and five incumbency advantages. Equalising some of these advantages would enable healthy political competition.For example, the bill proposes to limit government advertising before elections. The coalition spent $31 million on its positive energy campaign before the last election, trying to convince us we werent the worst OECD country on climate change. This was paid for by taxpayers. This was consistent with at least a doubling in government advertising before every election. Governments should not be able to use taxpayer funds to promote their partys achievements.The bill cleans up the postal voting process. Postal voting is an important part of our election process. But political candidates have been using this to harvest personal data and in many instances cause confusion.The bill removes the political party exemptions from the privacy and spam acts so that political parties have to protect personal data and cant send election day spam text messages.It also proposes setting up an independent campaign entity for independent candidates, to equalise access to voters and reporting dates between independents and parties.It also requires all new candidates to provide 100 signatures from the electorate, whether theyre an independent or in a party.

Public trust is key to proper functioning of democracy, and yet the Australia Talks National Survey found some very distressing data: 56 per cent of us agree with the statement that Australian politicians are often corrupt, and 89 per cent of us are confident that most politicians in Australia will lie if they feel the truth will hurt them politically. That is an indictment on the state of affairs, and it shows a profound disillusionment with politicians and the erosion of trust in government.This bill contains 13 provisions aimed at restoring trust in our democracy through building in protections for integrity. These provisions have broad support from across the crossbench and the political spectrum in our communities. They include provisions to stop the lies in political advertising, which I previously advocated for in this place and which should have been in place to protect the referendum. It has the support of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters interim report tabled earlier this year, and the government needs to get moving on this. Making headlines again today are alleged breaches of confidence and public trust by big four consultancies. This time it is KPMG in the media spotlight for overcharging Defence for work not completed.This bill includes measures aimed at ending the close association between businesses that benefit from public sector contracts and members of the government. The big four have donated some $4.3 million to major parties over the past decade. In the same time, they have seen a 400 per cent increase in the value of their government contracts, and we only know 21 per cent of the source of donations to major parties. So there is such a gap there that we need to absolutely claw. We need to restore trust in our democracy and in government.These important reforms—like increasing transparency around political influence, limiting financial influence and levelling the playing field—are what the Australian people are calling for. If the Prime Minister is listening at all to the outcome of the 2022 election and if the Leader of the Opposition is listening at all to the message that came loud and clear from the Australian people: they want better, they want more transparency and they want more integrity.Debate adjourned.","Electoral Legislation Amendment (Restoring Trust) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STEGGALL (Warringah) ","(10:22):"
20,0,0,0,1,1,"Bell, Angie MP",282981,"Moncrieff","LNP","N/A",5688," I move:That this House:(1) recognises that:(a) the Governments Cheaper Child Care policy has driven up the cost of early childhood education and care for families across Australia since it was implemented on 1 July 2023;(b) families are reporting increases to the cost of their daily fees in excess of $20 per day;(c) the Governments inability to manage the cost of living crisis in Australia is driving up the cost of rent, mortgages, groceries and everyday bills, like early childhood education and care bills, for Australian families;(d) the Governments inaction to address workforce shortages is limiting access to early childhood education and care for families; and(e) families continue to be unable to access early childhood education and care, particularly in regional and rural areas; and(2) calls on the Government to deliver:(a) more access to early childhood education and care places to support Australians to return to the workforce; and(b) real cost of living relief to families.For the past 12 months the Albanese government has been spruiking its cheaper child care policy. They promised that out-of-pocket costs would be lower and fees would not increase. When we asked about lack of access and the overworked and burnt-out educators, they basically shrugged their shoulders and said: Dont worry. Weve got a plan. Well, its a plan that were yet to actually see, and 1 July hit like a ticking time bomb for Australian families. My office has been inundated with emails from families who are further out of pocket now than they were before 1 July. Their fees have increased, eating most or all of their subsidy. Sarah in Jamisontown had her fees increased by $18 a day, and Naomi in Rothwell is now paying $45 more a day for her two children.According to the Parenthood, 90 per cent of families have watched their childcare fees increase in recent weeks. The Prime Minister promised families they would be better off. But what Ive been hearing is that families are struggling to pay their rent, their mortgage, their bills and their early learning fees. Many families were hoping to have extra money to pay for electricity bills, petrol for their car and other expenses. Instead theyve been left under further economic stress. The last time Labor was in government fees skyrocketed by 53 per cent in just six years. Theyve already increased by eight per cent in the past nine months alone. And while Labor says fees will go down, its pretty clear you cant trust a thing that comes out of this Prime Ministers mouth. Labor lied to the Australian people at the last election. Theyve broken promise after promise, and theyll continue to do so to stay in power.In the last month I travelled to South Australia, to Victoria and to Tassie, visiting regional and rural communities, many of whom have no access to any care or are stuck on waiting lists as far as the eye can see. I spoke with highly educated, capable women and men who want to return to the workforce as teachers, nurses, GPs and even small-business owners. But theres no local centre, theres no local family day care, the closest provider is 40 minutes away, and the waiting list already has 50 families on it.Id had high hopes that the government would do something meaningful with the Community Child Care Fund, a program established by the coalition to support regional and rural communities. Yet when the government announced the $19 million grant round earlier this year I scanned the list of eligible communities and was severely disappointed. Many of the communities Ive been to or heard from were not on that list and therefore were not eligible to apply—communities like Tumby Bay, Cummins, Augusta, Charlton, Biggenden, Wilmington, Ardrossan, and the list goes on. Labor spent $4.7 billion on childcare subsidies, and not $1 of that went to increase access. And none of its going to regional, rural or remote communities, who have zero access. Labor have left these communities behind, and its disgraceful.We also warned the government that their policy would put further demand on a sector already under great pressure. Ive spoken to hundreds of educators who are stressed, burning out, unsure how much longer they can stay in their jobs. Theyre working all day on the floor, and then theyve got after-hours staff meetings, professional development and paperwork up to their eyeballs that they need to complete. They dont feel respected or valued, but they should be, because they care for and educate our youngest Australians.When we ask about the plan for workforce, Labor simply rabbit on about their fee-free TAFE and University places. But what they fail to mention is that while Australians may enrol in early learning courses at TAFE at university many of them simply dont complete those courses and enter the sector. Those free places also wont support educators who have already completed their education and have been in the sector for many years. While we want to see more Australians at TAFE and university, theres no real plan to increase the number of educators in the pipeline and help retain them. Its become very clear that the Albanese government has no idea what its doing. They have no plan to increase access, no plan to address rising fees and no plan to fix workforce concerns. With out-of-pocket costs rising yet again under Labor, Australian families deserve to know why they always pay much more under Labor.","Child Care","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms BELL (Moncrieff) ","(10:25):"

25,0,0,0,1,1,"Sitou, Sally MP",298121,"Reid","ALP","N/A",5690," I am grateful to the member for Moncrieff for bringing on this very important debate. Its just a shame that she seems to be the only member on the benches opposite who cares about this issue. We didnt hear a word about child care during the federal election, and we didnt really hear a word about child care during the nine years the previous government was in office.We know that many of the issues the member for Moncrieff spoke about—the rising cost of child care, the workforce shortages and the waiting lists—are issues of real concern, but they are issues that have been around for many years. In fact, under the watch of those opposite, childcare costs increased by 41 per cent. What was their action? What was their plan to reduce the cost of child care? Nothing.We know that in 2021, 73,000 people who wanted to work didnt look for work, because of the prohibitive cost of early childhood education and the impact that had on household budgets. As the member for Moncrieff said, child care was eating into a significant portion of household budgets. People were having to decide between paying for child care and choosing to work extra days, or choosing to work at all. That was a difficult decision they had to make when those opposite were in power.We also know that wages for early childhood educators stagnated. If people are considering a career in a particular industry, one of the main things they will ask is, What are the wages and conditions like in that industry? Under those opposite, wages for early childhood educators flatlined; they stagnated. How do you attract someone to a profession when you do not give them a proper wage increase? Thats what we saw for nine long years under those opposite.With the Albanese Labor government, weve seen a real sense of purpose. In the very first budget, one of the signature pieces was around child care and making it more affordable for families. That goes to the heart of what we are trying to do as a government. We are getting more people in the workforce, particularly women—whilst there have been big gains when it comes to parenting and both parents stepping up, we know that it is often women who are left to bear the burden of caregiving. Were making it more affordable for families to send their kids to child care. This is an important measure that will help children, with all the rich learning that they experience in child care. It is also a good productivity step. Having more people in the workforce is good for our economy and good for productivity.The then Leader of the Opposition knew that at the time. That is why he made child care a signature policy that he campaigned on, and now we have delivered it. This is a significant policy decision of more than $4 billion injected into the early education sector that will benefit 1.2 million families. It is the biggest increase the sector has seen in a number of years, and it will have a tangible benefit for so many families. It means that, yes, they will see relief in their household budgets, but also we know that more kids are able to pick up days at school.I will finish by sharing an anecdote from my own sons experience at child care. He came home and told me that he knew about the solar system because he learnt about it at child care. We went through it together, and then he stopped before he got to Pluto. I reminded him that Pluto is a planet. He said No, Mummy, Pluto is not a planet. And that is what child care does. It teaches kids things that even their parents have failed to learn.","Child Care","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SITOU (Reid) ","(10:30):"

28,0,0,0,1,1,"Chester, Darren MP","IPZ","Gippsland","NATS","N/A",5690," This motion on child care moved by the member for Moncrieff, the shadow minister, is an important one because it recognises that the Albanese governments cheaper child care policy has actually driven up the cost of early childhood education and care for families across Australia since it was implemented in July this year and that families across Australia continue to be unable to access early childhood education and care, particularly in regional and rural areas, which this side of the Houses, obviously, is particularly focused on.In contrast to the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Reid, I note that the previous coalition government actually almost doubled childcare investment, to nearly $11 billion in 2022-23, and locked in ongoing funding for preschools and kindergartens. In fact, we made the biggest reforms of the childcare system in over 40 years. An ACCC report found that the average out-of-pocket cost to households had decreased since 2018, thanks to reforms undertaken by the coalition, which, as I said, were the biggest in 40 years.It goes without saying that raising children is the most important responsibility for adults and parents in our country. The conversation occurring right now across Australia for those with young children—in their lounge rooms and in coffee shops and playgroups—is how does our family manage its budget with the cost-of-living challenges? Tough decision are being made by families every day.We on this side of the House respect the need for choice and flexibility when it comes to the childcare and early childhood education system. We endeavour to have a light touch from government where we make it easier for families and parents and respect the choices they need to make. I fear that, in this place, we have become obsessed with a government sanctioned model of child care to the exclusion of all others, one that doesnt necessarily reflect the reality of life, particularly in rural and regional communities. We have become obsessed with long day child care at the expense of other models which families are seeking to explore to better fit their responsibilities and the way they manage their own family budgets.I challenge those opposite to work with the opposition in this case and work with the shadow minister, who is leading the way in having conversations with families around the country about how different models of child care may suit the modern Australian family. Right now, we have families making the tough choice about whether they can afford to have another child. Thats a very sad decision for a family to have to make if theyre desiring to have another member of their family—to start a family or expand their family. I believe the government has a responsibility to make sure that parents are respected in that decision and given the opportunity to make a decisions which is right for their own family.From my own experience and the countless conversations Ive had in my community, most families have quite a hybrid model approach to the way theyre managing their family budget and the way theyre managing their care arrangements. The hybrid model involves parental care; kinship care, with a lot of grandparents being brought back into the unpaid workforce to assist in that regard; family day care models; and childcare centres. I dont think we should be casting any judgement on any family or any parent that has to make a decision that enables them to properly care for that No. 1 responsibility in their family. There should be no judgement whatsoever if a parent—primarily it tends to be a mother in modern Australian society—decides they want to spend more time at home and be a stay-at-home mum for an extended period. That shouldnt be the subject of judgement from the rest of the community. Its a reasonable choice to make, particularly if they believe they can make a more substantial contribution to their childs upbringing by being home more often. Likewise, a family, or a mother or a father, demanding longer hours in a childcare centre because of their own individual circumstances shouldnt be judged either. Its a reasonable choice to make. We should respect the choices that Australian families have to make. We need to move to a model that respects all those choices and offers greater flexibility for Australian families.In making those comments, I want to acknowledge the work of the shadow minister and the tireless advocacy she has put into her role in terms of meeting with people, particularly in rural and regional communities, where we have childcare deserts families would like to pick up more shifts and to return to the paid workforce but simply dont have the option of formalised child care available to them. I dont want this to be a debate where we just sling arrows back and forth across the chamber. I want this to be a debate where we recognise that Australian families charged with the incredible responsibility of raising children want to see the government work with them, offer them choice and flexibility, but, most importantly, offer those rural and regional members access to centres that are required to address their cost-of-living pressures but also give their children the absolute best opportunities to achieve their full potential in the Australia community. I thank the House.","Child Care","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CHESTER (Gippsland) ","(10:35):"
29,0,0,0,1,1,"Phillips, Fiona MP",147140,"Gilmore","ALP","N/A",5691," Recently we celebrated Early Learning Matters Week. To celebrate our early learning educators and how important early learning is, I accepted an invitation to visit the Jerry Bailey Early Education and Care Service at Shoalhaven Heads. I was greeted by the friendly team of early learning educators and the very inquisitive children at Jerry Baileys childrens service. It was very easy to see the wide variety of educational and fun activities that the children were working on, which they got me to help them with. I particularly liked one of their most recent activities, a game with Indigenous words and pictures they proudly told me was made by a local Aboriginal woman. The children had been artistic before my visit, too, making a giant welcome and Thank you for visiting card, complete with colourful painted childrens handprints and artwork.I asked how the Albanese governments cheaper child care had been received by parents. I was told that it was a very welcome relief indeed. Our cheaper child care is helping provide cost-of-living relief for around 4,800 families in Gilmore. Its also good because we know that the early years of a childs life are a critical window in a childs development. It is about investing in the early years, which will deliver long-term benefits for children, families, and our communities.A few weeks ago, after the Albanese Labor governments cheaper childcare measures began to take effect, I met with local mum Lisa from Gerringong. Lisa told me that our cheaper childcare measures were great for her family. Lisa told me that cheaper child care means she doesnt have to choose between progressing her career as a health professional and being a mum. Thats a huge win. I dont want to see a situation where people must choose between having a family and progressing in their careers. In Lisas case, the Albanese Labor governments cheaper childcare measures are helping her have both. But cheaper child care isnt just good for Lisas family, because Lisa works in health care and she works with children. Cheaper child care allowed Lisa to do another day at work per week. As part of her work, she could then help other families whose children needed her specialised services. Cheaper child care is about letting people make the choices they need and allowing them to do what is best for their family.We know that after a decade of inaction by the Liberal government and their deliberate design strategy to keep wages low, there are many challenges in the early learning sector, including low wages of early learning educators and the dire shortage of early learning places—its a vicious cycle. I was recently contacted by a local mum due to go back to work as a teacher but was unable to secure a childcare place. Sadly, after years of neglect by the former government, this is common, but we are tackling the issues head on. Our cheaper child care is one important part of that, but we are also doing so much more.The work of our early childhood educators is essential to the successful development of our children and our nation. It should be valued on its own merits, free of discriminatory assumptions based on the gender of the people who perform the work. As a result, last year, we passed the secure jobs, better pay bill, which allows for greater access to bargaining for lower paid and feminised sectors through the supported bargaining system, which will help workers negotiate better pay and conditions. We did this because we know that we have to do more to help lift early learning educators pay and close the gender pay gap. Its why we have also implemented fee-free TAFE in industry skills shortage areas, like child care, and funded university places for early education teachers.We also have a comprehensive Productivity Commission inquiry into Australias childhood education and care system to help us chart a course for a universal and affordable early learning system in the great tradition of universal Medicare and universal superannuation. The inquiry will make recommendations to support affordable, accessible, equitable and high-quality early childhood education that reduces barriers to workforce participation and supports childrens learning and development.There is a lot to do to support early learning educators and our early learning centres. We are getting on with the job. We know just how crucial the first five years are for children and their families.","Child Care","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs PHILLIPS (Gilmore) ","(10:41):"
30,0,0,0,1,1,"Boyce, Colin MP",299498,"Flynn","LNP","N/A",5692," I rise to support the member for Moncrieffs motion as families in the Flynn electorate need child care that is available and accessible, as well as affordable. However, in many communities, families cannot find a childcare place for their child, which is preventing parents from returning to work. At the last election, the Prime Minister promised Australian families lower out-of-pocket costs for early childhood education, yet 12 months since the Labor government has come to power, its clear that its cheaper childcare policy will not deliver on that promise. Instead, weve seen fees and out-of-pocket costs increase and no additional places created for families. Early learning providers are increasing their fees—some twice in the last 12 months—and families are watching as their new subsidy is completely eaten up by those new fees. The last time Labor was in government, childcare fees skyrocketed by 53 per cent in just six years. Theyve increased by eight per cent in the last nine months. Labor has no plan to address increasing fees, no plan to increase access, no plans to address current workforce pressures faced by educators and no plans to address thin markets and childcare deserts.The Albanese government said their policy would get thousands of women back into the workforce. The reality is that families are stuck on waiting lists and centres are capping enrolments because they dont have the workforce to cater for the additional families and extra days. Parents who want to return to work or take up extra hours cant because this government didnt do the work to make that happen. There are currently more than nine million Australians living in a childcare desert with little access to early learning education or none at all. Many families are struggling to access a spot for their children, especially those under 18 months and especially in rural and regional Australia.Earlier this year my office conducted research on child care in the Flynn electorate. The research found that there are 36 childcare providers in Flynn offering a maximum of 2,419 places. There are no childcare vacancies in Boyne Island, Gayndah, Mount Morgan, Mundubbera or Wondai. There are also childcare centres in Agnes Water, Emerald and Gladstone that do not have any childcare places either. Since this research, the kindergartens in Mount Morgan and Biloela have announced they will be closing, all because of lack of funding and bureaucratic red tape. Labors plan states that Indigenous children will be able to access 36 hours of subsidised child care a fortnight from July 2023. Woorabinda and Eidsvold, with large First Nations populations, do not have those childcare places available. How can every Indigenous child be given 36 hours per fortnight when there are no places to be had?The Labor government is doing nothing to support families, nothing to increase access for families who need it most and, on top of this, nothing to ease the cost-of-living pressures. Cost-of-living indexes released by the Bureau of Statistics lay bare the rising cost of living under the Albanese government, especially for working Australians. Working households experienced the highest annual rise on record, or 9.6 per cent, based on mortgage rate increases. Mortgage interest expenses blew out by 91.6 per cent—another record. In the last quarter, indexes for all five household types measured by cost-of-living indexes rose by up to 1.5 per cent. Insurance and financial services are the leading component, again driven by mortgage interest rate increases and larger insurance premiums. The data confirms that all Australians have experienced significant—and sometimes record—cost-of-living increases on Labors watch. Families are reporting an increased cost of their daily fees in excess of $20 a day. The cost-of-living crisis in Australia is driving up the cost of rent, mortgages, groceries and everyday bills, like early childhood education and care bills for Australian families. On top of this, the governments inaction to address workforce shortages is limiting access to early childhood education and care for families.The member for Moncrieff is correct. This government must deliver more access to early childhood education and care places to support Australians to return to the workforce, particularly in rural and regional Australia.","Child Care","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BOYCE (Flynn) ","(10:45):"
31,0,0,0,1,1,"Reid, Gordon MP",300126,"Robertson","ALP","N/A",5693," I rise to highlight the work that the Albanese Labor government has undertaken to make child care cheaper, as well as its targeted cost-of-living measures that are being provided to Australians. In my electorate of Robertson on the Central Coast there are many young parents and families benefiting from our governments cheaper childcare policy. From the month of July this year, 6,900 families in Robertson received an increase to their childcare subsidy. What this means is that an average family on a combined income of around $120,000 with one child in care will save around $1,700 in the first year of our policy coming into effect. That is $1,700 kept in the pockets of families living on the Central Coast and right across Australia.Unfortunately, under the former Liberal government, we saw childcare fees rise by 49 per cent with no plan to help Australian families with these rising costs. I am proud to be part of a Labor federal government that continues to waste no time and is getting on with the job of supporting Australian families with cost of living. Across Australia there are now 1.2 million families benefiting from cheaper child care, which means more Australian families accessing affordable early childhood education and care across the country.The Albanese Labor government knows the importance of early childhood education and care and how critical those first five years are for the development of a young mind. Research supports the powerful role that early childhood education and care provides. Our government will continue to work on ways to make child care more accessible and more affordable for more Australian families.I want to take the opportunity to thank all the early childhood educators on the Central Coast and right across this country that provide outstanding education and care. The work that you do is so important, and you have a federal government that is on your side. But there is more work to do, and I am confident in the leadership of the Minister for Education and the Minister for Early Childhood Education who are steering our governments approach towards making early childhood education and care more equitable and more accessible.The Albanese Labor governments targeted cost-of-living relief does not stop at cheaper child care. This government has a suite of targeted cost-of-living measures that are helping Australians across the nation, and an area that I am particularly pleased to see investment in is Medicare. Australians know that it was the Australian Labor Party who built Medicare. Its only the Labor Party who will strengthen it and it is only the Labor Party that will continue to protect it. In the 2023-24 federal budget it was great to see the Treasurer announce an investment of $3.5 billion to triple the bulk-billing incentive. This injection supports patients and general practitioners and will strengthen what is the heart of Medicare, and that is bulk-billing. This is the largest ever increase to the bulk-billing incentive in the history of Medicare. Im pleased to report that this investment will benefit 73,130 people living in the electorate of Robertson on the New South Wales Central Coast, which means more equitable access to a doctor and targeted cost-of-living relief for Australians.On the Central Coast, the Albanese Labor government is progressing with our commitment to deliver two Medicare urgent care clinics, with one to be established in the north in Dobell and one in the south in my electorate of Robertson. Medicare urgent care clinics are game changers. They have been seen to be quite effective in other countries, like Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. They will be bulk-billed, and they will be open seven days a week, with extended operating hours. After nine long years of cuts and nine long years of neglect, the Albanese government is making Medicare stronger for all Australians, providing relief for Australians accessing health care and providing equitable access to general practice.Lastly, another area where our government is easing the cost-of-living is energy bill assistance. In New South Wales 320,000 eligible small businesses will receive a $650 rebate towards their electricity bill, and we will continue to develop measures to ease the cost-of-living for all Australians.","Child Care","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr REID (Robertson) ","(10:50):"

In inner regional Australia we have 332 places per thousand; in outer regional areas we have 295 places per thousand; in remote, 212; and in very remote Australia we have 166 places per thousand children. Eighty-five per cent of my electorate is either outer regional, remote or very remote, and the remaining 15 per cent is inner regional. In none of those areas do we have the kind of levels that people enjoy in the city.The former South Australian Premier, Jay Weatherill, is a Thrive by Five director. He says that poor access to child care in the regions had been accepted as a universal experience and it was unacceptable. The article goes on to say that this would be one of the single biggest things that we cannot afford to have as a universality. It would improve the outcomes for a whole host of industries and people living in regional Australia. In fact, while the number of childcare places across Australia grew by 17 per cent in the past four years, it is primarily in the larger population areas.I am indebted to our shadow minister, the member for Moncrieff. Angie Bell has been in my electorate twice in the last few months. Weve met with over eight communities, all desperate for more child care. Where they have it, they dont have enough; and in the smaller centres, towns with typically less than a couple of thousand people, they dont have any child care at all. Its leading to people recruiting new workers, and then when they roll up they say, I cant stay here, because theres no child care; people not accepting the job; and people leaving communities because they cannot juggle their career and child care.It is of great concern to me that the government has chosen to put $4.7 billion into child care. This is not creating one new place. The privilege of these people who live in underserviced areas is to pay more tax so that other people in overserviced areas or better serviced areas can access a service which they cannot. There is a serious inequity here. I make the point that people would have cheered about the extra money the government is ploughing into child care, only to find now that their childcare centre is raising its rates by virtually as much as the increased subsidy—a $20 a day extra, in some cases, which is soaking up most of it.The member for Reid has just been on his feet and said the coalition government presided over a 49 per cent increase over the nine years we were in government. The problem for the member for Reid is that Ive been here a bit longer than him. I can remember the previous Labor period of government, if he wants to go back and look at history. It was a six-year period where prices went up by 53 per cent, around nine per cent per annum. Its interesting that in the last nine months alone childcare fees in Australia have gone up by eight per cent. There is certainly no control over the price that parents are paying to access this service.For my communities that I am petitioning for, we have a system in South Australia called Rural Care. Its run by the state government through the education department, and they are able to access the subsidy. They are intently opposed to expanding it, but its limited to three staff maximum. So in a town thats got a couple of thousand people, its simply inadequate. Its a good service, though; it works quite well. In my mind, in these populations that are subcommercial, the obvious players to come into that space are the state based education departments. State governments may not want to go down this pathway, but I think its imperative that we reach an agreement with them from the Commonwealth government to say: These are communities that are missing out. We need to reach a mutual agreement.","Child Care","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RAMSEY (Grey—Opposition Whip) ","(10:55):"

It doesnt matter where you go on the New South Wales South Coast; the lack of affordable and social housing is at a crisis point. Every week, I hear from more and more people that are homeless or at risk of being homeless. And it doesnt discriminate. Families are at risk. Older people suddenly find themselves with nowhere to live.We took our $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund plan to the 2022 federal election. Its a plan that will provide 30,000 homes in the first five years. Importantly, it will be set up forever, regardless of who is in government, providing a steady supply of affordable and social homes for those that need them most—older people, families, frontline workers, veterans. Its a plan that has widespread support from industry, community housing and homelessness providers.But what is now blocking the Housing Australia Future Fund and more social and affordable homes? The Liberals and the Greens. Its hard to believe that anyone in the parliament could block affordable and social housing. But were getting on with it. Thats why the Albanese government is delivering immediate action, like the $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator to deliver thousands of new social rental homes across Australia, including $650 million in New South Wales. We have an ambitious housing agenda which will boost the supply of all housing with more social housing, more affordable housing, more homes to rent and more homes to buy.We established the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee three months early, helping regional people purchase a home with as little as a five per cent deposit and avoiding paying lenders mortgage insurance. We have widened the remit of the National Housing Infrastructure Facility, making up to $575 million available to invest immediately in social and affordable rental homes. We are working with the states and territories through the National Housing Accord and National Cabinet to support planning and zoning reforms to contribute to the aspiration of building one million new homes over five years from 2024; as well as investing $350 million in additional federal funding to deliver 10,000 affordable rental homes over five years from 2024 as part of the accord, matched by the states and territories. We have established the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council to provide expert advice to government on housing supply and affordability. We have provided an additional $67.5 million of funding to the states and territories to help tackle homelessness challenges as part of the one-year extension to the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement. The list goes on.Recently I visited two local disability providers, Yumaro at Moruya and Jindelara at Ulladulla, that are crying out to build more independent living for people with a disability. I attended the opening of the Southern Youth and Family Services opening of accommodation for young people at Warilla, which is a fantastic project that looks amazing. But there is already a thirst from Southern Youth and Family Services for a similar facility in the Nowra area. Then there are the many people who contact my office, needing help with somewhere to live—like Lee, from Ulladulla. Lee contacted my office in 2020, saying that she was homeless and had nowhere to go. It was a very sad and, unfortunately, common story. Lee was told that, if she changed her area of preference to another town, she would be more likely to get housing. But Lee had family and connections in Ulladulla. She was born and raised there and, understandably, didnt want to leave. I did all I could to help Lee, and, thankfully, she is now in housing in Ulladulla. But it shouldnt have been that difficult.There is so much demand for affordable and social housing, but who are getting in the way? The Liberals and the Greens—thats who. The Liberals and Greens are now blocking more affordable and social homes, and every day of delay by the Liberals and Greens means $1.3 million is not being spent on social and affordable housing for people who need it most. So I say to the Liberals and Greens: get out of the way and back this secure, ongoing pipeline of funding for social and affordable housing. Well keep delivering to ensure that more people have a safe and affordable place to call home.","Housing","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs PHILLIPS (Gilmore) ","(11:01):"

But I digress. The social and housing situation, in terms of affordability and availability, is a major issue, but the Greens are using what is essentially and primarily a state issue to garner votes in inner-city electorates to win federal seats. I know the Prime Minister has called this out and, to that extent, I agree with him. These days, all too often, the difference between state and federal spheres of government is diluted by people who should know better and who do know better but who use situations and policy areas, such as housing, to get votes. They know it is a state issue, yet they push on with federal seats in mind, and mores the pity.We do need more houses available for people who are doing it tough. Theyre doing it tough for a number of reasons. Its not only because weve got a Labor government in power and cost-of-living issues are going through the roof, and people are finding it so difficult to pay their power bills, their grocery bills and their rents, which are going up and up. But its not the federal governments prerogative, responsibility or remit to put freezes in place on rents or to put situations in place whereby people who are quite rightly, honestly and accountably putting in place such things as negative gearing, which has been in place since the Hawke government. These are things which enable people to get into the housing market. These are things which enable people, quite rightly, to make the most of their own finances. What the Greens would do, if they had control, would be to have this parliament run everything, and thats not how it works. The states cant be let off the hook.I note that the Premier of New South Wales is in Wagga Wagga today on his first visit since he took charge of the state. I note that he has indicated, via Twitter, that hes having a bit of a crack at the fact: I might be in Wagga Wagga right now, but that wont stop me cheering on the mighty Matildas—lets bring this home! I dont know why he feels he needs to have a whack at Wagga Wagga, which is the largest inland city New South Wales. Its a very progressive and very forward-thinking city, and hes making out that hes in some remote backwater. I note that yesterday he visited Gavin Kings Prefabulous in Wagga and talked about that as part of a solution to the housing crisis. To that extent, I agree with him; theyre doing a very, very good job.Its not just about making funds available; its also about having the resources and the workforce in place to build these social houses and housing in general. I note that Metricon last year was doing it very tough. Queensland firm Solido Builders, a small company specialising in luxury houses, appointed administrators last year. Perth based Home Innovation builders went into liquidation on the same day as another Western Australian company, New Sensation Homes, was placed in the hands of administrators. Condev Construction in Queensland specialised in multiunit residential constructions. It went into liquidation. ProBuild, a major construction company, was placed in administration. Other homebuilding companies going belly up included two Tasmanian based firms, Hotondo in February last year and Inside Out Construction in November 2021. Theyre doing it tough. Dennis Family Homes, Melbourne based, is scaling back its regional operations.Whats this government doing about this? Very little, making it so tough, not addressing the major issues. You all go around, Labor members, and talk at your constituents instead of listening to them, talking about the things that quite frankly theyre not discussing around the barbecues, around the sporting fields and around the weekend events. Start to get a little bit in touch with the electorate. Yes, we do need more social houses. What are you doing about it, apart from reading from your Labor dirt and talking points?","Housing","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr McCORMACK (Riverina) ","(11:06):"
37,0,0,0,1,1,"Miller-Frost, Louise MP",296272,"Boothby","ALP","N/A",5696," The Albanese government has a broad agenda for safe and affordable housing. Its focused on providing security and dignity for all Australians, and Im proud to be part of a government that knows a secure home will give more Australians the foundation for a better future. Our comprehensive strategy will create thousands of social and affordable homes across Australia. The housing sector is a complex one, so one strategy is not enough. The Minister for Housing is implementing a raft of strategies to address the housing and homelessness issues across the spectrum. Our strategy aims to increase housing supply sooner but also to provide a pipeline of secure funding for housing developments into the future, because this is an ongoing problem.We know that homelessness numbers jumped between the 2016 and 2021 censuses. We also know housing, both rental and for purchase, is increasingly unaffordable for many Australians, so the responses need to be urgent. But they also need to be effective and evidence based. Ultimately the one thing that ends homelessness is housing. What ends the rental rises is more rental supply—basic demand-supply economics. The Albanese government has a plan that incorporates a number of strategies to address housing and homelessness across the spectrum: more houses, more homes. We recently announced an additional $2 billion in funding, bringing the Albanese governments investment in housing and homelessness to more than $9.5 billion in this financial year. This additional $2 billion needs to be spent or committed by the states and territories within two years and result in a net gain in social housing properties. This is real dollars, driving real change, building more homes.But thats not all. This commitment builds on the actions weve already taken immediately to address Australias serious housing shortages: $575 million in funding unlocked in the National Housing Infrastructure Facility and a widening of its remit, with houses already under construction across the country; and the Housing Accord we announced in last years budget, which includes federal funding to deliver 10,000 affordable homes over five years from 2024. The Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee is already helping thousands of Australians into homeownership. Were delivering new action to help Australian renters, expand opportunities for homeownership and bolster frontline homelessness services. Were delivering a $67.5 million boost to homelessness to states and territories over the next year, and this funding will assist frontline homelessness services across the country through the $1.7 billion National Housing and Homelessness Agreement currently being renegotiated.In my career working in the homelessness sector I saw firsthand the inaction by the former Liberal-National government. Their inaction has left Australians with significant challenges across the country. I recently went back to Catherine House, an organisation I led prior to coming to this place, and saw their plans to rebuild and expand. Catherine House, in Adelaide, is a womens homelessness service that provides crisis accommodation and support services for women experiencing homelessness across South Australia. They have plans to expand their homelessness service so they accommodate women currently, right now, sleeping rough on the streets of Adelaide, homeless in the middle of this cold, cold winter. Their plans for Catherine House will directly result in expanded crisis accommodation but also in social housing. I saw their plans, which are ready to go—shovel-ready. All they need is the Housing Australia Future Fund legislation. They need certainty of funding.And thats not just for this development. Social and community housing providers need to be able to plan for the future, for developments next year and the year after, and that is what the Housing Australia Future Fund does. So Im appealing to the Liberals and the Greens to stop their posturing and do what is right for the Australian people. The HAFF is backed by homelessness services, community housing providers, Shelter Australia, the building industry, developers—the people who actually know how the sector works and what works for homelessness. What makes a difference for homelessness is social housing. When I talk to the sector, they tell me that what they need is certainty of funding going into the future. They are ready to go, shovel-ready; they are waiting for the Housing Australia Future Fund; and they are watching us—watching what happens here in this place and watching those opposite block solutions. So again I say to those opposite: stop standing in the way of more housing.","Housing","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MILLER-FROST (Boothby) ","(11:11):"
38,0,0,0,1,1,"Haines, Helen MP",282335,"Indi","IND","N/A",5697," I thank the member for Higgins for this motion. But, while members of the government like to list the ways in which theyre addressing the housing crisis across Australia, I want to draw attention to what is largely missing from this debate: housing for regional, rural and remote Australians. The member for Higginss only mention of regional Australia was the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee, but the member failed to mention what the take-up of the guarantees 10,000 places actually is. People in the electorate of Indi dont talk to me about this guarantee, and I wonder if one of the reasons is that there simply arent many homes to purchase.Ive said it before and Ill say it again: in rural and regional Australia we were told, Build it and they will come. Well, theyve come and we havent built it. Regional Australia grew by 70,000 people in the first year of the pandemic. The combination of increased regional migration, rising rental prices, a decline in affordable housing supply and a rise in living costs is having devastating effects. According to the national campaign Everybodys Home, 61.4 per cent of mortgage holders in my electorate of Indi are experiencing mortgage stress. On top of that, 40.6 per cent of renters in Indi are experiencing rental stress. Homelessness rates are deeply concerning. According to the 2021 census, homelessness in our region has increased by 19 per cent since the 2016 census. This housing crisis is happening not just in the cities but in the country areas too, and the government must not forget this.Im the first to acknowledge that there is no silver bullet to this problem, but Ive been consulting widely on what solutions there could be, and what Ive heard is that we need funding for critical enabling infrastructure. Im talking about poles and pavement, drainage, sewerage. Its not sexy, theres no ribbon to cut, but to build homes in rural and regional Australia we need this kind of infrastructure. Regional areas struggle to attract developer investment to build this infrastructure, and, with big geography and a small ratepayer base, local councils dont have the money to build it on their own.In Wangaratta theres a perfect example of this challenge. The local council have earmarked a former technical school site to deliver social and affordable and key worker housing in a specialised precinct—to deliver the vision of 200 safe, quality, energy-efficient and beautiful houses for young people, pensioners and essential workers. But they need funding to clear the site, including asbestos removal. They also need to build water and sewerage infrastructure. They then can get going with the building.Thats why Ive put forward a proposal for government to set up a dedicated regional housing infrastructure fund. This fund would unlock investment in new houses by building the basic infrastructure needed for new multitype developments—private housing, built-to-rent social housing and essential worker housing. It would have the flexibility to fund social infrastructure and provide local government assistance to fast planning approvals.Ive also called on the government to ensure their proposed Housing Australia Future Fund, the HAFF, delivers for regional, rural and remote Australians. I successfully secured amendments to ensure the Housing Supply and Affordability Council could have a regional focus when undertaking its work. So much more could be done to improve this bill for regional Australia, and, with negotiations on foot, we have the chance to do that. I introduced further amendments that would ensure an object of the HAFF is to deliver funding in regional, rural and remote Australia, including funding for the critical enabling infrastructure that Ive described.I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take up these amendments. Rural Australia makes up 30 per cent of our population, provides 90 per cent of the food we eat and brings in 50 per cent of Australias tourism income. Rural Councils Victoria estimates that, if we dont build the extra homes we need, we could lose up to $1 billion in gross regional product over the next 15 years. Thats a call to action if ever I heard one. I know the government is focused on delivering bricks and mortar housing, but funding for the roads, footpaths and streetlights is a key part of this discussion. Its a key part of the solution for regional Australia.I call on the government, the Minister for Housing and the Prime Minister: help us on this fundamental piece of work that needs to be done in order to unlock housing in rural, regional and remote Australia.","Housing","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr HAINES (Indi) ","(11:16):"
39,0,0,0,1,1,"Burnell, Matt MP",300129,"Spence","ALP","N/A",5698," I rise to speak in favour of the motion moved by the member for Higgins. It is especially poignant to be moving a motion on social housing now that it is National Homelessness Week. There are a number of events being held within this place over the course of the week, and Id encourage members to attend if they are able to. This is not to say that I think anyone is in an ivory tower, but, for all of us, it would be worth our time to learn a bit more about the what, why and how. It would give members a wake-up call as to why funding social housing is something that we need to start doing yesterday.Most of us can see the overt signs of homelessness and unstable housing situations within the borders of our electorates. We know that homelessness isnt just those sleeping rough; its people without a truly fixed address—those who couch surf, even though to those who dont have a stable housing situation due to short-term periodic leases. Whether visible or not, the effects are felt. It affects someones ability to keep a job, to send their kids to school on time every day, to find a job and to participate in society.In my state of South Australia, we have a long and proud history of providing social housing, with the South Australian Housing Trust having been created in 1936. It was the nations first state housing authority, created during the time of a Liberal government in South Australia. Over the long course of history, social housing hasnt been a partisan issue, though—over the course of our history—the extent of its importance has been. Having more stocks of social housing and affordable housing should be an aim of any government, but we know that growth in social and affordable housing certainly stalled over the previous nine years.I dont want to necessarily put the causation before the correlation—I doubt we would see any degree of remorse from those opposite when the numbers were put to them, in any case. However, last week we saw the member for Deakin, in his contribution to this debate, ride out of the gates to attack Daniel Andrews. Premier Daniel Andrews may be a mortal, but he is someone who, in the heads of the members of the Victorian Liberal Party, appears to live rent free, even during a rental crisis. I suppose there is room for that now, given the vacancy in their heads now the Greens are again frenemies with the Liberal Party and the National Party. Blocking the Housing Australia Future Fund legislation in the other place with new friends—new old friends—Id like to hope they arent blocking the legislation for the same reason, but it does make for a very confused coalition of ideals. One side cares about the issue; the other, displayed over nine years in government, could not care less about social and affordable housing. I remember a time when a Liberal MP could say the words Labor-Greens coalition three times, turn around and expect to see that they had summoned a pair of Birkenstocks; now the footwear of their partnership will more closely resemble boat shoes, I suppose. Whatever the footwear in question, itll be what they are wearing whilst they run away from their responsibility to the Australian people by blocking much-needed funds into social and affordable housing.Putting a fund in place that provides funds for social housing is important, given we cannot always rely on the better angels of future governments. This is clearly evidenced by the previous government and its lack of care in funding social housing. It had a missed opportunity with HomeBuilder and instead ignored social housing completely. A fund, much like our Future Fund, lasts the test of time and helps to fund unfunded public sector superannuation liabilities. Sovereign funds are not some alien concept. I know the Greens would portray this as playing the market, imagining the Prime Minister in front of his laptop in the wee hours of the morning exclaiming that some kind of digital coin is going to the moon—ludicrous.We know that, by having a fund which generates a baseline funding level for social housing, no matter the party in government, those funds are earmarked for this purpose so we can avoid what we have seen under nine years of Liberal-National government. We can futureproof social housing against the whims of a future Liberal-National government or Liberal-Green government—who knows. There is always going to be a mechanism allowing for a steady level of investment in social housing, and this can only be a good thing. Every penny beyond that will depend on the economic climate at the time and—as history would suggest—whether there is a Labor government in power at the time. I thank the House.","Housing","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BURNELL (Spence) ","(11:21):"
40,0,0,0,1,1,"Tink, Kylea MP",300124,"North Sydney","IND","N/A",5699," In rising to speak to the motion moved by the member for Higgins on the critically important topic of the nations housing policy, I want to offer the observation that Higgins and North Sydney have a lot in common. Like North Sydney, in 2022 Higgins voters felt that the then government wasnt listening to them and in turn they voted to see politics done differently. What this should mean is genuine, transparent and non-politically motivated debate on how to get better outcomes for communities, but, sadly, this has not been the case. In an area as complex as housing, we all need to admit that we wont find perfect solutions overnight, but this should not stop us from being ambitious and having the debate.In North Sydney many are facing extreme frustrations in finding an affordable and suitable home to rent or buy. The reality is property prices and lack of availability mean that most people who work in the electorate dont actually live there. Most notably, essential workers, including those in the health and aged-care sectors and teaching sectors, are literally having to travel sometimes up to an hour just to get to work. As a result, not surprisingly, many are taking roles in other communities.Housing has become a fundamental issue of equity between homeowners and renters, between workers and residents and across generations. As Ive previously stated in this place, the Housing Affordability Future Fund is a step in the right direction but its a very small and very unambitious step. Revitalising our public and affordable housing stock is critically important and we need to commit more public and private sector funding towards the challenge over the longer term, but thats just one piece of the puzzle. Other parts of the puzzle include rental property quality and security. In a recent survey we conducted on the rental experience, one of my constituents said:Our rental has no heating or cooling, it is damp and we had a mould problem for months. We are often feeling unwell due to the cold. But we cant move because it is too hard to find rentals.Another constituent told me:We are afraid to bother our landlord with simple repair tasks, such as faulty storage, for fear of reprisal.This government has proclaimed that it is working with the states housing ministers to help develop more aligned rental laws that address tenancy rights. However, there is little transparency over this process. Consequently the people of North Sydney remain in the dark about whether those discussions will result in tangible improvements to peoples current living situations. I receive complaints from people regularly about substandard rental quality. In this context I ask the government to let the people of North Sydney know how much of this new funding, whether it be via the HAFF or via the housing accelerator fund, will go towards basic maintenance of our existing social housing stock. In the end, efficiency can be just as important as availability and affordability, as we seek to build true equity.There are 51,000 people on the waiting list for social housing in New South Wales. I am yet to develop any true assurance that this governments policies are going to make a meaningful dent in that number. Building more homes wont be easy. The level of building approvals for new homes is now lower than it has been in 10 years, and home building costs are the highest. We dont have enough skilled tradespeople to meet demand. We must provide the right training to address these shortages and ensure our immigration system brings the workers that we need into our country. These issues are systemic and go beyond the current housing crisis debate.For these reasons, housing policy experts have been calling for strategic long-term planning for housing for many years. But this complex ecosystem is full of vested interests. Every time we look at more ambitious changes—be they reviewing tax settings, better aligning transport and service infrastructure planning or raising expectations on developers to guarantee affordable housing—vested interests swoop in and throw their weight around, often leading to a poorer outcome for our community.With all of this said, I do support the HAFF Bill and getting the Housing Supply and Affordability Council up and running so that they can look at a range of out-of-the-box solutions and help break the current gridlock. I do not underestimate the size of the challenge ahead. We need to have an honest discussion not dominated by political posturing. Housing policy should be about a safe and adequate home for all, not a political football.","Housing","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TINK (North Sydney) ","(11:26):"

I want to address a couple of issues mentioned by the member for North Sydney. Yes, it is complex but its also simple. When you build more houses, you increase supply. When you increase supply, you bring down the pressure on prices and rents. You also increase the capacity for the quality issues that you mentioned, Member for North Sydney. When youve got more choice in the market, tenants suddenly have more power in the market. Tenants can say to landlords, Unless you fix the lighting and the damp, Im moving down the road to the other rental that has become available. You can only increase choice by increasing supply, and thats what will be before the Senate: a fund to increase supply by 30,000 new homes in the next five years. It is a fund that will fund housing forever, a perpetual fund. Ten billion dollars is the biggest single housing investment proposed by any government in more than 10 years. Ten billion dollars is nothing to sneeze at. Thats in addition to all the other things the governments doing through record rent relief and the help-to-buy and help-to-rent schemes, including across regional Australia.I note that in her contribution the member for Indi called for an expansion of the HAFF, and I think she has foreshadowed some amendments to the bill. To be honest, Im a bit concerned by what she said—although I think she has good intentions—about expanding the remit of the HAFF to include support for infrastructure like drainage and sewerage.

It is increasingly coming to our orbit, and we are determined to tackle it head-on.In the past few months Ive spoken to working families, older women, single parents, grandparents caring for grandchildren, students, and women and children escaping domestic violence. All have stories of spending years on public housing waiting lists—some on emergency housing waiting lists—and making do in the meantime by sleeping rough or relying on friends or family for a roof over their heads. The answer is to increase supply, to build more houses.My office staff and I do all that we can to assist each and every one of the people who come to ask for help, but the stark reality is that there are just not enough houses to house people. Weve got 4½ thousand people on the housing waiting list in Tasmania alone. The member for North Sydney says there are 51,000 people in New South Wales. We can argue till were blue in the face about the reasons we got here. I can tell you its about decades of underinvestment by successive state governments across the nation. But the federal government are not willing to sit idly by. We have a plan of action backed by a $10 billion fund. Its a plan of action we took to the election.I simply cannot fathom how members opposite, particularly the Greens members on the crossbench and the Greens members of the Senate, are blocking the bill. They blocked the last bill. Weve reintroduced it. We want it to go through. Tasmanian Greens senators Nick McKim and Peter Whish-Wilson need to look homeless Tasmanians in the eye in Homelessness Week and explain why they have been blocking the building of 30,000 homes over the next five years, 6,000 of them to be built in Tasmania, that will put roofs over heads. They say they want cheaper rents. You get cheaper rates by increasing supply. Tasmanian Liberal senators Jonathon Duniam, Wendy Askew, Claire Chandler and Richard Colbeck need to explain why they were happy for billions of dollars to be rorted under their government but they arent prepared to support billions being invested for vulnerable Australians.There is a very real human cost to the political parlour games being played by the Greens and the Liberals. Its a cost borne by people who have no roof over their head or who are stuck in a violent home because there is nowhere else to go. This week politicians of all stripes will be going out for Homelessness Week and sleeping rough. That doesnt build houses. Its a nice symbolic gesture. We dont need symbolic gestures. We need the Housing Australia Future Fund passed by the Senate.","Housing","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

46,0,0,0,1,1,"Ryan, Monique MP",297660,"Kooyong","IND","N/A",5700," I move:That this House:(1) acknowledges that lobbying can result in the development of policies that favour the interests of private corporations over the interests of the Australian public;(2) notes that there is a lack of transparency over the relationship between lobbyists and Ministerial offices;(3) recognises that breaches of the Lobbying Code of Conduct are rarely identified by the Attorney-Generals Department and that there are currently no serious penalties for breaching the Lobbying Code of Conduct; and(4) commits to:(a) extending the Register of Lobbyists to include registered professional lobbyists acting on behalf of third parties, services firms and lobbyists acting on behalf of businesses and industry bodies;(b) extending the cooling-off period for former MPs and senior government officials to three years in keeping with international best practice;(c) introducing new penalties for breaching the Lobbying Code of Conduct, such as suspending lobbyists from operating for up to two years; and(d) ensuring the National Anti-Corruption Commission has the ability to investigate alleged breaches of the Lobbying Code of Conduct and enforce penalties.The corridors of this House are roamed by lobbyists given free rein to talk to whichever politicians they please. Too often they are close and old friends of some of our ministers and staffers, hired because of their personal connections, and useful to corporate interests because they open doors that 99.9 per cent of Australians will never have access to. This is a broken system. The most powerful people in our country spend vastly more time speaking to employees of lobbying firms than they do to people on JobSeeker, to tradies, to students, to small-business people or to refugees. Lobbying firms and powerful corporations are experts at political persuasion. Theyve figured out how to turn politicians personal relationships into profit, and the loser is the Australian people.Public servants and elected representatives must act with integrity, transparency and honesty. In recent decades in Australia weve seen access and influence skew increasingly to the interests of businesses and powerful individuals. Lobbying aims to influence government decisions, such as policymaking, legislation, procurement and grants. Over the past 30 years commercial lobbying in Australia has grown into a lucrative multibillion-dollar-a-year industry. Its hard to think that industry and those private interests dont expect a return on their massive investment.At a federal level, a Lobbying Code of Conduct applies only to professional or third-party lobbyists placed on a register of lobbyists operating under an administrative code of conduct. That code of conduct is inadequate. In-house lobbyists are not subject to the code of conduct and theyre not included on the lobbyists registry. Almost 1,800 in-house lobbyists currently hold orange passes, which give them unrestricted access to secure areas of Parliament House. We dont know who they are. We dont know who gave them access. Only one in four of our lobbyists is actually on our Register of Lobbyists. We dont know who our government representatives are meeting with and we dont know why. Responsibility for monitoring lobbyists activities in Parliament House lies with the Attorney-Generals Department, but this is a toothless system. The penalty for any breach of the code is deregistration from the register, but no fine—a punishment approximately as severe as being whacked about the face with a tissue.Ministerial and staffer diaries are an invaluable accountability mechanism. They help the public know who has access to our ministers, and they help them to know those issues that are of interest to those who do have access to the ministers. We should know about the timing, the frequency and the nature of representations made to ministers and senior staffers by lobbyists. Ministerial and staffer salaries are paid by public funds. It is difficult to conceive of any rational basis for refusing publication of those diaries.Another integrity concern is former politicians, senior political staff and high-ranking government officials leaving office then taking on related roles in the private sector and lobbying on behalf of their new employees—the so-called revolving door. One in four former ministers takes on a role with a special interest group after leaving politics, and nearly 40 per cent of our registered federal lobbyists worked for the government in some role before they became lobbyists—how cosy.Lobbying is a legitimate part of the democratic process, but it must be carried out ethically and transparently. Our ministerial standards and the Lobbying Code of Conduct are sketchy, limited and unenforceable. The regime imposes weak rules with no independent oversight and no real punishments for infringement. These rules do not ensure integrity or transparency. It is no wonder that the public has such little faith in the integrity of what goes on in this place and that it fears that influence can be bought in this country.Our electoral act should be amended to legislate a lobbying regime, replacing and expanding upon the current toothless Lobbying Code of Conduct. Administrative responsibility for that code should be placed with the Attorney-Generals Department, and the Anti-Corruption Commission should have the ability to investigate breaches of that code. We need more transparency over ministers diaries. We have to enforce revolving door bans. The people of Australia deserve to have faith in the integrity of their government.","Lobbyists","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr RYAN (Kooyong) ","(11:36):"

51,0,0,0,1,1,"Lim, Sam MP",300130,"Tangney","ALP","N/A",5701," When I decided to run for parliament, to represent the people of Tangney, I was seriously concerned, because I believed that our country faced a challenge. This challenge was one that affected all areas of government. Im talking about the lack of transparency that the Albanese Labor government is bringing to an end.To mention a few examples: I remember a high-ranking official of the Liberal Party involved in shady deals with their former partners. I also remember car park rorts, with the announcement of $121 million later inflated to $300 million, just to benefit political friends. I remember sports rorts that handed out money to applicants that were not the ones that deserved it the most, according to the Australian National Audit Office. But this should not come to us as a surprise. How can we expect transparency from the people led by a super minister—a man that appointed himself as minister of everything?We should consider ourselves privileged. Our constituents deposited in us their faith and their hopes. They expect us to lead this country with integrity, and we cannot betray their trust. I believe in justice, and I believe that those who act against the public interest eventually are exposed. I believe that selfishly putting your own interests above those of our nation comes at a great cost. I would not want to be in their position and have to go to bed with a heavy conscience.But this government can be proud of being different. In the first year of this government, the National Anti-Corruption Commission was created—an independent body with the authority to investigate any case suspected of corruption. I had the honour to work on this legislation, side by side with many talented, wise colleagues. But even though we have made progress, we still know that corruption is not limited just to public officials. Many will try to take advantage of their personal relationships, their position of influence and their economic power, but we have rules in place to prevent private interests interfering with the development of public policies.It was a Labor government that established the Lobbying Code of Conduct. This way, government representatives can always be aware of whose interests lobbyists represent. Any person who expects to lobby the government on behalf of a third party must be registered and compliant with the integrity and transparency framework set out in the code.Our Attorney-Generals Department does a good job enforcing this code, including investigating alleged or potential breaches. Under the code, a lobbyist that has committed a serious breach can be barred. Furthermore, if they fail to comply with their obligations they might be removed from the register. The court has been updated recently, with the last time being 2022. Those modifications aim to strengthen the compliance and enforcement options available to the secretary of the department, introduce continuous disclosure requirements and improve transparency where former ministers, advisers and officials are engaged in lobbying activities. Lobbying is not the main concern of the National Anti-Corruption Commission, but, where breaches to the code could consist of systematic corruption, the commission would have jurisdiction to investigate. With the work our Attorney-Generals Department does and the National Anti-Corruption Commission in place, we have a solid defence against corrupt interests. That way we can guarantee that the work we do here is for the benefit of all Australians.","Lobbyists","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LIM (Tangney) ","(11:41):"
52,0,0,0,1,1,"Chaney, Kate MP",300006,"Curtin","IND","N/A",5702," Im pleased to rise in support of this important private members motion, particularly so soon after introducing my private members bill on restoring trust in federal elections this morning. Both this motion and my earlier bill are consistent with the role of the expanded crossbench in this parliament, pushing for better transparency, greater integrity and more accountability in politics.The opaque role of lobbyists and the effect on policy are real concerns for a healthy democracy. When conducted in an open and transparent manner, lobbying can make a positive contribution to the development of public policy by ensuring that government understands the consequences of laws. But access is uneven. Not all voices have the money to pay for a lobbyist. Activities that are not transparent can have a negative effect on policymaking and public confidence in government. At the moment, some unregistered in-house lobbyists can wander the halls of parliament and walk unannounced into the offices of everyone, from ministers to backbenchers to crossbenchers, at any time, vastly increasing their ability to exert influence. As the Grattan Institute has observed, policymaking can be distorted if some interests are consistently heard while others are not. The Hon. Anthony Wheely KC, Chair of the Centre for Public Integrity, says it succinctly:Lobbying has become a large unregulated industry. The revolving door sees MPs and Ministers using their connections to further private interests.Third-party lobbying is currently governed by a code of conduct, with lobbyists listed on the lobbyist register and overseen by the Attorney-Generals Department. Under the current system, only third-party lobbyists are required to register. If youre employed directly by a company to influence government and policy rather than through a third party, youre not covered by any regulation. If you can get a parliamentarian to authorise a sponsored APH access card, you can walk the halls of parliament freely. As at 15 February this year there were 1,791 people holding a current sponsored APH access card, with 891 of those passes being issued in the current parliament. Many of these are family members of parliamentarians, but this also includes an unknown number of passes issued by parliamentarians to in-house lobbyists. These in-house lobbyists are able to conduct invisible lobbying activity without any regulation or oversight. The Australian Professional Government Relations Association has its own code of conduct to support transparent, accountable and ethical practice, but not all lobbyists are members.I strongly believe that we need greater governance over lobbyists. The UK and Canadian parliaments and the US Congress have legislated lobbying regimes rather than an administrative code of conduct. The law in those jurisdictions includes arrangements to allow scrutiny of passes granted by parliamentarians. Australia must follow this precedent, particularly in light of the fact that one anonymous parliamentarian in the 47th Parliament has already signed off on 55 sponsored access passes. We have the right to know who is accessing our ministers and our executive.Reform should also include extending the cooling-off period for former MPs and senior government officials to three years, in keeping with international best practice, rather than the 12 or 18 months we have here in Australia. It should include a penalty for breach of lobbying rules and regulations. Lobbying misconduct should be punished by denying access to government, including for more minor breaches involving a failure to report on their lobbying activities. I urge the government to consider these reforms to ensure that policy decisions are not unduly influenced by the loud voices of the powerful minority rather than the interests of the Australian public.","Lobbyists","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CHANEY (Curtin) ","(11:46):"
53,0,0,0,1,1,"Smith, David MP",276714,"Bean","ALP","N/A",5703," I also rise today to speak on the motion moved by the member for Kooyong. Integrity and transparency are clearly important matters for all members participating in this debate. This is not a new journey. This motion focuses on the Lobbying Code of Conduct introduced under the Rudd Labor government in 2008. Currently, the intent of the code is to ensure that contact between lobbyists and Australian government representatives is conducted in accordance with public expectations of transparency, integrity and honesty.The code sets out the requirements for contact between third-party lobbyists and government representatives as well as outlining the type of information that will be available to the public through the register. Lobbyists who do not comply with the code may be removed from the register. The register requires lobbyists to adhere to a number of obligations or risk being completely deregistered if they failed to conduct business with the government appropriately. Some of those principles include:… not make misleading, exaggerated or extravagant claims about, or otherwise misrepresent, the nature or extent of their access to Government representatives, members of political parties or to any other person … keep strictly separate from their lobbying activities any personal activity or involvement on behalf of a political party … use all reasonable endeavours to satisfy themselves of the truth and accuracy of all statements and information provided by them to clients whom they represent, the wider public and Government representatives …In its current form, the lobbying code allows the Secretary of the Attorney-Generals Department to remove a lobbyist under a wide range of criteria. The code requires government representatives, including ministers, assistant ministers and their staff, most Commonwealth public servants and all ADF personnel, to avoid knowingly and intentionally being party to lobbying activities by lobbyists who are not registered under the code.The code was updated as recently as last year under the former government. These updates include: strengthening compliance and enforcement options available to the secretary of the department; the introduction of continuous disclosure requirements for lobbyists for any material change to their registrations; and improved transparency where former ministers, advisers and senior officials are engaged in lobbying activities. In addition to these updates, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is currently reviewing the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018, which also regulates lobbying activities. The Albanese government looks forward to the committees report and will consider any recommendations it may make, including in relation to lobbying activities.One of the last causes of this motion discusses the need to ensure that the National Anti-Corruption Commission can investigate alleged breaches of the lobbying code. Lets for one second appreciate this country now has an established commission. Unsurprisingly, this is something the party of robodebt were unable or unwilling to deliver. This completely independent Commonwealth agency has been tasked with detecting, investigating and reporting on serious or systemic corruption in the Commonwealth public sector. It also has a role to educate the Public Service and the public about corruption risks and prevention.The commission can investigate the following: conduct of any person that adversely affects a public officials honest or impartial exercise of powers or performance of duties; conduct of a public official that involves a breach of public trust; conduct of a public official that involves abuse of office; and conduct of a public official or former public official that involves the misuse of documents or information that they have gained in their capacity as a public official. The commission was not legislated with the authority and jurisdiction to enforce any penalties under the Lobbying Code of Conduct. To maintain the integrity and mission of the commission, its critical to avoid the assumption that we can simply assign additional functions and powers to the commission and, by doing so, we can solve an issue.The Lobbying Code of Conduct was established by the last Labor government to ensure that government representatives who are approached by lobbyists know whose interests they represent. The government expects lobbyists and government representatives to comply with the code. To let this fall under the commission, while well intentioned, would potentially dilute the capacity of the commission and the incredibly important work its already doing to restore integrity and enhance transparency across the Commonwealth public sector.","Lobbyists","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DAVID SMITH (Bean—Government Whip) ","(11:50):"

56,0,0,0,1,1,"Templeman, Susan MP",181810,"Macquarie","ALP","N/A",5704," There are more than 3,000 construction businesses and more than 560 manufacturing businesses in my electorate of Macquarie, as well as a number of sandstone quarries, and so its for the thousands of construction, manufacturing and quarry workers in and around my electorate that I speak in support of the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill today.Its now well documented how great the risk of engineered-stone manufacturing is and the horrifying impact that it can have on people exposed to its dust. Weve already seen people die from silicosis in this country, people who were otherwise young and healthy. Rates of silicosis and other occupational respiratory diseases are unacceptably high here. These are entirely preventable illnesses and, all too often, entirely preventable deaths. I want every family in Macquarie to know that when they wave goodbye to a loved one as they go off to work in the morning, no matter what the worksite is or whether its their mum, dad, son, daughter or partner, theyre going to see them come home and theyre not going to be exposed to deadly silica dust.Its worth comparing the actions that were taken by governments when asbestos was first identified to what were doing today in these bills. The safety risks of asbestos were first identified in 1898, but it wasnt until the 1970s that meaningful action began. Now, as a parliament, we are not making that same mistake again. We are looking at a range of things that can be done.First, I want to make clear exactly what silicosis is. It is preventable, but it typically has scarring on the lungs called pulmonary fibrosis. Over time, breathing in those tiny silica dust particles triggers an inflammatory response that leads to small nodules growing on the lungs. They can cluster together, causing the lungs to be stiffer and reducing the transfer of oxygen into the blood. In the early stages of the disease, people can have a cough and can be breathless or tired, but theyre well, generally. The more the disease spreads in the lungs, the harder it will be for someone to breathe. There is no cure. A lung transplant may be the only option, although much work is being done on new treatments.The incidence of silicosis has really come to light in recent years. When we talk about this dust getting into peoples lungs, a lot of it has come from the use of dry cutting in the engineered-stone benchtop industry, where those big slabs of stone are cut to size using handheld power saws and grinders to form those holes for the sink, the taps or the stovetop.That generates the crystalline silica dust which can be released into the air and inhaled. We know that using water in this process can suppress the generation of dust significantly but, until recently, dry processing was by and large the way the industry operated. The Victorian government has done some good analysis, and they have found that almost 70 per cent of workers with silicosis in Victoria indicated they spent more than half their time at work in an environment where dry processing was occurring.Queensland was the first state to ban dry-cutting in 2018 and Victoria followed in 2019, with New South Wales in 2020, so there has been progress made to protect workers. Around the time the Victorian government brought in its ban it launched enforcement blitz, and WorkSafe Victoria implemented a free screening program for the estimated 1,400 workers in the stone bench industry across the across the state. The findings are interesting. Some 18 per cent of the initial 324 workers who completed the assessments were diagnosed with silicosis. There were similar results in Queensland where, as of February 2021, the government had screened about a thousand stone masons exposed to crystalline silica dust from artificial stone. Some 21 per cent were diagnosed with silicosis, including 32 with the most severe form, called progressive massive fibrosis. These are the sorts of numbers that show the extent of the problem.Its worth noting now that I am one of many people who, in organising a new kitchen a decade ago, opted for this product in my kitchen. There are lots of other options to use when it comes to the material of choice for a kitchen benchtop. In Australia, around 45 per cent of the benchtop market is artificial stone—compare that to the United States, where it is only 14 per cent. That is one of the reasons the numbers we are seeing are really quite high. It is worthwhile saying to people—and I would take this advice now had my house burned down this year and not 10 years ago, and were I building a new kitchen—that there are many alternatives that contain little or no silica, like wood, laminate, steel or marble.That brings us to where we are as a parliament and the sorts of things we can do to be tackling this very insidious issue. The Albanese government is committed to tackling occupational respiratory diseases and we are bringing in a suite of reforms to ensure Australias prevention and treatment measures are world-class, protecting workers from unacceptable health risks. The package includes the National Silicosis Prevention Strategy and the national action plan, done in collaboration with health professionals, unions and industry. Were also investing in educational campaigns for employers, workers and health professionals to improve not only that prevention, which is so important, but also the detection and treatment. We are also exploring measures to limit the use of engineered stone, including an import ban—thats where individual consumers have the individual choice and can make a difference. Were also working with states and territories to ensure we have a coordinated approach to keep workers safe. This particular bill delivers on the recommendations of the National Dust Disease Taskforce to establish a National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry. It follows the increase that we have seen, and will capture information relating to respiratory diseases that are believed to have been occupationally caused or exacerbated. It will support the use of the information to understand the true scale of all these diseases in Australia and take action to reduce further exposures in the workplace.The bill will require medical specialists in the fields of respiratory and sleep medicine, as well as occupational and environmental medicine, who diagnose certain occupational respiratory diseases to notify the diagnosis, the patient and the exposure details to the national registry via an online portal. These physicians may also notify other occupational respiratory diseases, where that individual provides consent—and youre going to hear the word consent throughout this debate because there is a recognition that there needs to be protection of individuals privacy, and that is embedded in the design of this register. Consistent with the recommendation of the taskforce, initially only silicosis will be a prescribed occupational respiratory disease. The Minister for Health and Aged Care will be able to add other diseases to the list of prescribed diseases, following consultation with the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and each state or territory. The bill recognises the potential burden that notification will have on physicians. We are very mindful that we are asking medical practitioners to do more things, so this limits the mandatory elements that must be notified to a minimum notification. A minimum notification will include sufficient information to identify an individual with a diagnosed occupational respiratory disease, the respiratory disease that has been diagnosed and details of the likely exposure that resulted in the disease, including the last and main exposures.Further additional information can also be supplied where the individual has provided consent, and there are many people that I crossed paths with who want these details to be known because they know that information may provide additional insights into detection, prevention or treatment. That additional information may include relevant medical test results and demographic and lifestyle information, such as their smoking history and employment status. They may want to add details of each job where the individual believes that they had an exposure to a respiratory disease-causing agent. A really good example demonstrates that it isnt only those who are holding the saws and cutting the stone who are affected. Weve had a really disturbing case study of a woman who worked in the office of a quarry where she ended up covered in dust every day without having any idea of what the effects of that exposure year after year might be. Being able to capture those details and some of the history of that person might provide really important insights, but each individual will determine what additional details they want captured.In addition to ensuring notified information is available to the physicians treating that individual, the bill will enable the disclosure of notifications about that person that are made to the national registry, including to prescribed Commonwealth state or territory authorities and to state and territory health agencies and work health and safety agencies. The disclosure to state and territory health agencies and work health and safety agencies will increase awareness of the prevalence of occupational respiratory diseases in that state or territory and will enable actions to be taken to reduce further exposure of workers to those diseases.This bill recognises that several jurisdictions have registry functions currently in operation and doesnt exclude or limit the operation of any state or territory laws requiring the reporting or disclosure of information around occupational respiratory diseases. Where notification is already mandatory in state legislation, the bill provides for notification of these diseases to occur through the national registry, should the state allow it. This will remove the potential for a physician in those states to be required to notify twice—that is, once nationally and once again on the state register.The establishment of the national registry will complement actions across all Australian governments to reduce exposures in the workplace and demonstrates the governments commitment to keeping workers safe. That, ultimately, is our goal here. It is really important for those of us who care about our workers. I dont think there would be a single person in this place who would not want to know that, as someone in their community went to work, their work was not leading to them being exposed to something that could be life-threatening to them down the track, so I look forward to the support of this bill by everybody in this place. It is a commitment by the Albanese government that the rights of workers and the safety of workers be at the forefront of our minds. As someone who has run a small business for 25 years and worked with many, many businesses throughout that period, I know how important our workers are, and I know that employers want to make sure theyre providing a safe workplace. I hope that this bill will assist in that process by expanding the information we have. I commend the bill to the House.","National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill 2023, National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) ","(11:56):"
57,0,0,0,1,1,"Claydon, Sharon MP",248181,"Newcastle","ALP","N/A",5706," I acknowledge the contribution of my friend and colleague the member for Macquarie just before me. This National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill 2023 is a bill of great significance and great importance to the health and wellbeing of Australian workers, and it should come as no surprise that this is a bill introduced by a Labor government. I am very pleased therefore to stand in this House and speak in support of the introduction of a new national occupational respiratory disease registry. This is an important bill, as I said, and I would expect it enjoys the support of every single member in this House.This bill delivers on the recommendations of the National Dust Disease Taskforce to establish this National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry in response to what have been some quite shocking increases in silicosis among Australian workers. Silicosis is an irreversible lung disease, but it is entirely preventable. Tragically it is a disease that is caused by worker exposure to silica dust, and health screening conducted by some jurisdictions in recent years has indicated that nearly one in four of the engineered stone workers who have been in the industry since before 2018 have suffered from silicosis and other silica dust related diseases. That is a most unacceptable statistic, nearly one in four engineered stone workers suffering from some type of exposure to silicosis dust. These are, as I said, entirely preventable diseases and conditions. Not only are they entirely preventable but the deaths are often entirely preventable as well.I come from a region where respiratory diseases have shockingly high rates of prevalence. We know the devastation that is the black lung disease for coalminers, which has reared its ugly head in some parts of Australia again in more recent times, but we have shockingly high rates of respiratory disease across the board. So I am very fortunate to have some of Australias most preeminent researchers and specialists in respiratory and lung diseases based in Newcastle, and I do want to give a special acknowledgement to Dr Susan Miles, who was recently awarded a terrific acknowledgement from her exceptional work as a clinician but also as someone with excellence in clinical teaching at the Calvary Mater hospital in Newcastle. She was rightly recognised for her outstanding contributions not just to general medicine more broadly at the mater hospital and, as I said, as an outstanding clinical teacher, but also as a very valued member of that team and at the university, and I know she has worked with many other important researchers to understand what is going on with these new cases of silicosis.I remember the work that Dr Miles and Dr Geoff Tyler did four years ago which alerted us to a number of new cases of silicosis. They were saying that there were 18 new cases each month coming through. Their role has been as researchers and medical advisory members on what used to be the New South Wales Dust Diseases Authority—I think iCare has taken over that role. These people have been at the forefront of alerting us to the increased prevalence and, of course, what we can do in order to prevent these shocking statistics from continuing to escalate. It was a real challenge that we didnt understand the size of the problem, particularly in New South Wales, so heartfelt thanks and a very big shout-out to people like Dr Susan Miles and Geoff Tyler, whove done incredible work to bring this to our attention and to really alert us to the dangers related to the exposure to manufactured stone products. They have also made clear just how we can improve the diagnostic work there and the need for something more than just X-rays if we are to truly detect the extent of this problem.The bill before us today establishes the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry, which will capture information on respiratory diseases that are believed to have been occupationally caused or, indeed, exasperated. The national registry will also capture associated respiratory disease-causing agents that can lead to the disease, and thats obviously really important information as well. The national registry will capture and share data, where appropriate, on a number of things. I want to step us through what that role looks like. Firstly, it will alert us to the incidence of occupational respiratory diseases and their respiratory disease-causing agents; and the last and main exposures, including the place of business or the industry and occupation and the job task at hand. It will capture the respiratory health data that we need to ensure we have a really accurate picture of what is happening.This is vital information that will aid in detecting new and emerging threats to workers respiratory health. It will inform incident trends, which obviously we want to know as far in advance as possible. It will help inform actions to be taken to reduce further worker exposure. It supports, as I mentioned earlier, some really important research that we still need to do in this area into occupational respiratory diseases. I know that doctors and specialists in respiratory disease in my region and the Hunter are very keen to ensure that we have the necessary data to support the critical work they need to do on the frontline of this disease. This information will also assist in targeting and monitoring the effectiveness of the interventions and prevention strategies that we deploy.The bill will require medical specialists in the fields of respiratory and sleep medicine, and occupational and environmental medicine who diagnose certain occupational respiratory diseases to notify of that diagnosis and ensure that the patient and exposure details are also part of the national registry, and they will be doing that via an online portal. This is not, of course, unfamiliar to most of our medical specialists in this field already. They are well equipped to start putting valuable data into this national register. And the bill provides for the minister for health to have the power to make rules prescribing which occupational respiratory diseases require notification, and that is consistent with the recommendations of the National Dust Disease Taskforce. They have asked that initially it be mandatory for only silicosis to be reported. However, this power, which would require further consultation before it is executed—and I want to make that clear—will ensure that the national registry can respond to other threats to workers respiratory health in the future, and I would think that is important.It is important that we dont have unfettered powers for ministers. There will be a consultation process there. But we do want our ministers to be able to respond in a speedy manner to new data and information coming through. If there are other threats to workers respiratory health then we would want to be doing everything we can to get on top of that quick smart. We dont want to see long, drawn-out delays like we saw with asbestos and the awareness raising and necessary legislative responses to those shocking implications for workers who, for too long, continued to work with those dangerous products. We dont want to see a repeat of that. Sadly, in Australia we have a lot of experience in dealing with these respiratory issues for workers, whether its asbestos related, whether its coal dust related or, now, on the new frontier of silicosis.As I said, the bill will allow respiratory and occupational physicians to notify to the national registry information about an individual who has been diagnosed with a non-prescribed occupational respiratory disease where that individual provides consent. The member for Macquarie, who spoke before me, talked about the importance of having consent in all these steps of the process. The bill provides for two categories of information to be notified to the national registry—the minimum notification information as well as the additional notification information. The minimum notification information is that which needs to be supplied to notify the national registry of an occupational respiratory disease. This includes information identifying the individual who has a diagnosed occupational respiratory disease. It requires notification of the respiratory disease itself and details on the exposure, including the last and main points of exposure. These pieces of information are all vitally important in order to get ahead of the spread of this disease and to get better and better at targeting our prevention strategies.The additional notification information is information that can be supplied where the individual has provided consent. That might include relevant medical test results. It might include demographic and lifestyle information, such as smoking history and employment status, and details of each job where the individual believes theyve had an exposure to a respiratory-disease-causing agent. That builds a bigger picture for us all, really. And this bill will enable the disclosure of notifications about an individual made to the national registry, including the respiratory and occupational physicians treating the individual as well as prescribed information to the Commonwealth, states or territories, state and territory health agencies, and work health and safety agencies.In the short amount of time remaining, I want to say that this bill does not exclude or limit the operation of any existing state or territory laws, and that is important. For those states and territories that already have laws that require the reporting or disclosure of information concerning occupational respiratory diseases, we dont want to see any exclusion or limitation of that. In my home state of New South Wales we have an existing register that requires the mandatory reporting of some occupational respiratory diseases by physicians. This bill will allow for those New South Wales registers to remain intact, but it will make clear that notification of these diseases will occur through the national register so that there is no need for a physician to double-report—they wont have to report to the state register and then the national register; they will only report to the national register.

58,0,0,0,1,1,"Keogh, Matt MP",249147,"Burt","ALP","N/A",5707," Silicosis is the fastest-growing occupational disease. The rates of this and other respiratory diseases in Australia are unacceptably high. These are entirely preventable illnesses and often result in entirely preventable deaths. In a nutshell, when oil, sand and granite are worked on during blasting, crushing, cutting and drilling in construction and associated industries, such as tunnelling, quarrying and mining, silica is released as a very fine dust. One of the most potent sources of silica dust is engineered stone, used mainly for kitchen benchtops. When breathed in, this dust is small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs, causing irreversible lung damage—silicosis. Its incurable, progressive and fatal. About 600,000 workers are exposed to silica dust every year, with about 350 diagnosed with silicosis and 250 with lung cancer.In June 2021, the Australian Workers Union brought a delegation of silica dust victims here to Parliament House. I met with a 35-year-old mum of two, Joanna, who contracted silicosis after working in an administrative role at a quarry for seven years. She said:Its the unknown that is so terrifying. With silicosis there is no cure, and you just dont know how it will progress.Joanna is angry, rightly. She says that she should never have been exposed to this disease. I also met with 53-year-old Kevin, who worked for his company for almost 28 years. He says he wasnt aware that he could get silicosis from what he was doing. He said:Every day, walking around the site, we thought we were OK and safe, but we werent. For years we had inappropriate PPE, safety rules and regulations. I was even offered second-hand equipment. This should have never happened.Sixty-one-year-old Craig worked at a Victorian quarry for 36 years, until he was diagnosed with silicosis in 2019. He said:My health, family, work, and finances have been devastated. Silicosis has affected my day-to-day life and completely changed my lifestyle. Life now revolves around going from one specialist to another and frequently visiting the hospital. I feel shattered. I will not be able to see my granddaughter grow into an adult, spend time with my wife and loved ones and be there for my family.Six hundred thousand workers are still being exposed to silica dust every day. A Curtin University study estimates 103,000 workers will now be diagnosed with silicosis as a result of their current exposure to silica dust. The rate of silicosis will skyrocket in coming years if swift, preventative regulatory and compensatory measures are not quickly adopted. Our government is taking this seriously. We are undertaking a suite of reforms to make sure Australias prevention and treatment measures are world-class. We must protect workers from unacceptable health risks. We are developing a national silicosis prevention strategy and national action plan. We are investing in educational campaigns for employers, workers and health professionals to improve prevention, detection and treatment. We are exploring measures to limit the use of engineered stone, including an import ban, and were working with states and territories to ensure we have a coordinated approach to keeping workers safe.The bill we are debating today, the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill 2023, and its related bills deliver on the recommendation of the National Dust Disease Taskforce to establish a national occupational respiratory disease registry. This will mean that medical professionals will need to notify the national registry so that we can better understand and manage occupational respiratory diseases as well as monitor the prevalence of these horrible respiratory diseases, which will enable action to be taken to further reduce workers exposure to risk.The national registry will capture information relating to respiratory diseases believed to have been occupationally caused or exacerbated and support the use of information to understand the true scale of these diseases in Australia and take action to further reduce exposure. Consistent with the recommendations of the taskforce, initially only silicosis will be a prescribed occupational respiratory disease. The Minister for Health and Aged Care will be able to prescribe other diseases following consultation with the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and each state and territory.The bill recognises the potential burden that notification will have on physicians and limits the mandatory elements that must be notified to a minimum notification. Minimum notification will include sufficient information to identify an individual with a diagnosed occupational respiratory disease; the respiratory disease diagnosed; and details on the likely exposure that resulted in the disease, including the last and main exposures. Further additional information can also be supplied where the individual has provided consent and may include relevant medical test results, demographic and lifestyle information, such as their smoking history and employment status, and details of each job where the individual believes they have had exposure to a respiratory disease-causing agent.In addition to ensuring notified information is available to the physicians treating the individual, the bill will enable the disclosure of notifications about an individual made to the national registry, including to prescribed Commonwealth state and territory authorities and state and territory health agencies and work, health and safety agencies. The disclosure to state and territory health agencies and work, health and safety agencies will increase the awareness of the prevalence of these occupational respiratory diseases and will enable action to be taken as a result of the information we are gleaning from the development of this registry. Where notification is mandatory in state legislation, the bill provides for notification of these diseases to occur through the national registry, should the state also allow that. This will remove the potential for a physician in those states to notify twice—that is, once nationally and once again on the state register. This is important to assist physicians and not overburden them.The establishment of the national registry will complement actions across all Australian governments to reduce these exposures in the workplace and demonstrates our governments commitment to keeping workers safe, because we are committed to keeping workers safe, as Im sure all members of this parliament are. We need to do this, and we need to do more. We need to do this for Joanna. We need to do it for Kevin. We need to do it for Craig. We need to do it for their families, and we need to do it for so many more like them that are suffering and to make sure that we can reduce, limit and cease more people and their families suffering in the future. I commend the bill to the House.","National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill 2023, National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KEOGH (Burt—Minister for Veterans Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel) ","(12:25):"
59,0,0,0,1,1,"Rae, Sam MP",300122,"Hawke","ALP","N/A",5709," Every Australian worker has the right to be safe at work. However, sadly, for many years, thousands of Australian workers were unknowingly exposed to enormous risks in the workplace. Since the first Australian case of silicosis associated with engineered stone was reported in 2015, thousands of Australian workers have sadly been diagnosed with this insidious disease. Many spent years, or even decades, cutting and grinding the stone without any meaningful protection or understanding of the dangers they faced, covering themselves in deadly silica dust. The National Dust Disease Taskforce estimated in 2021 that one in four workers exposed to silica dust from engineered stone before 2018 has been diagnosed with silicosis—one in four workers. Such is the danger of the dust and the inadequacy of protections in so many Australian workplaces.The impact that silicosis and other occupational respiratory diseases have on Australian workers and their families is absolutely devastating. Symptoms may not emerge until years after exposure, and might start as a persistent cough or shortness of breath. However, as the disease progresses, the lungs will continue to stiffen as the silica dust causes inflammation and scarring. Symptoms will progress further to chest pain and fatigue as simple breathing becomes increasingly harder. Sadly, Australians diagnosed with the disease will likely never recover. There is no cure and the effectiveness of treatment is very limited. Thats why prevention and early detection must be a priority.The National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry forms a key part of the governments response to the National Dust Disease Taskforces final report. The registry will keep records of individuals diagnosed with or being treated for respiratory diseases such as silicosis. The registry will enable the analysis of data relating to the incidence of occupational respiratory disease in Australia, which will, in turn, assist with the development and evaluation of preventive measures. This analysis will enable us to better understand the true scale of these diseases in Australia which are often underreported and underestimated, as this disease can take years to emerge.While there were 579 Australians diagnosed last year, research from Curtin University estimates that up to 100,000 cases of silicosis may emerge from current silica exposure. Clearly, the scale of this challenge requires very significant action. In order to ensure that comprehensive data is captured, this bill will require medical practitioners to report any diagnosis of a prescribed occupational respiratory disease via an online portal. The minimum notification information will include the patients identity, the respiratory disease they have been diagnosed with and details about the likely exposure that caused the disease. It is essential that this data is gathered to ensure that we have the best chance of preventing further exposures in the future. More detailed information can be recorded with patient approval, and may include relevant medical test results; demographic and lifestyle information such as their smoking history; employment status; and details of each job where the individual believes they may have had an exposure.This bill also includes provisions to share data with prescribed Commonwealth, state or territory authorities, as well as state and territory health agencies and work, health and safety agencies. This is essential to ensure that all levels of government are fully equipped to take action to reduce workplace exposure to respiratory-disease causing agents. The bill further recognises that some states already have a registry in place and provides for notification to state registries to occur through the national registry, should the state approve. This would remove a requirement for medical specialists to notify twice of any specific case.Initially, the only prescribed occupational respiratory disease will be silicosis. However, there are provisions for other diseases to be added by the Minister for Health and Aged Care as necessary. The establishment of this registry will be a critical tool in the fight against silicosis and potentially other diseases in the future. No worker deserves to be put in a situation where they can contract a deadly, life-changing disease by simply showing up at work and doing their job well. We must act to protect these workers, and understanding where, how and why people are contracting silicosis is the first step. The data from the proposed registry will enable us to answer these crucial questions.It is important to note that this is only the first step. Gathering the data alone will not prevent workers from contracting silicosis. Governments and businesses alike must act on that data. In its final report, the National Dust Disease Taskforce made a series of recommendations beyond the establishment of the registry. These recommendations included the enhancement of work health and safety measures, the development of guidelines to identify people at risk and improve the health screening available to them, improving support for people affected by dust related diseases and their families, and improving the diagnostic capacity of the health sector in relation to silicosis. That is why the government is implementing a range of measures to ensure that Australias prevention and treatment measures are world class, protecting Australian workers from unacceptable health risks.A national silicosis prevention strategy and national action plan is being developed in collaboration with unions, industry and health professionals, whilst investment is also being made in educational campaigns for employers, workers and health professionals to improve prevention, detection and treatment. Importantly, the government is also looking at ways we can limit the use of engineered stone, including an import ban.Id like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the ACTU, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, for the power of work they have done to bring this issue to the attention of so many in this place. I would also like to particularly thank the very brave union members and workers who have been diagnosed with silicosis and are telling their story in order to raise awareness. With mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, labourers and admin workers all coming forward, its clear that this disease doesnt discriminate and that workplace safety practices have been totally inadequate for far too long.In fact, while occupational exposure only contributes 1.8 per cent of the overall burden of disease in Australia, in the specific case of silicosis, it contributes 100 per cent. One hundred per cent of silicosis cases are a direct result of exposure in the workplace. That means workplace exposure is entirely responsible for the pain and suffering of thousands of Australians diagnosed with silicosis as well as the hundreds of thousands of Australians who may be diagnosed in the future.Whilst there is still a significant amount of work to be done, it is reassuring to see this legislation receiving broad support from across the parliament, the union movement and the medical profession. I want to acknowledge the opposition, who established the National Dust Disease Taskforce and are supporting this legislation. I very much hope this bipartisan approach to protecting the rights of Australian workers is continued into the future.The National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill is an important step in protecting Australian workers from silicosis and providing a framework for protection from similar diseases in future. Its about ensuring that Australians can return home safely from work every single day without risking their health now or in the future. I commend this bill to the House.","National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill 2023, National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RAE (Hawke) ","(12:33):"
60,0,0,0,1,1,"Chesters, Lisa MP",249710,"Bendigo","ALP","N/A",5710," I rise to make a few contributions towards the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill and urge the House to support it. I also acknowledge the leadership and the campaign work of the activists in this space and their unions in raising this issue. In quite unfortunate circumstances, people with quite advanced rates of silicosis and other related occupational respiratory diseases took the time to share with us why a bill like this and a reform in this area is needed. Rates of silicosis and other occupational respiratory disease are unacceptably high in Australia. These are preventable diseases and illnesses. Far too often there are entirely preventable deaths if we can just get things right in the workplace and in the health response. We also have the unique opportunity right here, right now, to stop the rise of silicosis and other dust-related diseases from becoming the new asbestos and asbestos-related diseases.While our government is committed to tackling occupational respiratory disease, I acknowledge from the onset that it is not our job alone—it requires the federal government to work in close collaboration with our state and territory governments as well as with workers, unions and industry. It is essential that the federal government act and take leadership on this matter as it is urgent that we institute measures to lower the exposure of silica dust in Australian workplaces. Colleagues have shared stories of workers coming to tell their tales of how they developed silicosis-related diseases, and those tales are heartbreaking—people who worked with engineered stone, not knowing that cutting and the way in which they cut, and the exposure that they had, would lead to this deadly disease; people who didnt even work with cutting stone—in reception or in accounts—but happened to be in a workplace where dust levels were so high.Recent modelling by the union movement has shown that, without significant change, 10,000 workers in Australia will be diagnosed with lung cancer related to exposure to silica dust, and 100,000 will be diagnosed with silicosis. Existing safety laws do not provide enough protection for these workers or future workers, and that is why we need to take urgent action. It is good to see that this is bipartisan and that the parliament is working together to ensure that silica dust and silicosis doesnt become the next asbestos. Surveys by the National Dust Disease Taskforce, occupational hygienists and unions show that employers are not doing enough to prevent exposure. More than 70 per cent of occupational hygienists surveyed in 2022 said they were concerned about the overexposure of silica dust in Australian workplaces. Hygienists reported that two barriers to protecting workers were: one, management commitment and; two, lack of financial resource. Its little wonder that we are hearing this—similar reasons were cited during the very slow reform to the asbestos industry over the 1940s and 1980s. I guess thats the point I am trying to make here: we need to act now to prevent silicosis and silica dust becoming the next asbestos and asbestos-related diseases.Where are we at with asbestos? I am co-chair with the member for Monash of the Parliamentary Group on Asbestos Related Diseases. What we hear time and time again in our forums is the legacy that we have. There is so much asbestos that is out in our built environment. Its estimated that one-third of buildings built between a certain period in Australia have asbestos in them. There are homes, there are government buildings, there are schools and there are hospitals, and its fine until its disturbed. With so much asbestos in our built environment, a lot of the shift has gone from the workers who installed it to the DIY people who are doing their own work on their properties. It has in many ways become a huge burden on our health system, as we dont quite know who has been exposed and how theyve been exposed, and the education campaign in relation to exposing yourself to asbestos dust is enormous. If you think about one in three homes in Australia built in a certain period as having asbestos, thats a huge education campaign to ensure people are removing or repairing asbestos. It could be any kind of work. You could simply be hanging pictures in your house and nailing holes into the wall or sanding back a wall to paint, quite common tasks that all of us undertake, but if it is an asbestos wall you could be exposing yourself to that dust. Due to the fact that its in our schools and hospitals, trying to remove it in a way that is safe and not to expose people working in that space is so critical.We have an opportunity here to get on top of it. Silica dust is quite common, it is fair to say. It is a naturally occurring substance that is part of the earths crust. We can be exposed silica dust to during mining, tunnelling or road construction. Those are the more natural ways. However, one of the most disturbing ways in which people are becoming exposed and where we are seeing most of the cases of silica dust related disease is with the use of engineered stone. It shouldnt be a surprise. Engineered stone is also known as fake marble out in the community. It has started to be used in benchtops and other parts of finishing off homes. Its a cheaper product, which is why people tend to go for it, but its also a product that is, to be honest, crap. Its a little bit of stone and then a whole bunch of glue, and I see my colleague across laughing.","National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill 2023, National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CHESTERS (Bendigo) ","(12:44):"

We might see it in lots of units or apartments, but whilst it might be a cheaper product to install, the legacy it has can be profound. If the workers involved in cutting and installing that stone havent done it in a safe way, they are exposing themselves to this deadly dust. Once it is there, its a bit like the asbestos problem. We need to make sure we are monitoring where this stone already exists, where the engineered stone has been used, because in future renovations and future work, particularly on a home, it may have four or five owners before that stone is disturbed. In apartments its a similar situation. But once its there, it becomes a legacy, just like asbestos. I do believe, whilst this is a good first step and we are talking about a national plan, we do need to start to work with the states on looking at a ban on engineered stone because we do need to stop its use to make sure we dont have the same legacies as asbestos.This government is committed to tackling occupational respiratory disease and undertaking a suite of reforms to ensure Australias prevention and treatment measures are world class. We want to protect workers from unacceptable health risks like those associated with this deadly silica dust. We are developing a national silicosis prevention strategy and a national action plan in collaboration with health professionals, unions and industry as well as our counterparts in the states and territories. This is one of those spaces where there are federal government responsibilities and state and territory responsibilities.We are investigating an education campaign for employers, workers and health professionals on how to improve prevention, detection and treatment. Treatment is critical for those who have already contracted the disease, and prevention is to ensure that further workers arent exposed. We are exploring limiting the use of engineered stone, including import bans, as Ive just mentioned. I believe its a step we need to take to ensure that we dont have that future legacy and impose a future burden on future workers, future homeowners and so on and so forth. Were working with the states and territories, as Ive mentioned, to ensure that we have a coordinated approach across all jurisdictions to keep workers safe.This bill delivers on the recommendation of the National Dust Disease Taskforce to establish a national occupational respiratory disease register. It follows an increase in silicosis in stonemasons working on engineered stone benchtops. Whilst it is a naturally occurring substance, and we do see it in some workers in mining, it is particularly a problem in engineered stone and stonemasonry work because they have been using engineered stone. There is some debate in the industry about whether it can be used safely ever, and that is where the science needs to come in to tell us whether it can be used safely in any way.The national register will capture information relating to respiratory diseases believed to have been occupationally incurred or exacerbated, and it will support the use of information to understand the true scale of these diseases in Australia to take action to further reduce exposure in workplaces. This bill will require medical specialists in the fields of respiratory and sleep medicine and occupational and environmental medicine to diagnose certain occupational respiratory diseases and to notify the diagnosis, patient and exposure to the register via an online portal. Information is key to this. This bill is consistent with the recommendations of the taskforce. Whilst the register will be only silicosis initially, there will be the opportunity for the Minister for Health and Aged Care to prescribe other diseases following consultation with states and territories and the Chief Medical Officer. Whats really important is making sure that were capturing future diseases that we are able to detect.Within this space, I want to acknowledge that, as with asbestos, Australia is a leader in the world. I note that any reform we do in this space will be watched in other parts of the world because they look to us for leadership in workplace health and safety. Just as weve been a leader in asbestos education and awareness, we can be a leader in silica dust reform and silicosis too.This bill recognises the potential burden that notification will have on physicians. We will work to make sure that that burden is able to be managed in a way that is minimal, but the notification is necessary. If we really want to get a handle on how far and how deep this is and how many have been exposed, we need the data. The data is the first step that we are taking in our plan to make sure that we are tackling this deadly disease.Every worker has the right to come home safe not just from injuries that occur in the workplace but from longer term injuries that we quite often dont focus on. We focus on being crushed by equipment and on trying to prevent those instant workplace accidents that may occur, but we do also need to make sure we focus on less obvious incidents, like exposure to dust—asbestos dust, silica dust or any sort of dust that may cause respiratory disease. Far too often, individuals exposed to silica dust may develop silicosis or asbestos and develop mesothelioma but have it dismissed as being from other factors, such as living with a smoker or being a smoker, but we know thats not always the case. We need to take seriously whats happening in the workplace in relation to dust.In concluding, I want to acknowledge the leadership of the men and women who work in this space—those brave individuals who saw all of us to tell their stories—as well as the leadership of the ACTU, the AMWU and the CFMMEU, in making sure we all know that deadly dust is causing a huge problem in Australian workplaces.","National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill 2023, National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[7]","N/A","N/A"

64,0,0,0,1,1,"Repacholi, Dan MP",298840,"Hunter","ALP","N/A",5712," I rise to contribute to the debate on the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Register Bill 2023. When someone goes to work, its fair to expect them to go home at the end of every day, and its fair to say that no worker should ever have to suffer from long-term health problems resulting from work that sometimes show up years after the work has been completed. But this is the case for many Australians who work with asbestos or were exposed to the harmful particles and who are now suffering from asbestosis. This is just one example of an occupational respiratory disease. Right now rates of these occupational and respiratory diseases are far too high in this country—unacceptably high. Nobody should go to work and contract such a disease, especially not when it is entirely preventable. Yet it still results in the death of people who were just doing their job.Another occupational respiratory disease is silicosis. Not unlike asbestosis, silicosis is a long-term lung disease, caused by inhaling unsafe levels of silica dust and usually developing over a period of many years. People who work with materials like granite, slate and sandstone may inhale a fine dust that contains silica. These dust particles, once inhaled, can scar the lungs. This can make it difficult to breathe and in some cases means the patient will require oxygen to help them breathe. Having silicosis also increases the risk of other health problems, like tuberculosis, lung cancer and chronic bronchitis. It is a high price to pay for a days work, and no-one should expect this to be the consequence of showing up to work to provide for their family.More can be done to prevent these diseases. Workers can be spared from suffering the early death that comes from a disease such as silicosis. That is why our government is committed to tackling occupational respiratory disease and is undertaking a wide range of reforms to ensure that Australia is world class in our prevention and treatment measures and to make sure we are protecting workers from unacceptable health risks. Our work in this area has already started. We are talking to health professionals, unions and industry to develop a national silicosis prevention strategy and national action plan. It is in the interests of all these parties to make sure silicosis is prevented where possible. It will mean that unions and employers are looking out for workers. This will result in a healthier workforce, and medical professionals will have an eased workload, with fewer cases of this disease—which, sadly, are soaring right now in this country.As with so many issues, education can play a major role in the solution. When it comes to preventing occupational respiratory disease, education is vital. This government understands this and is investing in educational campaigns for employers, workers and health professionals to improve detection and treatment. Employers need to know how they can make their workplaces safer for employees. Employees need to know how they can work in a way that is safe, and they need to understand the consequences if they are not making sure that they maintain safe work practices that prevent these diseases.Its also important for all medical professionals to be aware of and alert to the existence and threat of occupational respiratory diseases so that these diseases can be detected early and receive the right treatment. We all know there are certain materials that increase the risk of producing the dust that contains silica and ultimately leads to workers contracting diseases like silicosis. One of these materials is engineered stone, which is often imported from overseas. We are exploring measures to limit the use of engineered stone, including an import ban, so that materials coming into our country and being used by our workers arent leaving them with lifelong health complications.But its not the responsibility of the federal government to be the only soldier in the fight to prevent occupational respiratory disease. The states and territories also have an interest in responding to what has become an increasingly large issue. It is important that we work together so that we can achieve the best outcomes and develop an effective strategy and response. This is why we have been working with the states and territories to ensure we have a coordinated approach to keeping workers safe.In recent years there has been an increase in cases of silicosis. This increase has been seen to be largely impacting those working as stonemasons and specifically those who have been working with engineered stone benchtops. This issue led to the recommendation of the National Dust Disease Taskforce to establish the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry, and that is exactly what this bill is seeking to deliver.The national registry will play an important role in helping to prevent these diseases. It will capture the information relating to respiratory diseases which are believed to have been caused as a result of someones occupation, or diseases which are made worse in particular lines of work. We know that this is a big issue in Australia, but before we can act to respond properly and effectively, we need to understand the real size of this issue. That is why the information that will be collected by the registry is so important. This information will be vital to understanding the true scale of these diseases in Australia and will make sure that we are able to take action to reduce further exposures in the workplace. If we cant see the issue and its real size, we cant properly respond. This registry established by this bill will help us to see the issues we are facing so that we are able to act, prevent disease and properly protect workers.This bill also gives attention to the important role that medical professionals play in fighting these diseases. It will require medical specialists in the fields of respiratory and sleep medicine and occupational and environmental medicine who diagnose certain occupational respiratory disease to notify the diagnosis, patient and exposure details to the national registry via an online portal. This makes sense because it ensures that this registry is accurate and seeing the full picture of those being implicated by this issue. These medical professionals are also able to notify the registry of other occupational respiratory diseases where the individual provides consent.While there are many respiratory diseases that can arise from a wide range of occupations, all of which present big risks to peoples lives, at this stage we are following the recommendations of the taskforce. As a result, initially only silicosis will be a prescribed occupational respiratory disease. But this is still a huge step forward, and one which is necessary to protect workers, which is what the Labor Party does best. Going forward, that Minister for Health and Aged Care will be able to prescribe other diseases following consultation with the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and each state or territory.We know these changes that will require medical professionals to notify the registry of any diagnosis of occupational respiratory disease could create some kind of burden. We want to make sure that this burden is as little as possible by limiting the mandatory element that must be notified to a minimum notification. A minimum notification will include sufficient information to identify an individual with a diagnosed occupational respiratory disease; the respiratory disease diagnosed; and the detail of the likely exposure that resulted in the disease, including the last and main exposures. While it may be a small burden, it is necessary to ensure there are fewer of these cases arising and needing the attention of these doctors.There may also be cases where further information will be provided. This additional information can be provided when the individual has provided consent. This information can include relevant medical test results; demographic and lifestyle information such as their smoking history; and employment status and the details of each job where the individual believes they had exposure to respiratory disease causing agents. This is, again, about understanding the full picture, which will help us to work towards preventing these kinds of diseases from impacting workers in the future, and finding ways to better diagnose those suffering with these diseases and give them the best treatment possible.This information will be available to the physicians treating the individual, but the bill also ensures the disclosure of notifications about the individual made to the national registry, including prescribed Commonwealth, state or territory authorities and state and territory health agencies and work health and safety agencies. It is important that the information is disclosed to state and territory health agencies because responding to the issue of workplace diseases requires us all to work together and, importantly, communicate. The disclosure to state and territory health agencies and work health and safety agencies will increase awareness of the prevalence of occupational respiratory diseases in states and territories and will enable actions to be taken to reduce further work exposure to those diseases. If they arent aware of the issue, they cant respond. This will mean states and territories will be fully aware of the impact of occupational respiratory disease in their state, which should help them to develop ways to take action against it.States are not unaware of the issue of occupational respiratory diseases, and many states are doing a lot to act and address this issue. The bill recognises that several jurisdictions have registry functions currently in operation and does not exclude or limit the operation of any state or territory laws requiring the reporting or disclosure of information concerning occupational respiratory disease. This is not intended to override or shut down what is already happening in different states around Australia; this is about creating a combined approach and building onto what is already happening in different states. Given this point, it is important to make sure that this does not create a doubling-up of work when it comes to the requirements of the notification. Where the notification is mandatory in state legislation, the bill provides for notification of those diseases to occur through the national registry, should the state allow it. This will remove the potential for a physician in those states to have to notify twice—once nationally and then again to a state register.This is not the only thing that our government is doing to keep workers safe. Were a party committed to making sure that workers in this country can go to work and provide for their families and do it safely. Were a party that was born out of the interests of workers. We exist to fight to improve the conditions of workers because everyone should return home at the end of their shift. In the case of respiratory disease, nobody should suffer as a result of what they did for work. Workers like stonemasons work hard; they should not have to find it difficult to breathe later on in life because of their hard work. The establishment of the national registry will complement actions across all Australian governments to reduce exposures in the workplace. It demonstrates the governments commitment to keeping workers safe.I want to see a future without people who have worked hard all their lives having to pay the price of battling life-limiting disease caused by their workplaces in their retirement. We know that these diseases are preventable, and this bill is about finding the best way to ensure that they are prevented. Retirement should be a reward for a lifetime of hard work; it should not be spent battling the consequences of work, such as occupational respiratory disease. This bill is the first step to preventing this reality, and I commended bill to the House.","National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill 2023, National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr REPACHOLI (Hunter) ","(13:00):"
65,0,0,0,1,1,"Smith, David MP",276714,"Bean","ALP","N/A",5714," I also rise today to speak in favour of the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill 2023. This bill will establish a national occupational respiratory disease registry that will contain specific information on individuals diagnosed with or being treated for occupational respiratory disease such as silicosis. I would like to firstly talk about the disease I just mentioned: silicosis. Silicosis is a long-term lung disease caused by inhaling silica dust over a period of time. It is a silent killer. The particles, once inside the lungs, scar the lungs—this is what causes silicosis. A one-off exposure may not be immediately noticeable, but a career exposed to quartz, sandstone, soil, granite, brick, cement or engineered stone can lead to irreparable damage. In fact, evidence suggests that workers exposed to engineered stone are particularly at risk, as those workers experienced a more rapid disease progression and a higher rate of mortality, despite being exposed to silica dust for a shorter duration. Symptoms may start to appear in the form of shortness of breath, a dry cough and tiredness. These symptoms become worse with time. Worst of all is the fact that there may be no symptoms at all. Eventually, a silicosis sufferer will find walking and climbing stairs more difficult, and theyll start to notice trouble sleeping and will struggle to eat properly.Last year, Australian Unions published the story of Joanna, which encapsulates just how unnoticeable silicosis can be. Joanna, a mother of two and a wife in her early 30s, was working in an administration role for a quarry belonging to a huge, multinational company that manufactured construction materials. Joannas actual job had little to do with the manufacturing side of the business. In her role, Joanna oversaw things like purchasing and payroll from her office located around 90 metres from the quarrys crushing plant. The dust thrown up by the action of the crushing plant, however, was so pervasive that Joanna said:You could taste it on your lips. Every time youd go home from work you could actually taste it.In her administrative duties, Joanna would also frequently run the safety meetings for staff—sometimes even tasked with taking the minutes. Nowhere in any of those minutes of any of those meetings was she or any other worker for the company made aware of a substance called silica. After returning from maternity leave, Joanna went for her routine medical, as required by her employer. Following an X-ray, she was informed that there appeared to be something on her lungs. A medical biopsy revealed that the something was silica dust.Joanna was fortunate. For many Australians who are exposed to silica dust and who develop silicosis, their risk of developing tuberculosis, chest infections, emphysema, kidney damage and lung cancer drastically increases. Indeed, the Cancer Council has estimated that approximately 587,000 people had occupational exposure to silica dust in 2011. Based on that number, the Cancer Council estimated that 5,780 people will have developed lung cancer.We know today that silicosis cannot be treated, the damage to the lungs cannot be reversed, and only some symptoms can be properly treated to improve quality of life. It was the union movement that successfully campaigned for a National Dust Disease Taskforce and has lobbied successive governments for action since 2019, when members started to flag with their unions that they were suddenly being diagnosed with scarring on their lungs, and healthy workers whod had long careers in quarries, construction sites, tunnels and masonries were suddenly struggling to breathe, developing lung cancer despite not smoking, and entering retirement stuck to a chair and connected to oxygen. Unions, fearing another asbestos-like health crisis, commissioned reports and surveys and began lobbying hard for government intervention and better outcomes for their workers.It was these unions that urged governments to introduce a ban on the use of engineered stone products and that highlighted the need for greater leadership from the federal government to avoid the dust disease epidemic reaching the levels of public health challenge that asbestos had. The ACTU declared:A failure to take these necessary steps will further risk thousands of workers contracting silicosis, an incurable and sometimes fatal lung disease.Id like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the coordinated work from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Workers Union, the Electrical Trades Union, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union, and the Construction Forestry Maritime Mining and Energy Union in advocating for their members most at risk of developing respiratory disease.In April 2019 the Australian government committed $5 million to establish the National Dust Disease Taskforce to develop a national approach for the prevention, early identification, control and management of dust diseases in Australia. This was in response to the emerging trend of new cases of accelerated silicosis. The taskforce was established in July 2019 and provided some initial advice to the then Minister for Health in December 2019. This advice made 17 findings and five early recommendations. The early recommendations included the development and implementation of a prevention strategy, with an initial and immediate education campaign; the development of a national approach to capture data, information collection and sharing to improve the understanding of occupational dust diseases in Australia, including the staged establishment of a national dust disease registry; and research to better understand accelerated silicosis, with an aim to improve prevention and treatment options.The taskforce provided its final report to the minister in June 2021. This final report made seven recommendations. These included: enhanced work health and safety measures; urgently undertaking regulatory impact analysis to identify and decide on measures for implementation that would provide the highest level of protection for workers; developing guidelines to identify people at risk of silica dust exposure and improving the quality, frequency and coverage of health screening for current and former workers; designing and implementing preventative measures; improving support for people affected by dust related diseases, and their families; improving the supports available for the health sector to improve the diagnosis and management of people affected by silicosis; establishing cross-jurisdictional mechanisms to improve communication and information sharing, coordinate response and report on progress; and implementing the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry as soon as possible, with an initial focus on mandatory reporting of silicosis, and voluntary reporting of other occupational respiratory diseases.One of the most confronting statistics that was discovered was that nearly one in four engineered stone workers whove been in the industry prior to 2018 have been diagnosed with silicosis or other silica dust related diseases. This legislation recognises the important work that the states and territories have been doing to keep Australian workers safe in following some of the recommendations that were made in the National Dust Disease Taskforce report, and we can see practical examples of these recommendations being implemented. For example, here in the ACT a number of policy changes have occurred to enhance work health and safety measures. These measures include a ban on the dry cutting of engineered stone; a new minimum standard for safety control that will apply for mechanically cutting engineered stone, concrete, cement, bricks, mortar, masonry and natural stone; and that any future cutting of crystalline silica materials is expressly defined as high-risk construction work, and, additionally, that those involved in high-risk cutting must complete mandatory training by 1 October this year. These reforms will be enforced through penalties for individuals and businesses that fail to meet the new mandatory requirements, with fines ranging from $6,000 to $30,000.Establishing the National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry was a key recommendation of the National Dust Disease Taskforce. As recommended by the taskforce, specialists in respiratory sleep and occupational and environmental medicine will be required to notify the registry of every diagnosis of occupationally caused silicosis. They may also notify the registry of other occupational respiratory diseases with a patients consent.This bill will establish a registry that will record the incidence of occupational respiratory diseases in Australia, which will therefore inform activities to prevent further workers being exposed to respiratory hazards. With no cure for silicosis, prevention is our best chance to successfully eradicate this disease for future generations of workers. The registry will have a multitude of functions, including: collecting, storing, analysing and publishing information on the diagnosis and progression of occupational respiratory diseases; monitoring the incidence of occupational respiratory diseases and preventive activities and the effectiveness of these activities; informing the identification of the industries, occupations, tasks and workplaces with a risk of exposure to respiratory hazards; providing prescribed medical practitioners with access to individual patient information on the registry to inform that persons health care for respiratory diseases; and supporting research, including through the identification of individuals for clinical trials and observational studies.By being able to track where cases are coming from, how theyre being treated and how theyre being prevented, the government can use this data to assist with the formulation of a long-term and robust approach to eradicating silicosis and similar respiratory diseases from workplaces. Consistent with the recommendation of the taskforce, initially only silicosis will be a prescribed occupational respiratory disease, but the Minister for Health and Aged Care will be able to prescribe other diseases, following consultation with the Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer and each state and territory.The bill recognises the potential burden that notification will have on physicians and limits the mandatory elements that must be notified to a minimum notification. The minimum notification will include sufficient information to identify an individual with a diagnosed occupational respiratory disease, the disease diagnosed and the details and the likely exposure that resulted in the disease, including the last and main exposures. Further information can also be supplied where the individual consents.In addition to ensuring notified information is available to the physicians treating the individual, the bill will enable the disclosure of notifications about an individual made to the national registry, including to prescribed Commonwealth, state or territory authorities, state and territory health agencies and work health and safety agencies. The disclosure to state and territory health agencies and work health and safety agencies will increase awareness of the prevalence of occupational respiratory diseases in the state or territory and will enable actions to be taken to reduce further worker exposure to those diseases.The national registry is about empowering and informing the governments long-term plan to eradicate silicosis. This is not something the country can fix in six months, and, due to the slow nature of the disease, the data suggests that numbers will still rise for some time and that the long-term effects will still be present in generations of workers. But the national registry will help formulate our response and will ensure that future generations of workers do not need to fear developing silicosis in their workplace.The establishment of the registry will complement actions across all state and territory governments to reduce exposures in the workplace and demonstrates the Albanese governments commitment to keeping workers safe. We cannot cure silicosis, but we can prevent it. I commend this work from the assistant minister and the union movement, and I commend this bill to the House.","National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry Bill 2023, National Occupational Respiratory Disease Registry (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DAVID SMITH (Bean—Government Whip) ","(13:14):"

Silicosis is an irreversible lung disease. It affects workers who are exposed to silica dust—mainly in the construction and mining industries and those working in engineered stone industries. Currently there are no effective treatments for silicosis. Once damage from silicosis occurs, it cannot be reversed. The treatment tends to focus on slowing down progression and relieving symptoms. In severe cases, a lung transplant is required.Silicosis is said to have been causing death and disability to Australian workers for over 100 years. According to the Lung Foundation Australia, around 600,000 Australian workers are potentially exposed to silica dust each year across various industries. Tragically, these are preventable conditions and often preventable deaths. Everyone has the right to feel safe and protected at work. This government is adamant and passionate about making sure that is the case.

Despite this being a fun and educational way for someone to spend their school holidays, the reason behind a program like this is justified when you look closely at the numbers. According to the ABS, out of design, engineering, science and transport professionals in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, only 22.3 per cent are female.This is coupled with the STEM Equity Monitor published last year by the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, showing that girls confidence in STEM subjects is generally lower than boys, and the number falls with age. According to that same report, women make up only 36 per cent of enrolments in STEM university courses and 16 per cent in vocational STEM placements.We can tackle this issue at a macro level, but I am pleased to see a strong and capable woman like Georgia McRae doing her part to even the numbers with initiatives like Techno Girls.

Recent data shows that half of the older women living in private rentals in Greater Sydney are living in poverty, and, according to the 2021 census, two out of five homeless individuals are women.But women dont often present as homeless individuals or rough sleepers, instead couch surfing, house-sitting, sleeping in a car or relying on help from friends and family, so all too often their circumstances are overlooked. Most of these women have never been homeless before and find themselves in this situation because of an unavoidable life event, like the death of a partner, a relationship breakdown, illness or early unemployment. As women tend to live longer, be paid less, have less superannuation and take more time out to care for others, the situation is only exacerbated over time.In some cases, these women can access public housing or other resources, and I applaud the work of organisations such as Housing for the Aged Action Group, but in truth there is much more that can be done. Policies that provide long-term certainty and support for all older Australians, particularly women, are within our power to enact.

Thanks to the support from the City of Swan, for example, we will have many amazing businesses and wineries from the Swan Valley of my electorate of Hasluck, including Sandalford, Limeburners, Nikola Estate, Sittella estate and Old Youngs Kitchen; then we will have beautiful food from the House of Honey, Morish Nuts, Whistlers Chocolate and Mondo Nougat, a local business that will be holding a nougat-making masterclass at their booth. Showcase WA will also be featuring exhibitors from the resources sector, tourism, education, defence industry, environmental conservation, local and state governments, business and agriculture.It has been a huge undertaking to put this event together and I must acknowledge my colleague in the other place, Senator Pratt, as well as the member for Moore and their teams for all their effort to give Western Australia this most deserving moment in the spotlight.

According to the RAC, there have been 31 crashes and countless near misses at the local blackspot in Sorrento. A recent RAC survey nominated the intersection as Perths most hazardous. I have been working with concerned members of the local community towards a solution, including Sacred Heart College. I recently met onsite with members of the Sorrento community to hear their concerns. Whilst talking to residents I met 20-year-old Kirby Dees, a local resident who sustained a broken wrist in an accident at the intersection whilst on her way home. Ive launched a petition that has already been signed by hundreds of concerned residents, and I call upon the federal government to provide the necessary road safety funding required to install a roundabout or a set of traffic signals at the intersection as a matter of urgency. Failure to act on this matter will only result in more accidents and more injuries to the local community.","Moore Electorate: Roads","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[9]/speech/talk.text/body/p","Mr GOODENOUGH (Moore—Second Deputy Speaker) ","(13:42):"

Decades of evidence have shown that financial pressures from cost-cutting in transport supply chains squeeze operators and drivers and cause dangerous pressure to delay maintenance, meet unrealistic deadlines or stay on the road too long. This year alone has seen the collapse of Scotts Refrigerated, Rivet Mining Services and Milkrun in the face of incredible pressure from wealthy clients making extraordinary profits while squeezing transport contracts.So far this year, more than 100 people have died in truck crashes, including 29 truck drivers. Twelve food delivery riders have been killed since 2017. In the last financial year, there have been close to 200 insolvencies in the trucking industry. As Michael Kaine, the National Secretary of the TWU, has said:This crisis in transport affects the entire industry, from gig workers to owner drivers under pressure to drive longer and faster, to employers faced with cannibalistic, unfair competition.In 2016, when the Road Safety Tribunal was abolished, the gig economy barely existed. Now its a deadly additional factor to the supply chain pressures in this industry. Its time to pass reform to make road transport safer, fairer and more sustainable and ensure lives are protected.","Transport Industry","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[10]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DAVID SMITH (Bean—Government Whip) ","(13:43):"

We saw from RedBridge polling last month that the no campaign was leading 56 to 44, and, worse for the yes campaign, when people had read both official pamphlets that increased to 59 to 41. What was once an issue of a lack of detail for the yes campaign has become an issue of the presence of detail: the more people find out, the more they reject it. I see Newspoll is now showing that there is a majority in neither the popular vote nor the state vote for this. Australians are divided on the issue of race, and I think this is a terrible outcome. No matter where you stand on the issue, its terrible to see us divided on this issue.But there is one place where there is 100 per cent support for the Voice, and thats where Labor and the Independents meet. I cant hold it against the Labor members. Theyre told what they have to do. They cant object to their position. But the Independents have chosen to be Labors voice in their electorates, and you have to ask why theyre doing this despite popular support falling. Popular support is falling, and yet they continue to insist on being Labors voice. Thats because theyre not here to represent you; theyre here to change you. That is the Independents view. They came to this place pretending to be great community advocates. Theyve been revealed to be nothing more than Labors voice in their electorates.

This inclusive art studio tags its exhibition as an opportunity to revel in unconventional, progressive art from artists who are not afraid to take risks.The crowd was escorted around the exhibition by performance artists Kurt Bosecke, Mathew Leigh-Tamblyn and Dougie Jacobssen in character, and we were treated to a large range of artworks, from paintings, drawings and sculptures to T-shirts, digital art installations and much more. True to the exhibitions title, there were biscuits as well. The standout pieces included some digitally enhanced pictures that move when viewed through an app, by Matthew Cawthorne, Michael Tye, Banjobe Hunt, Lewis Constantine, Jenna May, Hannah Ryles and Kimberly Sellers.

I grew up in North Parramatta myself and am from Parramatta through and through.Alan was one of eight children who grew up in Granville. He undertook national service at the age of 18. He worked for James Hardie. He became involved in the building of Ronald McDonald House. He was also involved with the Parramatta football and rugby league club for 30 to 40 years. He was Chairman of the Eels and the leagues club. He was crucial both on and off the field. As one of the greatest sons of Parramatta, he was also integral in ensuring the growth of this community and seeing many of the important community developments that we have seen over the years blossom into a great centre for Western Sydney in the heart of New South Wales.His passion for the community saw Alan receive numerous awards for his achievements, including the OAM—the Order of Australia Medal—and, of course, being appointed a Member of the Order of Australia, for his work with Scouts groups and handicapped children and for his services to the clubs. On behalf of the entire membership of the Parramatta Eels and the Parramatta Leagues Club, the district, the community, my community of Mitchell and all of the people whove worked with Alan—including me, as I have had the pleasure of working with him over many years—to his wife, Merle, and his children, Karen, Craig and Grant, we say: vale, and a life well lived.","Overton, Mr Alan Clifford, AM","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[13]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HAWKE (Mitchell) ","(13:48):"

In attendance were not-for-profit organisations like Haven Home Safe and local community health services like the Bendigo Community Health Service. We also had our local government—the City of Greater Bendigo—and our local real estate agents attend. I mention local real estate agents because of what they said clearly and loudly to the group: We cannot supply all the rental properties that people in Greater Bendigo need. Yes, we are a critical part of the private rental market, but we cannot do it alone.They agreed with the rest of the people who participated that we need more social and community housing and that we need more supply to help solve the housing crisis not just in my electorate but across the region and across Australia. What they also said, which I thought was really interesting, is that this has taken decades to occur, that the legacy of the Howard-Costello years is finally starting to really impact in our local community.

But I say to those Australians: Do not be troubled because the man charged with solving these problems, the Treasurer, is a big Labor thinker. He was kind enough to point this out to us when writing his dazzling essay in the Monthly. He gently reminded us that other big Labor thinkers have done the same thing—Kevin Rudd in February 2009 and Wayne Swan in March 2012. He cited the timeless wisdom of a Greek philosopher: No man ever steps in the same river twice. If hed told us that no man or woman ever gets an interest rate increase twice, that would have been a lot more comforting, but he couldnt actually say that, because theyve had 11 of them in a row under this government.But do not worry about these minor details, I say to Australians. Read the Treasurers essay. Print it out and carry it around with you. Memorise it. Repeat it. It will comfort you. I say to Australians: be awed and amazed by the limitless power and ambition of this remarkable man, a man with big plans. His to-do list includes redefining and reforming our economy and institutions and reimagining and redesigning markets, but my favourite is the one he promises to get done this year: building a better capitalism, uniquely Australian.

Ive said for a long period of time now that we will co-operate with China where we can, well disagree where we must and well engage in our national interest. The decision by China to remove the 80.5 per cent antidumping and countervailing duties on Australian barley should be welcomed by all Australians. This is a decision that is good for Australia, but its also good for China, because they get access to the best barley in the world—the best barley in the world. These duties had effectively blocked barley exports worth over $900 million. This is a decision thats good for our economy, good for agriculture and good for jobs—and Im sorry that its opposed by some of those opposite. One in four Australian jobs are in exports. Jobs in export industries have higher-than-average pay. Trade contributes 30 per cent of GDP. And China is by far our biggest export market.The result is the culmination of more than a year of work, and I want to pay tribute in particular to Don Farrell, the trade minister, and also Penny Wong, our foreign minister, for their calm, consistent, responsible approach, standing up for Australias interests. They have had a sustained engagement. Our approach has been serious and sustained. We have continued to speak up for Australias national interests and we will continue to do so—on human rights and on the need for economies and the rule of law to properly operate.But we do say that there is an interest in China receiving our goods, just as there is an interest in Australia exporting those goods. It is in Australias interest to have a stable bilateral relationship with China, and we made it very clear that we were open to dialogue. I met with Xi Jinping in November last year, and Im sure we will potentially meet again on the sidelines of the G20 meeting that is coming up in the future. I have also overseen a ministerial engagement, including between foreign ministers, trade ministers, defence ministers and others. We have made progress without shifting any of our fundamental positions on trade, on security or on regional stability. Well continue to do so, by having respectful dialogue.

This represents years of hard work from Australian government officials and industry. Australia has successfully use of the rules based World Trade Organization dispute settlement system to respond to, resolve and address these issues. We welcome Chinas decision to remove duties on Australian barley and have made clear to China we expect a similar process to be followed to remove duties on Australian wine. We are confident of a positive outcome.Since coming to office, the Albanese government has been working hard to stabilise our relationship with our countrys largest trading partner. Chinas decision to remove duties on barley is the latest in a series of decisions we have been able to secure from China to remove trade impediments on our agricultural products. Already, over the past couple of months, we have managed to successfully negotiate the removal of impediments on cotton, timber products and horticultural products—something I would have thought those officers would be welcoming. This is a feat that they could not achieve when they were in government. While the decision on barley is welcome, there are a number of products—in particular, wine and beef—that are still subject to impediments. We will continue to work hard to stabilise the relationships with trading partners.The Albanese Labor government is steadfast in its support of industrys ambition of $100 billion by 2030, evident in the significant market access wins secured since we came to office. Last year alone we recorded 107 market access achievements where access was established, improved or restored, and that is worth over $5.4 billion to our agricultural sector. We will continue to work hard to pursue Australias interests on behalf of the agriculture sector to ensure that we have the best possible international access.","Agriculture Industry","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[4]/answer/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"

He was also a passionate campaigner for the introduction of a royal commission into financial services, something that the Labor Party supported in opposition and the coalition voted against 26 or 27 times.There were 76 recommendations from the royal commission. Of those, some 54 were to government, another 12 were to the regulators and 10 were to industry. I am very pleased to be able to report to the House that in the first 12 months of the Albanese government we have implemented a key recommendation that was outstanding from when we came into government, and that was the implementation of the compensation scheme of last resort. I say its important because, upon coming into government, there were around 2,000 people who are owed an award of damages that was unable to be paid and would have otherwise been paid by the compensation scheme of last resort. About $230 million worth of compensation payments will now flow because in the last month that legislation passed through the Senate.I can also inform members of the House that, of the six outstanding recommendations to government, five can be passed this week if the financial accountability regime passes through the Senate. I believe its on the Senates Notice Paper to be considered this Wednesday, and Id urge the Senate to ensure that that does occur. The final recommendation to government that I havent dealt with so far deals with point-of-sale exemptions in relation to certain credit products. I propose to deal with that in the context of the buy-now pay-later reforms that I hope to bring into the parliament if not late this year then early next year. I think that would be a very important reform.If I could point to the other recommendations, my understanding is that there are two recommendations to the regulators that remain unresolved. Both of them require other processes to be dealt with. For example, one of them requires the implementation of the Quality of advice review and other associated processes that Im busily dealing with the regulators, the department and the regulated industry on. In relation to the industry, my understanding is that there are three outstanding recommendations. Ones a bit hard to measure because it deals with the change of culture within the industry. The other two deal with not yet time expired reviews of codes of practice within the industry.

Hes a great Tasmanian representing the great people of Lyons. I also want to acknowledge how grateful I am to represent Senator Farrell here for this question. He is a great South Australian, who, by his deeds, is proving to be an exceptional trade minister in the Albanese Labor government.As many in this chamber know and as has been referenced before by the Prime Minister and the minister for infrastructure, in May 2020 Australian barley producers copped an 80.5 per cent tariff when exporting barley to China. That has led to an almost $1 billion a year loss to those grain growers around Australia because the duties effectively blocked the export of that barley to the Chinese market. That is why the news that came out last week that the Chinese government will no longer be imposing these duties on Australian barley is so welcomed by the industry and of course by all Australians. There are presently 126 exporters registered to supply barley to China, who will again have access to the significant market after three long years. This is also great news for Chinese consumers, who will now be able to enjoy better beer brewed using great Australian barley—the best barley in the world, as the Prime Minister has commented.Since being elected, the Albanese Labor government has been working constructively with the Chinese government to address a range of trade related matters which arose during a long period of diplomatic silence overseen by those opposite. As part of this constructive approach, in April China initiated a fast-track review of the barley industry following agreement between our two nations to suspend the WTO dispute on barley. Now, following Fridays announcement and consistent with the terms of that agreement with China, Australia will discontinue that WTO dispute. This is a great outcome, which demonstrates the approach adopted by the foreign minister and the trade minister of engaging in sensible dialogue and negotiation, which is delivering timely results for Australian industry. The reality is that, if we had pursued this dispute through the World Trade Organization, barley producers would not have had a resolution for at least another 12 months, and that is entirely unacceptable for a $1 billion a year industry.We know growers were devastated by these tariffs. At the time, barley was one of the top 3 agricultural exports in the country. Other markets were pursued, such as Mexico, because, of course, they brew some good beer over there too, but none could match the geographical proximity of the Chinese market for barley nor the population. This decision has been celebrated by stakeholders. I want to acknowledge the support of National Farmers Federation Chief Executive, Tony Mahar, who said:We acknowledge the hard work by the Albanese Government to stabilise our relationship with China—in particular Minister Watt, Minister Wong and Minister Farrell who have engaged constructively with their counterparts on this issue.We have an exceptional Senate team leading for Australia.

Those opposite dont even pretend to care about the cost of living anymore—or about the jobs market. They have vacated the field. Could that be because inflation is moderating in our economy, our jobs market has been particularly resilient, and we are handing down the first surplus in 15 years—something those opposite were incapable of?But we know that people are still under pressure, and in the face of the shadow Treasurers embarrassed indifference, our highest priority is rolling out billions of dollars in cost-of-living relief and creating good, secure well-paid jobs for more of our people. In the face of pressures coming at us from around the world and being felt around the kitchen tables of this country, our labour market has been a source of resilience and a source of strength. Australians have every right to be proud of what we have achieved together over the past year and a bit: 14 million Australians in work for the first time ever; the population share in work the highest ever; the unemployment rate now 3½, down from 3.9 at the election; and womens participation at near-record highs as well. The most recent data confirmed half a million jobs had been created in the first 13 months of the Albanese government. Thirteen months is the shortest period for any new government to reach this mark on record. It took those opposite 34 months to create half a million jobs. It took Mr Howards government 45 months. Thats more than three times longer than its taken us.Despite the outstanding performance of our labour market and our people, we know that high but moderating inflation, higher rates and global uncertainty is expected to slow the economy and push up employment in the months ahead. Both the RBA and the Treasury forecasts have unemployment ticking up over time. But this is a remarkable starting point as we enter a new period of uncertainty from a position of relative strength. Its also prompted a welcome and important focus on full employment and how we manage and maximise opportunities for more of our people.The first priority of the employment white paper that we will release in the coming months will be finding some common ground on full employment and, in the process, laying out our plans for job security and wages and productivity and skill shortages and addressing the barriers that people confront, even with unemployment, with a three in front of it. As pleased as we are with the progress that Australians have made together, we know that there is more to do to ensure that people who work hard can provide for their loved ones and get ahead. This is a central feature of our responsible economic management. Were making progress, but we know that theres uncertainty ahead.","Employment","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1[4]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr CHALMERS (Rankin—Treasurer) ","(14:28):"

170,0,1,0,0,1,"Clare, Jason Dean MP","HWL","Blaxland","ALP","N/A",5729," I thank my friend the fantastic member for Pearce for her question. Australia is the best country in the world. There are lots of reasons for that, but one of the reasons is that we look out for each other. Think about when theres a bushfire or when theres a flood: we get together and we help each other out. Mateship isnt some kind of made-up national myth. Its what we do and its who we are. We dont leave our mates behind. But there are a group of Australians who are behind. If youre a young Indigenous person today, youre less likely to go to preschool, youre more likely to fall behind at primary school and youre more likely to drop out of high school. And, if youre a young Indigenous bloke today, youre more likely to go to jail than to university. Thats despite decades of good intentions and billions and billions of dollars that have been invested.The no campaign says you dont need a voice because all of the answers are here and politicians know best—you can hear some of those noisy no voices right now—but that unyielding gap between black and white Australians tells us thats wrong. If we want things to change then we have to do more than just change what we do. We have to change the way we do things. Thats what the Voice is about. It starts with recognition—recognising the fact that Australia didnt start when Captain Cook got here. Its about listening. This is an advisory committee. When you listen to people, you get better results and you get a better use of taxpayers money.I said a moment ago that, if youre a young Indigenous bloke, youre more likely to go to jail than uni. It costs taxpayers, on average, $11,000 every year to send an Australian to university. It costs taxpayers $148,000 a year to send someone to jail. Thats $11,000 a year to set someone up for life and $148,000 a year to lock you up for life. And, if youre a young person in the juvenile justice system, its more like $1 million a year. What if better policies, informed by listening to people who know what theyre talking about, helped more young Indigenous people to finish school and go on to university, rather than to jail? Thats what we mean when we say better results and a better use of taxpayers money. Isnt that what we all want? Its not easy—its hard—but its worth it. Its about building a country where no-ones held back and no-ones left behind, and that is what the Voice is all about.","Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1[6]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CLARE (Blaxland—Minister for Education) ","(14:35):"

Last week, the member for Cook claimed he stopped robodebt. He said:… I closed the scheme down during the operational phases of the scheme when the issues and unintended consequences first arose.But hes not the first former coalition Liberal minister to now claim credit for stopping robodebt. Stuart Robert, the former member for Fadden, also famously claimed credit in this place. He curiously didnt credit the member for Cook for it! Whilst the commission doesnt deal with the member for Cooks claim that he stopped robodebt—presumably because no-one except the member for Cook thought that he would ever say that!—Commissioner Holmes did have something to say about Mr Roberts claims. She found the evidence provided to the commission by Mr Robert on this point to be less compelling. She continues that Mr Robert was informed of the existence of AGS advice warning of a potential illegality on 4 July 2019. And, for the record, Mr Robert decisively acted five months later!But, not to be outdone, theres another former Liberal robodebt minister who has also popped his head up to claim credit; its the former member for Aston, Alan Tudge. Breaking the habit of 15 years of parliament, I read the Spectator last week—it was actually sent to me. Mr Tudge outs himself that he effectively stopped robodebt by removing all the bad parts of the scheme. He writes, I paused the raising of debts, and he lists some other areas which he changed. He then essentially asserts that after his interventions there was nothing bad to see here. For the record, I remind Mr Tudge that after he civilised robodebt it went for three more years. There were 156 AAT decisions that the DHS were wrong because robodebt used averaging to calculate the debt, and there were many articles. In fact, between 2017 and June 2020, hundreds of thousands of people were still robodebted. Nonetheless, if Mr Tudge wants to claim credit for stopping it, well done!But who really did end the illegal robodebt scheme? Ill draw attention now to the words of the royal commissioner. She congratulates Madeleine Masterton and Deanna Amato. These are individual citizens who took on the federal government. She says:The litigation in Masterton and Amato, in both cases conducted by Victoria Legal Aid, played a crucial role in the demise of the Scheme.The royal commission concludes:It succeeded in exposing the illegality of Robodebt where other possible forms of check on the Scheme … did not …So, to be perfectly clear and answer the question, those opposite did not stop robodebt until the legal system forced them. And now the Leader of the Opposition has to decide whether he will agree with the royal commissions findings or he will keep white-anting the royal commission, showing that those opposite have learnt nothing.

We had, of course, General Campbell, the CDF, as well as Greg Moriarty, head of the Department of Defence. I spoke there very clearly about my governments position, which, consistent with the position that the Biden administration has taken, is that climate change is a national security issue.

We engage with the Pacific Island Forum about why that is the case.We engage in all of our international forums, whether it be through the UNFCCC, that have been attended by the minister, or whether it be through the recent meeting of AUSMIN, where I, along with our foreign minister and defence minister, met with the US Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, and the US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken. When we met in Brisbane, one of the things that we spoke about was climate change as a national security issue. Its something that is a consistent theme, not surprisingly, from the world. Indeed, at the NATO summit that was held in Vilnius in Lithuania, the impact of climate change was a constant theme as well. It has an impact on food security. Its having an impact on migration. Its having an impact on so many areas of the globe, which is why we have to put it in that frame as well.

I know that youve done outreach with your community about this issue. More broadly, nationally, I know youve met with the coalition of peak organisations who are making representations to parliament on this issue.Youpla was a disgrace. It was an absolute disgrace. You had a dodgy company flogging junk funeral insurance to First Nations communities. When it collapsed in 2021, 14,000 First Nations families were left stranded. They couldnt pay for their funerals. We came to government a few months later. There were bodies trapped in morgues, who could not be buried. The Minister for Indigenous Australians and I moved quickly to put in place an interim arrangement. Were standing in the shoes of the insurer, and Im pleased to report that over $2 million has been paid out and around 250 claims have been made. Funerals are happening. The thing about this thats a disgrace is that the behaviour was well known to successive governments for close to 30 years. This mob had a rap sheet that Chopper Read would be proud of. For over 30 years, regulator after regulator, state departments and federal departments were made aware of what was going on. In 2015, Centrelink took them off Centrepay—an acknowledgement that this was a mob that was doing harm to community. But seemingly it took another two years before that decision was even implemented.The royal commission handed its report to the former Treasurer in 2019. It took another two years for licensing arrangements to be put into place which led to the closure of the fund. The minister for Indigenous affairs, when we were shadows, wrote to the Treasurer in 2020 and said: As soon as this happens, the company will collapse and these families will be stranded. Nothing happened.The simple fact of the matter is that, for over 30 years, this business was taking advantage of First Nations people—taking advantage of their known cultural practices. Millions of dollars were lost in premiums. It was known by government and it was known by regulators. But nothing happened.If thered been a Voice to Parliament, that Voice would have been listened to.

Australian manufacturers know that weve got their backs—that weve got a strong plan for Australias existing and emerging manufacturers, to help them grow and thrive; to add value, create jobs and export to the world. But we have also stepped up to act when the situation demanded it.When Australian manufacturers were faced with a global energy crisis, with the cost of gas and coal soaring, the Albanese government stepped up and stepped in. The actions made a difference. On the Energy Price Relief Plan, the facts, the numbers, are compelling about what it did. Remember: in the second quarter of last year—the final quarter of the Liberal and National government—the electricity prices that confronted Australian manufacturers rose by 60 per cent. You fast forward to the second quarter of this year, where they were predicted to jump 33 per cent, and, in actual fact, based on the recent data, they fell by 1.5 per cent, showing that the Albanese governments Energy Price Relief Plan had helped shield manufacturers from the worst of those energy price spikes.Now heres how industries that called for help to tackle this problem reacted. Caprals CEO—and I just visited Caprals Bundamba facility in the member for Blairs electorate just the other week—said the governments actions in the short and medium term are an excellent step forward. The Energy Users Association of Australia congratulated the government on a balanced approach, saying it looked after domestic energy users in the national interest. Manufacturing Australias CEO highlighted that governments the world over are intervening to protect customers, and went on to say that the Australian government is right to do the same. Thats the take of Australian manufacturers who knew we stepped up when they needed it most.But what was the hot take of the catastrophiser-in-chief, the Leader of the Opposition? He went on to make a number of big claims. He said that the Energy Price Relief Plan was a disaster. He said it was a massive con job. This one was a doozy: he claimed it would lead to blackouts! Blackouts, he claimed! No claim too outrageous or absurd! I guess that if the Teflon count is big enough the embarrassment just whooshes straight off—thats what it does! The master of disaster! But what did you expect? This is the party of robodebt, who are only interested when peoples lives are miserable. Theyre not there to help. They voted against the Energy Price Relief Plan and voted against the National Reconstruction Fund but are always there to back their own political interest above the countrys interest.","Energy","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1[12]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HUSIC (Chifley—Minister for Industry and Science) ","(14:53):"

Im also delighted to report, after our visit to a general practice this morning, that she has excellent blood pressure, which is often very difficult in this line of work we are in. She also promised her constituents at the last election that we would deliver cheaper medicines, and that is exactly what we are doing. In just 12 months we have delivered three different waves of cheaper medicine reform, which is already saving Australian patients tens and tens of millions of dollars, and were working hard as well to list new cutting-edge treatments on the PBS so Australian patients get access to the worlds best medicines—theyre coming on right now—at affordable prices. Last month, for example, we listed a medicine called Kerendia, a new treatment for diabetic kidney disease. Now 26,000 Australians will have access to this life-changing treatment at no more than $30 a script—$7 a script if theyre concessional payments; $30 a script otherwise—instead of paying a thousand dollars per year to have access to this relief.As the member for Canberra intimates, we want to do more. We are determined to make medicines even cheaper, which is why we accepted the advice of the medicines experts who manage the PBS to allow doctors to issue 60-day prescriptions for ongoing health conditions at the price of a 30-day script. It is a policy that just makes sense. It saves patients time and money, halving the price of common medicines for six million patients. It frees up millions of desperately needed GP consults for much more serious complex health conditions, and it improves medication compliance. We know that from evidence overseas. This is why so many other countries already do this, and that is why pretty much every patients group and every doctors group in the country supports our policy.","Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1[14]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BUTLER (Hindmarsh—Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House) ","(14:59):"

If it was somewhere where there were issues and problems, then the Leader of the Opposition would have been first there.

So accustomed is he to acting in bad faith that he assumes everyone else is too. Those opposite should have attended the Garma Festival.Ill tell you what is different between last year and this year. Last year the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians and shadow Attorney-General, the member for Berowra, was at the Garma Festival and made a constructive contribution to it. I think that gave the people at the Garma Festival a great deal of hope that there was an opportunity to actually lift up this nation by responding positively to the generous ask that is represented by the Uluru Statement from the Heart. It is a generous ask that arose after many years of process and consultation—including by Tony Abbott, who established a process when he was Prime Minister—on the form of constitutional recognition it should take, not whether it should take but what form. Tony Abbott hoped 2017, with the 50th anniversary of the 1967 referendum, would represent the year in which the coalition government would take a referendum forward and give Australians a chance to say yes. Instead, we have seen between last years Garma Festival and this years a walking away from the process in which Julian Leeser had been involved since at least 2012.The Leader of the Opposition thought that saying sorry would be the end of the world; now he thinks listening to people will be the end of democracy.

This week is Homelessness Week, and the theme of this week is Its time to end homelessness. On census night more than 1,500 Australian veterans were homeless. Today, I convened the first of a number of consultation sessions that will contribute towards our new defence and veteran mental health and wellbeing strategy, something you would think those opposite would be very interested in. The strategy implements one of the recommendations of the Productivity Commission inquiry in 2019.In the roundtable, we heard the perspectives of medical professionals, those who practise in the space of mental health and wellbeing, assisting serving personnel and veterans. They highlighted that housing is a fundamental prerequisite in helping veterans who are suffering from mental ill-health. We cant move forward in assisting those who do not have secure housing. So it is fundamental to assisting the development of a mental health and wellbeing strategy that we also deal with homelessness. Indeed, we heard that the risk of suicide in the Australian population is double if someone does not have access to safe and secure housing. That is a matter that is fundamentally affecting our veteran community. So, we know, in trying to tackle the issues that the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide is grappling with, that housing is fundamental to that effort.The work that our government is doing in bringing forward the Housing Australia Future Fund, which sets aside $30 million to assist veterans who are experiencing homelessness or are at risk of experiencing homelessness, is fundamental to our veteran community, not only in assisting them with this important issue of homelessness but also in helping members of our veteran community who are suffering mental ill health to tackle that, to gain treatment, to gain access to the services they need. Its also fundamental to a very important issue that was raised in the round table today, and thats social connectedness. If you have insecure housing, if you dont have a secure location, it is very difficult to put down roots and to gain connection into a community. These are very important issues.

I know that like many Australians she was up well past three this morning cheering the Diamonds on, and I thank her for her form.What a game! And it was made even better by the fact that, from broadcasting to camera crew to commentators, it was all women this morning. Firstly, I want to give a huge congratulations to the Diamonds—to Coach Stacey Marinkovich, Captain Liz Watson and their team—for trouncing the old enemy, England. Bravo! A 61-45 defeat of the Roses, Kiera Austin with an MVP performance of 15 goals, a fairytale ending for Ashleigh Brazill—the Diamonds just secured Australias 12th Netball World Cup championship in 16 attempts since 1963.Our female athletes are excelling on the world stage. Our female athletes are changing sport in this country forever. The womens football World Cup has ended any and all arguments about the popularity and importance of elite womens sport. Womens sport is not a phase, it is not a nice-to-have, it is not a charity; it is thrilling, it is brilliant and it is here to stay.The Womens World Cup is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to foster inclusion, diversity and participation for women and girls. Just look at the Matildas 20-year-old superstar Mary Fowler. Mary grew up in Cairns sleeping in caravan parks and learning to play football on Mission Beach. Shes now getting literal goals in front of record global crowds. Sport has completely changed Marys life.And, because it is always more than sport, it is always beyond the result as well. The successes we are seeing are not cures. Women still face major barriers on many fronts—societal, cultural and procedural. Although there is strong womens participation in grassroots sport, girls are far less likely to progress to high-performance or professional roles than men are in this country. They are far less likely to become sporting officials, far less likely to become sporting chairs and far less likely to become sporting CEOs. In Tokyo, 51 per cent of our Australian athletes were women but less than 20 per cent of the coaches were women.But sport can be a driver for inclusion. In the lead-up to the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games we must and will use sport to help tackle issues of race and of gender. This government is determined to support people to achieve their dreams, from playground to podium and from unmown suburban lawns to walking out onto a World Cup pitch in front of 80,000 people.

291,0,0,0,1,1,"Jones, Stephen MP","A9B","Whitlam","ALP","N/A",5737," I move:That the House refer the following matters, relating to insurers responses to recent natural disasters in Australia, to the Standing Committee on Economics for inquiry and report by 30 September 2024:(1) responses of insurers to the claims resulting from major 2022 floods, including the:(a) south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales (NSW) floods of February and March 2022;(b) Hunter and greater Sydney floods of July 2022;(c) Victorian, NSW and Tasmanian floods of October 2022; and(d) central west NSW floods of November and December 2022;(2) the inquiry shall have regard to the following matters in respect of the aforementioned floods:(a) the experiences of policyholders before, during and after making claims;(b) the different types of insurance contracts offered by insurers and held by policyholders;(c) timeframes for resolving claims;(d) obstacles to resolving claims, including factors internal to insurers and external, such as access to disaster-hit regions, temporary accommodation, labour market conditions and supply chains;(e) insurer communication with policyholders;(f) accessibility and affordability of hydrology reports and assessments to policyholders;(g) affordability of insurance coverage to policyholders;(h) claimants and insurers experiences of internal dispute resolution processes; and(i) the impact of land use planning decisions and disaster mitigation efforts on the availability and affordability of insurance;(3) the inquiry shall also have regard to insurer preparedness for future flood events; and(4) the inquiry will take into consideration findings from other reports such as Deloittes external review of insurers responses to the 2022 floods, and ASICs claims handling review.On 19 July I announced on behalf of the government that there would be a parliamentary inquiry into insurer responses to the 2022 floods affecting South-East Queensland, the Northern Rivers of New South Wales and the central western districts of New South Wales. It is the truth that there is barely a city or town in Australia that hasnt been hit by floods or by fires and other natural disasters in recent years. They are becoming more frequent and more intense, and the destruction more devastating.About $14 billion is how much the Insurance Council of Australia estimates the damages from storm and flood cost in the period from January 2020 to December 2022. Thats $14 billion. Almost every state and territory experienced a major flood event in that period. When these natural disaster events hit, they leave trauma behind and social and emotional crises. They also cause an economic crisis for the communities affected. Each time, the recovery job is enormous and multifaceted. Food, shelter and supplies are the most immediate needs. Labourers and building supplies need to arrive quickly into communities. Insurers employ surge workforces to process huge volumes of claims. Experts in hydrology are brought in to determine where, in the case of a flood or a stormwater event, the water came from. With this knowledge, the terms of reference for this inquiry take a whole-of-economy and social view of the effects of these events.When I announced the inquiry last month, I was with the member for Calare, whos in the chamber today, in the town of Eugowra in western New South Wales. We stopped at a place called The Fat Parcel, a popular local food van. I can assure you that this is not on the Heart Foundation of Australias recommended eats in New South Wales, but its a fantastic place to get all manner of burgers, fries and other sorts of goodies. I spoke with some of the tradies who were still erecting temporary block homes for people to live in eight months after the flood had hit and made so many people homeless. The member for Calare and I were welcomed into the homes of Lesley and Brian Smith. I wont forget both what they told us about their own experience and the warmth with which they greeted us. They had used their entire lifes retirement savings to move to the town and enjoy a quiet life in the country. When I met Lesley and Brian, they were still living in a temporary block home, stamped onto their front lawn. Eight months after the flood, they were still in a dispute with their insurers. They were unable to move back into their home, which remained painted in my mind.When we visited Molong earlier that day, I was struck by the sense of community. I met local business owners, like Sarah, who ran the local hair salon, and Kaylene, who owned the local newsagency. Like most small business owners, they work around the clock and invest not only their money but their heart and soul into their businesses. Sarah employed an apprentice and her long-time best friend, who were both left instantly jobless when the flood came. Sarah shifted trades overnight and began working as a labourer, I believe, in a concreting business with her partner—very versatile; from hairdressing to concreting. Kaylene quickly poured her own money into the newsagency to fast-track repairs. The business became the post office, the bank and the convenience store for the town. Kaylene was still waiting for her insurance claim to be resolved when the shop floor remained covered in wooden slats, which were exposed after the owners ripped up the carpet themselves. They all shared stories about the immediate aftermath of the floods. The entire community held the weight of the clean-up on their shoulders. What they didnt expect was the fight ahead when it came to their insurance claims.In Australia, when we talk about the effects of climate change, we no longer use the future tense; we talk about it in the current tense. One of my first visits on becoming minister was to the town of Lismore in New South Wales Northern Rivers. I joined with the state member Janelle Saffin, the member for Lismore, who pointed out a sign on a telephone pole that showed the high-water mark from 1974 at 12 metres. At the peak of the 2022 floods, that sign was underwater because the waters rose to 14 metres. Cut through the politics and the denial, and youll find a simple unavoidable truth: natural disasters are happening more often, and theyre getting worse, and, of course, theres inequality at the centre of it. Most exposed communities are in places like western New South Wales, North Queensland, the Northern Territory, northern New South Wales and Western Sydney, where there is a huge threat of extreme weather. In these places, youll find low-income earners who live in the areas that are more likely to be impacted by the effects of these severe weather events. Lets not mince words. its low-income earners who will bear the brunt of climate-change-induced severe weather events. Theyre the same people who struggle to afford the mitigation work, by the way, and theyre the same people who are struggling to afford insurance. Theyre overrepresented in the underinsured or the non-insured. And theyre the people who most desperately need a smooth claims process when something goes wrong.Im sure the member for Calare will use his own words to describe this in the chamber today, but I remember his very passionate words when we spoke about this in towns like Cudal. I was very pleased to visit my old youth stomping ground in the town of Cudal. When we visited Molong and Eugowra, the member spoke very passionately about his dissatisfaction with the claims-handling process.In places like these, instead of having a smooth claims-handling process, many found themselves in dispute over exactly where the water came from. Was it stormwater run-off or a flooding creek? Was the water running into the creek or out of the creek? Thatll determine the impact on your insurance claim. Hydrology reports are expensive, and few people are trained to write them. These reports can cost an individual up to $10,000. Thats money thats always hard to come by, but when youve lost everything its impossible.Even where claims are paid out, there can be serious delays in the repair work, and the communities often need to rebuild from the ground up. They can struggle to find enough labourers, and there are supply chain issues that mean delays in getting the building supplies needed, a point that the member for Gilmore has raised with me in relation to the bushfires that affected her community in southern New South Wales in 2019-20. The member for Eden-Monaro has raised the same issue, and, just to ensure that Im not seen to be partisan, I will say that Ive heard the member for Page make similar representations in this place about the impacts of floods on his community. Some losses cant ever be replaced, but when people are suffering, when things have fallen apart, theyre entitled to expect that the recovery wont be made harder than it needs to be. Theyre entitled to a process that is as simple, efficient and compassionate as possible.Thats why were setting up the inquiry. We want it to look at all of these issues, and well give it plenty of time to inquire. I see Dr Mulino in the chamber today. Hes an eminently qualified chair, and hell work across the parliament in a very bipartisan way. I know that others will be invited to join the committee as they need. I expect several reports to be published by his committee to address the various aspects of what is a deeply felt issue. I know theres a lot of expectation, from the communities that Ive mentioned, other members of this place and the community and the industry more broadly, about how we can focus on some pragmatic, practical solutions to the problems that people are feeling in their households, businesses and communities.The committee will hear from people on the ground in affected communities. Theyll travel, ask the questions, listen carefully to the answers and try to find a way forward. I look forward to receiving the recommendations that can be made to the parliament, to the government and to industry about how we can make the claims process clearer, how we can deal with affordability issues and how we can ensure that people—and this is all about people—who are going through one of the most traumatic moments in their life can, at the very least, have an insurance process that works much more easily, with less sting and pain in that insurance process.Before I close, Ill just note that the government is not just about setting up inquiries. The Albanese government, upon coming into government, has had a range of initiatives. The Minister for Emergency Management, Senator Watt, is leading the rollout of the Disaster Ready Fund, which will invest over $1 billion over five years on risk mitigation work, reducing risk with the view that if you reduce risk you reduce the cost pressures on premiums. Weve set up a hazard risk partnership to get data and the initiatives and to have better information about firming up our infrastructure. This is a collaborative approach between industry, government emergency management and financial ministries, such as mine, to ensure that we can do better.I want to thank the member for Calare for his passionate advocacy and for first raising the matter with the Prime Minister about a month ago. I want to thank the member for Moreton, Graham Perrett, and the state member for Lismore, Janelle Saffin. Ive mentioned the member for Page, who has raised this matter here. So many members have raised this with me. I am incredibly indebted to their passionate representations in this place. I wish the chair and his committee godspeed, and I commend the motion to the House.","Economics Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JONES (Whitlam—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services) ","(15:23):"
292,0,0,0,1,1,"Gee, Andrew MP",261393,"Calare","IND","N/A",5739," When residents across the Central West woke up on Sunday 13 November 2022 they had no way of knowing that it would be the last day before their lives were split in two: before and after the storm. That night and the following morning, locals across Molong, Cudal, Eugowra, Wellington and Canowindra faced water torrents so strong and terrifying that roads became rivers, homes sailed down streets and two much-loved residents were, tragically, lost.For those who saw the absolute destruction of that day and the monumental clean-up that followed, it would be hard to find a scene more gut-wrenching and heartbreaking. But more heartache was to come. Hundreds of disaster-hit residents and business owners, eager to pick themselves up and fight on, found themselves at the mercy of insurance companies. In the nine months since, the rebuilding and recovery process has been made much harder, and the tragedy much worse, by the cold-hearted and shocking response of insurers to policyholders. In some cases it was almost like they were in competition for which one could care less. Our region and many other disaster-hit areas along the east coast have been left reeling from the callous conduct of insurance companies, from long delays in claims processing to widespread knockbacks. Its taken a massive toll across our region.Stories of tragedy are everywhere. During the public meetings I held around the electorate recently, we heard stories of homes being over-stripped out, denial after denial of claims, and insurance premiums skyrocketing for some people to up to 10 per cent of the value of their property per year. The stories of our disaster-hit residents who faced horrific torrents of water, only to be hung out to dry by their insurance companies, must be heard.Change needs to come from this. Thats why I called for a parliamentary inquiry into the insurers response to these natural disasters. I would like to thank the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services for visiting the storm and flood affected towns of Eugowra and Molong recently and seeing firsthand the devastation that residents have been faced with. I would also like to thank the minister and his office for their productive engagement in drafting the terms of reference for this inquiry. I thank the Prime Minister for doing what he undertook to do in determining if a parliamentary inquiry would be possible. This inquiry must not be just a box ticking exercise. It must be a turning point, a pivotal moment in the way insurers deal with disaster-hit policyholders. Enough is enough. In response to my question last week on this very issue, the Assistant Treasurer confirmed—and he repeated it in the House today—that it was through listening to stories like those shared by Sarah Bone from 17 Shades Hair Studio in Molong, Kaylene Philpott from the Molong Post Office and Newsagency, and Brian and Lesley Smith from Eugowra that made him see that a broader scope for the inquiry into insurance was needed.As Assistant Minister Jones said in his response, Australians take out insurance policies to protect themselves in times of need and tragedy. These policies are meant to be a safety net for policyholders, not an added burden when disaster strikes. Insurance policies should not only be simple and easy to understand; they should not be adding to the anxiety created by a disaster through mismanagement of the claims process. The Assistant Treasurer said he took from his visit to our area that communities like Eugowra, Molong, Wellington and Canowindra have pulled together like country communities in Australia do. But they need more support and they need their insurance claims dealt with better and their policies honoured in a better way. That is why I engaged so heavily with the Assistant Treasurer to produce the terms of reference that I believe will enable not just residents from our area but people across Australia who have had their lives turned upside-down by natural disasters and the response by their insurers to tell their stories and ensure this level of heartbreak is not experienced again.I note that one of the terms of reference did raise an eyebrow, and that is that the report will take into account other reports, such as the Deloitte report into the insurers response to the recent storm and flood events. I just say this about that particular issue: whilst I wasnt consulted on that particular term of reference, to me, that is the big end of town reviewing the big end of town. Deloitte was commissioned by the Insurance Council of Australia to review their performance, and they obviously want the committee to take that into account. Well, I have no doubt that this committee will give that report the weight that it will deserve. I think it will be the evidence that local residents and business owners around Australia will give directly to this inquiry that will really tell the story. I put my faith in this committee and not the review that the big end of town is undertaking for the big end of town.I urge the inquiry to travel to the Central West to hear the stories of heartbreak and the cold-hearted response of insurers, just like the Assistant Treasurer did during his visit. The reality is that there is a huge power imbalance between policyholders and insurance companies. At the end of the day, if a policyholder wants to fight a knockback from an insurer, theyre going to need to fork out big dollars for an expert hydrology report and also a solicitor. If youve lost everything or your business is in ruins, there is just no prospect of fighting back. Thats the cold, hard truth. Despite what the industry says, at the end of the day thats what you need to do—you need the hydrologist and the solicitor to take these companies on.The stories of insurers trying to do the right thing are sadly few and far between. Australians expect insurers to be assessing claims in a generous and kind-hearted way, and nothing less. Insurance companies dont answer just to shareholders but also to the nation. They dont just have insurance contracts with our residents; they also operate with that social licence. We need to get to the bottom of whats happened here and make sure that the pain that insurance companies have inflicted on our communities is not repeated in others. Im hoping that this inquiry can shine a real spotlight on the experience of our local residents and that they will get a chance to tell their stories on a national stage so that other communities wont have to go through what we have endured.I also urge the state and federal governments to activate the full suite of disaster assistance measures that have been made available to other parts of the state but have, sadly, been denied to our residents. This is support that has not been delivered to date—assistance such as the home buybacks and retrofit schemes, the Community Assets Program to help rebuild towns and villages, funding for our damaged roads and bridges, and a program similar to the Northern Rivers Commercial Property Return to Business Support Grant. The people of the Central West deserve nothing less than the same level of support these other areas have had, and I will keep on fighting until they get it. The injustice of this support being activated for some of the state not our region is appalling. We are being treated as second-class citizens. Its wrong, and this wrong must be made right. I look forward to this inquiry being a catalyst for change for disaster-hit Australians right around our country.","Economics Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GEE (Calare) ","(15:35):"

The government committed to these measures in our last budget, the 2023-24 budget, to encourage smokers to quit and to help the government achieve the priorities of the National Tobacco Strategy 2023-2030. The Minister for Health and Aged Care is very passionate about these, as is the entire government. The government is doing this through two means. First, the proposals increase the excise and customs duty on tobacco goods by five per cent per year for three years, starting from 1 September this year, in addition to the current biannual indexation. Second, the proposals increase the excise and customs duty on tobacco goods that are subject to the per-kilogram rate, such as loose-leaf tobacco, to broadly align them with the effective duty paid on tobacco goods subject to the per-stick rate.

295,0,0,0,1,1,"Tehan, Dan MP",210911,"Wannon","LP","N/A",5741," The Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023 will amend the Migration Act 1958 to strengthen employer compliance measures in relation to protecting temporary migrant workers from exploitation, including through implementing recommendations 19 and 20 of the 2019 Report of the Migrant Workers Taskforce. The Migrant Workers Taskforce was established in 2016 by the coalition to identify proposals for improvements in law and in law enforcement and investigation and other practical measures to identify and rectify cases of migrant worker exploitation. The taskforce was chaired by Professor Allan Fels and included members from a wide variety of government agencies. The report was presented to the government in February 2019 and was released publicly on 7 March 2019 along with the governments response.The report made 22 recommendations and the then coalition government accepted in principle all 22 recommendations. The coalition then developed legislation to implement recommendations 19 and 20 of the Report of the Migrant Workers Taskforce. That was the Migration Amendment (Protecting Migrant Workers) Bill 2021, which was introduced on 24 November 2021. The 2021 bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee on 25 November 2025. The committee report was tabled on 18 March 2022. The 2021 bill lapsed at dissolution prior to the 2022 election.The majority of the measures in the bill we are debating today are a cut and paste of the coalition government bill; therefore, in principle, we support this bill. Although, through a Senate inquiry, we do want to check that what the government has added hasnt added a huge regulatory burden and that they have it right, especially when it comes to the implementation, but, in principle, we support what the bill is trying to do.The coalitions bill was examined by the Senate committee and the Labor members of that committee, led by Senator Kim Carr—now retired—made 10 pages of comments in the report of things that were wrong with the bill. Yet todays bill does not pick up on any of that. It is fortunate that it doesnt, because it was basically just pure political pointscoring. Its good that we are able to look at something that is all about the facts and make sure we deal with migrant exploitation while, at the same time, ensure that employers in this nation are not overburdened by red tape and regulatory burden.The current bill also includes additional areas in the repeal of section 235 of the Migration Act, which currently provides that a temporary visa holder who breaches any condition of their visa that restricts the work they may do or an unlawful non-citizen who undertakes any work at all commits an offence. The government is seeking to repeal this. The fact that this particular criminal offence hasnt been used in, its my understanding, about 25 years does point to it maybe not being effective. So were happy to look at this as part of the Senate inquiry process. Obviously, if the rationale is a good one, its something we will support.Ive received a briefing on the bill from officials in Home Affairs and the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. I thank the minister for arranging that, and I thank those officials. We had a good, open and frank discussion for about an hour on all the various parts of the bill. That proved to be incredibly useful in me being able to brief shadow cabinet and the party room on this bill.As I said earlier, there are some concerns. If an employer makes a minor mistake when dealing with a migrant worker—for example, asking them to undertake a task that does not fall under their visa class—we want to make sure the employer wouldnt be sanctioned by burdensome rules and red tape. This is important, especially when it comes to small business. For instance, say you were employing a chef and your waiting staff didnt turn up. In the heat of the moment, youre under pressure, so you ask that chef whether he could help serve tables. That becomes an inadvertent breach. We want to make sure there is a proper-balanced and proper-scaled approach to a matter like that. That chef might have worked in the kitchen for two years, and it might have been the first time that something like that had happened. It happened because of the pressure the small-business owner was under, not them willingly or wanting to force someone to work outside their visa conditions. We just want to make sure that there is the appropriate flexibility and the appropriate scale as to what types of misdemeanours we might be talking about. As we demonstrated in putting this bill in place before there was a change of government, where there is serious exploitation, obviously we do want to deal with that. We need to ensure that, while we protect migrant workers rights, we dont create a legal minefield for small businesses that make a minor mistake.I have consulted widely on this bill with a broad range of groups. They all, in principle, support the bill, but they also want to ensure that the red tape burden isnt going to make it very difficult for small business, in particular. There are concerns that the bill may have an effect beyond its stated purpose of establishing protections in employer/employee circumstances and may disproportionately affect, for example, farmers and horticulturists using migrant workers to deal with workforce shortages. One of the things that has been suggested to us is that the government should consider introducing education or guidance programs to ensure that employers fully understand their obligations under this legislation if it passes the parliament, as I assume it will. One of the things we do have to make sure is that people understand what these new rules and regulations entail and that they understand that there are scaled penalties for a misdemeanour or an offence which is established under this bill.One of the reasons were happy to give in-principle support to this bill and just check the details with the Senate inquiry is that we on this side understand that we need to help and support the government when it comes to immigration because theyre making a complete mess of it. We know there are 1.5 million people heading our way. We know that theres no plan for how theyre going to be housed; what its going to do to the rental crisis; what its going to do to congestion; how it will impact on our health sector, which is already under enormous pressure; and what impact it will have on the environment. Weve just seen today, in relation to the pandemic visa, that there were more pandemic visas issued after the borders were opened than there were when the borders were closed. This pandemic visa seems to be just another way that the Labor Party can add to their big Australia agenda—by issuing the pandemic visa like its going out of fashion.My hope is that the minister will find another way to deal with the skills shortage rather than using the pandemic visa. We are hearing, since all the publicity today, that this is just another measure in Labors big Australia approach, and that the minister will move now to end the pandemic visa. We will wait and see. Weve got the data up until March, and well continue to look at that data to see how the pandemic visa is being used by Labor for their big Australia approach. Theres also the issue of the 102,000 people who have sought asylum here in Australia and have failed to get that asylum. When Labor were in opposition, they made a big song and dance about this and said that something needed to be done about it. As we understand it, in the Nixon report, there are some suggested solutions to how the Labor Party might be able to deal with this issue in government, and theyre sitting on that report. They havent released the Nixon report. Having made a big song and dance especially about those people who are coming by plane, seeking asylum once theyre here and being unsuccessful in seeking asylum, we now find out that the government is sitting on the solution that has been given to them.There are lots of problems with Labors big Australia approach. Thats why, when it comes to small issues like this, were happy to support the government. Theyve put legislation in place which builds on legislation that we developed. We just need to check the red-tape elements of it, but, in principle, we support it. I commend the bill, as long as we get proper Senate scrutiny of it and, potentially, have the ability to make changes to ensure it doesnt bring a huge red-tape burden to employers.","Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TEHAN (Wannon) ","(15:48):"
296,0,0,0,1,1,"Garland, Carina MP",295588,"Chisholm","ALP","N/A",5742," This is a very important piece of legislation before us today, the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023. At the outset, in making my remarks in support of the bill, I want to acknowledge the many workers over many years who have advocated for change so that migrant workers would not be exploited in a country like Australia. I acknowledge the Migrant Workers Centre, the Victorian Trades Hall Council, the United Workers Union and so many other organisations who have spoken out over many years, particularly workers who, despite risk and fear in speaking out about their own exploitation, have courageously come forward about what has been an absolute injustice in this country, with coercion, wage theft and exploitation taking place. The reason that these workers so bravely spoke out was to bring about change—the kind of change our government is implementing through this bill—to make sure that no other migrant workers experience what they went through. This is about real justice, at last. It comes from over a decade of work by so many brave people determined to see change. Im really proud to stand here as a member of a Labor government that is making this change.In my work before coming to this place, I heard many stories. I heard from people right across the country about their experiences. For a moment, lets imagine the farm worker in regional Victoria. They have been employed to pick vegetables, cash in hand, in a regional community. They are underpaid, sometimes earning as little as $5 an hour. They are forced to live in a dilapidated shack with eight others. The employer insists on deducting money from their pay, at a cost of $200 a week, for this shabby accommodation. One of the workers is sexually assaulted by a supervisor and is not taken seriously when they come forward and speak to the police about it. Having come forward, they are scared about what will happen. Will they be able to stay in Australia? Will their visas be signed off by their employer? This is a terrible story, but, unfortunately, it is one that too many people in our country have experienced. Imagine youre working in a poultry boning shed. You live in the western suburbs of Melbourne, and every day youre transported in a white van to your employer—again, paid cash in hand. Youre bullied, harassed, injured at work and too afraid to speak out, lest you be punished for doing so. Australia is a better country than these stories suggest, and Im really pleased that were taking the exploitation of migrant workers so seriously through this bill.This package of reforms is designed to confront head-on some of the problems that Ive described. One in six recent migrants to Australia are paid less than the minimum wage. This exploitation hurts us all. Of course it hurts the individual worker, but it also drives down wages and conditions for every worker. We see exploitation all around us, and, where others have failed, our government is committed to addressing it. This bill will implement key recommendations from Professor Allan Felss Report of the Migrant Workers Taskforce, the recommendations of which were not taken seriously by the previous government. It is now up to us to implement the recommendations in full to protect workers as much as we can.There are new criminal offences for using a persons migration status to exploit them in the workplace—this is recommendation 19 from the taskforce. There is a new tool to prohibit employers engaged in exploitative practices from hiring workers on temporary visas for a period of time—this is recommendation 20 from the taskforce. And the bill will go further. There will be high penalties for those who do the wrong thing.The ABF will receive new compliance tools, which is really important because, while it is obviously very important that we have laws in place to prevent the exploitation of workers, we need to make sure that these are implemented properly through effective compliance. We are repealing the part of the Migration Act that makes it a criminal penalty for workers to breach their visa conditions—effectively criminalising speaking up. That is a key part of the change were making today, which is to shift the onus, to shift who needs to be responsible for the terrible things that we are seeing in workplaces across our country, and to really be part of ensuring that justice is truly able to be pursued where it needs to be.We have been taking the work of the Migrant Workers Taskforce and the work of a range of other organisations really seriously for many years. We know that recent migrants are 40 per cent more likely to be underpaid than long-term residents with the same skills and experiences who work in the same job. We know that temporary visa holders make up four per cent of the workforce, but in 2021-22 they made up 26 per cent of all litigation initiated for breaching the Fair Work Act, so we can clearly see that the exploitation of migrant workers is a considerable problem in our community.The new criminal employer sanctions that were introducing in this bill will mean that coercing people to work in breach of their visa conditions will become a new criminal and civil offence, and the penalty for doing so will be up to two years in prison or 360 penalty units. This is a really important deterrent to employers who might be considering exploiting workers due to visa conditions. We know that for many workers one of the barriers to coming forward and speaking out about things like underpayment and unsafe workplaces is that theyre really worried that it will affect their visa conditions. So we should also expect to see more people having the courage to come forward and stand up for their rights.We will be prohibiting employers and individuals who have done the wrong thing in the past from hiring future workers on temporary visas. The triggers for prohibition will include court orders and noncompliance with migration and employment law. Where employers and individuals are subject to prohibition notices, the minister will publish the relevant details on the departments website. This is a really important step, as there is currently no ability to prevent employers who have been sanctioned under the Migration Act from hiring international students or backpackers despite the vulnerabilities these workers face. Well see some unscrupulous employers be unable to continue exploit very vulnerable people.Were going to align and increase penalties for work-related breaches with the maximum penalties available under the Migration Act. This will see penalties increase from 60 units to 240 units, sending a really important deterrence message. We will also be able to make sure that enforceable undertakings for work-related breaches are possible, seeking to use similar provisions under the Migration Act for the Australian Border Force, providing them with additional tools in their enforcement approach. As I mentioned before, its all well and good for us to have the laws in place, but we need to be able to ensure that they are being effectively enforced.There are a range of other amendments that we are making here, and there are a range of other things that our government is doing to ensure that we finally do whats required to implement the key recommendations of the Migrant Workers Taskforce report. We have seen over the last decade an absolute crisis of exploitation in workplaces across the country.So I mentioned a couple of examples at the beginning of my contribution here today, but there are others that people may be well familiar with, like the 7-Eleven scandal, which began a lot of the work that led to the Migrant Workers Taskforce. Weve seen, through the Four Corners episode slaving away from 2015—quite some time ago—brave horticulture workers share their stories about what their experiences were, and yet we are now, in 2023, finally seeing the effective action being taken by our government.The taskforce reported to the Morrison government in 2019, and, unfortunately, not much had progressed from that point. Clearly, this was not a priority for the previous government. It was not taken seriously. Our government takes tackling exploitation really seriously. One of the big issues that we saw as well over the last 10 years was a preference from the previous government for temporary visas rather than permanent visas. What that effectively does for a lot of people is that it makes it easy for unscrupulous employers to target vulnerable workers because they know that they can use the temporary visa status to coerce people and make them feel vulnerable and insecure in this country. Those opposite also created a backlog of almost one million visa applications. So, clearly, they were not taking their responsibility in relation to migration very seriously, neglecting basic administrative tasks and looking the other way.This is despite the fact that so many different organisations, advocacy groups and individuals gave advice that we have a severe problem with exploitation in this country and that action needs to be taken. Of course, that includes Professor Allan Fels, who was the chair of the Migrant Workers Taskforce. It includes the Migrant Justice Institute and Human Rights Law Centre. It also includes the Australian Fresh Produce Alliance, the peak industry body in horticulture. Those members represent half the industry turnover of Australian fresh produce. Theyve said that this bill supports the integrity of visa programs and contributes to whole-of-government initiatives to combat migrant worker exploitation. The Grattan Institute have supported this. Of course, as I mentioned at the beginning of this, the work of the Migrant Workers Centre and the Victorian Trades Hall Council, as well as the Australian Council of Trade Unions, spoke out early on about these issues, which must be noted and commended.There is a lot of work to be done to make sure that everyone in our country in a workplace is treated with respect and is safe. Of course, the implementation of all the recommendations from the Respect@Work report that our government implemented is also really significant to provide that positive duty to employers to ensure that workplaces are free from sexual harassment and discrimination. That is something that, of course, does affect migrant workers too, and I have seen firsthand the terrible impacts of that in workplaces where there are a lot of migrant workers employed.All in all, our government is taking the issue of improving the migration and visa system really seriously. Were taking issues of workplace safety really seriously, and were making sure that were correctly looking at who needs to be punished for instances where there have been breaches of visas, where people have been coerced to do so because of the vulnerability to being exploited by unscrupulous employers.Im pleased that, at last—after decades of work from lots of people right around the country and, of course, after many brave workers have spoken out about their experiences to finally get justice and change in this world—our government is taking the steps that need to be taken to make sure that everyone is safe at work and is not punished for speaking out by having their visa status threatened in this country. Were so much better than that.","Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr GARLAND (Chisholm) ","(16:00):"
297,0,0,0,1,1,"Spender, Allegra MP",286042,"Wentworth","IND","N/A",5744," Migration is central to the story of Australia. As the daughter of a migrant, I know firsthand the contribution that migrants make to our wonderful and diverse society and the opportunities that Australia can provide for those who come to our shores to work, study and live. When migrants come to Australia, they expect to be treated fairly, particularly in the workplace. But the truth is that by some estimates up to one in six migrants whove recently arrived in Australia have experienced exploitation at their place of work—for example, through wage theft, having their passports withheld, threats of visa cancellation, bullying, and harassment.The problem of migrant worker exploitation was highlighted by the 2019 Migrant Workers Taskforce, by the recent independent review of the migration system, by submissions to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration and by people who have contacted my office. A few months ago I was contacted by a temporary migrant on a sponsored training visa. Shed been working for an accounting firm but after six months had still not received the wages that were owed to her. When she raised the matter with the company, a senior executive threatened to cancel her visa and demanded money from her. She soon discovered that other trainees had had a similar terrible experience. This kind of exploitation is devastating for those affected. But it doesnt just harm the migrants themselves. It also harms the vast majority of Australian businesses who are doing the right thing, and it harms Australias reputation as a destination for people across the world who are looking for a great place to work, study and live.For too long weve failed to get our migration system right. In 2019 the Migrant Workers Taskforce presented 22 recommendations for tackling temporary migrant worker exploitation. This bill implements several of them and so is a step in the right direction. The Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023 targets unscrupulous employers with harsher penalties and bans on employing migrants as well as the expansion of the Australian Border Force s enforcement powers. Importantly, it also provides better protections for workers to pursue claims via the Assurance Protocol, and Im glad to see the government also committing to creating a workplace justice visa for those affected by exploitation. If implemented well, these measures would be good for migrants and good for the vast majority of businesses who are doing the right thing.But this bill will be effective only if it is accompanied by stronger action on enforcement, measures to prevent the conditions for exploitation to occur and, importantly, proper support for businesses to implement these changes. Firstly, enforcement: there is no use having good laws if nobody is there to enforce them. Thats why I ask the government, as recommended by the Grattan Institute, to ensure that the home affairs department and the Australian Border Force have the right resources, culture, policies and prioritisation to enforce these changes and transparently measure and report on their effectiveness. The Fair Work Ombudsman must also play a role in ensuring that all workers in Australia are protected, regardless of their work visa status. But their record in identifying and acting on illegal employment practices is poor, and they need to be properly resourced to do their job.Secondly, its about preventing the conditions for exploitation to occur. As the independent review of the migration system recently identified, visa conditions are one of the three main factors that create conditions for worker exploitation. I know the government is considering measures to reduce this vulnerability, including the form of a workplace justice visa, and I look forward to seeing this work as it progresses.Finally, support for business: the vast majority of businesses in Australia want to do the right thing by the migrant workers, and they do so. But many find navigating the complex array of government rules and regulations difficult. This is certainly what businesses in Wentworth have told me. I therefore ask the government to work with businesses to minimise the burden associated with the additional regulation and to ensure that employers have easy access to the right information and support to ensure compliance. As part of this, I ask the government to consider a transition period for these reforms to give businesses the opportunity to revise their processes, bring in new procedures and train their staff without the immediate threat of penalties for noncompliance. I note that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has raised this point with the minister, and I ask him to consider it seriously. I also ask the minister to, as part of broader reforms to the migration system, consult closely with business about how the broader visa system works and to work out how we can make it easier for businesses who are trying to support and include migrant workers in their workplaces to do that in a way that is simple, is cost-effective and allows them to bring the best workers to Australia to contribute to their businesses as well as to the broader Australian economy.Having a system that works for business and is simple, efficient and effective to employ is absolutely critical if we are going to raise productivity and get the best people into the country. Australia should be the best place to work in the world for a migrant, but right now too many migrant workers are subject to exploitation. While most businesses want to do the right thing, a few bad apples are holding us back. This bill is a step in the right direction but must be accompanied by additional measures if it is to have the desired effect.","Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SPENDER (Wentworth) ","(16:14):"
298,0,0,0,1,1,"Ryan, Joanne MP",249224,"Lalor","ALP","N/A",5745," I rise to commend this bill, the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023, and I do so because action in this space is important. Its also overdue, and it is overdue because, following a decade of neglect from the former Liberal government, its now up to the Albanese government to take much-needed action to implement the key recommendations in the Migrant Workers Taskforce report. This report came about after our nation saw a crisis of exploitation occurring in a number of workplaces, and despite national debate and the uproar caused, the former Liberal government chose to take no initiative. We know, because it was brought to our attention and it was brought to the nations attention, what was happening to many migrant workers. There was rampant exploitation going on, which led to the Migrant Workers Taskforce, who made recommendations that the former government failed to bring on after two years. That report went to the Morrison government in 2019. Two years on, a bill was introduced but, as per the common poor standards of the former government, the bill was never brought forward for debate.As always, there was lots of talk. There was an inquiry. There was a report. There was even legislation drafted. But the actual final steps to make those laws were not taken by the former government, and when you hear and remember those words, that low wages were a deliberate feature of the former governments economic plan, you can make your own assumptions about how those low wages were created. But we know worker exploitation was part of driving down wages because it undermined other businesses who were behaving appropriately. Businesses who were paying award wages to migrant workers, businesses who were doing the right thing, were actively being undermined, creating a false economy, by people who were doing the wrong thing. The lack of action from the former government is not surprising, but it took a devastating toll on our countrys valued residents. Electorates like mine felt the brunt of this, and small businesses in electorates like mine felt the pressure to comply with what was irregular rather than what was regular, because those exploiting workers got a competitive edge and got a better bottom line.Introducing this bill fulfilling the reports recommendations is a priority for this government. When I say vulnerable workers were exploited, they were targeted by some companies giving preference to temporary visas as opposed to permanent visas. A backlog of almost a million visa applications was created. Basic administrative tasks that are crucial to a seamless operation were neglected. Its time appropriate action is taken to protect those who contribute their skills for this nations benefit. Weve done a lot of work in our first year of office around migration and the visa system. During our time in government weve already made significant changes to the migration and visa system. Tackling exploitation is only possible through the establishment of a functional and well-administered visa system. Extended waiting times for visas and poor service to clients create additional vulnerabilities and problems for workers in our nation. With regard to visas, we have significantly slashed the backlog created by the former government by employing over 500 new staff. There are now fewer than 600,000 visa applications at hand. Now that were in government, temporary skills shortage visas for health and education workers are being assessed and finalised in a matter of just a few days.Since we took government the backlog for citizenship has been reduced to fewer than 80,000 people, which is the lowest it has been in six years. Up to 90 per cent of people are now waiting less than six months for a citizenship ceremony. In my electorate, that has been critical. My local government has worked tirelessly across these first 12 months to get a backlog of citizenship applications actually through citizenship ceremonies, because we know how important citizenship is to people. For many in our communities who come into the country on refugee or humanitarian visas it will be the first time they have citizenship. I hear it all of the time at citizenship ceremonies.Other people may have come on a student visa and then gone on to employment and, working through the system, getting their permanent residency. In my electorate the waiting time to go from permanent residency to citizenship had blown out, so I am pleased to be a part of the government whose intent to shorten these time frames has seen action occur in my local government, where they now understand how important it is for people who are seeking citizenship to do so as quickly and conveniently as possible.We have made significant efforts towards establishing safe and fair working conditions. Despite this, one in six people who have recently migrated to Australia are being paid less than the minimum wage, and consequently this drives down wages and worsens conditions for other workers in Australia. This government is committed to addressing any and all kinds of exploitation, and we are taking action now. This bill will take key recommendations from Professor Allan Felss Migrant Workers Taskforce report and implement them to create a much more appropriate standard for those employing migrant workers.As per recommendation 19 from the taskforce, new criminal offences will come into effect for those who use someones migration status to exploit them in the workplace. A new tool will also be engaged in prohibiting employers that have engaged in exploitative work practices from being able to hire workers on temporary visas for a period, as per recommendation 20 from the taskforce. There will be an aligning and an increasing of penalties for work related breaches, with an increase from 60 units to 240 units. This will act as an important deterrent. Compliance notices for work related breaches, which consist of a formal notice for employers who are in breach of relevant Migration Act and migration regulations, will be enforced. This will allow for the promotion of compliance with the Fair Work Act. There will be consideration of worker exploitation as a potential mitigating factor should a visa cancellation be under consideration.The Albanese Labor government is committed to doing more than just the bare minimum. This bill will go further. Higher penalties will be implemented for transgressors. The Australian Border Force will receive new compliance tools. A part of the Migration Act that makes it a criminal penalty for workers to breach their visa conditions, which criminalises speaking up, will be repealed by this government. Through the implementation of appropriate protections from visa cancellations, workers will be encouraged to speak up and report exploitation. I have heard stories in my electorate about threats of visa cancellations and how they are used to exploit workers and get them to work for below minimum wages.We should not be surprised that those opposite failed to act, because since we have come to government those opposite have refused to back in changes that this government is making to ensure workers are getting paid award wages. They oppose a regulation that would make it illegal to advertise a position for below the minimum wage. They oppose it. It makes good sense to everybody else in the country. It makes good sense to people in my community that you shouldnt be able to advertise a position when youre not prepared to pay the remuneration that the position is entitled to. That seems fair to me. They are the same kinds of practices against which this bill will put in place deterrents and fines, so as to ensure that workers are not exploited and to ensure that the legislation carries public awareness around whats going on here.The Australian Border Force will receive new compliance tools. The part of the Migration Act that makes it a criminal offence for workers to breach their visa conditions, which criminalises speaking up, will be repealed. We encourage workers to speak up and report exploitation by putting in place appropriate protections from visa cancellations. In turn, this will protect businesses doing the right thing. It will protect all of our workers from having their conditions and their remuneration undermined.The government provided $50 million over four years to the Australian Border Force in the 2023-24 budget. The ABF oversaw a month of action in July and used its resources to target employers who were suspected of doing the wrong thing. The government is raising awareness of employer obligations and taking action to get out and visit businesses in a substantive way for the first time in a very long time. This work would not have come to fruition had there not been an increase in funding or the prioritisation taken by this government to tackle worker exploitation. As Minister ONeil made clear, this indifference will stop with our government.We will be a positive change for those who have chosen to call Australia their home and who are being exploited. This is a matter demanding a response. The former governments lack of competence and value on this matter will not continue to be reflected in the current governments actions. Our government has been engaging in an intensive co-design process with industry, unions and civil society to assist in informing the design of further safeguards within the visa system. We want it to be safe for those who are being exploited in their workplace to speak up and to do so in the confidence that our government is backing them. We want to explore the potential for a new visa for workplace justice to ensure this exploitation ends.We are aware that there are gaps in what workers understand. There may also be gaps in what employers understand. Many people are unsure of who to turn to or where to go should something go wrong. Our migration system needs to work for everyone. It needs to work for the workers and it needs to work for business. Part of that is creating public awareness of these changes, but also ensuring that we have in place policies and a government that will take action where people ignore the rules, where people seek to avoid the rules and where people seek to undermine wages and conditions in this country and undermine other businesses while doing so. I commend this bill to the House.","Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms RYAN (Lalor—Chief Government Whip) ","(16:20):"
299,0,0,0,1,1,"Stevens, James MP",176304,"Sturt","LP","N/A",5747," As indicated by the lead coalition speaker, the member for Wannon, we are supporting the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023 through this chamber. We will take the opportunity through Senate debate to look at some of the regulatory impacts of this legislation that only a committee consideration can uncover. Assuming that nothing significant changes there, no doubt we will support the bill through the Senate. Frankly, this bill emanates from the work of our government, the previous government, which established the Migrant Workers Taskforce. We introduced into the last parliament a piece of legislation that responded to those recommendations, but the calling of the election meant that that legislation lapsed. Most of that legislation is in the bill we are debating now.There are a lot of businesses in my electorate that employ workers through the migration system. and they are all exemplary employers. My experiences with them are that some employ people locally, while others have their headquarters in my electorate but they might be a rural or regional business where their operations are outside my electorate. I have the opportunity, as a local member, to meet and interact with those businesses. Of course, at times they will also come to me as their local federal member to raise with me and seek assistance for matters to do with the migration system and a visa that an employee might have.The businesses that I interact with in my electorate are absolutely all doing the right thing. I want to start by thanking them for the fact that theyre employing people. In fact, theyre businesses that in some ways are so successful that they need to seek additional labour through the migration system. The economy has been so strong in the last few years, and the employment market has been so tight, that the migration system has been a very important avenue for them to access new employees so they can continue to grow their business. That means, of course, paying more tax to people like us, in the federal government, to fund the society that we live in. Were very lucky to have these employers, and I dont think the tenor of this debate should be some kind of assumption that every employer is seeking to exploit someone in their workforce, particularly those that are coming through the migration system.I fully acknowledge that there are a small proportion of employers that are doing the wrong thing, and this is legislation that appropriately strengthens and tightens the framework so that employers who are doing the wrong thing are properly held to account. We want everyone in the workforce, whether theyre an Australian citizen or working under a visa, to be working in an environment and under a framework that we legislate. Wherever there are examples of opportunities to make that system more robust, we should take them, and that opportunity exists in this legislation.The businesses that I work with and interact with in my electorate that are employing people are absolutely doing the right thing. In fact, they are bending over backwards to help the staff that they take on, particularly through the employer sponsored visa system, to not only earn an income but also benefit from the innovative programs these businesses have that support new migrants. The businesses do what they can to provide additional support well beyond the remuneration that the employees are provided by virtue of working in that business.One challenge in my home state of South Australia that I have spoken about repetitively in this chamber since I was first elected is that, in essence, we have a national migration scheme that is very much one size fits all. Theres not a lot of flexibility in it. Were setting policy that is trying to balance burgeoning major metropolises, like Sydney, Melbourne or even South-East Queensland, and regional and remote areas in my home state of South Australia and other states, which have quite different population problems and challenges. In the cities, the population has been growing far too rapidly and putting an enormous burden on the creaking infrastructure of those cities, and infrastructure investment has not kept pace with population growth. But weve got some communities in our country that have been depopulating for many decades and, indeed, have excess capacity in parts of their infrastructure because the population has been reducing. Thats the case particularly in agricultural communities, where efficiencies in agriculture have meant the unit labour required per hectare of farmed land has dramatically changed over the decades. Thats a good thing for productivity, but it has also demonstrated not only a challenge but an opportunity that our migration system hasnt properly taken advantage of.There are other jurisdictions—for example, Canada—where they have a much more differentiated approach to migration, which is very much geographic. The issue in this country is that even the schemes weve established, like the regional skilled migration scheme, have not been strictly required. People can apply to get a visa that purports to ultimately have them come and work and live in South Australia, and the South Australian state government might sponsor them through that regional skilled program, but, invariably, more often than not, that human capital ends up in the big cities like Sydney and Melbourne, so the principle of the scheme hasnt been strict enough and robust enough to ensure that the outcomes or the principles of the policy are being achieved in practical terms.The government has indicated that its undertaking this broad review of the migration system. Well, thats great. Although, having reviews of the migration system is a very common drumbeat across both sides of politics. It is really up to the government as to whether or not they want to look deeply and seriously at this population workforce imbalance and challenge that we have. Its not just geographic; its obviously in categories of work as well.It was very disappointing that the Labor Party were so opposed to our agriculture visa. We know that the union movement was very, very engaged in ensuring that that was the position of the now government. That was really disappointing because that was a huge opportunity for regional Australia in particular to have a dedicated visa channel for them to address the significant Labor shortages in regional areas and in particular industries in original areas. Unfortunately, the union movement went from embassy to embassy in the lead up to the election, telling those nations that were seeking to engage in bilateral agreements under that visa program not to dare consider signing up to that. That was a great loss to our economy and to regional businesses out there succeeding so much and trying to employ more people, grow their businesses and pay more taxes. That allows us to do a whole lot more for our society, as the federal and state governments benefit from it, too.But, regrettably, we have a situation where the union movement has been undermining those efforts, and thats a great shame. The union movement makes these claims, but I have certainly never met a business that has a preference to employ people through a sponsored migration scheme in lieu of an Australian. Thats just nonsensical. Theres obviously a much higher cost and a higher risk to a business to seek to employ someone by sponsoring their visa and meeting all that risk and cost if they could employ an Australian. The reality is that theyre attempting to but simply cannot find the workers in this country to take up those employment opportunities that those businesses have. If they dont avail themselves of the migration system, then the businesses will either not grow or, in some cases, shrink or shut down, because they cannot operate if they dont have a reliable, stable workforce. Then there are businesses growing their workforces or wanting to grow their workforces, and the migration system is obviously there to help them do that.We are a very proud migrant nation. Almost everyone in this chamber has a story or a connection to migration in some way, shape or form. Although, they would have addressed that before getting here under section 44 of the Constitution. Nonetheless, we all know that our migrant communities are thriving across this nation. As members of parliament, we love to engage in our multicultural communities. Migration has been a vitally important part of the Australian story, but, better still, it is going to be forevermore. We will always be a nation that has a level of migration. We are now, and well always be a great multicultural society into the future.But having an efficient migration system that is also making sure that the economic needs of our future workforce planning are met is going to be vitally important as well. We know, through all the projections, that if we dont have a migration system that is structured towards addressing those identified future pressures, let alone current pressures, we simply wont have the workforce that we need for the economy and the society that we want to have into the future.We support this bill through this chamber and obviously have no concern whatsoever in making sure that a stronger framework is in place to make sure that migrant workers are protected and given the protections that they rightly deserve: to be employed in conditions that follow the law of the land and that are the same conditions that anyone in this country should be employed under. We recognise that there is a uniqueness around the risk of exploitation of migrant workers, and so we welcome that as well.I conclude by reconfirming my comments at the beginning of this contribution, which are that that should not send a message that the vast majority of employers are doing anything short of the right thing by their workforce. Every business that Ive ever been involved in, and the businesses that I engage with in my electorate, see their workforce as their most important asset. Particularly in recent years, with such a tight employment market, businesses have been, more than ever before, doing so much in addition to the minimum to make sure that their workforce are well remunerated, satisfied and will have longevity in that business. When theyre employing people through the migration scheme, that has certainly also been my experience in my electorate.I welcome legislation that will crack down on bad actors and bad participants in this space but also commend the vast majority of businesses that are doing the right thing. I commend them for employing migrants, who add such richness to both our economy and our society. I look forward to supporting their future needs through a reformed migration system that is going to more appropriately fit those challenges that our economy is going to have into the future.","Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr STEVENS (Sturt) ","(16:33):"
300,0,0,0,1,1,"Chesters, Lisa MP",249710,"Bendigo","ALP","N/A",5749," There are a few facts in this debate on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill that I think are really important. The vast majority of employers are doing the right thing, unless of course you are a temporary migrant worker. Recently arrived migrant workers are 40 per cent more likely to be underpaid than long-term residents with the same skills or experiences. Thats what a recent Grattan report said. One in six recently arrived migrant workers are paid less than the legal minimum wage. Temporary visa holders make up four per cent of the workforce but in 2021-22 made up 26 per cent of all litigation initiated for breaches of the Fair Work Act. Thats what our own Fair Work Ombudsman Commission said—and theyre just the ones who came forward. Thats just the work that the government is doing. Lets not forget about the case of blueberry workers being paid about $3 an hour to pick blueberries because of piece rates that were ripping them off. Union after union, worker after worker, taskforce after taskforce has told this parliament and previous governments that not enough was being done to protect migrant workers.Lets just for a moment touch base on what has happened in the past decade, if not longer. First, those opposite, in government, said there wasnt a problem, that it was a few cases. Then, as more media reports came out, they accused the workers and the unions of causing trouble. It was only after their own taskforce started to expose the true underbelly and extent of the problem that they finally acknowledged that there was a problem. But, rather than meet it with action, what we saw from those opposite when they were in government was just more taskforces and more committees to tell us what everybody else had been telling them for so long, that we had a problem: recently arrived migrants, regardless of what visa they were brought here on, were being exploited. It happens in the Seasonal Worker Program, where it explicitly says in that program that these workers must be paid the award rates. We are seeing workers being paid less. Its not just in agriculture that we have these problems. Its happening in hospitality, in the hotel industry, in retail work and in accountancy. Its happening in a whole bunch of industries, and that is why reform is so necessary. It took the election of a Labor government for real reform and progress to be made on this issue.The Albanese Labor government is progressing a package of reforms to tackle the exploitation of all workers, including migrant workers, and the bills that are before us right now seek to implement the key recommendation from Professor Allan Felss Migrant Workers Taskforce report. I feel like Ive stood in this parliament and spoken about this report time and time again, so I am so proud and relieved to be able to stand here and say that we finally have a bill before us that addresses and implements key recommendations from Professor Allan Felss Migrant Workers Taskforce report. There are new criminal offences for using a persons migration status to exploit them in the workplace. This is recommendation No. 19 from the taskforces report. There is a new tool to prohibit employers engaging exploitative practices to be able to hire workers on temporary visas for a period of time. This is recommendation No. 20 from the taskforces report. This bill in fact goes further than the reports recommendations. There are higher penalties for those who do the wrong thing. The ABF will be receiving new compliance tools. We will repeal the part of the Migration Act that imposes a criminal penalty on workers who breach their visa conditions—effectively, criminalising them for speaking up. Can you believe it is actually a part of the Migration Act, currently, to criminalise people for speaking up about breaching their conditions when, in many cases, these workers were being forced to breach their own visa conditions?This bill is one part of the Albanese Labor governments plan to protect workers. In the 2023-24 budget, the government provided $50 million to Australian Border Force over four years to help address and tackle the challenges that were seeing. For the first time in a long time, the government is raising awareness about employer obligations and actually getting out and visiting the businesses in a substantive way to talk to them about their obligations. There are some employers who engaged labour hire who say they didnt know. Now they will know, and now they will have a responsibility. It became part of the business model that was supersized under the previous government: you use a labour hire company to outsource your obligations to these workers. We heard shocking stories—and, unfortunately, we continue to hear them today—about workers who get paid but then have deducted from their pay exorbitant fees for transport, accommodation and uniforms. In some cases, people had money deducted for things that they hadnt actually received. All of these methods were being used by unscrupulous employers, quite often labour hire companies, to exploit temporary migrant workers. We should thank temporary migrant workers. We are privileged to have them come to this country. We all know about the labour shortages in the industries that I have raised and others. We should be grateful and thankful that these workers choose to come to Australia to work, when they could work in so many other places, because we simply dont have the local workers to actually do the job. Yet, rather than thanking them, supporting them and paying them what theyre worth, companies have exploited them.One of the industries that has had lots of issues is the meatworks industry. We have seen labour hire companies recruit workers—international students and people who are here as backpackers—and pay them less than other workers. There is other legislation that this parliament may consider in the future which will look at the same job, same pay legislation and which will look at saying that labour hire workers should be paid the same or equal rates as other workers. Whilst that addresses another loophole, what this legislation does is look at the loophole and the challenges where migrant workers are paid much less—another example of why.The United Workers Union, which represents quite a number of farm workers, recently surveyed about a thousand workers in the lead-up to a submission that they had to the National Agricultural Workforce Strategy. Their findings reflect what weve been continually hearing for the past decade. They found that 32 per cent of workers surveyed experience dangerous and unsafe workloads. Twenty-seven per cent reported that they did not have access to toilets or efficient drinking water. They found that 32 per cent of workers were threatened by a contractor for making a complaint about wages and conditions. Sixty-three per cent of workers said that they were being underpaid. Forty-four per cent reported that they were being paid in cash. The fact that we still have workers being paid in cash demonstrates just how big the problem is.Another survey that was undertaken by the union in 2019 found that the average hourly rate for horticultural workers that were surveyed was $14.80 before tax. Thats well below the casual minimum wage and well below the full-time minimum wage. This is what is going on and this is why we need action to address it. Piece rates, subcontracting, the ridiculous rates that theyre being charged for accommodation and the extra costs that are imposed on them for transport are all ways in which these migrant workers are being exploited, on our watch here in parliament.That is why Im so proud to be part of a government that is doing something about it, that isnt just setting up another taskforce blaming somebody else. Quite often what was happening under the previous government with these cases was the blaming of the very people being exploited for speaking up. I want to take a moment to acknowledge the bravery of those migrant workers, many of whom are here on temporary arrangements, for speaking up, as well as their unions—the AWU, the former NWU, now the UWU, and the SDA—for the way in which theyve spoken up. Its a big thing for a worker to speak up about being exploited in the workplace. Its an even bigger thing for a migrant worker, who risks losing their visa, to speak up.Some of the specifics in this bill are that a new criminal employer sanction will be introduced. Prohibiting employers and individuals from hiring future workers on temporary visas will be introduced. Aligning and increasing penalties for work-related breaches are part of this bill. Part 4 is enforcing an undertaking for work-related breaches. There are compliance notices for work-related breaches and a number of other amendments that will ensure that people working here on temporary visas are given a fair go and treated with respect.Its disappointing that its taken a Labor government for this to be enacted. Treating people with respect in the workplace should be core business for all of us. Making sure that all workers, regardless of visa status, are paid the minimum wage should be the responsibility of all of us, not just because of the election of a Labor government. It is disappointing that it has taken so long—over a decade—for there to be real action. At the same time, Im really proud to be part of a government that is acting on behalf of temporary migrant workers whove come here to earn a decent living and to help us with some of our challenges that we have with our workforce—that it is our government that is doing the work.I would also like to acknowledge the Migrant Workers Centre in Melbourne thats part of the Trades Hall that has long advocated for change to the awful situation that migrant workers are in, because their visa status is quite often held over them. I would also like to mention the work that the Migrant Resource Centre have done in this place, and all the other civil society and community organisations that have supported migrant workers when they find themselves in situations of horrible exploitation. This is a horrible stain that we have on Australian workplace history, and it is good to see action finally happening.As previous speakers on this side have mentioned, not only will we tackle the exploitation of migrant workers and ensure they get paid the same as other workers; well also help other workers to ensure their wages and conditions are not undercut. If you have the exploitation of migrant workers as part of your business model and you are able to pay them so much less than other workers who are either Australian citizens or permanent residents, then it puts pressure on everybody. It means their labour, because it is cheaper, becomes the labour of choice, and thats what we need to avoid. I encourage all of those in this place to consider this bill and to vote for it. It is long overdue, it is action thats required, it implements key recommendations from Professor Allan Fels Migrant Workers Taskforce report and it is great to see it finally happening.","Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CHESTERS (Bendigo) ","(16:47):"
301,0,0,0,1,1,"Ware, Jenny MP",300123,"Hughes","LP","N/A",5751," I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023, and I do support this bill in principle. The bill seeks to amend the Migration Act 1958 to strengthen employer compliance measures in relation to protecting temporary migrant workers from exploitation. The latest figures available reveal that on average there around 1.6 million temporary visa holders with a full or partial right to work in Australia each year. Obviously many of us speak in this place regularly about the importance of immigrants and migrants into Australia not just for economic reasons but also because they have built our society and will continue to do so. Our economy, our businesses and our country rely heavily upon temporary migrant workers to fill shortages within our existing labour market and increase the overall productivity of Australia. Our industrial relations system should be flexible, it should be diverse and it should definitely protect all workers, including temporary migrant workers.Although this is not the driving purpose of the temporary work regime, many temporary migrant workers decide to pursue full Australian citizenship through legitimate means available to them through immigration policies. When I attend ceremonies at my local councils, Liverpool city and Sutherland shire, it is always a pleasure to meet and welcome many of our newest Australians from all around our globe, many of whom started their Australian journey as temporary migrant workers. The work performed by temporary migrants is important. It is valued by employers and Australians overall. Temporary migrant workers have predominantly worked in the areas of agriculture, food production and meat processing, but theyve also been required, when our economy has needed it and individual employers have needed it, in a full range of various goods and services across our economy.Employers value employees as a rule. However, no system is perfect, and temporary migrant workers can be at risk of exploitation. This bill seeks to implement recommendations of the former coalition governments 2019 report of the Migrant Workers Taskforce, and I think its important to remember the taskforce was established in 2016 under a coalition government to identify proposals for improvements in the law, law enforcement and investigation and other practical measures to identify and rectify cases of migrant worker exploitation. The taskforce was chaired by Professor Allan Fels and included members from a wide variety of government agencies. The report made 22 recommendations in total, and the coalition while still in government accepted in principle all 22 recommendations. The stated purpose of this bill is to implement particularly recommendations 19 and 20 of the taskforces report. This bill includes some measures contained in the Migration Amendment (Protecting Migrant Workers) Bill 2021. So this was work which was commenced under the former coalition government.In particular the bill introduces criminal offences for employers who coerce temporary migrant workers into working in breach of their visa conditions and establishes a mechanism to prevent such employers from employing additional migrant workers for a period of time. These protections are appropriate. I do support these protections. I support this bill. However, this does not in any way mean that I am saying that the vast majority of employers, or indeed a very large minority of employers, exploit their temporary workers. The bill also provides measures to deter employers from exploiting temporary migrant workers, including mechanisms to encourage voluntary compliance and increase penalties for breaches of relevant workplace laws. There are also amendments introduced to remove some of the disincentives for temporary migrant workers to report exploitation where currently they may fear that their visa status would be in jeopardy if they did so. These all are appropriate measures.Temporary migrant workers form a very important part of our national economy and workforce. Overall, they are valued and supported by their employers. It is appropriate that these workers are afforded the full legal protections to guard against some opportunities that may exist for exploitation. Migrants, including temporary migrants, have helped to build our country and will continue to do so into the future. Our industrial relations system should be flexible and diverse and include protections for all of our employees, including temporary migrant workers. Temporary migrant workers and having a viable and diverse workplace allow businesses to adjust their individual workforces when needed to meet the inevitable ebbs and flows in demand for goods and services across the country. We live in a global society. We operate in a global commercial world. Most of our employers are honourable and really do look after all their workers, but it is appropriate that safeguards are put in place, particularly for temporary migrant workers. And for those reasons, I commend this bill to the House.","Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WARE (Hughes) ","(17:00):"
302,0,0,0,1,1,"Perrett, Graham Douglas MP","HVP","Moreton","ALP","N/A",5752," Too often in the media we see stories of migrants being exploited in workplaces right around Australia. There are tales of unscrupulous employers misusing a visa condition to coerce a migrant worker into not complaining about either their working conditions or, even worse, underpayment or other things. Moreton has significant Filipino, Taiwanese, Pasifika and Korean communities. Many of these young people end up working in the agricultural sector or the hospitality sector while theyre in Australia. Most have fun and make some money. Some are exploited. A few years ago, I travelled with diplomatic representatives from these countries up to Bundaberg and then west to Lockyer Valley, and we interviewed some of these fun-loving farm workers from these countries to see how they were being treated. Sadly, both then and now, there are numerous cases of workers not being paid what theyre legally entitled to be paid. Often, it is a subcontractor and middle people who are doing the exploitation. Unfortunately, the neer-do-wells often speak the same language as the person theyre exploiting. We even hear of migrant workers being silenced after being sexually assaulted.All sensible members on both sides of the chamber would agree that such behaviour must stop, and I note the contributions from those on the other side prior to my addressing this bill. This is where the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023 before the chamber will make a difference. The Albanese Labor government is taking action through addressing the recommendations made in the report of the Migrant Workers Taskforce led by Professor Allan Fels, which was handed down in 2019. No-one would be surprised that, even though the coalition government accepted in principle the recommendations of the taskforce—you guessed it—there was no follow-through. There was no implementation of any of the recommendations. It is another example of how the LNP is all about the announcement but hopeless when it comes to follow-through, unable or unwilling to put in the hard work needed to deliver something.There is clear evidence of the systemic nature of exploitation in Australias labour market. Unscrupulous employers and facilitators have misused visa rules to exploit workers. According to a recent report by the Grattan Institute, up to one in six recent migrants are paid below the minimum wage. Another report, from Unions NSW, found that more than one in five workers are paid a lower salary because of their visa status or nationality. So its not just a bad apple or two. Remember: if 20 per cent of the market is undercutting good employers, they set the tone for a race to the bottom. Those good farmers intent on doing the right thing are punished by those down the road doing the wrong thing.The Albanese government is particularly concerned about the vulnerability of people who hold temporary visas. We have heard of wage theft, sham contracting, threats of a phone call to Australian Border Force, empty promises of permanent residency, and stories of people having their passports locked away or being sexually harassed and sexually assaulted. Obviously, this behaviour needs to stop. These actions dont just harm migrant workers; they also damage our international reputation. These workers go back, normally, and become ambassadors of bad. They tell everyone of their exploitation and damage our international standing.For those industries that require a migrant workforce—especially seasonal picking, where youve got to get to work when things are on the vine and ready to go—it means that those jobs wont get filled; migrants simply wont come to Australia, because of the horrors that theyve heard from those ambassadors of bad. Again, this has effects on not only those migrant workers but the broader Australian economy. As the saying goes, one drop of lemon juice can spoil gallons of milk. Therefore, these bad actors need to be stopped.Our government is amending the Migration Act 1958 to (1) establish new criminal offences and associated civil penalties to deter employers from using a visa condition or status to coerce, unduly influence or unduly pressure someone in the workplace, (2) establish a new mechanism to prohibit an employer from hiring any additional people on temporary visas for a period of time, (3) increase the maximum criminal and civil penalties for all current and proposed work related offences and provisions in the Migration Act, (4) create additional tools for the Australian Border Force to address employer compliance, (5) repeal section 235 of the Migration Act, which makes it a criminal offence to breach a work related visa condition, and (6) revise the regulation-making power in the Migration Act to ensure worker exploitation must be taken into consideration for all visa cancellation decisions.Through the amendments in this bill, the government is delivering on its response to two key recommendations made in the report of the Migrant Workers Taskforce. Recommendation 19 reads:It is recommended that the Government consider developing legislation so that a person who knowingly unduly influences, pressures or coerces a temporary migrant worker to breach a condition of their visa is guilty of an offence.Thats a good warning. Recommendation 20 reads:It is recommended that the Government explore mechanisms to exclude employers who have been convicted by a court of underpaying temporary migrant workers from employing new temporary visa holders for a specific period.Establishing these criminal penalties will help deter those employers seeking to exploit vulnerable workers. There needs to be serious criminal consequences for this poor behaviour. A simple financial penalty on its own isnt a big enough deterrent. The perpetrators will balance a fine against the benefits that come from the suppression of wages and conditions in their workplaces through exploitation, so there needs to be criminal repercussions and also bans. The crooks shouldnt be able to access the workforce theyve been found guilty of exploiting. This will help change behaviour and make the rogues think twice before going down that road.Well also remove section 235, which is the tool used to threaten migrant workers to exploit and coerce them under the Migration Act. This section makes it a criminal offence to break a work related visa condition, which deters workers from speaking up about their exploitative work environment for fear of criminal sanctions.Some of those opposite will bleat about how this is a weakening of the Migration Act. I havent heard any yet; hopefully Ill be disappointed. Obviously Im talking about a party who are happy to jump in front of a camera or to post on social media about how theyre horrified by the treatment of migrant workers, but when it came to actually doing anything to stop it they sat on their hands and effectively did nothing. Why should we be surprised, when this is the party who had suppression of wages at the core of their economic policies? Do you remember their spokesperson detailing that? At the core of their economic policies was the suppression of wages. So why would they want to stop unscrupulous employers from helping them achieve their stated economic goal? They talked the talk but didnt walk the walk.The media have reported lots of transgressions, but, sadly, no convictions have been recorded against this part of the Migration Act, or for any serious breaches of a migrant visa. Visa cancellation powers still remain. So the bill carefully extends the new prohibition power to include breaches of the Fair Work Act and the Migration Act. This will ensure that workplace relations law and migration law are working together to protect workers and penalise those employers who do not abide by the law. This includes breaches of compliance notices and enforceable undertakings. Triggers will include remuneration-related noncompliance, but they also extend to other forms of exploitation, recognising the corrosive behaviour of some unscrupulous employers. And it will be a criminal offence where prohibited employers have been found to have employed an additional worker on a temporary visa whilst prohibited.We need to make sure that the new provisions of prohibiting employers from employing migrant workers are enforced and that actions taken in breaking the law will also lead to a criminal offence. The decision to prohibit will be a decision for the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs or the Minister for Home Affairs, or obviously it can be delegated to a relevant decision-maker. I understand that Minister Giles is consulting and collaborating on how the Fair Work Ombudsman can play a constructive role in this process. This will include considering extenuating circumstances outlined by an employer, such as the impact the prohibition would have on the ongoing viability of the business and how that might impact on existing workers and the broader community.This is a significant measure. In industries where exploitation is particularly widespread, such as accommodation, food services, cleaning and construction, this is a necessary step to show that we can tackle exploitation where it is most prevalent. This bill will see additional powers given to Australian Border Force and an increase in penalties under the Migration Act. Maximum penalties for work-related breaches will be almost triple, with civil penalties of up to $99,000 for individuals and $495,000 for bodies corporate. In addition, Australian Border Force will gain a new compliance notice and enforceable undertaking powers.These measures are designed to drive employer compliance under the Migration Act, which, sadly, has been deprioritised over the past decade. To assist the Australian Border Force in doing that, they will receive $50 million over the next four years to improve employer compliance as well as other immigration compliance priorities. Were also looking at measures outside of this bill to tackle the exploitation of people on temporary visas. The Albanese government is engaging with civil society, unions, industry and others on complementing measures to help people speak up about any exploitation that occurs in their workforce. This includes exploring what a whistleblower visa could look like and how the government can implement a firewall between the employment regulator and the Department of Home Affairs. We dont want to see our reputation as a leader in workplace rights and conditions continue to be tarnished by unscrupulous employers or their middle operators—the people who deliberately take advantage of migrant workers. As I pointed out, often they speak the same language as the person theyre exploiting.The Albanese government is making sure that we stop these poor behaviours. We want these people to face serious criminal consequences, and some of the tools they use to coerce and exploit will be removed. I commend this legislation to the House.","Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PERRETT (Moreton) ","(17:07):"
303,0,0,0,1,1,"Neumann, Shayne Kenneth MP","HVO","Blair","ALP","N/A",5754," I am pleased to speak on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023. If ever there was an example of an issue which demonstrates the importance of the role of the trade union movement, it is this one. I want to pay tribute to a number of trade unions who have been at the forefront of advocacy for this type of legislation and bringing to the publics attention the shocking and egregious exploitation of migrant workers. The SDA, the TWU, the AWU, the AMWU and other unions have been at the forefront of the campaign for better working conditions for migrant workers, urging the previous government to take action in relation to the egregious exploitation of those workers. When I was the shadow minister for immigration and border protection, I visited places of work and held forums in places like my home town of Ipswich, where metal workers were being exploited. I spoke with hospitality workers in Melbourne and farm workers in Bendigo. I want to pay tribute to the member for Bendigo, who has been at the forefront of the campaign on this issue for such a long time.This legislation is long overdue. Those opposite have had 1,100 days in office yet have done nothing meaningful for migrant workers. Between 7 March 2019 and 10 April 2022, 1,100 days passed, during which the Morrison government did nothing meaningful for migrant workers. Why are those dates important? On 7 March 2019, not only was the Migrant Workers Taskforce report released but also the governments response was released. The Morrison government responded glibly, without giving the report the respect it deserved, and then failed to implement its recommendations.On 10 April 2022 happens to be the day the then Prime Minister, the member for Cook, paraded off down to the Governor-General—not to give himself yet another ministry, I might add—to call the federal election. So 1,100 days passed with nothing meaningful done. To demonstrate the abject dithering and delay of the former government, do you know who tabled the governments response to the Migrant Workers Taskforce report? It was the former member for Higgins, Kelly ODwyer. That was a couple of members for Higgins ago. Not only did a whole parliamentary term go by while the Morrison government did nothing meaningful, but two members for Higgins came and went. The irony is that the current Labor member for Higgins came into this place by way of a skilled migration program. As such, I know she recognises the struggles of migrant workers to make their way in Australia. Having arrived in Australia in 1984 with her parents from the UK via Zambia, the current member for Higginss father qualified for skilled migration to this country as an accountant.There has been dithering and delay, and that is why this legislation is absolutely important. The member for Moreton aptly gave figures from the Grattan Institute and from other reports, including from Unions NSW, of the shocking exploitation of migrant workers, and this shames this country. It shames Australia internationally when people who come to this country get exploited. There is sexual exploitation, wage theft—workplace conditions that none of us would find acceptable. It shames our country, and it was ignored by the previous government. There was so much in migration that we needed to do.I want to pay tribute to Professor Allan Fels AO and Dr David Cousins AM. They were the co-chairs of the Migrant Workers Taskforce and they put it best:Wage exploitation of temporary migrants offends our national values of fairness. It harms not only the employees involved, but also the businesses which do the right thing.It means that businesses who do the right thing by their workers get punished and they themselves get exploited. Workers get exploited in their workplace and the businesses who do the right thing get exploited. It puts at risk the workers who work for good bosses and puts good employers at risk as well. Dont forget that the temporary skilled migration income threshold, the TSMIT, which was the basis on which someone had to come to this country and not be paid less than nearly $54,000, had not changed from 2013 onwards. The previous government didnt change it.We got in—we increased it to $75,000 per year. The reason for that was the previous government had a deliberate design feature—an aspect of their core belief was to drive down wages. So, unintentionally, unwittingly, I think, they were helping the exploitation, weirdly enough. I dont believe they genuinely meant it; I really dont. But by their policies they were inadvertently aiding and abetting what was happening in exploitation, and that is not good enough. I dont believe those opposite have those views generally—I do not believe it. But their failure to take action meant that the exploitation continued, whether it was in Bendigo or Melbourne or Ipswich, and that is what happened. It is simply not good enough.There were many stakeholders who came to that report for the Migrant Workers Taskforce—the ACTU, Chamber of Commerce and Industry, recruitment and consulting services, the National Roundtable on Human Trafficking and Slavery, the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Industry Group. There is a 140 page report—Ive read it. Its a comprehensive report. The previous government did three pages of response, barely acknowledging, tokenistic and patronising in many respects. There was more than two years of painstaking evidence gathering on the exploitation of vulnerable workers. I think Professor Fels and Dr Cousins would have great grounds to feel dismayed and disappointed. Its very clear there was systemic exploitation in our labour market, and it was hiding in plain sight. There were many companies—and I wont name them all—that Australians deal with each and every day who have attracted adverse media attention for their employment arrangements. Those are companies that people might go and get a coffee or a donut at, they might be getting their petrol from them, and they are exploiting workers. These are well-known brands throughout Australia. Its simply not good enough. We need to do everything we can to prevent the exploitation of workers through the entire value chain.Recently, another case came up before the Federal Court on behalf of four migrant workers in the SDA—the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association—alleging that a franchisee had failed to pay for the all time they worked, failed to pay overtime and correct penalty rates, operated a cashback system, misclassified workers, denied pay entitlement, and breached payslip and recordkeeping requirements. This resulted in workers not being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars. Effectively, in the end, when they did all the calculations, it totalled $1 million in underpayments. They sought penalties against the franchisee and the franchiser for breaching the Fair Work Act. That stuff is all too common.We had the Retail Supply Chain Alliance, comprising the SDA, the TWU and the AWU, making recommendations to the Senate inquiry, and there will be many inquiries in this place—in this House and elsewhere. Its not just the Fels and Cousins inquiry—the Senate inquiry recommended important changes as well. The Retail Supply Chain Alliance, consisting of the SDA, TWU and AWU, made a very good submission to the Senate inquiry about the unlawful underpayment of employees remuneration to ward off ongoing exploitation. There were many recommendations about making sure there was a visa system works, and we are taking action here. One of the most important things we did was to slash the visa backlog processing times, improving it with 500 extra workers, having a national labour hire regulatory scheme, better licensing arrangements and more funding. These are some of the things we had taken up.This bill in particular is very important because it makes it a criminal offence to coerce someone into breaching their visa conditions—a key recommendation from Fels and Cousins. Why was it so difficult for the previous government to do that? There was no excuse. Its not like they had a huge legislative agenda that we were dealing with every single time we came to this place. We had 1,100 days and two members for Higgins, and they still couldnt bring themselves to bring it in. They brought it into the chamber but did not debate or pass it—Labor would have supported it, theres no doubt about that whatsoever—but they wouldnt do it. We need to make sure that we do it, and thats why this legislation is picking up those recommendations. The forms of exploitation the taskforce found were many, and I commend people who might be listening to look at it: unfair dismissal, unpaid training, working conditions that are unsafe, upfront payment deposit, pressure of working beyond the restrictions of a visa. There were many things that were egregious and appalling.Under this legislation it will be an offence to use a workers visa status or a future work related visa requirement to coerce or unduly pressure a person into accepting an exploitative work arrangement. This was an election commitment we made to help remove barriers that stopped exploited temporary migrant workers from speaking out and seeking support. Were keeping our word, to deliver outcomes for migrant workers, and through them to improve wages and conditions for all workers. Thats why we increased the TSMIT.This bill includes further important measures such as: where an employer has been convicted for underpaying migrant workers, that employer will be unable to employ migrant workers for a specified period of time, closing a loophole in our migration system. This prohibition is necessary to protect workers from employers who engage in serious, deliberate or repeated noncompliance with their obligations. Were publishing information about this. Thats important for transparency so that workers actually know who the good bosses and bad bosses are. Everyone working in this country is entitled to protection from exploitation, including those on temporary visas. Were committed to making sure that wages and conditions improve for everyone, by stopping exploitation by unscrupulous employers. Were committed to the principles of natural justice, or procedural fairness, and decision-making based on factual evidence—a long-established approach to responsible government which seems to have eluded those opposite when it came to this issue for most of the last decade.The bill provides that an employer can be declared prohibited—that is, the decision-maker must give the employer a written notice, and that notice must state the decision-maker proposes to make a declaration and provide the reasons for doing so. The notice must invite the employer to make a written submission setting out reasons why the decision should be made—procedural fairness; natural justice. The employer will have the opportunity to set out extenuating circumstances, which must be considered in decision-making.For penalties to act as a deterrent, they must be set at a level that actually deters people from offending. The bill does just that, by increasing the penalties for unscrupulous employers misusing migration programs. This reflects the significant damage that employers whove done the wrong thing can do to public confidence in our migration system and to our national prestige and honour.A key element of this bill is to repeal the offence currently set out in section 235 of the Migration Act 1958. That section makes it a criminal offence for a visa holder to work in breach of a work related visa condition or for an unlawful noncitizen to work at all. This offence has undermined the ability of workers on temporary visas to have recourse to their rights under certain workplace laws, such as workers compensation laws, and weve removed that barrier to justice.Migrant workers should have the confidence to speak out and seek help without fear of visa cancellation, and the measures in this bill support those aims. Specifically, the commitment between the Department of Home Affairs and of the Fair Work Ombudsman known as the insurance protocol will be reformed. The protocol encompasses that a worker who holds a temporary visa will not have their visa cancelled for breaching a work-related visa condition if certain criteria are met. Stakeholders have told the government that the protocol is too secretive to instil the necessary trust and confidence. They dont trust it, because its not transparent and its not legislated. The bill will allow the government to make regulations to legislate the protections that are currently only available under government policy.This government will work alongside industry and community groups, unions, civil societies, lawyers, researchers and other experts to examine protections available to workers on temporary visas and encourage them to speak out when they face exploitation at work. This government recognises the important role of the Australian Border Force in compliance and enforcement. For those employers who choose to do the wrong thing, beware: the ABF, and the law, will catch up with you. In the recent budget, this government increased funding for immigration compliance. Those who misbehave, do the wrong thing or exploit workers will be penalised.The Albanese Labor government will continue to work together with the community and industry groups across the country towards eliminating the exploitation of migrant workers. In turn, this will improve wages and conditions for all workers. Thats something that any Labor government can be proud of. Its something that every government in this country should always be proud of. Even a coalition government should learn their lessons from the last nine years. I commend the bill to the House.","Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr NEUMANN (Blair) ","(17:19):"
304,0,0,0,1,1,"Fernando, Cassandra MP",299964,"Holt","ALP","N/A",5756," I rise to speak on a matter of great importance, a piece of legislation that will shape the future of our nation, the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023. As elected representatives of our communities, we have the responsibility to uphold the values that define Australia: a fair go for all, compassion for those in need and a commitment to social justice. This is exactly what this bill is about. It addresses some key recommendations from Professor Allan Felss 2019 Migrant Workers Taskforce report as well as further measures to tackle migrant worker exploitation.I want to be clear from the outset that this bill is not about raising barriers or slamming shut the doors for opportunities for those seeking a better life in our country. It is about ensuring that our immigration system operates with dignity, fairness and transparency—values that we hold dear as Australians. Migration has long been an essential thread in the tapestry of our nations history. It is the story of diverse cultures, of dreams realised, of aspirations achieved. Our society has been enriched immeasurably by the contribution of migrants who have chosen to call Australia home. They have brought with them knowledge, skills and traditions that have helped shape our country into what it is today: a vibrant, multicultural and dynamic nation. I know this because my family has been just one of many migrant families to call this land our home and to contribute to this community through work, volunteering and being law-abiding citizens.I also know that one in six recent migrant workers is paid less than the minimum wage. The negative flow-on effects from this affect all of us. It ultimately drives down wages and conditions for all workers as businesses seek to compete under these conditions. In one of my very first jobs, I experienced attempted wage theft through unpaid super contributions I discovered. Whilst I was lucky enough to migrate to Australia as a child, I do not doubt that this employer sought to take advantage of my youth and background to try and pull the wool over my eyes.I commend this bill for its commitment to strengthening employer compliance in our immigration system. The establishment of new criminal offences and relevant civil penalties is designed to deter employers from using a workers visa status as a negotiating tactic to lower their wages and conditions. This bill will increase the maximum penalty under the Migration Act for work related breaches, with civil penalties of up to $99,000 for individuals and $495,000 for a body corporate. Further to this, the Australian Border Force will gain new compliance and enforceable undertaking powers; $50 million will be invested in the ABF over the next four years to assist their actions to improve employer compliance alongside several other immigration compliance priorities. In fact, the ABF just oversaw a month of action in July expertly targeting those employers who were suspected of doing the wrong thing.For the first time in a long time, the shift in emphasis on ensuring employers are aware of their obligation is deliberate. It is Albanese Labor government policy. None of this vital work would have been possible without the increase in funding and the emphasis we are placing on tackling worker exploitation. Whether it is migrant or Australian worker exploitation, we strongly believe it should be eradicated across the board. It has no place in our great country. Going forward, the Albanese government is engaging in extensive discussion with civil society, industry and unions around methods to help inform and design further safeguards in the visa system.We must make it as safe as possible for migrant workers to speak up when they or their colleagues have been exploited in the workplace. This government knows the anxiety and stress many migrant workers go through when faced with either working in terrible conditions or alerting authorities and subsequently risking losing their visa. Thats why weve taken the steps in this bill to remove section 235 of the Migration Act, which currently makes it a criminal offence to breach a work related visa condition. Currently, this section of the act deters workers from speaking up about poor pay and conditions, because they then fear the larger problem of criminal sanctions. Perversely, some employers count on this deterrent so that they can exploit migrant workers. The removal of this section simply means that migrant workers who are being exploited through no fault of their own will be empowered to alert authorities to this so that it can be rectified.Let me be clear: this does not weaken the act in any way. There have been no convictions recorded against this part of the Migration Act, and the governments extensive visa cancellation powers remain in place, as they should. The very fact that there have been no convictions recorded against this section of the act shows that its only current purpose is to deter migrant workers from raising their voices. Its removal will not weaken our migration framework, only make it more efficient.The heart of this legislation lies in protecting the rights of migrant workers who journey to our shores seeking a fair go and a chance to build a better future. Let us not forget that these are individuals with families, hopes and dreams, just like any other Australian, yet regrettably we have witnessed instances of exploitation, wage theft and unfair working conditions faced by some migrant workers. This cannot be tolerated in a society that prides itself on compassion and the idea of a fair go for all. This bill sends a powerful message: Australia stands firmly against any form of exploitation and is committed to protecting the vulnerable. This legislation proposes empowering our immigration authorities to be proactive in holding employers accountable for their actions. Stricter penalties will act as a strong deterrent against those who would seek to take advantage of vulnerable workers while providing incentives for employers to embrace fair and ethical practices.Critics may argue that these measures could discourage employers from hiring migrant workers, but this would only be the case if those employers were seeking to manipulate the conditions of migrant workers. For employers already doing the right thing, this bill will do nothing but help level the playing field so all employers do the right thing, unless they want to risk real penalties. Australian employers have always risen to the challenges presented to them, and they will continue to do so while recognising that their success lies in treating their workforce with respect and dignity.Furthermore, let us not forget the importance of putting Australian workers first. The governments commitment to our citizens does not negate the recognition of the contribution of migrant workers to our society. By prioritising Australian workers for job opportunities we ensure that our people have access to meaningful employment and are not displaced in their homeland. Some may seek to misread our intentions, but the truth is we believe in maintaining a balanced approach to migration, one that safeguards the interests of both Australian workers and those who come to our shores seeking a better life.Australia has always been a land of opportunity, and we must ensure that these opportunities are accessible to all, regardless of their background. To achieve this we must streamline the visa application process and facilitate cooperation between the Department of Home Affairs and the Fair Work Ombudsman. A collaborative approach between these agencies will ensure that the path to compliance is clear, straightforward and accessible to both workers and employers.We must also address the question of exploitation that occurs within sectors that rely heavily on temporary migrant labour in agriculture, hospitality and other industries. Migrant workers often find themselves vulnerable to dishonest employers. This bill seeks to provide additional protections for those workers and ensures that their contributions are recognised, valued and rewarded fairly.It is essential to remember that this legislation is not just about words on paper. It is about values we hold dear—the values that have shaped our great nation, like fairness, compassion and respect. This bill is a tangible manifestation of these values—a testament to our commitment to building a better, fairer and more prosperous Australia for all.I call upon all members of this place to support this bill, to embrace the ideals that define us as a nation, to stand united against exploitation and unfairness and to show the world that Australia remains a beacon of hope and opportunity. Let us move forward, building a path that reflects the very essence of our identity as Australians—a diverse, compassionate and fair society that celebrates the richness that migration brings to our shores.","Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms FERNANDO (Holt) ","(17:34):"
305,0,0,0,1,1,"Burnell, Matt MP",300129,"Spence","ALP","N/A",5758," It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak in favour of the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023. I would like to acknowledge the fantastic contribution to this debate from my good friend just now, the member for Holt. Our parliament is so much richer for having you here. This is an important additional step that the Albanese Labor government is taking toward ensuring that all workers that work in Australia can be free from being exploited by unscrupulous employers—and they do exist out there.Protecting the vulnerable and protecting workers is deeply embedded in the DNA of members of the Australian Labor Party. This is true of those within the parliamentary Labor Party and of the broader membership. The most eye-opening statistic amongst many worthy contenders is that up to one in six migrants are paid less than the minimum wage. This does not exist in isolation. Migrant workers being paid less than the minimum wage affects all workers. For, when employers think theyve found a way to pay any kind of worker less than what is set at the base level and when left unchecked, it brings down the minimum standards for all of us, in not just wages but conditions too—unless mechanisms exist in law to deter and punish this kind of behaviour.In fact, recent migrants are 40 per cent more likely to be underpaid than long-term residents who have the same level of skills and experience and who are doing the same job. Temporary visa holders comprise four per cent of our total workforce in Australia, but, within the 2021-22 year, migrant workers made up 26 per cent of all litigation initiated for breaching the Fair Work Act.On the eve of the Australian Labor Partys National Conference in a few short weeks, I look back to our national platform that was endorsed back in 2021, where the section that is quite germane to this bill reads as follows:Temporary overseas workers are vulnerable to exploitation and this exploitation affects those workers and all Australian workers by undermining their wages and conditions. Labor will ensure that migrant workers including temporary visa workers have access to adequate information on their workplace rights and how to join their union.Another pertinent section reads:Too often, temporary migrants end up exploited or underpaid with some employers abusing the system for cheap and disposable labour. Labor will always ensure that measures are implemented to protect all migrants from exploitation, including:requiring temporary migrants to be paid in accordance with Australian awards or enterprise agreements and to have their wages paid into an Australian bank account;ensuring temporary migrants are protected by Australian workplace law and are not exploited through sham contracting or unethical labour hire practices give them; andoffering them whistle-blower status if they are providing evidence of exploitation.This will be my first national conference as a member of this place and a member of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. There is a feeling of pride in making a contribution on legislation like this or any of the multitude of measures this government has introduced in this 47th Parliament that moves the dial closer to parity between employees and employers. In this instance, the pride I feel boils down to being part of supporting legislation in this place that accomplishes the parts of our platform that I mentioned earlier. And why might that be? Because, as I said earlier, it is in Labors DNA to stand up for workers.Further to this point, if one were to use private members business as a litmus test for this theory and to seek the sheer extent of contrast from those opposite, I saw two motions last week. One was moved by the member for Holt on this exact issue, combating the exploitation of migrant workers in Australia. For the most part, it was an extremely gracious debate where we broke bread and agreed that a problem existed. Many anecdotes of exploitative practices that were aired were utterly reprehensible and observing of sanction, and we look forward to real action to combat this. Then we had the member for Sturt laying blame at the feet of the union movement. He couldnt imagine a world where any small-business owner might be tempted to engage a temporary migrant employee contrary to our industrial laws. The member for Sturt even went so far as to say the union movements ultimate goal is to constrict migration. How does that stack up when key members of the oppositions brain trust, namely the Leader of the Opposition himself and the member for Hinkler, have criticised the government for letting migration levels rise to a slightly lower level than what they, when in government, modelled would occur prior to closing the borders at the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic.Their criticism can only mean they are advocating for the pandemic-era border closures—but, of course, Labor and unions are against migrant workers. Frankly, from now on, I am hoping those opposite do an appropriate amount of warm-up stretches before engaging in debate on immigration or industrial relations, because the flexibility they must possess to somehow occupy both sides of this argument and blame Labor is quite impressive. If I were a high school debating adjudicator, I would be awarding some pretty high marks for that effort, but its just a game to some of them. On our side of the chamber, it is anything but. As those opposite point out until blue in the face, we are full of ex-union officials, me being one of them. We have seen what exploitative workplace practices can look like in the real world and their effects on workers, not only on their hip pocket but also their self-esteem and mental health.It doesnt matter where you were born or what conditions someone has to work in in Australia; if you are working here, you deserve the full complement of workplace rights as everyone else. Allowing the derogation of workers rights, conditions, entitlements, and minimum standards of our domestic workforce will hurt our migrant workforce, and the opposite is just as true, too. But it is our migrant workforce that faces additional vulnerability and susceptibility to falling prey to unscrupulous practices. This bill particularly aims to tackle the exploitation of migrant workers, which is something that has been exposed for its prevalence through a number of reports.A report of particular significance that has led to this bill is the one that the Migrant Workers Taskforce handed down. Additionally, a slightly more contemporary report I encourage members to read when they can is the report published by the Grattan Institute earlier this year called Short-changed: how to stop the exploitation of migrant workers in Australia. The Migrant Workers Taskforce was commissioned to report to government largely due to the shocking revelations that were reported on in the media concerning 7-Eleven franchises—a company where migrant workers, namely international students, dominated its main workforce. Further investigations confirmed many of the reports by the media that workers were systematically underpaid, with franchisees going so far as to falsify records to hide these underpayments. It was quite evident that, mainly due to the prevalence of this transpiring amongst 7-Eleven franchises, the exploitation of migrant workers was baked into their business model in some of the most egregious ways.The Migrant Workers Taskforce report was handed down to the government in early 2019. To their credit, the government at the time gave a response to the report mere weeks afterwards. This was something the Morrison government was known to have form for. However, the time line after that response was handed down is more on brand for the former government. The recommendations of the Migrant Workers Taskforce, in addition to the bill introduced by the previous government that lapsed in the 46th parliament, culminated in this government introducing its own bill—the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023. Without delving into every tiny detail contained within the bill, I will attempt to paint the measures contained within by way of broad strokes.Part 1 of this bill introduces new employer sanctions against the Migration Act. This part implements recommendation 19 of the Migrant Workers Taskforce report, which proposes that the government develops legislation so that a person who knowingly and unduly influences, pressures or coerces a temporary migrant worker to breach a condition of their visa is guilty of an offence. These circumstances will include circumstances where a person knowingly or recklessly coerces or exerts undue influence on a lawful noncitizen to work in breach of their work-related visa conditions, on an unlawful noncitizen to work to avoid an adverse effect on their continued presence in Australia, and on a lawful noncitizen to work to avoid an adverse effect on their immigration status or to avoid being unable to acquire the required information or documents regarding their work for visa purposes.The maximum penalty associated with each of the offences listed above shall be two years imprisonment or 360 penalty units. The civil penalty associated with these offences is set at 240 penalty units, which, however, are distinct from the offences, given that the state of mind of a person is not required to be proven in order to form all of the required elements of the civil offences, meaning that if an employer coerces an international student to work more than the hours in their visa permits then the employer will be committing one of the offences above to a standard dependent on the circumstances involved.These provisions satisfy a number of aims: to deter others, to punish those in breach and to protect migrant workers from coercive practices by employers that would find them in a breach of their visa conditions with respect to the manner that they can work and for the amount of time they can work during a given period of time. These exploitative practices against migrant workers need to be dealt with strongly. The amendments to the Migration Act in part 1 have been a very long time coming, much like the others proposed by the Migrant Workers Taskforce.Part 2 of the bill concerns the conditions in which an employer may be prohibited from employing temporary migrant workers. Through this part, the minister or their delegate can prohibit the hiring of additional workers on a temporary visa where an employer has underpaid or otherwise breached their obligation as an employer. The circumstances in which they can occur are also set out in this part, through how a person can be subject to a migrant worker sanction. Once a person has satisfied the criteria to be subject to a migrant worker sanction, the minister or delegate may declare that person to be a prohibited employer for a five-year period each time a person is subject to a migrant worker sanction.This part further outlines what happens once someone has been declared a prohibited employer. Namely, the penalty for allowing a noncitizen to begin work, whether for reward or otherwise, is two years imprisonment or 360 penalty units, or 240 penalty units as a civil penalty. This part also provides an affirmative duty to name and shame prohibited employers on the departments webpage. Part 2 also provides for the procedures for the 12-month period after a persons term as a prohibited employer concludes, with a number of interim conditions imposed, such as the requirement to report on any new temporary migrants that are employed during this time.Part 3 of the bill increases the pecuniary penalties that currently exist for work-related civil penalty breaches in the Migration Act and for breaches under existing employee sponsorship obligations in the Migration Act and the Migration Regulations 1994. Part 4 of the bill establishes a framework whereby the minister or their delegate can enter into enforceable undertakings with an employer, labour hire company or other party that has committed a work-related offence or other such provisions under the Migration Act, which would include the new civil penalties and offences provisions within part 1 of the bill. Part 5 of the bill establishes a framework enabling an authorised officer to issue a compliance notice as an alternative to initiating court proceedings for contraventions of work related provisions of the Migration Act. Part 6 of the bill comprises a number of ancillary amendments.I commend this bill to the House, and I would urge all members to support it to put to rest amendments to the Migration Act that have been sorely warranted and called for by several experts and a number of parliamentary committees. By virtue of the lapsed bill in the previous parliament, the Migration Amendment (Protecting Migrant Workers) Bill 2021, you could even extend that through to the opposition, given they were in government when introducing similar legislation into the 46th Parliament.This is one big step forward to eliminating exploitative employment practices against our migrant workforce. Its a workforce that Australian employers cannot take for granted, and employers cant abuse their fundamental rights and protections under Australian industrial law with wanton abandon without risking the full weight of that law by trying to do so. It has been flagged that this is by far not the complete cure, but these are measures that have been asked for now for a significant amount of time that will go a long way to addressing the problem and to minimising its prevalence in pockets of Australia whilst also maximising the likelihood of workers feeling comfortable enough to report breaches by prospective or former employers to the relevant authorities. I thank the House.","Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BURNELL (Spence) ","(17:46):"
306,0,0,0,1,1,"Hill, Julian MP",86256,"Bruce","ALP","N/A",5760," I want to start at the outset with two clear, simple but powerful propositions. Firstly, Australia has done really well over decades as a permanent settler society. Secondly, as a corollary, we dont want our country to become a guest worker society where theres this temporary underclass that is exploited. I think most Australians would agree with me. Even if those opposite dont agree with those simple propositions, dont care about migrant workers being exploited or wont back action to do something about it, lets be very clear on the self-interest that every Australian has in stamping out the exploitation of migrant workers. Exploitation and wage theft dont just hurt migrant workers. They impact every Australian, as they can drive down wages and worsen conditions for all Australian workers. If unscrupulous employers can keep exploiting cheap migrant labour, theres no incentive to pay Australian workers properly or to raise wages.This was an old-fashioned speech at the outset, but lets put a couple of facts on the table. The government, informed by evidence, has public policy informed by evidence—I know, particularly when you look at the climate change debates of recent years, that its a shocking thing for the opposition. Fact: one in six recent migrants to Australia are paid less than the minimum wage—one in six! Recent migrants are 40 per cent more likely to be underpaid than long-term residents with the same skills and the same experience doing the same job. Temporary visa holders make up four per cent of the workforce yet make up 26 per cent of all litigation initiated for breaching the Fair Work Act, and theres every indication that thats a significant underrepresentation of the real situation.Personally, I think those statistics alone are shocking and morally wrong. Everyone in our country should be treated fairly, whatever their visa status is, whether theyre here for four weeks, four years or 40 years and whether theyre citizens, permanent residents or temporary visa holders. But thats manifestly not the case now, and its been going on for years. The previous government had numerous inquiries over their decade in office, but they failed to do anything meaningful. Ill quote Professor Allan Fels, Chair of the 2019 Migrant Workers Taskforce, who said that this exploitation:… has been severe problem for at least 10 years, there have been huge numbers of underpaid and exploited migrant workers and nothing was done about it. Now it is extremely timely …He said that in June this year.These are not abstract issues, though. Theyre real people. I see the member for Hotham here; we share a community in Greater Dandenong. In our communities, the majority of people are born overseas. Theyre not other people. We have tens of thousands of people in each of our electorates in south-east Melbourne who are not citizens but here on temporary visas. Theyre our neighbours. Theyre the other parents at the school gate. Theyre the people who make your coffee. Theyre the people who clean your workplaces. Theyre the people who repair your cars. Theyre the people who pack the food in the factories for the supermarkets.Enough is enough. We dont need more inquiries and more reports. We need action by changing the law, finally, and changing the incentives. Thats what the government is doing. This bill is not every step of the plan, but its an important part of the plan. For the first time in a long time the government is already out there raising awareness amongst employers about their obligations, actually getting out and visiting businesses. People may ask if we will stamp out all exploitation, and of course the answer is no. Some people will always do the wrong thing in any human society or any big service system in the economy. But we can and we must make real changes. The Liberals and the Greens political party should not play politics; they should actually vote for this bill.One important shift is to move the focus of compliance from the worker to the employer. I cant emphasise that enough. For too long, workers who were exploited for being in breach of a visa condition were then punished through the criminal system rather than the employers who were breaking the law. This practical fact has led to the clause in the bill that repeals the part of the Migration Act that, currently, makes it a criminal penalty for workers to breach their visa conditions and so, effectively, to criminalise speaking up.All of this goes to what kind of country we want to be. Theres undoubtedly a crisis of exploitation in Australian workplaces. People are too terrified to speak out when theyre mistreated because of the high risk that theyll be criminally charged. Exploitation is not isolated. It has been proven, year after year, in report after report, to be systemic in the labour market. Unscrupulous employers, migration agents and facilitators have misused the visa rules and the visa system to exploit workers.Ive talked about these issues over many years. It is hard for people—for most citizens, frankly—who were born in Australia, to truly understand the vulnerability, and the vulnerability to exploitation, that is caused by a temporary visa status and the power that an employer has over a person if theyre on a temporary visa. That threat is a key driver of exploitation: do what I tell you, or Ill dob you in and get you deported. Thats the basic power imbalance and basic threat. Its a key driver of sexual slavery, underpayments, wage theft, mistreatment conditions, empty promises of permanent residency and sham contracting—that threat of calling Australian Border Force and having them deported. There are stories where people have had their passports locked away and been sexually enslaved. These are not abstract. Its actually happening right now. As we debate this legislation, therell be people right across the country hidden away in factories, on farms and in houses in the suburbs and the regions suffering this kind of exploitation. We have to reverse the onus.This bill implements key recommendations from Professor Allan Felss Migrant Workers Taskforce report in 2019. It recognises, as I said at the outset, that when people vulnerable to exploitation are mistreated we all suffer. It also inherently recognises the positive contribution made by so many workers and that Australia cannot take for granted that were a destination of choice for prospective migrants. Were in the global competition for talent. This growing problem we have as a country, where its reported around the world by international students and others that if you come to Australia youll get exploited, is something we cant sustain. Morally, we cant sustain it in terms of the impact on Australians and their wages and prospects, and we cant sustain it in terms of our competitive position globally. So its critically important for the government of Australia to demonstrate our strong commitment to addressing worker exploitation, because its the right thing to do and its squarely in our national interest.The bill reflects our principle, if you like, that approaches to employment and migration have to work side-by-side, collaboratively, if were actually going to address exploitation. The Fair Work Act and the Migration Act have to work together to protect workers, regardless of their visa status. ACTU president Michele ONeil was spot on when she said:Migrant worker exploitation is a national shame—we welcome the Albanese Government taking action to protect migrant workers from exploitation and to implement key recommendations of the Migrant Worker Taskforce—after years of inaction by the Coalition Government.Shes right: it is a national shame. And the former government is to blame—as I said, not for every incidence of exploitation; of course you cant stamp everything out: therell be people who do the wrong thing. But they are to blame for having these reports and, worse than doing nothing, going through a political charade and pretending they were going to do something but instead sitting by and overseeing this crisis of exploitation in workplaces across the country. There was a national debate in the wake of that shocking 7-Eleven scandal, which showed it was a scam. It wasnt just missed time sheets. It was a systemic exploitation and rorting of the labour and migration systems to exploit vulnerable people, undercutting the wages of Australians, hurting our international reputation and just doing the wrong thing. They could have fixed this.So, they got the Migrant Workers Taskforce report in 2019—and fair enough. As the previous speaker said, to their credit, they responded. They didnt agree with everything, but they put out a government response and said, Were going to do this stuff. They didnt do anything. It was a scam; it was a sham. Then they introduced legislation to the parliament, two years later. In 2021 they introduced a bill. But, as was so common with the former government, they didnt even bring the bill forward for debate. They introduced the bill, they got the press release, they got the speech up on social media—job done! They didnt actually care about stamping out migrant worker exploitation. It was all about sending another dodgy message before the election, to make people think they were doing something. They didnt even bring the bill on for debate, let alone allow a vote, let alone allow it to go to the Senate, let alone allow it to become law.Itll be interesting to see whether the opposition can actually bring themselves to vote for action on this, given their wasted decade of division, dysfunction, decay and denial, which exacerbated this problem, as they sat by and watched it grow. As we saw, the Liberals preferred temporary visas to permanent visas, which actually made it easier for unscrupulous employers to exploit workers. Not only did they sit by and do nothing, not only did they pretend to do something—a con trick—but they actually made it easier for employers to exploit workers. They also created a backlog of nearly one million visa applications—well over a million if you count the citizenship backlog, too. They neglected the basic administrative tasks by looking the other way. Instead of employing some public servants, as the governments done—I think over 500 new public servants in the Department of Home Affairs, working through that shocking backlog—they blew 92 million bucks trying to privatise the visa system. I think the reason they abandoned it wasnt because they figured out it wasnt a great idea but because they couldnt find anyone to give it to, as a tenderer, who wasnt a mate of Scott Morrison, because good old Scott Briggs wasnt there. They had to abandon it because of probity. Its been in the paper. That $92 million included I think a $42 million PowerPoint for BCG. I mean, its good work if you can get it, isnt it?So, the bills new criminal offences of using a persons migration status to exploit them in the workplace are welcome. Thats recommendation 19 from the taskforce. They could have done that years ago. Theres a new tool to prohibit employers who are engaged in exploitative practices from being able to hire workers on temporary visas for a period of time. Thats recommendation 20 from the taskforce. They could have done that years ago. But the bill will go further. Higher penalties are proposed for people who do the wrong thing. There has to be a strong deterrent. As the government has made clear, weve got to reverse that onus, weve got to change the incentive and weve got to remove the disincentive for people to speak up about exploitation. Its a ridiculous situation that weve put up with for too many years, where an exploited worker makes a report and then theyre threatened or criminally prosecuted, and the employer gets off scot-free.The government will promote workers ability to speak up and report exploitation by putting in place appropriate protections from visa cancellation, and thats just one part of the governments plan to protect workers. In the budget this year there was $50 million over four years to Australian Border Force. Shocking revelations—I do not envy the Minister for Home Affairs the job that you have to do now to clean up this mess, after it was revealed that there was almost no enforcement on shore, almost no integrity measures. I see the former assistant minister sitting over there. Weve got the Leader of the Opposition. He set up the shemozzle—set it up to fail, as the leaked report said. He was a tough cop on the beat, tough on the borders. It turns out that over 100,000 people arrived on their watch, with fake protection claims that they let run up, with no onshore enforcement and no integrity measures.","Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[12]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HILL (Bruce) ","(18:01):"

They can come here, make fake claims, hang around for years working and sending money home, and eventually, if they happen to get deported, if one of the departments couple of staff find them, then theyve made a lot of money. Its a good return on investment.As I said, the ABF with those new resources oversaw a month of action in July targeting those employers who were suspected of doing the wrong thing. It wouldnt have been possible without the additional funding provided by the government and the priority that this government is placing on tackling the exploitation of workers.In summary, I commend the bill to the House. I do genuinely hope that the opposition can bring themselves to support the bill—its not usually in their DNA; it certainly runs against a decade of their record—and to ensure its quick passage through the Senate so that workers who are being exploited right now across our country can start to be confident of being able to speak up without fear of criminal prosecution and start to expose those employers who are systematically rorting and abusing the system, who are not just hurting the exploited migrant workers but driving down the wages of Australian workers.

310,0,0,0,1,1,"OConnor, Brendan Patrick John MP","00AN3","Gorton","ALP","N/A",5764," I move:That the amendments be agreed to.Im happy to go to the amendments concurrently. I congratulate the members and senators for a very constructive debate around what is a very important piece of legislation for the government. The Jobs and Skills Australia Bill 2022 was in fact the first bill introduced into this parliament. It was done so because it was the governments decision to clearly indicate that we were well aware that there were significant challenges to confront in dealing with skills shortages across our economy. For that reason, we introduced that legislation which established Jobs and Skills Australia. But there was more to be done to set up the governance arrangements and create, if you like, the architecture for it to perform its functions optimally and also work with government initiatives in the creation of jobs and skills councils. Those councils, of course, are tripartite bodies. They work in tandem with Jobs and Skills Australia. Theyll provide the opportunity for a real economy insight into the decision-making of government. They will advise government and industry, allowing an interrogation, if you like, by the collection of data of JSA and the insights and views of industry to get the best possible outcomes when we spend taxpayers dollars on education and training or when were advising departments about what might well be needed in terms of skilled migration.Were very happy with the development and the work that has gone into this very important area of public policy to date. I would also like to thank, as I said earlier, the members who participated constructively in this place and in the Senate. I am reporting on the Senate amendments. Constructive amendments were agreed to by the Senate—ones that strengthen the governments plans for expert advice and analysis, delivered by an explicitly tripartite body in a partnership between governments, including states and territories, employers and unions.It is telling who voted against this. Only the opposition voted against this. The opposition foreshadowed that it would not oppose the bill and would not oppose it as a second reading bill, yet it divided on the bill in this place. I think, because of that accidental division, it then decided to also oppose the bill rhetorically, having accidently divided on it, which is a shame. This is a broader and deeper effort to understand the labour market and more precisely anticipate the changing nature of the labour market so we can deliver more effectively education and training in areas of demand. Its predecessor, the National Skills Commission, did some good work, and I said so. I thank the National Skills Commission for that work, but it wasnt broad enough; it didnt bring industry into that engagement in the way that we wanted it to.This is a really important moment. This is an amended bill, returned from the Senate with amendments that we accept. All of the crossbench voted in favour of the amended bill. Other than the opposition, everyone voted for the bill initially in this place as well. Two amendments were accepted in the Senate. We had already made amendments in the House. One amendment was to ensure that we provide an evaluation of government programs, particularly on how they relate to and potentially impact upon disadvantaged cohorts in our society and our labour market. I was very happy to accede to that amendment. Also, a further amendment was to ensure that, of the representation on the ministerial advisory board, there would be four distinct places for experts who would not be representing employer or employee organisations so that union representatives and employer representatives were clear and the other four would be able to provide advice without being an advocate of either employer or union bodies. Were very happy with that amendment as well because that reflected the governments position.We have a significant workload to ensure that we deliver the pipeline of skills to our economy, whether its the energy sector, the care economy, digital or traditional trades—you name it; there are real issues. These amendments will be an improvement. I want to thank the members and senators for their work.","Jobs and Skills Australia Amendment Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr OCONNOR (Gorton—Minister for Skills and Training) ","(18:21):"

313,0,0,0,1,1,"Charlton, Andrew MP","I8M","Parramatta","ALP","N/A",5766," I rise today to support the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023, to strengthen employer compliance for temporary visa holders working in Australia. Migrants are incredibly important for our economy. According to ABS data, in the year 2019-20, 26.3 per cent of all jobs in Australia were held by migrants. Thats over a quarter. Thats 5.3 million jobs. Thirty per cent of those jobs were held by temporary migrants. That means temporary migrants held 1.6 million jobs. Thats about 10 per cent of our labour force. Temporary migrants make an enormous contribution across Australias industries to fill workforce shortages and do millions of jobs that Australia needs to keep our economy powering forward.Migrants are incredibly important for our economy, and without them our economy would grind to a halt. They contribute so much to our local communities through their culture and language. They enrich what it means to be Australian. Migrants look after us, and, in turn, we must look after them. But, unfortunately, for all that migrants are doing for our economy, they are being exploited, underpaid and ill-treated in many parts of our labour force.The bill before us today addresses the exploitation of Australias temporary visa holders. The reality for these workers has been laid bare in numerous dire reports. The Migrant Workers Taskforce report in 2019 showed that wage theft from migrants is an issue that we havent known very much about historically but is rife within our economy. The National Temporary Migrant Work Survey of 2017 revealed that as many as 50 per cent of temporary migrant workers may be being underpaid in their employment. That means, as a temporary migrant worker, you are as likely as not to be the victim of wage theft—one in two. The report goes on to say that the wage exploitation of temporary migrants offends our national value of fairness. It harms not only the employees involved but also the businesses which do do the right thing and are panelised by comparison to those that do not. The Grattan Institute in May 2023 showed that exploitation of temporary migrants in our labour force is widespread. Up to one in six of recent migrants are paid less than the national minimum wage, compared to just nine per cent of Australian workers—that means between 27,000 and 82,000 workers across Australia. Between 6,500 and 42,000 are underpaid by at least $3 an hour. This is wage theft on a grand scale, right across our economy, impacting the most vulnerable and lowest-paid workers.These incidences of exploitation and wage theft are rife across many Australian industries. The construction industry, the second-highest industry employer of temporary residents, at 44,300 people, was described in a 2017 report by the Australian Institute of Criminology as particularly problematic when it comes to employment standards of temporary migrants. That report highlighted a range of areas of noncompliance with employment standards, despicable practices like the confiscation of workers passports and some cases of actual physical abuse. In the food and beverage industry the data shows the situation is not much better. This industry is the most common industry to employ temporary migrants. More than 100,000 temporary migrants work in the food, beverage and hospitality industries—12 per cent of all temporary migrant workers. Before the pandemic, recent migrants were four times as likely to work in hospitality than long-term residents, but those who worked in hospitality—an industry which particularly relies on migrant workers—were found even more likely to be underpaid than those in other industries. They are younger, theyre less skilled, and theyre ripe for exploitation.There were so many examples across these and other industries of how temporary migrant workers have been exploited. The first was the simple underpayment of wages: workers being underpaid for the hours they worked, workers asked to work extra time without being paid, and workers having entitlements that they deserved not provided. The second area was unfair dismissals: without being given a reasonable justification or where there was no warrant for dismissal in the first place. The third was unpaid training. The fourth was tax avoidance by paying workers only in cash. These are practices which rob temporary workers of their rightful wages, rob Australians of taxation revenue, and create an unfair playing field where those businesses that are doing the right thing are disadvantaged.It gets worse than that. There are incidents highlighted across these reports of migrant workers being pressured to break their visa rules, of misclassifying workers as independent contractors rather than employees, of workers having their passports withheld, and of threats to have the workers visas cancelled. Weve seen example after example of these horrific practices being perpetrated on Australias temporary migrant workers. One of the most egregious was the case 7-Eleven. In 2020, 7-Eleven was forced to pay back $173 million to workers that their franchisees had ripped off. This was systemic underpayment of wages. In some cases workers were forced to withdraw their wages from an ATM and pay them back to their employer. Thats how brazen it was—workers were forced to withdraw their wages from an ATM and pay them back to their employer. There was absolutely no regard for the law, and completely wilful ripping-off of these workers. The migrant taskforce report in 2019 determined that wage exploitation was systemic across the 7-Eleven network. It wasnt a minority of stores, it wasnt a few bad apples—the majority of 7-Eleven stores were involved in this wage exploitation. After these practices were first revealed to the public in 2015, 7-Eleven outlined a number of measures to prevent wage fraud amongst their franchisees. They made investments in technology to centrally record employee attendance, they made greater investments into enforcement and compliance through field investigations, and they created a noncompliance complaint hotline for employees. Still right throughout the economy the practices that were so rife at 7-Eleven are perpetrated across many different sectors. Another example highlighted by the Migrant Workers Taskforce report was the case of NQ Powertrain and July 2023 reports of this labour-hire company being fined $106,000 for exploiting migrant workers at its North Queensland farm. This exploitation included unlawful deductions from workers wages and workers being brought in on the Seasonal Worker Program but noncompliant, and these practices were happening for years. In 2021 the Levitt Robertson class action for workers on the Seasonal Worker Program revealed workers were losing up to $300 per week from their wages.I think a lot about my electorate when I think about these cases. Parramatta is home to 113,000 people born overseas. Thats over 55 per cent of the electorates population. Parramatta is one of the most multicultural electorates in the country based on the percentage of the population born overseas. We have nine university campuses in Parramatta. People are drawn to Parramatta from all over the world to come here to study and build a life for themselves and their families. Many of those people, whether they be students or people on temporary visas, are here working in these arrangements. They are some of the most vulnerable workers in our community, people that have come to make a contribution to Australia and a contribution to themselves, but ultimately end up in exploitative workplaces. If I think about the scale of this challenge and apply it to the electorate of Parramatta, in the 2021 census 81 per cent of Parramattas population were working either full or part time. If this data on the number of people exploited across the country were repeated across Parramatta, then one in six of those people would be exploited. Thats about 5,000 people in my electorate working in exploitative conditions; 5,000 people being underpaid; 5,000 people living with the threat of a visa cancellation or passports being confiscated; 5,000 people living without the rights they deserve; or 5,000 people being forced to work overtime, not being paid for training or being forced into employer arrangements that arent warranted based on the nature of the work they do.That is why the bill before us today is so important. The key objectives of this bill are, firstly, to strengthen employer compliance laws, making it fairer for Australian businesses who do respect the rules and ensuring they are not undercut by scrupulous competitors; secondly, to remove barriers which discourage workers from speaking up and seeking support; and, thirdly, to implement two recommendations of the Migrant Workers Taskforce report. Specifically, thats recommendation 19:… that the Government consider developing legislation so that a person who knowingly unduly influences, pressures or coerces a temporary migrant worker to breach a condition of their visa is guilty of an offence.Adding new criminal offences building on existing laws in the Migration Act to make it a crime to coerce migrant workers into breaking visa rules and to make it a crime to unduly influence, pressure or coerce unlawful migrants to work—thats the first one. The second one is recommendation 20 of the migrant workers report—that is:… that the Government explore mechanisms to exclude employers who have been convicted by a court of underpaying temporary migrant workers from employing new temporary visa holders for a specific period.To implement this recommendation the government is introducing a new prohibition measure. Its designed to stop prohibited employers from hiring temporary migrant workers who are not sponsored—for example, international students—it aims to stop unscrupulous businesses from reoffending and exploiting more vulnerable people and it will help even the playing field for Australian businesses who employ migrant workers but have been disadvantaged by unscrupulous competitors for too long.When you put these measures together, they aim to stop unscrupulous employers from gutting their workers wages, to stop them from pressuring workers to break their visa rules and to stop workers from being threatened with visa cancellations. Its about making sure that our labour market is fair. Its about restoring the national value of fairness, which in this field has for too long been undermined.This legislation goes to the core of the country that we want to be. We want to be a country that attracts people from all around the world, that is a magnet for talent, hope and ambition in the four corners of the globe, that brings people to this country in ways that we have across sequential waves of migration, that brings people to this country to build a better life for themselves and ultimately to build a better nation for everybody. But we undo that ambition and thwart that national objective if we dont treat these temporary workers with the dignity and respect they deserve, if we have one in two of those temporary workers being underpaid and one in six exploited in other ways. It is a national shame. It betrays our aspiration to be a great, multicultural nation, and thats why this legislation is so important.","Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[5]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr CHARLTON (Parramatta) ","(18:36):"
314,0,0,0,1,1,"Watts, Tim MP",193430,"Gellibrand","ALP","N/A",5767," Australia is a proud migrant nation. That wonderful Indigenous leader Noel Pearson says that you cannot tell the story of Australia without telling three stories. First is the 65,000 years of continuous Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture that is the foundation of our society. Then there are the Westminster institutions, the democratic norms and the rule of law that followed. Finally, there is multicultural migration that has so enriched our nation in recent decades. You cant tell the one story of Australia without telling those three stories. Indeed, today half of Australians either were born overseas or have a parent who was born overseas. My community is central to this success story. More than two-thirds of my constituents were born overseas or have a parent who was born overseas. Australia, as a result, is a prosperous, safe and cohesive country. We are the greatest multicultural success story in the world, and our migration system through the years has enabled that. In the past, when our nation has confronted crises and challenges, weve used our migration system to help us build a better country for the next generation.Unfortunately, the previous governments neglect of immigration policy, this critical part of our national identity, this strategically crucial part of our economy, this foundation stone of our community, has created and bequeathed an immigration system to the incoming Albanese government that, as Minister ONeil has said, favoured temporary migration in increasingly lower-paid jobs—and these are the two essential ingredients of the worker exploitation that we know is occurring in Australias workplaces. Those opposite left our migration settings on cruise control for a decade, and the system drove into a ditch.Over the last decade, story after story has emerged about the exploitation of migrant workers in our community. Ive said repeatedly in this chamber, on the other side of this place, that this was one of the great scandals of our time. It was one of the great stains on our national character. We had in recent years the infamous 7-Eleven case, where we saw intimidation and threats of deportation against staff. We saw systemic underpayment and doctoring of payroll records. Through the class action process against 7-Eleven we saw that one worker was being paid as little as 47c an hour and we saw that 7-Eleven underpaid their workers by $173 million.Weve also seen research that says 60 per cent of international students in Sydney earn less than the national minimum wage, with even more missing out on other mandatory workplace benefits, including casual loading. As in the case of 7-Eleven, these people are particularly vulnerable to coercive threats of deportation, which could mean fears about losing the opportunity to complete their study despite the huge financial and emotional downpayments made by them and their families. Because of these coercive threats, we know that many workers are terrified to speak up. A Grattan Institute report from this year found:Recent migrants are 40 per cent more likely to be underpaid than long-term residents with the same skills and experience and who work in the same job.The Grattan Institute report found that up to one in six migrants are paid less than the minimum wage. The report also found that, while temporary visa holders made up four per cent of the workplace, they made up to 26 per cent of all litigation initiated for a breach of the Fair Work Act in the year 2021-22.A report from Unions NSW found that over one in five workers are paid a lower salary because of their visa status or nationality, and migrant workers are also more likely to miss out on paid leave, overtime and superannuation.This exploitation is devastating for every worker. These are hardworking people contributing to Australias economy who, to date, have fallen through the cracks in our system. In a country which prides itself on egalitarian values, a nation built on immigrant success stories, this is a national shame. Its a disgrace. And those opposite did nothing about it for far too long.As the Grattan Institute said earlier this year, If we dont take wage theft more seriously it will keep happening. And as Professor Allan Fels, the Chair of the Migrant Workers Taskforce, said in June this year, this exploitation:… has been a severe problem for at least 10 years, there have been huge numbers of underpaid and exploited migrant workers and nothing was done about it.Nothing was done about it by those opposite during their time in government. This crucial area of national economic policy and national cultural policy was left on cruise control. The previous government did not act. In fact, they wilfully oversaw systemic exploitation of migrant workers across Australia. The 7-Eleven scandal, which rocked Australia, led to no action by the former government. The former government did not implement the key recommendations from the Migrant Workers Taskforce, which reported to the Morrison government in 2019. Two years after the publication of the taskforces report, they did introduce a bill, but it was a bill which was never even brought forward for debate in this place, let alone for a vote.The Migrant Workers Taskforce report was another report in a long succession that were left on the shelf by the previous government. The announcements were made, the social media posts were put out there, and they said, Job done! The marketing was done but no substantive reform was delivered, and therefore the problem continued. The previous government sat on their hands, which pretty much sums up their attitude to resolving this systemic and devastating problem.On top of doing nothing to solve the problem, those opposite preferred temporary visas to permanent ones. The effect of the migration system they presided over was actually to make it easier for crooked employers to target vulnerable migrant workers. They looked the other way. They allowed long-running abuse of some of the most structurally vulnerable people in our society to continue.Thats why were reforming these laws. Thats why this bill is before the House. We have listened to the recommendations from the 2019 Migrant Workers Taskforce final report, and through this legislation we are implementing recommendation 19 and recommendation 20 of the report. Weve listened to recommendation 19, which was to strengthen our legislation so that any employer or individual who coerces workers, such as by using a workers visa status to exploit them, is guilty of an offence. Weve also listened to recommendation 20, in prohibiting employers and individuals who have been found to exploit workers from hiring workers on temporary visas. These reforms will provide strong incentives for employers to do the right thing by their workers.After a decade of inaction, the Albanese Labor government is tackling the exploitation of migrant workers in this country, and its not before time. The Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023 will establish new criminal and civil offences for coercing people to work in breach of their visa conditions or for using visa status to exploit workers. It will prohibit employers and individuals who have exploited migrants from hiring future workers on temporary visas. It will align and increase penalties for work related breaches. It will provide for an enforceable undertaking for work related breaches and compliance notices to employers who breach relevant Migration Act and Migration Regulations rules, and it will reform the law so that the exploitation of a worker may be considered as a potential mitigating factor when visa cancellation is under consideration. These reforms are not before time. The Grattan Institute has expressed its support for the bill:We support the Bills expansion of the powers of the Australian Border Force (ABF) to crack down on unscrupulous employers and prevent employers found to be taking advantage of migrant workers from hiring temporary migrants.These arent the only reforms that the Albanese Labor government is making to our visa and migration system—a visa and migration system which is not fit for purpose and which creates vulnerabilities for workers across our economy. Since coming to government, weve slashed the backlog of visa applications, from just under a million in the pipeline to now less than 600,000, and the citizenship backlog is now less than 80,000; thats the lowest level in six years. In the last 10 years, not one MP in this House could do a street stall in the Australian community without somebody coming up begging for action on visa processing times—people who would jump through all of the hoops required to receive the Holy Grail that is Australian citizenship and were stuck in a bureaucratic purgatory. People in my community started to draw inferences about the conduct of the previous government. There are large parts of my community that believe those opposite didnt want visa, PR and citizenship applications to be processed, because they didnt think it was in their political interests, thinking those people would hold Labor values. That is something that was raised with me regularly in the electorate. The incompetence of those opposite—their lack of prioritisation for creating new Australians—is inexplicable without that explanation, in my view.Anybody who is worth their salt in this place will have spent a lot of time in Australian citizenship ceremonies. Theyre one of the best parts of the job. Looking someone in the eye who has just received Australian citizenship, seeing how important it is to them—you cant get through a citizenship ceremony in this country without someone being in tears. Seeing how important it is to these people, I think the failure to process citizenship applications was one of the great scandals of the previous government. It was just indefensible. Weve gotten to work on fixing it, and the citizenship backlog is now less than 80,000—the lowest its been in six years.Weve also established a pathway to Australian citizenship for New Zealanders in this country. Its a crucial thing in communities like mine with big Kiwi Pasifika communities. These are people who lived in a state of limbo in our society, mates from across the ditch, equal in all ways except for their status in Australia. Its particularly harsh on the children of those families. It was a foolish decision by the Howard government, the consequences of which grew over time, and this Labor government is fixing it. Were dealing with the problem.Weve also commissioned a review of the Australias migration system, led by former Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Dr Martin Parkinson. That review described the migration system as broken. As I said earlier, this was a system that was on cruise control for the better part of a decade, and it ran into a ditch. It became more and more complex and less and less adequately funded, and it became less and less fit for purpose. We need a migration system that serves our nation by delivering the skills that Australian businesses need and the nation-building that our country was built on. Since this review was released, in April, the Albanese Labor government has been consulting widely on the development of a migration strategy, which will be released later this year. It will deliver a new approach to skilled migration, helping to drive productivity growth and wage growth while ensuring migration is better managed and integrated with the levers that make migration successful.The reforms to the Migration Act in this bill will ensure that migrant workers are treated respectfully and honourably and are paid what they rightly deserve. I would just emphasise to the House, in my capacity as the Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs, that the world watches how we treat migrants in our country. Were not a country of guest workers. Were a country where workers should be treated equally and fairly in the workplace. Its what our country was built on. When I am overseas, I am commonly asked by international peers about how members of their diaspora are treated in Australia, about their status in our community, about their status in our educational institutions, about their status in our workplaces. We need to be able to look our international peers in the eye and say that in Australia everyone is treated equally, everyone is treated fairly, there is no underclass, there is no guest work, there is no vulnerable exploited class in our society. The exploitation of migrant workers enabled by the previous government hurt Australias reputation internationally.Equally, these reforms will be closely observed. They will be important for our relationships across the Indo-Pacific—relationships with countries who send their students to our universities, relationships with countries who send their young people to our country on working holidays. They will be able to look to Australia and know that their students, their children, their young people will be protected from exploitation. They will be able to work here and study here free from coercion and free from exploitation. Thats why these reforms are so important.As Minister Giles has said, this bill recognises that when people vulnerable to exploitation are mistreated, we all suffer. It recognises the contribution being made by so many workers and the importance of addressing the corrosive nature of expectation in workplaces across the country. Worker exploitation hurts everyone and only benefits wrongdoers. Its up to government to stamp it out, and thats what this bill is about. I commend the bill to the House.","Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[5]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WATTS (Gellibrand—Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs) ","(18:51):"
315,0,0,0,1,1,"Khalil, Peter MP",101351,"Wills","ALP","N/A",5770," Everyone deserves to feel safe and be treated with respect at work. Its a basic principle. Its a right we all deserve no matter who we are or where we come from. Being able to speak up at work without fear is also essential. If you arent being paid correctly—for example, a correct wage—or if youre experiencing unfair working conditions, youve got to have the right to speak up and make that be known. Having protections in place to support people speaking out is critical. It enables accountability and fairness.Unfortunately some of the most vulnerable members of our community have struggled to feel safe at work. Thats just an unfortunate fact of the past decade in particular. Many are exploited by employers who feel it is acceptable to take advantage of those, for example, on temporary work visas. Were talking about a significant group of people in Australia on temporary work visas. Last year 137,090 temporary work visas were granted, adding to the estimated number of more than 1.6 million temporary migrants already living in Australia. Many of them are underpaid, harassed, bullied and unsafe at work. Unsafe conditions impact this group disproportionately. Whilst we hear their stories, many people dont know how to report incidents. They experience language barriers, for example, or are afraid to lose their job or their visa, and they sadly continue to be exploited as incidents are very under-reported.The issue is significant. Whilst people on temporary work visas only make up four per cent of their workforce, and 2021-22, the same group of people made up 26 per cent of all litigation initiated for breaching the Fair Work Act—and, as I said, most of the incidents are unreported, so that is a stark statistic. The Grattan Institute report titled Short-changed also outlined just how bad the situation is. They found that as many as one in six migrant workers in Australia is paid less than the national minimum wage. That same group of migrant workers is also more likely to miss out on superannuation, overtime and paid leave. Many also face unsafe workplaces and sexual harassment. Recent migrants are also 40 per cent more likely to be underpaid compared to long-term residents who have the same skills and experience and who work in the same job.This exploitation not only hurts the individual and those around them but also ultimately drives down wages and worsens conditions in the workplace for all Australians. Unfortunately many people choose not to speak out on the mistreatment they experience due to fears that their visa will be cancelled or they will lose their pathway to permanent residency. I will give one example: a fellow by the name of Amir Bagheri-gol-roud-badi. Hes an Iranian refugee on a temporary work visa. Amir is his 50s and has worked pretty hard within the construction and building industry. Amir told my office that he worked for his employer for an entire year—in a very physically demanding role, as you can imagine in construction—yet was not paid his wages at all. He was underpaid completely. It is absolutely shocking the way that he was exploited. His employer refused to pay him the wages that he was entitled to. They told him, You can complain if you want, and warned him that no-one would listen to him, given he was a refugee on a temporary visa.Amir was also exposed to unsafe working conditions. In fact, given that there were very limited safety measures in place, he actually experienced a permanent work injury. He was too scared to speak out in case his visa would be cancelled or he would be deported. By the time he found the courage to speak out, it was too late. Amir hadnt sought the relevant documentation or evidence to support his case, so he was told he had no options to fight this, all because he was too scared to speak out and make a complaint earlier. The current system failed to protect Amir. He was too scared. The Albanese Labor government is committed to addressing this type of exploitation and many other forms of exploitation.These reforms are just one way that the Albanese government plans to protect workers. As part of these reforms, well directly implement key recommendations made by Professor Allan Fels in the Migrant Workers Taskforce report. This includes new criminal offences for using a persons migration status to exploit them in the workplace—recommendation 19 from the taskforce. Theres also a new tool to stop employers engaged in exploitative practices being able to hire workers on temporary visas for a period of time—recommendation 20 from the taskforce. This bill also goes further and provides high penalties for those who do the wrong thing. The government will also repeal the part of the Migration Act that makes it a criminal penalty for workers to breach their visa conditions, which has effectively criminalised speaking up. We want to encourage workers to speak up and report exploitation, and well do this by putting in appropriate protections from visa cancellations when this happens.The government has also provided $50 million to the Australian Border Force as part of the 2023-24 budget to be used over four years. The ABF targeted employers who were suspected of wrongdoing. These reforms will give the ABF new compliance tools. As part of this work, the Albanese government is working with industry, union and civil society through a co-design process to help design further safeguards within the visa system. Put simply, the government is committed to making it safer for people to speak up when they are being exploited in the workplace.There is a lot of detail in this bill from paragraph 245AA of the Migration Act. There will be new criminal and civil offences being introduced in cases where people are coerced to work in breach of their visa conditions or are using their visa status to exploit workers. That penalty will be up to two years in prison or 360 penalty units. It will be important to deter employers and prevent the exploitation of workers due to their visa conditions. At the moment, there are no ways to prevent employers who have been sanctioned under the Migration Act from hiring international students or backpackers, despite the vulnerability these workers face.In paragraph 245AYA of the Migration Act there will be new prohibition notices that will enable the minister or a delegate to declare employers and individuals as being prohibited from hiring workers on temporary visas for a period of time. The triggers for such prohibitions will include court orders and noncompliance with employment and migration law. The government wants to ensure that the employment law and migration law work collaboratively and towards the same goals. When this situation occurs, the minister must publish relevant details on the department website. Ultimately, these changes mean that employers will not be able to hire any temporary visa holders where they have exploited workers in the past.There will be stricter enforcement of breaches for those involved in wrongdoing, and penalties for work based breaches will align with the maximum available penalty under the Migration Act. Also under the Migration Act there will be work related offences and provisions made subject to enforceable undertakings, providing the Australian Border Force with additional tools to help them in their enforcement efforts. There will be a notice that formally advises an employer who breaches relevant Migration Act and migration regulation rules and provide the ABF with more tools to assist in their enforcement of that. Under section 116(1A) of the Migration Act, exploiting a worker can be considered as a potential mitigating factor when visa cancellation is under consideration. This will help encourage migrants on temporary visas to speak up if theyre being exploited. It puts protections in place and sends a message that their visa will not be cancelled in these cases.Over the past 10 years our migration system in this country has relied on a large number of low-paid, exploited temporary migrant workers. We know theyve been routinely exploited; the evidence is there for all of us to see. Over the past 10 years the former government, the coalition government, did nothing about this. Its I think a familiar pattern to all of us: they did absolutely nothing about this.The former coalition government also failed to implement the key recommendations of the Migrant Workers Taskforce. That taskforce reported to the Morrison government back in 2019, but it was never actioned. Thats not a surprise. The former government became aware of the atrocious exploitation of temporary workers particularly through the 7-Eleven case in 2016, a situation that saw workers paid as little as $10 an hour, with franchise owners commonly paying workers for half their hours and forcing staff to hand back much of their pay in cash. Many of these individuals were international students. This situation led to 7-Eleven franchise employees being paid $173 million in underpaid wages, interest and superannuation to compensate them. The former government found out about this but did not feel compelled to take action. Instead, they preferred temporary visas to permanent visas, making it easier for employers to exploit vulnerable members of our community.This is the crux of this. The Morrison government did a big smoke-and-mirrors play. The former prime minister went on about how he was going to do congestion busting in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, but particularly Sydney and Melbourne. He said, Im going to reduce the migration numbers. He reduced permanent skilled migration by about 10,000, and he upped temporary work visas. It was all smoke and mirrors. And I think its very important to note for the House that while temporary work visas are an important part of the migration system—there are gaps in various industries and sectors that need to be filled—they cannot be the only way that people come in on work visas. It goes against the whole set-up whereby, particularly in the post World War II period, Australias migration system and Australia benefited, frankly, from having millions of people migrating to this country to settle here permanently on skilled visas and to work here and become Australians—like my parents who came here and worked hard and became Australians. They settled here and built a life and built a home, for themselves and for their children and their grandchildren. Thats what we want to see more of, because its that connection to Australia and becoming Australian.So, as I said, while there is a place for temporary work visas, they cant be the replacement for that skilled and permanent migration that has built this country into what it is today. Thats exactly what the previous government did. They played a game by increasing the number of temporary work visas. They knew exploitation was happening. They did nothing about it. Then they claimed they were reducing congestion—and bashed migrants at the same time. Its deeply cynical, deeply do nothing—typical of the previous Morrison government.We know we have to protect temporary visa holders. We got a glimpse of labour shortages in the absence of temporary visa holders during the pandemic. As I said, we understand the value of temporary migrant workers and the rich contribution they make to our economy. But we have to make sure we protect these workers, that the protections are in place, because it is the right thing to do. I also acknowledge that without these protections the exploitation of these temporary workers will ultimately discourage this type of migration and lead us to experience more long-term net loss in economic terms.The Albanese government is putting a stop to this exploitation. That is what this bill is about. Members opposite can huff and puff, roll their eyes and do all sorts of things, but they know the truth of this. They know we are taking steps to ensure that no-one who comes to Australia is exploited or abused. You cannot deny that principle; you cannot deny that objective. Were taking the relevant steps to ensure that people like Amir no longer fear speaking out when they are clearly being exploited—not being paid the wages that they earn—or are experiencing unsafe working conditions. These are basic principles for workers and for Australians. Were making these changes because people in this country deserve to be paid fairly and treated respectfully. Thats what this bill is about. Exploiting workers is never okay. Its never acceptable. It doesnt matter what that persons migration status is. Whether they are an Australian, a permanent resident or on a temporary work visa, it is not acceptable. Thats the standard we should be setting as a nation. This government is committed to protecting all the workers in Australia.","Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[5]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KHALIL (Wills) ","(19:06):"
316,0,0,0,1,1,"Mitchell, Rob MP","M3E","McEwen","ALP","N/A",5772," Today I rise proudly to speak on the Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023. I joined the Labor party because of my passion for protecting workers rights. Its something we in Labor have done since before Federation. Its something we will always do. It is the very foundation that our party is built on, and its everything that we do and focus on. Since weve been in government, weve been responsible for a significant suite of reforms in the industrial relations space. Lets not forget that this is an area that had been neglected for almost 10 years while those opposite were in government. It was nearly 10 years when employers could run amok and focus on their profits rather than their people. It was 10 years when the most vulnerable in our society could be exploited due to the lack of empathy and care that was shown to them by the then government.It wasnt just robodebt or the attacks on services; it was the lack of action in workplace relations that hurt Australians. People coming to our country were left unprotected and vulnerable too. As Professor Allan Fels, chair of the Migrant Workers Taskforce said: This exploitation has been a severe problem for 10 years. There have been huge numbers of underpaid and exploited migrant workers and nothing was done about it. COVID hasnt been around for 10 years. Those opposite cant use that excuse any longer.This was even after the national debate that occurred following the 7-Eleven scandal. The former government sat around and did nothing. Whos surprised? Wed all got used to that because it was the former governments response anytime it got tough. They ignored, and didnt implement, the key recommendations of the taskforce report. They knew of the crisis gripping our country, yet they wiped their hands clean of their responsibilities. Now that I think about it, its how the Liberal Party always handle tough situations. Remember how the former Prime Minister, the member for Cook—the sook from Cook—handled national challenges like the Black Summer bushfires? He wiped his hands clean of the problem while sipping pina coladas on the beach at Waikiki.The former coalition governments inaction even extended to individual cases in their own electorates. Take Freedom Foods in Shepparton, for example, who were accused of underpaying their workers by 25 per cent in 2019. That was pre COVID. These workers were made to perform tasks not covered by the skilled workers scheme as well as being severely underpaid. The company also discouraged workers from talking to the union about their working conditions, saying that, if they talked to the union, they were getting on a plane. This is the sort of rhetoric that is both degrading to the worker and also utterly illegal. But its the sort of rhetoric that was allowed to run rampant under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison mess. The complaint about Freedom Foods dated back years before the 2019 report, with the former Nationals federal MP apparently being told about it in 2016. What did he do? He did the same as always: nothing. This is just a further indictment of the former governments inaction on protecting all workers in this nation.In primary school, we teach our kids to step in when someone is picking on someone else and to stand up and speak out for the person being bullied. Typically, the coalition are bystanders. They knew what was happening. They could see it happening, yet they chose to do nothing about it. Even primary school kids could tell the other lot that not stepping up and just being a bystander makes you as bad as the perpetrator. Migrant workers were left in the deep end, with the government happy to watch them drown. Im proud to stand here today and say that this will happen no longer.The Grattan report shows that one in six recent migrants are paid less than the minimum wage. This government sees the exploitation that migrant workers experience under the current system, and thats why we are committed to addressing it. We know that underpaying one worker isnt devastating just for them; rather, it affects the entire workforce. Also from the Grattan report we know that recent migrants are 40 per cent more likely to be underpaid than long-term residents with the same skills and experiences who are working the same job. Allowing the underpayment of migrant workers isnt just a migrant worker issue; it has ramifications across the entire workforce. It drives down the wages of Australian workers—but thats what the other side like.The mistreatment of one group has devastating consequences on the entire workforce, and Australian workers will often suffer worse working conditions along with their migrant counterparts. By lifting up the most vulnerable, we lift up everyone. We are doing this by implementing the key recommendations from Professor Allan Felss Migrant Workers Taskforce report. There are new criminal offences for using a persons migration status to exploit them in the workplace. This is recommendation 19: there is a new tool to prohibit employers engaged in exploitive practices to be able to hire workers on temporary visas for a period. This is recommendation 20: to further deter those who seek to exploit the system and their employees, we are increasing penalties to make sure that those who do the wrong thing experience consequences for their actions.We know that temporary visa holders make up four per cent of the workforce, but, in 2021-22, they made up 26 per cent of all the litigation initiated for breaching the Fair Work Act. However, we know that tackling this problem through the industrial relations portfolio wont achieve the full outcome, which is why we take a holistic approach and give the Australian Border Force new compliance tools. These new tools given to the ABF are supported by the Grattan Institute, which says:We support the Bills expansion of the powers of the Australian Border Force (ABF) to crack down on unscrupulous employers and prevent employers found to be taking advantage of migrant workers from hiring temporary migrants.To make sure workers are empowered to stand up and advocate for themselves, were repealing the parts of the Migration Act that has a criminal penalty for workers who breach their visa conditions. With these parts of the act removed, the government will encourage workers to speak out and report exploitation by putting in place appropriate protections for visa cancellation. The government will also raise awareness of employer obligations and substantively engage with businesses to ensure they understand their responsibilities and are equipped to do the right thing.The bill does this by working in six parts. The first part of the bill focuses on new criminal employer sanctions. These increased penalties will be up to two years in prison or 360 penalty units. The second part will be focused on making sure employers or individuals who have been prohibited from hiring overseas workers due to breaches are unable to hire in the future. If an employer shows they cannot maintain the standard work practice, they should not be put in a position where they can exploit workers further. The third part of the bill aligns and increases penalties for work related breaches. This is aligning the current breaches to the ones within the Migration Act, seeing them increase from 60 penalty units to 240 penalty units. The fourth part of the bill is to make sure that there are enforceable undertakings for work related breaches. This part of the bill uses the Fair Work Ombudsman system to provide enforceable undertakings. The fifth part is the use of compliance notices to inform workplaces of workplace breaches. This will help promote compliance, like what is done under the Fair Work Act. The sixth part of the bill tackles other smaller amendments to the Migration Act, that, if a worker is having their visa cancelled, the worker can provide evidence of worker exploitation that could be a potential mitigating factor in the case.This is something that has been very near and dear to me. I worked in a shoe factory and watched migrant exploitation happen. This is what drove me to get to this place, to make sure people are treated fairly, to make sure they are getting the proper workplace health and safety training they need and to make sure theyre not exploited because of their lack of English language or knowledge of workplace laws. This is something we should be doing more and more. We should be making sure that people who are vulnerable are protected. Usually, its those people who are considered unskilled—although, Id challenge 98 per cent of us to do some of the work they do, and I think wed all fail. Its also about ensuring that people on the lowest incomes get the support they need and deserve to do their jobs properly and efficiently.Migrants are not just stats to be played with; theyre actually people—mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, sisters, brothers—but theyre also people who come here for a better life and who deserve a better life. They deserve a better life by making sure that their workplaces are safe and by making sure that unscrupulous employers are taken out of the system. We need to make sure that we do the right thing for every Australian who goes to work. Everyone who goes to work deserves a fair days pay for a fair days work. It also means theyre entitled to a safe workplace, free from harassment, exploitation and abuse. This is something that the Albanese government does. The Albanese government stands up for workers and ensures they get the support they need when they go to work.Debate interrupted.","Migration Amendment (Strengthening Employer Compliance) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[5]/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ROB MITCHELL (McEwen) ","(19:20):"
317,0,0,0,1,1,"Wilson, Rick MP",198084,"OConnor","LP","N/A",5774," I thank the member for giving me an extra 30 seconds, and Ill make good use of it. On Friday evening, at around about seven oclock Western Australian time, when my farmers, miners, prospectors and small landholders were settling in for dinner and perhaps to watch a little bit of footy, some of the best news that theyve had in a very long time came through in the form of an article in the West Australian announcing that the Western Australian Labor government, the Cook government, had done a spectacular backflip on the Aboriginal cultural heritage legislation.Deputy Speaker Goodenough, youd be very well aware, as a proud Western Australian—and I know you are—of this legislation and the sort of pain, uncertainty and grief that it was inflicting on the Western Australian community. It was going to introduce an extraordinary layer of bureaucracy for farmers, in particular, in my neck of the woods, but of course miners and prospectors as well. Anyone with a block of over 1,100 square metres, in order to dig a hole more than 50 centimetres deep or to remove more than 20 kilograms of soil, which is about a nine-kilo bucketful of soil, was going to have to go through this extraordinary process of due diligence, which was going to increase the complexity of doing simple tasks like building a chook pen or planting a lemon tree in their backyard.It was going to make running a farm almost impossible. You would get up in the morning and, depending on the weather, you might say, Today were going to go and repair that fence that needs a bit of work. Of course, you would not have been able to do that, because there would have been a several-month process of getting approval for it, as a tier 2 event, so opportunities would have been missed. It was certainly going to damage the operational efficiency of miners, prospectors and farmers, among others.There are many people who are sceptical about the reasons the WA government have backflipped on the Voice. Within seconds of that article going up, many of the commenters were pointing out that the Voice has been travelling very badly in Western Australia. People are speculating that the vote may well have a three in front of it. In my electorate, I wouldnt be surprised if it has a two in front of it. Many people were blaming the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act for the very poor reception of the Voice in Western Australia. Thats yet to be seen; well see whether that is actually the case, and how genuine the Premier, Mr Cook, is.Remember that when the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia, Shane Love, suggested just six weeks ago to Mr Cook that the implementation of this legislation be delayed for six months—just delayed, not scrapped, as they have now done—Mr Cook rolled out the old Paul Keating favourite, the old quote about the dog returning to their vomit. He accused Shane Love of dog whistling to calls of racism from his C-grade backbench. Its yet to be seen just how genuine Mr Cook is about rectifying this terrible legislation that they have introduced, but one thing that he could do in the short term to assure Western Australian growers, miners, prospectors and others that he is genuine is to perhaps sack his minister, Mr Buti.Mr Buti has shown industrial-strength incompetence throughout this process. Weve had hundreds, if not thousands, of people turning up to information sessions to explain how this is going to impact their businesses. We had 650 farmers turn up to a public meeting in Katanning to express their dismay. We had 30,000 signatures on a petition collected by the Hon. Neil Thomson MLC. Mr Buti completely ignored all of that. He never turned up to one meeting. He never showed any interest. As recently as last Wednesday, he said that the rollout was going smoothly. So Mr Cook could show some good faith to the productive workers of Western Australia by sacking his minister, because to suggest that he is in any way, shape or form suitable to review and implement some more workable legislation is a complete and utter fallacy.One very last suggestion for the Premier, in my last few seconds, is that if it is indeed true that the federal government lent on him to backflip on this, then he should be leaning on them to backflip on live exports.

I had the honour of representing the Australian government at the opening ceremony of NEXTDCs first overseas data centre in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia. This significant milestone not only highlights the growing economic partnership between Australia and Malaysia but also marks a significant step forward in our collaboration on the digital front.In todays interconnected world, data has become the lifeblood of the global economy. It flows ceaselessly across borders, transcending geographical limitations, and driving innovation, productivity and growth. Recognising the vital importance of the digital economy, Australia and Malaysia have made it a priority under our comprehensive strategic partnership. This commitment highlights our shared belief in the power of digital collaboration and our determination to use it for mutual prosperity. The Australian government embraces its commitment to deepen economic links, foster trade, and promote investment with Malaysia and the wider region. This way, we unlock exciting new markets and opportunities for Australian businesses, who stand to benefit greatly from this significant relationship. As we forge stronger ties and facilitate the flow of trade and investment, we open doors to innovation, job creation and economic growth that will benefit both our nations.NEXTDCs decision to establish its first overseas data centre in Malaysia speaks volumes about the confidence and trust they place in our economic partnership. I would like to take this moment to acknowledge and commend the effort of the Albanese Labor government in building up and reconnecting the neglected relationship with the ASEAN region. Through the governments dedication and vision, we have been able to foster strong connections with our South-East Asian neighbours. I would like to extend my gratitude to the foreign minister for her tireless effort in ensuring that our relationship with Malaysia is on track for progress. Her commitment to diplomacy and collaboration has played a pivotal role in strengthening the ties between our nations. Our thanks go to her and to the Minister for Trade and Tourism for the commendable job he is doing.This partnership between Australia and Malaysia in the digital space is not merely confined to infrastructure development. It is about fostering collaboration, sharing knowledge and promoting innovation. By aligning our expertise, we can address the challenges of our digital era together, driving the adoption of emerging technologies, enhancing cybersecurity measures and promoting ethical use of data. Our joint efforts will enable us to unlock the full potential of the digital economy, creating opportunities for our citizens and ensuring that our countries remain at the forefront of global innovation.As I reflect on my visit to Malaysia and the opening of NEXTDCs data centre project, I am filled with optimism and excitement. The bonds between Malaysia and Australia continue to grow stronger, and it is through such collaborations that we shape a future in which our two nations can thrive together.In conclusion, I want to express my gratitude to the Australian High Commission for its warm hospitality and to NEXTDC for its commitment to strengthening our economic partnership. Together, let us seize the opportunities that lie ahead, navigate the digital landscape with confidence, and build a future that is defined by shared prosperity and limitless possibilities.","Malaysia","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LIM (Tangney) ","(19:34):"
319,0,0,0,1,1,"Fletcher, Paul MP","L6B","Bradfield","LP","N/A",5775," There are a lot of questions being asked about artificial intelligence at the moment. Its human nature to be fearful of the unknown and of change. Obviously, we need to look carefully at the implications of this technology, but, as we think about how we respond as a nation to artificial intelligence, its useful to bear in mind some of the ways in which artificial intelligence is being used today.The tools being used by services like YouTube, Netflix and Spotify to serve up videos or songs that we might like to see or listen to next are one good example of artificial intelligence in action, and many of us find it pretty convenient. These tools become better over time at working out our preferences. If you regularly choose eighties artists like the Thompson Twins, Alison Moyet and Frankie Goes to Hollywood, you tend to get more of these tunes served up to you—I know I do! The tools use data from previous choices you might have made. They also use data from choices made by other people. You might have chosen All Cried Out by Alison Moyet. If a lot of other people who chose this song also chose Dont You Want Me by the Human League, then its quite likely that Dont You Want Me will appear in your feed. The serious point is that that is but one of many examples of the way artificial intelligence is part of all of our lives, and some of the benefits it is delivering are profound.I recently visited professor of neurology Dr Michael Barrett, a world-leading expert in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. He showed me computer images of brain scans and explained how his team had developed an artificial intelligence tool to look at brain scans and identify signs of this terrible disease. Such tools do not replace the work of radiologists, but they do allow radiologists to deal with higher volumes of scans and allow a given patients scans to be seen more quickly.A similar approach is being used in scanning for many other conditions in medicine. Australian start-up business harrison.ai has developed AI tools used by radiologists, and its estimated that about a third of radiology practices are now using some form of artificial intelligence to assist in their work. This is but one of many situations where a large number of images or a large quantity of video need to be examined, and artificial intelligence tools are increasingly being used for this work.Endeavour Energy has worked with Optus, Amazon Web Services and Unleash live on a project to use drones to fly above powerlines to identify places where the line is at risk of failing. Typically the line gets hotter when it is nearing failure, and this is captured by infrared video. The drone captures this video and sends it back to be examined by an artificial intelligence tool, which then flags locations for human investigation. This kind of preventative scanning work was simply not being done previously but is now feasible thanks to artificial intelligence.Australian start-up company Trellis Data has developed artificial intelligence tools to scan shipping containers coming into Australia for biosecurity risks. For example, insects may have built nests on the outside of the container while it was sitting on the ground in another country waiting to be shipped. The tool examines images of the container from cameras located in the ports where the containers are unloaded from ships, and it flags containers where theres a risk. In a two-week trial period, with the cameras scanning containers from multiple angles in just four seconds, more than 1.7 million images of containers were analysed, with four per cent of containers having pests that needed to be removed. While the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is only able to inspect about three per cent of all goods manually, the benefit of using this artificial intelligence tool is that containers were scanned more quickly and efficiently. Rather than causing jobs to be lost, this tool allows a higher percentage of incoming containers to be scanned, and it allows staff to then have their efforts focused on a more detailed examination of the containers which the artificial intelligence tool has flagged as presenting a risk.Similarly, in the example I gave previously, with Endeavour Energy using artificial intelligence, that system allows the skilled maintenance staff to be directed to locations where they can do preventative maintenance work rather than having to simply engage in physical inspection. As work they were previously doing is now able to be done by the artificial intelligence tool, those skilled staff are able to be deployed to other high-value and more productive work.Its clear that many businesses are developing ways to use artificial intelligence in a growing range of settings, generally to allow existing processes to be carried out more quickly and efficiently. Rather than leading to a reduction in jobs, in many of these instances artificial intelligence is instead resulting in an increase in activity. We need to think carefully about the risks that AI might bring, but we also need to be alive to the very significant benefits we are seeing from it every day.","Artificial Intelligence","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FLETCHER (Bradfield—Manager of Opposition Business) ","(19:39):"
320,0,0,0,1,1,"Miller-Frost, Louise MP",296272,"Boothby","ALP","N/A",5776," This weekend I had the pleasure to attend the Flinders Medical Centre with state health minister Chris Picton and some of my state colleagues the member for Davenport, Erin Thompson, the member for Waite, Catherine Hutchesson, and the member for Badcoe, Jayne Stinson. Like much of the country, our health system is under strain, and the most obvious indicator of the challenge is ambulance ramping. Ambulance ramping is, of course, a symptom and not the cause of the problem, and it is caused by bed block in emergency departments and in the hospital. It was great to be able to announce that 20 additional beds are being fast-tracked to help address bed block. This is in addition to the extra 26 new beds already online at Flinders Medical Centre and repat hospital earlier in the year. Flinders Medical Centre is a key tertiary hospital that plays a critical role in South Australias health system network, particularly providing services to Boothby, the southern suburbs of Adelaide, and the southern regions. The Albanese Labor government committed $200 million, matched by state Labor, to redevelop 40-year-old Flinders and bring it up to current best practice. We absolutely need these services to come online as quickly as possible.But wait—theres more! Prior to the last election, now Minister for Health and Aged Care Mark Butler announced that Boothby would be one of the sites of an urgent-care clinic to support the Flinders emergency department by giving patients with urgent but not life-threatening health conditions another treatment option. This will be a walk-in option, bulk-billed, no appointment or referral required. It will mean that emergency departments can focus on life-threatening conditions and those with less-serious conditions will be seen faster in more appropriate places. The tender for the Boothby urgent-care clinic has closed, and I am looking forward to what I hope is an imminent announcement.But again, theres more. We are investing in the Bragg Comprehensive Cancer Centre in the CBD. This is a $77 million federal government commitment that will bring together South Australias leading cancer researchers, clinicians and technology, and will provide the best education and prevention services, treatment, and long-term care in one coordinated service. The centre will also feature a proton therapy machine which provides targeted radiation therapy, particularly for children or those with head and neck cancers where minimising damage to surrounding tissues is of extreme importance.We mustnt forget primary care. We have already cut the price of scripts by $12.50, and this has saved people in Boothby over $90,000 collectively this year. This will be followed by 60-day prescriptions being introduced in three tranches, starting 1 September. Enabling patients to fill longer prescriptions for medications that have been risk-assessed as safe improves medication compliance. We have all heard of patients rationing medicine or choosing which prescription to fill because of the cost—this reduces that barrier. We also know that the time when people are most noncompliant with medication is at the end of the packet, perhaps because they forgot to fill the script. With longer prescriptions this risk is halved. Of course, if your prescription is longer, you dont need to go back to the GP so often to get a new prescription, so GP time will be released for other patients. Longer prescriptions are backed by doctor groups, patient groups and nursing groups. I acknowledge the concerns of pharmacy owners, and well continue to work with them to address their concerns. The minister has already introduced a number of programs to offset the potential profit-reduction, and I am in favour of expanding scope of practice so that pharmacists can work to their full clinical scope, further freeing up GPs.Getting back to primary care, the other really exciting thing we are doing is tripling the bulk-billing incentive. I am sure all of us here have heard about the difficulties of finding a bulk-billing doctor anywhere in the country. In November, after six years of Medicare rebates being frozen under those opposite, it is intended that this change will make bulk-billing financially viable again. I hear from doctors that, while the Medicare rebates were frozen, the costs of doing practice werent—the costs of their staff, of running the service and of the medical supplies werent. This will make bulk-billing viable again. This government is committed to improving our health system, and we are getting under way at pace.","Health Care","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MILLER-FROST (Boothby) ","(19:44):"
321,0,0,0,1,1,"Ramsey, Rowan Eric MP","HWS","Grey","LP","N/A",5777," It would seem almost certain that the Western Australian government is to withdraw its Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act sometime this week. This is an outlandish, outrageous piece of legislation that I congratulate Western Australian farmers in particular for standing up to. I believe 650 attended a meeting at Katanning recently, and 400 apologised. Its what you get when people with no life experience draw up legislation about things they have no idea about.This act was so foolish as to say a farmer, or anybody, couldnt dig a hole more than 50 centimetres deep without getting cultural clearance; indeed, that they couldnt shift 20 kilograms of soil. You can get about 15 kilograms of soil into a 10-litre garden bucket. Ive got a 60-year-old farm front-end loader that shifts one tonne at a time and Ive got a slightly newer one that will do two, and many of my friends who are still farming have something that will shift four or five tonnes. Basically, any job you wanted to do on a farm would have needed cultural clearance. Im so pleased its gone, but I have concerns that its not completely gone; that it will come back. Im also concerned that they have been told it would be a good idea to get rid of it while the nation is considering the Voice. It comes back to getting Indigenous clearance to carry on work on properties.The reason I bring this to the chamber is that my community too has hit an issue. Kimba has been through an eight-year program to secure the right to host the nations low-level radioactive waste management facility. Eight years ago I took this to my community. I said: I think there are good jobs on offer here. For a small community with a declining population this could make a real difference. Just a few weeks ago, a Federal Court justice ruled that the minister at the time, Keith Pitt, was biased in his decision, and the project was disallowed.My opinion is that the court was erroneous on two points. The first was in giving standing to the Barngarla Determination Aboriginal Corporation on freehold property in the first place, because we know that freehold property extinguishes native title rights. The second was in saying that the minister was biased. After a five- or six-year program to find a site in Australia where a farmer was prepared to sell their land to the Commonwealth to put the site on, after finding a community that was prepared to not only accept but welcome it—61.8 per cent of people in Kimba voted in favour of this proposal—and after two Federal Court cases saying it was okay, a third one, with a new justice, ruled it ineligible.I am concerned that Kimba too will become a casualty of the government trying to sweep any confrontation with Indigenous groups out of the road before the Voice. I believe the minister for resources should be appealing this decision immediately. I sought a meeting with the minister last week. It was cancelled at 24 hours notice, and apparently she has no time to see me this week. I can only assume that shes not prepared to speak with me about this issue.","Western Australia: Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2021","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RAMSEY (Grey—Opposition Whip) ","(19:49):"

There are a few mixed feelings in Tasmania because of Crown Princess Mary, but Im sure well all get behind the Matildas. Tens of thousands are expected to fill Sydneys Olympic Park, and millions will be watching on screens worldwide.The Womens World Cup here in Australia has been a huge success already, with record figures for stadium attendances and TV audiences viewing womens sport. Stadium attendance numbers have averaged over 26,000, with over 75,000 at Stadium Australia for the Matildas opening game against Ireland. Its estimated that, over the tournament, two billion people will have tuned in worldwide, doubling the figures from 2019. I know when the bells ring to adjourn the House, many of us, particularly the assistant minister, will be racing out to find somewhere to cheer on our Matildas.As millions of viewers tune in, it sparks conversations about gender equality and womens representation in sport. It amplifies the voices of those advocating for equal pay, improved facilities and increased media coverage of female athletes. These conversations go further, moving into learning institutions and workplaces. When girls see women on the field in the World Cup, they know they can pursue their own dreams, and to hell with what the boys say! Encouraging young girls to pursue STEM, for example, helps bridge a gender gap in industries that are traditionally male dominated, fostering innovation and diversity. The fabulous STEMforGIRLS program in St Helens, which I support, works tirelessly to break down barriers that have no place in modern Australia.The Womens World Cup tournament serves as an inspiration to countless young girls who dare to dream big in whatever they want to succeed in. When they see Caitlin Foord and Hayley Raso competing at the highest level, they see role models who exemplify resilience, dedication and the pursuit of excellence. Not only are there champions and role models on the field, but there are people off the field making a huge difference. At this World Cup, my state is represented by someone with a very important role. Tasmanias Holly-Lace Ayton is the Matildas equipment manager at the tournament. Its her job to make sure the players kit, training gear and equipment are pristine and at the right place at the right time. She sets up and packs away training equipment and ensures its delivered to the next location. Holly has toured the world in her role with the under-20 Young Matildas in previous years and, in between, has returned home to play for her beloved Taroona FC and coach young Tasmanian girls, empowering them to be the best they can be. I need to mention Alex Aylott and the coaches at Launceston City, in my electorate, whose passion and dedication to the kids in and around Launceston every weekend promote not only health but inclusivity, teamwork and dedication. Theyre training the next generation of Matildas.The impact of this competition echoes through other sporting codes, like Aussie rules and cricket, where professional womens teams are now a regular part of the sporting calendar. This percolates through community sport and, in just a few short years, we see the difference this makes, not only to women in sport but to children and also to men, to appreciate the fantastic role that women have in the sport. Not too many years ago, men would have been aghast at the idea of women playing full-on Aussie rules footy, but its just what they do now. Its terrific to see.Last weekend, in between sitting weeks, I volunteered at the South East Suns Womens Football Club, celebrating the Indigenous round of the competition, and the New Norfolk Panthers junior soccer club, where hundreds of kids, boys and girls, descended on Tynwald Park in New Norfolk. Young kids are taking it for granted that boys and girls can do anything. When I was at school, girls werent even allowed to do metalwork—weve come a long way. Weve still got a long way to go, but, with every kick, every tackle and every goal, the Matildas are helping lead the way. Go, Tillies! You have the nation behind you.","FIFA Womens World Cup","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) ","(19:54):"

Memorials raised in every corner of our country inscribed with the names of our service men and women bear testament to this. Over the past two years the village of Millthorpe, 1,500 people strong, has come together to search for those sons and daughters of their beautiful town whose names needed to be added to their war memorial at Redmond Oval. The Millthorpe and District Historical Society and the village committee worked tirelessly on this project and recently, on a clear winters morning, the local community gathered at the memorial to see 15 new names officially added to the roll of honour. It was a day to remember, as families from all over the state came to honour their loved ones. I was privileged to attend as well.One of the names added to the memorial was that of Major Colin J Flatters OAM, who was born in Millthorpe. Colin did two tours of Vietnam and served in the artillery during the Battle of Long Tan. Colin spoke of his service to our country, and his address was very significant, given that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the end of Australias involvement in the Vietnam War.Adding these names to the memorial, ensuring their service and sacrifice is honoured for generations to come, was made possible by the hard work and dedication of the Millthorpe and District Historical Society. I give a big thank you to President Bruce Chapman, Secretary Jacki Irvine, Collections Manager Hayley Lavers and Treasurer Rosemarie Amos. The project was funded by a Saluting Their Service grant, successfully applied for by the Millthorpe Village Committee, run by President Nick Anagnostaras, Vice President Richard Beach, Interim Secretary Mark Logan and Treasurer Helen Russ. A big well done must also go to Ben Crombie and his team at McMurtrie and Co. stonemasons of Orange, who expertly installed the new plaque on the roll of honour.Another highlight of the day was catching up with Irene Chapman, who celebrated her 101st birthday that very day. Friends and family gathered to toast Irenes more than 10 tremendous decades.Small villages like Millthorpe thrive when community members volunteer their time and skills to make their corner of the country extraordinary. Id like to acknowledge the team of volunteers who helped out on the packed Millthorpe fire festival on the weekend. A huge congratulations to the event committee of Nick Anagnostaras, Richard Beach, Michelle Slack-Smith, Helen Grey, Dane Morgan, Phoenix Kamsteeg and the dozens of hardworking volunteers who chipped in to make the opening night for the winter fire festival such a memorable one.Millthorpe, as you can gather, is an extraordinarily vibrant community.

It was a vibrant event filled with smiles, laughter and an overdose of cuteness as parents and their children gathered to celebrate the shared spirit of family, unity and mateship that defines the community I am so proud to represent.At the outset I acknowledge the organisations, volunteers and community members who helped transform this idea into a grand success. Their relentless dedication, spirit of service and constant commitment to our community are the pillars upon which such events stand. This event was organised in collaboration with Backpacks 4 VIC Kids, a local charity that provides essential material aid to displaced children who often have little more than the clothes they are wearing at the time of their displacement. Backpacks 4 VIC Kids were generous to donate goodie bags for parents, which consisted of baby-friendly items for the youngest members of our community.The main attraction for children at the family fun day, however, was the fire truck displayed in the car park thanks to Warneet-Blind Bight CFA, the local volunteer fire brigade. They were kind enough to let children use the fire hose on the truck and speak to parents and children alike about the importance of fire safety. I also thank the Warneet Motor Yacht Club, who offered their public hall free of charge in the spirit of ensuring the best for our community. During the event, many parents emphasised their happiness with the hard work undertaken by the Albanese Labor government, particularly with this governments suit of family-friendly policies. Through initiatives like cheaper child care and changes to paid parental leave, families in my electorate will be able to spend more time and money on their little ones.In conclusion, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who participated in the Holt Family Fun Day, contributing to making it a memorable day filled with joy and community spirit. I am immensely proud to represent such a vibrant and connected community, and I look forward to continuing the collaboration with Backpacks 4 VIC Kids for the rest of the Holt Family Fun Days we have planned for various parts of my electorate.

331,0,0,0,1,2,"Sukkar, Michael MP",242515,"Deakin","LP","N/A",5781," Despite Labor welcoming 1.5 million migrants into Australia over the next five years without any plan on how to house these people, we are seeing this government make even more poor decisions and savage cuts to infrastructure projects throughout Melbournes eastern suburbs, particularly in my electorate of Deakin. For anyone across the country whos having to deal with road issues, congestion, a lack of parking and traffic bottlenecks, its about to get a whole lot worse under this government when Labor not only implements its 1.5 million Big Australia policy but presumably goes forward with the cuts that it is threatening to local infrastructure projects.In my electorate of Deakin, there are a range of projects that they either have cancelled or are threatening to cancel. The first is the Ringwood Station Carpark. I committed funding to 482 parking spaces at Ringwood Station. You cannot get parking after seven oclock in the morning. Theres nothing more frustrating than trying to get on the train and get to work and arriving at the station without parking. Labor is now threatening to pull the funding for this multi-level car park at Ringwood Station. Planning and zoning have been progressed by Maroondah City Council, who have worked very closely with me in utilising that funding. In the end, the Labor Party now are threatening the residents of Ringwood with being unable to utilise Ringwood Station and get parking in the morning. So we call on the Labor Party to backtrack on the threat of these cuts.Weve also seen threats to cut the $50 million of funding for Canterbury Road to add a lane both inbound and outbound. Everybody who lives near Canterbury Road in Bayswater North, Kilsyth South and Croydon South knows that the traffic congestion on Canterbury Road is already at breaking point with more than 30,000 vehicles a day. I call on Labor again: do not go ahead with the cancellation of this project. A small but important project theyre also threatening to cancel is the intersection upgrade of Tortice Drive and Warrandyte Road. It is a very dangerous and congested intersection in the morning for residents of North Ringwood. Its $4.8 million dollars, and the Labor Party is threatening to cancel this, even though the work is ready to commence. Sadly, theyve already confirmed the cancellation of the $50 million upgrade to Dorset Road in Croydon for road widening, fixing turning lanes, removal of open drains—can you believe it, in metropolitan Melbourne?—and fixing potholes. So we call again on the Labor Party to reinstate that coalition $50 million commitment to Dorset Road. We know the Labor Party has absolute contempt for the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, and these planned and threatened cuts just confirm that.","Infrastructure","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SUKKAR (Deakin) ","(10:35):"

Today, having just arrived back from Arnhem Land and attending Garma, I want to reflect on a few things. I caught up with Warrant Officer Class Two Tommy Munyarryun. It was great to see him again and great to see how far he has been promoted in that great unit, NORFORCE. There was also James Ghengi. Talking to James Ghengi, a soldier in NORFORCE, reminded me of a time when I was serving with them. It reminded me of the importance of listening to First Nations people regarding policies that affect them. We served together—James, Tommy and I—in 2007. Youll remember that those opposite, and there are still some people in the opposition from around from that time, launched the Intervention without consultation, and as a result it was incredibly divisive.NORFORCE were given a role with logistics, but essentially what we ended up doing was a lot of the cultural brokerage to try and explain what was going on with this imposition in their traditional lands, such as what the child health checks were all about. Many of the community were very fearful, because of the way this intervention was rolled out, that their children would be taken away—taken away again, in some cases.I asked James and the Yolgnu soldiers in my patrol what they thought I should do and what they thought we should do as part of this cultural brokerage work, and they said we should put up a big sign in front of the clinic saying in the Yolgnu Matha language, The doctors are here to see your kids and to give them a check-up. And the families started bringing in their young children. Its just a small example of asking for advice, listening and taking that advice, and how that results in proper, practical outcomes, improving health and wellbeing. It worked.That is the very simple point of the Voice: taking advice from people is going to give better outcomes. That was reinforced for me this morning from talking to my good friend Dr Mike Freelander, who has seen the power of Aboriginal controlled health centres in his electorate in improving health outcomes. Obviously, he is someone who would know well the benefits that will come, such as the perinatal benefits—giving young kids the start that they need in life through that support.

The minister has now said that that date will not be met, and we are none the wiser as to what, if any, commitment is going to be made about when the government believe they will be able to achieve it. But that in many ways is irrelevant, because it is absolutely unacceptable to abandon delivering this plan in full and on time by 30 June 2024.The now Prime Minister, the then opposition leader, came to South Australia during the election campaign 15 months ago and made a very solemn commitment to the people of South Australia that an Albanese government would deliver the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full and on time. Fifteen months later, that covenant with the people of South Australia has been broken.After the election, when the Prime Minister was announcing his new cabinet, there was an interesting decision that he made to move the now Minister for the Environment and Water from the portfolio she had held in opposition, that being education, across to environment. He made this comment:My view is that Tanya will be outstanding in that area, but also particularly in the area of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, as well; its very important that that actually gets delivered. Tanya is someone who can get things done.What we know now, 15 months later, is that the minister is someone that cant get things done. The Prime Minister might have known that all too well when he appointed her to that portfolio, given our understanding of the tension between the two. Nonetheless, the people of South Australia have been misled.It was the Howard government that developed the Water Act, a bipartisan initiative coming out of the millennium drought, and that was passed in 2007. It was the then Gillard government that developed the plan that that act required. All constituent governments within the basin signed up to the plan on the basis that there were 2,750 gigalitres within the plan. South Australia signed up on the basis that there would be an additional 450 gigalitres, taking the plan to 3,200 gigalitres, which would be delivered by 30 June 2024.Nothing has changed since the now Prime Minister promised he would honour that. Nothing has changed since then. There is no new fact or piece of information that could possibly be used to explain this, other than that he never intended to keep that promise in the first place.","Murray-Darling Basin","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr STEVENS (Sturt) ","(10:41):"

Its really wonderful to be part of a government that is actually investing in and delivering for the eastern and south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne.It was a fantastic day for both the Waverley Blues Football Netball Club and the Mount Waverley Cricket club when we recently had the opportunity to host Minister Catherine King to reconfirm the governments funding commitment to the redevelopment of Mount Waverley Reserve and view the new plans for the pavilion. This funding, along with the support from the Victorian state government and Monash Council, will deliver a brand-new and expanded two-level sports pavilion, a complete renovation of the playing ground, new and expanded training facilities, and upgraded spectator and community amenities for the reserve. This visit was a great opportunity to view the Mount Waverley Reserve Masterplan, which will also include replacing the current clubrooms, a sports lighting upgrade, reshaping the oval—including improved fencing, drainage and irrigation, an oval circuit path and associated tree planting—cricket net relocation and new public toilets.One aspect of the redevelopment that I know was so welcomed by the tenant clubs, players and the community is the new female change rooms which will be a part of the upgrade. We know how important having a female change room can be when it comes to growing participation in sport. I make this comment, of course, just after the Australian Diamonds have won the Netball World Cup, and were all looking forward to watching the Matildas tonight, so it is a really fine time for womens sport in this country. I had the pleasure when I was at Mount Waverley reserve of meeting the many girls and women who stand to benefit from this aspect of the redevelopment, who were obviously just as excited as I was about these changes.Another really important visit over the last few weeks was to Guardian Childcare and Education in Blackburn South, where, along with the Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth, the wonderful Dr Anne Aly, I had the chance to meet with centre manager Ashleigh Curnow and talk about all things early childhood education and meet with some very special young constituents in Chisholm.

There are countless volunteer hours that go into putting this large rural expo on, and the committee does outstanding work in making sure that Sheepvention takes place year on year on year. Even when we went through the pandemic, they made sure it was done virtually.But this time everyone was back, out and about. The weather was good, and it was a fantastic Sheepvention. They had a guest speaker, Roger Fletcher, who came all the way down from New South Wales. He drove because he wanted to look at the countryside as he came down. He spoke very well about the opportunities which still exist for the sheep industry but also about future challenges that the industry is going to face. It was a very thoughtful speech by someone who is at the heart and centre of the wool industry.Of course, everything was showcased, whether it be fine merino wool, whether it be those prime lambs or whether it be the breeders. Of course, there are very important sales that take place. Youll see some of the best stud rams in the nation on display.The sheep industry makes an incredibly important contribution to our nation. Its a large generator of export revenue. Its also a large generator of jobs locally. Whether its the breeding industry or those who are producing wool, sheepmeat or prime lambs, right across the board they make a significant contribution to our nation. Of course, its wonderful to be able to have a stand there, and the local community from right across the region who come to Sheepvention get the chance to interact. I thank everyone who came up to me and was talking about the issues that were of concern to them such as the local roads and making sure that Dan Andrews does something to invest in our state roads, which are in such a poor state, or the concerns at the moment that farmers have with the cultural heritage laws, which look like theyre about to be ripped up in Western Australia—but no-one knows whats going to take place in Victoria or nationally.

I was initially contacted by Jayne Hewetson through her occupational therapist, who went on to tell us that they were raising concerns for Jaynes wellbeing should she not receive any NDIS. Theyd applied and been knocked back continuously. When they contacted me, Jayne was in the Royal Adelaide Hospital with severe issues which she had managed to basically overcome. I have to say from the outset that Jayne is chairbound and completely dependent on her mobility scooter for accessing the community. She suffers from severe lymphoedema, severe arthritis and complex PTSD.When I first heard about Jayne, she was, as I said, in the Royal Adelaide Hospital. The hospital would not release her unless she had some ongoing care at home, because they had basically examined her and decided she needed ongoing care. They had applied to the NDIS and got absolutely nothing; they were rejected. Thats when they came to see me. I was advised that they had applied for the NDIS but were refused for various reasons. I then took it upon myself to make representations to the minister on behalf of Jayne because I was very concerned for her. This is what holds up beds in public hospitals. People are in those beds without any support to go home. We could release many beds if the support were in place to do so. I made representations to Bill Shorten, the minister, who took a keen interest in this particular case himself. He asked for it to be reviewed and to look at why it was knocked back. Through his intervention in this case, Jayne finally received her NDIS and was able to return home, where her quality of life has improved immensely.During the last nine years, the NDIS under the former coalition government was neglected and underfunded, and it was always under constant attack from a revolving door of different ministers that would come and go. The former government left the NDIS at a place where it was not what it should have been. For the NDIS to reach its potential, it needs a reboot. Thats what the minister and this Labor government are currently doing. Since weve been in government, weve worked to deliver on our promises, and they include getting the NDIS back on track so people like Jayne and many others that Ive seen in my office get the services that they require.The first step we would have seen in the things that came out in the budget: the six-point plan, the NDIA workforce, the long-term planning, the addressing of spiralling expenses, better outcomes for supported independent living and, very importantly, elimination of the unethical practices that we have seen much of and the increasing of community and mainstream supports.","National Disability Insurance Scheme","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[8]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GEORGANAS (Adelaide) ","(10:51):"
337,0,0,0,1,2,"Thompson, Phillip MP",281826,"Herbert","LNP","N/A",5784," Australian seafood is a delicacy, a world-renowned product that we take pride in sharing with the world. But this Albanese Labor government is putting the future of our seafood industry at risk. In a race to spruik an announcement on World Environment Day, the Minister for the Environment and Water made a decision to phase out N2 and N4 fishing licences by December 31 2023.N2 and N4 licences allow our fishers to engage in set-mesh netting in offshore waters. Products like barramundi, grey mackerel, king salmon, flake, queenfish and blue salmon are all caught in this way. The phase-out was a decision that was made without any community consultation, and so many commercial fishers have been blindsided by this change—fishers in the electorate of Herbert, like Lounds Seafood owner, Colin Lound, who has owned and operated a net licence for 40 years. He is set to lose 30 per cent of his annual turnover with this change.This decision is cutting off the hand that feeds the nation, resulting in a loss of jobs and closure of businesses who rely on this source of seafood product. Further, a shift from wild caught to farmed fish will affect the sales in retail shops—along with the health of Australian customers. Consumers will be forced to eat farmed and imported fish from unregulated overseas fisheries.I have written to the Minister for Environment and Water, and Im yet to receive a response—I wrote to the minister some six weeks ago. I also take this opportunity to ask the minister: what happens to the fishers, their employees and their families? Where do they go? What they do? But its not just about the fishers or the local fish shops that will be affected by this change; Townsville based fishers, like Paul Ryan, have informed me of the ripple effect that this decision will have. The nets, the boats, the parts suppliers; ancillary trades and personnel; and the entire tourism industry will see a negative repercussion because of this change.The minister s answer to support fishers through this transition is to buy back the N2 and N4 portions of their licences. This solution clearly shows that the minister does not understand her own portfolio. Our fishers have comprehensive licences that often allow them to fish for a variety of species using multiple techniques. Buying back a portion of this licence significantly devalues what is left, not to mention the other components that come with providing the service. Further, what happens to their equipment that is now obsolete?One of the responses that the minister has given is that we dont want gillnet fishing on the reef. But we dont have net fishing on the reef; you cant put nets across the Great Barrier Reef, it simply doesnt happen. The minister needs to answer these questions.","Seafood Industry","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[9]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr THOMPSON (Herbert) ","(10:54):"
338,0,0,0,1,2,"Jones, Stephen MP","A9B","Whitlam","ALP","N/A",5784," On 28 July Australia and the Illawarra lost a magnificent human being. Professor Justin Yerbury AM was tragically taken from us, his loving family and community at the age of 49—far too young. Professor Yerbury, Justin, spent his life researching motor neurone disease, the very disease which ultimately went on to take his life. Its a terrible and relentless disease that eventually affected Justins ability to walk, talk and even breathe. But it didnt stop him living life to the full, and having passion and purpose every day. He was driven by determination and willpower. He told the ABCs Australian Story that he wasnt much of a scientist at school. He grew up in Oak Flats and he went on to become a world renowned molecular biologist.His life was shaped by terrible circumstances: MND first caught Justins attention after it struck his distant uncle and then a cousin. It took the life of Yerburys mother, grandmother and aunt, all in the space of just a few weeks. He himself was then diagnosed with the disease in 2016. He promised his mother that he would do everything he could to find a cure, and he kept that promise.I knew of him as a professional basketballer for the Illawarra Hawks, a team I have been a passionate supporter of all my life. He had already at that stage completed a commerce degree but he switched to science at the University Of Wollongong, fuelled by the death of his family and loved ones. Nearing the end of his PhD at UOW, tragedy struck again: Justins younger sister Sarah herself died from MND. She was only in her late 20s. I cant imagine how difficult that would have been for Justin and his family.This news did not slow his efforts. He drew inspiration from the great Stephen Hawking—they met and discussed the disease in their studies at Cambridge. He was in New York, delivering a lecture on his groundbreaking research, when he felt that his thumb had gone numb—the workings of MND. A genetic test years ago had confirmed that Justin, too, carried the rare genetic form of the disease. And within 18 months, Justin required the use of a wheelchair.Despite grappling with the disease himself for many years, he continued to lead significant scientific research to understand more about it. He became the professor of molecular biology at the University of Wollongong and is recognised as one of the world-leading experts on MND. His research group was established and was dedicated to examining the disease and exploring strategies to observe motor neurone health. He received many rewards and recognitions, including the Order of Australia and the prestigious University of New South Wales Eureka Prize for Scientific Research.Vale, Justin Yerbury. Youve passed, but your research will go on to help many others.","Yerbury, Professor Justin John, AM","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[10]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JONES (Whitlam—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services) ","(10:57):"

341,0,0,0,1,2,"Fletcher, Paul MP","L6B","Bradfield","LP","N/A",5785," I move:That this House:(1) acknowledges that:(a) the digital economy plays a critical role in the Australian economy, helping to drive economic growth and create new jobs;(b) the Government has not:(i) provided sufficient funding in the budget to help grow the digital economy;(ii) produced a digital economy strategy; and(c) the Government abolished the role of the Minister for the digital economy; and(2) calls on the Government to prioritise the digital economy by:(a) providing funding in sufficient levels to advance Australias digital economy;(b) delivering a digital economy strategy to make Australia a world-leading digital economy; and(c) appointing a Minister responsible for the digital economy.The digital economy plays a central role in the lives of all Australians. We know that digital transformation and the growth of the digital economy have been game changers for our nation, for our economy and for our society. We take for granted many of the benefits of digital services and products, such as Uber, for convenient transport; booking a holiday through Airbnb; or finding an appropriate support worker for a person with a disability, through Australian companies like Hireup or Mable. We take for granted the benefits that services like these, and many others, deliver us. They make our lives easier. They provide customers with greater choice and convenience.The digital economy has allowed entirely new businesses and sectors to grow and flourish, creating jobs and prosperity. Just think of the various categories which simply did not exist 30 years ago—streaming video, mRNA vaccines, drones, low earth orbiting satellites and additive manufacturing are a few that come to mind.Talking of low earth orbiting satellites, let me mention two of the many great Australian companies working in this space: Myriota and Fleet Space Technologies, both based in Adelaide, both using low earth orbiting satellites in innovative ways—one using them for services to support agriculture and many other utility type applications; and the other, Fleet Space Technologies, making very exciting use of them to support prospecting for minerals, allowing mining companies to do in a few days what would previously have taken a year or more.Of course, globally, weve seen huge companies like Amazon, Apple, Samsung and Tencent achieving extraordinary growth. In Australia, there are plenty of good success stories as well: SEEK, founded in 1997, became a top-100 company with a market capitalisation today exceeding $8 billion; Atlassian, founded in 2001, now has a market cap of more than US$43 billion.The pipeline of digital economy businesses was a major focus for the previous Morrison government. We also had a major focus on the space sector, and, again, the companies that Ive mentioned are ones that demonstrate just how important space based technology can be.Our nation, therefore, is making very good progress when it comes to the digital economy, and I was pleased to join a panel discussion recently at the Tech Summit in Brisbane, with Robyn Denholm, global chair of Tesla, an Australian businesswoman; Scott Farquhar, co-founder of Atlassian; and other tech sector leaders. I reflected there on the progress that has been made since I first got involved, in a public policy sense, in the sector in the late nineties.But there is much more that needs to be done, and, frankly, the current government needs to work harder. We need a clear commitment from the current government that the digital economy is a clear national priority. We need to work on driving digital take-up in sectors which lag, including the small business sector. A recent survey found that nearly a third of small businesses are still doing their record keeping largely physically; theyre still collecting the invoices and chucking them in a shoebox, and, at the end of the year, taking them to their accountant.If youre not using cloud based internet accounting services like Xero, MYOB or many of the other service providers, then, almost certainly, you also dont have a digital sales and marketing strategy. And that means youre missing lots of customers and every year youre likely missing more customers as, with each passing year, the percentage of Australians who are digital natives—those who wouldnt think of going anywhere but online to work out where the business or product that theyre looking for is to be found—gets higher and higher.We need to see a national digital identity system. This was a major priority for the Morrison government. There was a lot of work done—some $600 million was spent on it—but this has really drifted since the current government came to power. And we need more of a focus on the digital delivery of government services. Unfortunately, this government is more interested in responding to the pressures that they get from union bosses, who are much more enthusiastic about the 1950s-style backward-looking economy. But Australians are going in a different direction. They want government services delivered digitally. Our economy needs to be more digital, and that will continue to be a focus for the opposition.","Digital Economy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FLETCHER (Bradfield—Manager of Opposition Business) ","(11:00):"

346,0,0,0,1,2,"Lawrence, Tania MP",299150,"Hasluck","ALP","N/A",5786," The world has moved on a little. We cannot speak of the digital economy now as something separate from the economy as a whole. There was a time when we could, back in the 1980s and the 1990s, for example, when the widespread use of computers and the internet was new. Paul Keating, in the 1990s, spoke of the emerging digital economy. Now, almost everyone on the planet is walking around with at least one computer on their person every day. The digital economy is the economy.Even what we still refer to as primary industries—mining and agriculture—are infused with the use of digital technology. To put it bluntly, pig farming is getting very technical these days. It shouldnt be a surprise that, when we refer, for example, to the Minister for Communications, we dont use the term minister for digital communications. When we speak of the digital economy now, we need to be more nuanced, lest the term be meaningless. We can certainly identify and speak of the emerging technologies—all of which are wholly or partially digital. These include robotics, cybersecurity, new applications, payment systems, AI, quantum computing and others. The motion calls for a minister for digital technology. Of course, the minister for science and technology already holds this role; he covers the digital field well. In some ways, this seems to be a motion in search of an issue.Perhaps the member for Bradfields motion is coloured and confused somewhat by the confusion in the last Morrison ministry! Senator Hume did have the moniker digital economy tacked onto her assistant ministry of superannuation and finance, but in the areas of science and industry it became a little muddy. After 15 April 2021, the member for Cook was Minister for Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, and were not sure what the then Minister for Industry, Energy and Emissions Reduction, the member for Hume, thought about that, nor what the Minister for Science and Technology, the member for Durack, thought about that—but it must have been very confusing. Australian voters dont have to worry about that now because they have a government with clearly defined roles; a prime minister with one job, which hes doing extremely well; and ministers who are very enthusiastic in their policy areas.But I can still hear the motion calling out from the far past: Wheres the digital strategy? We had a digital strategy. Wheres your digital strategy? I cant cover all the relevant work being done by the government in this area in the few minutes left, so Ill just touch on payment systems, cybersecurity, robotics, AI and quantum computing. In terms of payments, in June this year the Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer released the Strategic Plan for Australias Payments System. It included cybersafety, phasing out cheques, the broader use of digital ID, upskilling the workforce, the use of AI and many other facets.In terms of cybersecurity, in December last year, the Minister for Cyber Security appointed the Cyber Security Strategy Expert Advisory Board and opened consultation on the 2023-2030 Australian Cyber Security Strategy. In February this year, the Prime Minister led a round table on cybersecurity. In March, Australia was ranked No. 1 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as the country showing the most progress on cybersecurity. In June, the government appointed the inaugural National Cyber Security Coordinator, Air Marshal Darren Goldie AM, CSC.In robotics, submissions closed on 7 May for the National Robotics Strategy. The government will encourage investment in robotics and automation to invigorate the economy and improve dynamism and productivity, at the same time as ensuring a transition to safe and fulfilling jobs for Australian workers. In artificial intelligence, Minister Husic released a discussion paper in June. Safe and responsible AI in Australia looks at regulatory and government responses and proposes several options to strengthen the framework governing the use of AI. Consultations have recently closed, and feedback will be used to build on the $101.2 million in the May budget to support businesses to integrate quantum and artificial intelligence technologies into their operations. In quantum, in May, Minister Husic released Australias first National quantum strategy based on extensive consultation with the Chief Scientist Dr Cathy Foley and with guidance from the National Quantum Advisory Committee. The minister stated that quantum technologies will be truly transformative.So I thank the member for the motion. No, it isnt time for a digital economy strategy. The world has moved on, and it is a digital world. We have strategies in the areas of payments, cybersecurity, robotics, AI and quantum computing, and we have more than one minister dedicated to those tasks at hand. To his point about small businesses continuing to use shoeboxes for their invoicing and the like: be assured that small businesses are not being overlooked in the movement and education for computing and digital technology.","Digital Economy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms LAWRENCE (Hasluck) ","(11:06):"
347,0,0,0,1,2,"Violi, Aaron MP",300147,"Casey","LP","N/A",5787," I want to commend the member for Bradfield for this very important motion and also the member for Hasluck for her contribution, in which she actually confirmed why we need a minister for the digital economy. She mentioned Treasury, the Assistant Treasurer, Home Affairs and cybersecurity, the Prime Minister himself, science and innovation with Minister Husic and also communications. Thats the point: it goes across so many industries and so many ministries that you need one person developing the strategy that brings this all together. The digital economy is its own industry in its own right, but it also delivers productivity gains to so many industries. It is across all of government, which is why its so important that there is someone—one person—leading that strategy.Michael Porter is well known in strategic management theory. Im sure the member for Fraser would know him well. He would know Porters five forces. Anyone whos been in business or done anything to do with economics and strategy would know Porters five forces. Michael Porter said: If a strategy meets a goal: its working. If a strategy meets a target: its a success. The reality is that, when it comes to the digital economy, this government has no strategy, no goals and no targets. There is no way that it can deliver success in a digital economy. We need it all brought together. We need someone leading it. The former coalition government had the 2030 strategy, which was a roadmap that had objectives, goals, targets and funding behind it.The reality is that industry is frustrated. I am very fortunate to have spent three years prior to becoming the member for Casey working in the digital economy. Ive still got many friends in the industry. I speak to many stakeholders and many business owners, and they are frustrated. They are feeling let down by this government because they know theres not a strategy. As the member for Hasluck said, we are at such an exciting time with artificial intelligence, quantum and medtech. We know that the health budget is under significant fiscal pressure at the moment, and medtech is an amazing opportunity to not only help people with health but also take costs out of the health system. There are so many opportunities to create jobs and to provide more efficiencies, and this government doesnt have a plan or a strategy.One of the big benefits of the digital economy outside its own industry is productivity. We know that our productivity isnt where it needs to be. Its going to be one of the key pillars thats going to bring inflation down and take some pressure off cost-of-living challenges, which all Australians are going through. In its five-year report earlier this year, the Productivity Commission had a whole section dedicated to digital technology and the important role that that would play in driving productivity growth for generations to come. Its transformational, but, again, we dont have a minster to bring that strategy together to drive that productivity.Lets be clear that, when were talking about the digital economy and that industry, were talking about an industry thats estimated to be worth $315 billion over the next decade. It is an industry that is estimated to create 250,000 new jobs by 2025. Thats $315 billion of economic growth and a quarter of a million jobs to be created, and this government doesnt see fit to have a minister for the digital economy.As I said, its also about productivity and efficiency. If you think about it, were going to see many people going to watch the Matildas and the soccer tonight. Theyll be able to sit at their table and not have to go to the bar. They can scan a QR code and order what they want. That makes it easier for that hospitality venue to get them their drinks and their food quicker, make sure that theyre saving money and make sure that its an efficient time for that business and a great experience for all those people cheering on the Matildas. Ill be one of those people tonight, and Im looking forward to that.That is what this is about: driving productivity and greater opportunities for business, as well as improving experiences for consumers. We saw the recent AI report that the member for Hasluck referenced and, disappointingly, it exclusively looks at the risks of AI. There is nothing about the economic opportunities, which is why we need a minister for the digital economy taking advantage of these economic opportunities for our country.","Digital Economy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VIOLI (Casey) ","(11:11):"
348,0,0,0,1,2,"Garland, Carina MP",295588,"Chisholm","ALP","N/A",5788," In many ways this is quite a strange motion. Its quite misleading. Im not sure what battle those opposite are fighting when we look at what our government is doing in having a holistic approach to the digital economy. This is a motion around something very superficial, about a name for a ministry, rather than the substance of what were actually doing to achieve real progress in the space of the digital economy. Its something we take seriously and its something we see that we need a whole-of-government approach on. This is why we understand the intersection of the digital economy across many portfolios, including Treasury and communications—to name a couple that my colleague and friend the member for Hasluck outlined already.Lets look at what were doing. Lets look at how the digital economy is already embedded in the work that our governments doing. Frankly, Im not terribly surprised that those opposite are stuck in the past and fighting a fight that has already moved on, because on this issue, like so many, they are looking backwards rather than looking forwards, which is our governments focus. Before Labor won government in May last year it really was only possible to characterise the previous decade of government as a decade of waste and neglect. That is perhaps in no way clearer than when it comes to the digital economy.The previous decade saw the former government exhibit a startling lack of understanding regarding the role that the digital economy could play in determining the future of our country. This laziness caused both them and, more importantly, Australia to lose out on some of the biggest shifts in the digital age. With digital technology revolutionising sectors and propelling global economic development, unfortunately, Australia found itself trapped in the past due to the lack of vision from those opposite. Thats a past that they are still seemingly trapped in right now, during this debate. Those opposite, satisfied with the status quo, selected a path of stagnation rather than lifting their vision, lifting their ambition for this country, embracing the digital revolution and investing in vital areas like digital infrastructure, research and development, and cybersecurity. Were all poorer for that failure.The lack of investment, of financial resources, allocated towards digital infrastructure, such as fast broadband networks, significantly impeded our capacity to contend with global competition. Other countries were creating state-of-the-art digital infrastructure while we were forced to struggle with sluggish internet speeds and spotty access. Weve suffered a great deal as a result of the inability of those opposite to invest in the foundation of the digital economy. Im really pleased that were changing that in so many ways.We know cybersecurity has been an area of neglect. We know the devastating impact that scams are having in our communities, having lost $3 billion as a nation last year to scammers. Its amazing what difference a change of government makes in addressing this terrible issue. We are committing $86.5 million over three years to combat scam activity and online fraud. Imagine $3 billion ripped out of our communities because those opposite allowed scammers to take advantage of our communities. We are investing $58 million in funding for the ACCC to establish the National Anti-Scam Centre, which launched earlier this year, and were also establishing an SMS sender ID registry, which will help block scammers from infiltrating legitimate text streams. This issue is of utmost importance to my community. I go around to community groups across my electorate and I speak to people about what they can do to prevent scams, because it is really unacceptable that so many people are being targeted by criminals in the way that they are, and its a shame that we werent able to take action over the past decade.Lets look at what were doing in the digital economy beyond just that. Were discussing central bank digital currencies. Those opposite are still obsessing over ATMs. Were discussing seamless real-time digital payments. Were building a framework to ensure electric vehicles can be built in Australia, rather than goading car industries and other manufacturers to leave our shores. Those opposite say one thing and do another. They barely moved the needle on tech jobs when they had the opportunity, despite the platitudes we hear in this place today. As with a lot of things, we just get a lot of rhetoric but very little action, the opposite of our government. Im really pleased to be a part of the Albanese Labor government.","Digital Economy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr GARLAND (Chisholm) ","(11:16):"
349,0,0,0,1,2,"Spender, Allegra MP",286042,"Wentworth","IND","N/A",5788," I thank the member for Bradfield for moving this motion and for the opportunity to speak about the digital economy. I share the members enthusiasm for Australias tech sector. Australians often think of tech as foreign firms like Apple and Meta, but they dont always know what an incredibly vibrant and local tech sector we have here at home. We have homegrown unicorns such as Atlassian, Canva, SafetyCulture and Airwallex; we have a huge amount of world-class talent; and we have a dynamic venture capital community. Its a sector that already plays an important role in Australias economy but one that could play an even more important role in the future.Tech is important not just because of the jobs it creates or its contribution to GDP but because it is a key enabler of success for other businesses and because it plays, frankly, a direct role in improving our lives. Its a particularly important part of the economy of Wentworth, where Im from. The tech sector is actually the second-largest industry of employment in Wentworth. I feel very fortunate to have met so many local people who are helping to grow and develop the sector here in Australia. Im particularly grateful to those who could work anywhere in the world but have chosen to base themselves in Sydney and help build the Australian tech community. We have been enormously successful over the last decade, and I hope this success continues.But that success requires the support of government and effective policy frameworks. One of the challenges for the tech sector, I think, is how to coordinate a range of policy areas so that they all support the tech sector effectively in this country, because alternatively it can mean that ministers are working at cross-purposes, such as when the Treasurer is trying to build business productivity and the industrial relations minister is trying to build reforms that undermine it. A lack of coordination can also mean that important policy issues slip between the cracks, as we see with small business, which falls sometimes to the small-business minister, sometimes to the Assistant Treasurer and sometimes to the industry minister. Its a similar problem with the tech sector, where policy issues can fall between the Treasury, industry, education and skills and migration portfolios. Theres a clear need for someone at the cabinet level to have responsibility for coordinating across these portfolios—someone to act as a single point of contact between the sector and the government and someone to be a champion for the sector from within government. Whoever is appointed should, as the motion suggests, prepare a digital economy strategy that will guide policymaking across government.The tech sector has ambitious goals. The Tech Council wants to grow the industry so that a million Australians are employed in tech jobs by 2025, the industrys contribution to GDP is $250 billion by 2030, and Australia becomes the destination of choice for those looking to start and scale a new business. To reach those goals, the government will need to refine its policies across a range of portfolios. In the Treasury space, the R&D tax credit and fringe benefits tax need to be redesigned, long-delayed payment reforms need to be implemented, and we need to ensure our institutional frameworks support the types of investment vehicles that work for startups and for tech companies. In the education and skills space, we need to lift our game with research commercialisation, improve the quality of some of our IT degrees and provide good pathways for skills development outside of universities. In the migration space, we need to make it easier for the worlds most talented entrepreneurs, coders and others to relocate to Australia and make a contribution locally.I commend the activities the government has put forward in these places, but I still feel very strongly that this coordination across the tech sector could play a very valuable role in improving the outcomes for the tech sector and for the broader economy. Id like to see the Prime Minister appoint a digital economy minister and direct that minister to produce a digital economy green paper by the end of the year, with a white paper to follow next year. Ideally, this would be a bipartisan strategy that provides us with a clear roadmap for the digital economy, including long-term goals and actions it will need to take to support the industrys development.","Digital Economy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SPENDER (Wentworth) ","(11:21):"
350,0,0,0,1,2,"Ware, Jenny MP",300123,"Hughes","LP","N/A",5789," I rise to speak in favour of this motion brought by the honourable member for Bradfield, who has been a passionate advocate for advancing and supporting Australias digital economy for a long period of time. Our digital economy is now an integral part of the lives of Australians, whether it be e-commerce, e-marketplaces, online education courses, streaming platforms, social media, videoconferencing, e-health or offering innovative work-from-home solutions. According to the ABS, Australias digital activity accounted for $118 billion, or the 6.1 per cent of our economys total value, in the financial year 2020- 2021. Therefore, the Albanese Labor governments failure to prioritise the digital economy is incomprehensible. This is now directly impacting the future prosperity of our country.The digital economy is not just a passing trend; it is the foundation of our future economic landscape. It plays a crucial role in driving economic growth and creating new job and study opportunities for Australians. It is transforming age-old production sectors, from agriculture to law to health. Despite its undeniable significance, the governments policy approach to the digital economy has so far been woefully inadequate. It needs is a comprehensive digital economy strategy to guide us towards becoming a world-leading digital economy. Without a clear roadmap and concrete actions, Australia risks falling behind in the global race for digital supremacy. Moreover, the lack of sufficient funding allocated to advancing Australias digital economy and lack of investment in digital infrastructure, research and development will limit our future ability to stay competitive and leverage the immense opportunities offered by digital economies. To make matters worse, the governments decision to abolish the role of the minister for the digital economy is regressive. This is a move that demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the importance of the digital landscapes significance and highlights the governments disregard for the potential benefits that can come from prioritising this vital sector.Australians are renowned for our innovative spirit and inventiveness, as evident from our impressive contributions to the world in various fields. From the hills hoist to the black box flight recorder to wi-fi technology, the winged keel, Vegemite and the cochlear implant, our nation has consistently pushed the boundaries of human achievement. Australians have similarly embraced the digital revolution, whether as innovators, startups or users. We therefore need a government that will support this revolution and prioritise the digital economy. I particularly want to recognise the role played by many tech companies within my electorate of Hughes.Therefore, I call upon the government to do three things. First, allocate sufficient funding to bolster Australias digital economy. Without adequate investment, we risk stalling our progress and lagging behind other nations in this digital race. Second, the government needs to develop and implement a comprehensive digital economic strategy, a framework that outlines clear goals and actionable steps. This strategy must be forward-looking and ambitious, positioning us as leaders in the digital landscape. Third, we need a minister appointed that is directly responsible for the digital economy. This critical position is essential for coordinating efforts and ensuring that digital transformation remains at the forefront of government initiatives.The governments lack of emphasis on the digital economy is a missed opportunity. Embracing the digital revolution is not just a matter of choice; it is a necessity for our nations future growth and prosperity. It is time now for the government to step up and prioritise the digital economy to ensure a brighter and more innovative future for Australians. The coalition will be constructive here. We urge action and intelligent, constructive planning to support and bolster Australias digital technologies.","Digital Economy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WARE (Hughes) ","(11:25):"

353,0,0,0,1,2,"Thwaites, Kate MP",282212,"Jagajaga","ALP","N/A",5790," I move:That this House:(1) acknowledges the release of the report of the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme, a 990-page report that examined the establishment of the scheme and who was responsible for it, and made 57 recommendations;(2) recognises that the Robodebt Scheme, which was put forward as a budget measure in 2015 and was found to be unlawful by the Federal Court in late 2019, caused great harm to vulnerable members of the Australian community;(3) notes that despite the mounting warnings and criticism of the scheme, in the words of the report the Government of the time continued to illegally raise debts against some of societys most vulnerable;(4) commends the courage, leadership and bravery of victims, families, advocates and whistle-blowers who continued to raise concerns about the Robodebt Scheme; and(5) welcomes the Governments commitment to ensuring such a tragedy never happens again, and to carefully consider the recommendations from the report and provide a response to these recommendations in due course.Robodebt was a crude and cruel mechanism, neither fair nor legal, and it made many people feel like criminals. In essence, people were traumatised on the off-chance they might owe money. It was a costly failure of public administration in both human and economic terms. Those are the findings of the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme. There are 434,901 people who are known victims of robodebt. This includes as many as 2,125 victims in my community.The impacts of robodebt went far beyond those who were told that they owed money. Children, parents, family members, community members and loved ones were all impacted by this scheme—all impacted in so many ways because of the program that those who sit opposite operated for years, despite the warnings and the criticisms and despite the fact that we now know it was illegal.In a way, we shouldnt be surprised that over these years the Liberals ignore the warnings, because if theres a chance to be nasty, if theres a chance to punch down on people in our community who we should be lifting up, then the Liberals will take it.Of course, one of the chief proponents of the scheme in the coalition government was the member for Cook. The member for Cook has described himself as a bulldozer. When it came to welfare, to the social security net that holds our country together, he was—self-described—a tough cop on the beat. As both a minister and as a prime minister, issue after issue, he decided hed just crash through, regardless of the impact on peoples live. The royal commission found that the member for Cook allowed cabinet to be misled. The commission found:He failed to meet his ministerial responsibility to ensure that Cabinet was properly informed about what the proposal actually entailed and to ensure that it was lawful.And yet, despite these findings, just last week the member for Cook made it clear he will not be changing his mind on the role he played in the robodebt scheme. In fact, he dismissed the findings of the royal commission as disproportionate, wrong, unsubstantiated.The now Leader of the Opposition has called those words from the member of Cook, his former boss, a strong defence. The Australian people have a right to ask the now Leader of the Opposition, Who do you support? Whose side are you on? Are you on the side of the victims of this illegal scheme or are you on the side of the member for Cook, the bulldozer? At the moment it seems like the Leader of the Opposition still cant bring himself to side with the victims.It is vitally important that we do not forget the stories of the victims of robodebt, to ensure that we never see another government running a scheme like this. This is a commitment our government have made—that we will work to ensure we never, ever see a scheme like this again. We understand, as the royal commissioner said, that anti-welfare rhetoric is easy populism that doesnt build up our country but just drags us all down. That, of course, is not what those on the other side have done. The nasty party are happy to engage in a bit of welfare bashing.Rosemary Gay, an age pensioner, gave evidence to the royal commission. Rosemary said of the pension:… (it) help[ed] keep my head above water financially. This benefit has enabled me to live my life with dignity and to pay my living expenses. It has been particularly important given my health issues and inability to work full-time.Of course, Rosemary was shocked when she received a debt notice in late 2016, and then part of her age pension was withheld to pay the debt. Rosemary said to the commission:It turned my life upside down. It was just sheer terror that I owed a figure that was such a huge amount that Ive never earned that much money. How could I owe that much money? I could not possibly owe that amount of money to Centrelink.Rosemary, the pensioner affected by this scheme and whose life was turned upside down by this scheme, knew it wasnt correct yet, over years and years and with successive ministers, those opposite, who should have known and should have asked questions about what was going wrong and about why people were being slugged with these inaccurate, wrong and ultimately illegal debts, did not ask the questions. They failed these victims.Rosemarys story is just one of many shared during the royal commission. I want to acknowledge every victim, their families, the advocates and the whistleblowers, who, despite the roadblocks they hit, kept going. They didnt let others shut them down. They, I hope, are reassured by our governments assurance that this will never happen again.","Pensions and Benefits","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms THWAITES (Jagajaga) ","(11:30):"

358,0,0,0,1,2,"Fletcher, Paul MP","L6B","Bradfield","LP","N/A",5791," Todays motion is another step in Labors relentless political attack on the social security compliance program carried out under the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments. It is deeply regrettable that the Minister for Government Services devotes such a large proportion of his time and energy to this unceasing political attack rather than concentrating on improving the delivery of government services to the millions of Australians who rely on them today.A clear risk of this royal commission is that it will make the Public Service more timid, more risk adverse and less likely to think creatively and ambitiously about how best to serve the government of the day and in turn the Australian people. High-performing organisations in the private and public sectors encourage their people to generate ideas and to take risks. Many of the recent advances in the government services space at the federal level have relied on emulating best practice in the private sector and in other countries.Consider the rollout of voice print, digital assistants, digital identity and video chat appointments, amongst many other reforms, delivered under the coalition. Consider in New South Wales the scrapping of the old motor registries, replaced by Service NSW model pioneered by then minister Victor Dominello and the New South Wales coalition government. These new ways of service delivery required innovative thinking from both the Public Service and within government.If we are to do a better job of serving the public, it is important that public servants feel they are expected, encouraged and supported to develop, propose and implement evidence based public policy. It is also important that ministers can encourage and rely on innovative advice from their departments. Both of these desirable outcomes are, in fact, deeply threatened by the ferocious politicisation of the outcomes of the former governments income compliance program.The royal commissions report makes it crystal clear that the central idea was developed by officials within the Department of Human Services. I do not say this to be critical or to point the finger; I say this because it is an example of what we want public servants to be doing—generating ideas. But how will any rational public servant in the future conduct himself or herself, at least in a world where the member for Maribyrnong remains in the parliament prepared to trash the careers of public servants if it will gain him a short-term political advantage?Equally troubling is the novel doctrine put forward by the royal commissioner that, in the future, ministers should not feel confident in acting on the written advice of their departments. It is not in factual dispute that the then Minister for Social Services in taking forward a cabinet submission for the income compliance program did so on the basis of a formal new policy proposal prepared by his department which said on its face that no legislative amendments would be required to implement the proposal. Yet the royal commissioner says the then minister was under a duty to second-guess and to doubt this advice and, because he accepted it and took it forward to cabinet, he in some way had breached his duty.I think, with respect, this conclusion makes no sense and is very bad for public administration. It is, yet again, a regrettable consequence of the ferocious politicisation of this matter, carried out by the member for Maribyrnong. Let us be clear. Our governments, the former Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments, made mistakes with the Income Compliance Program. They were made based on the clear advice of the Public Service that the program was lawful. Once that advice changed, we acknowledged the mistakes on our watch, and we fixed it on our watch. The incorrectly raised debts were cancelled, all who had paid such a debt had it refunded or had their debt zeroed, and the then Prime Minister apologised to Australians.One other troubling consequence of the member for Maribyrnongs royal commission is that it appears to reject the idea that there should be continuing scrutiny over the validity of social services payments and an ongoing process to identify instances of overpayment, whether innocent or fraudulent. To the extent that the royal commissioner puts this proposition, I express strong disagreement with it. Every dollar paid in social services benefits is a dollar raised from a hardworking Australian taxpayer, and taxpayers rightly expect that there are controls in place so that social services benefits do not go to people who are not entitled to receive them under the law. Its very important we draw the right lessons from this royal commission.","Pensions and Benefits","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FLETCHER (Bradfield—Manager of Opposition Business) ","(11:36):"
359,0,0,0,1,2,"Templeman, Susan MP",181810,"Macquarie","ALP","N/A",5792," For more than 2,000 people in the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury, getting a letter telling them that theyd been overpaid a social security benefit was the start of a long-running nightmare. Before it had a name, it was a threatening letter, often from a debt collector, with a payment due date and a series of instructions but no explanation as to how the debt was calculated. I saw those letters. They were cold, impersonal and, as we now know, largely automated. We now know that it was robodebt. For the pensioners, students, disability pension holders and many others who were sent these letters, the royal commission findings brought down last month show that they were among 435,000 people who were targeted by their own government in a cruel and unlawful scheme from July 2015 to November 2019. The scheme was finally paused but not before it unlawfully raised $1.8 billion of debt against approximately 435,000 Australian. The royal commission into robodebt was our election commitment to get to the bottom of what happened, why and how, and to make sure it can never be repeated. We established the royal commission on 20 August last year, and the final report was delivered within 12 months.Its worth remembering how robodebt was designed. Under the scheme, some Centrelink debts were calculated using averaged Australian tax office income information. Averaging was applied where there was no explanation of discrepancies between income that recipients had reported to Services Australia and income data from the ATO. It was a blunt instrument with little but mostly no human oversight. In November 2019, on the day that ministers and senior public servants would have given evidence in the trial of the class action on this matter, the Commonwealth finally admitted it had no legal basis to raise these debts. The use of averaging ATO data as the sole basis for raising debts stopped. Justice Murphy, the judge presiding over the case, approved the largest class action settlement in Australian history, describing the scheme as a shameful chapter and a massive failure in public administration. Fast-forward 3½ years, and Commissioner Holmes has delivered her final report of the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme. What we saw in the 46 days of public hearings and what we heard from more than 100 witnesses was distressing and heartbreaking, with stories of how people who relied on the safety net were in fact hounded by their government with no means of fighting back. It was action where the major decisions were signed off by the former coalition cabinet, of which the current Leader of the Opposition was a member. After we announced a royal commission, the opposition leader called it nothing more than a political witch-hunt.Much has been reported about the findings of the royal commission on various ministers involved and comments made about them. But I want to highlight comments about the former self-styled senator for Western Sydney, Senator Marise Payne, who was the minister for human services. I note that more than 4,700 people in the Penrith area, the seat of Lindsay, received debts on top of those in Macquarie and across Western Sydney. We would have tens of thousands of people who received debts under this scheme.The former Minister for Human Services is talked about by the commissioner, who says:The Minister for Human Services, Ms Payne, could not remember whether the need for legislation in relation to the income averaging proposal was raised with her; she could not recall what happened to the advice that legislative change was needed and she did not have a record. Ms Payne did not remember anybody coming up with a proposal other than income averaging as a means of using ATO data. She did not have any specific recall how the question of legislative change for the proposal had disappeared and there was no material to inform her. This series of disparate and unsatisfactory answers would have the makings of a childs nursery rhyme if it were not so serious.The commissioner made note:The evidence before the Commission was that fraud in the welfare system was miniscule, but that is not the impression one would get from what ministers responsible for social security payments have said over the years. Anti-welfare rhetoric is easy populism, useful for campaign purposes.Those are the comments from the commissioner.This royal commission has gone some way to bringing a voice, visibility and some justice to those who were hounded. We want to make sure that we never see it again.","Pensions and Benefits","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) ","(11:41):"
360,0,0,0,1,2,"Daniel, Zoe MP","008CH","Goldstein","IND","N/A",5793," The royal commission puts it very simply:Robodebt was a crude and cruel mechanism, neither fair nor legal, and it made many people feel like criminals. … It was a costly failure of public administration, in both human and economic terms.Those costs include lives, unjustified financial hardship for thousands, stress, anxiety, depression and other mental health problems for many. In the end, an illegal mechanism touted to raise at least $1.8 billion ended up costing the budget $1.7 billion, not counting the below-the-line costs within the government or indeed of the royal commission itself.The report of the commission is an extraordinary document. Its preface deserves pinning to the wall of every ministers office and of every public servants office as well. It reads:It is remarkable how little interest there seems to have been in ensuring the Schemes legality … and the lengths to which public servants were prepared to go to oblige ministers on a quest for savings. Truly dismaying was the revelation of dishonesty and collusion to prevent the Schemes lack of legal foundation coming to light.Its only a week since the government pushed the Public Service Amendment Bill through the House over the objections of many on the crossbench, including me. It was precisely what was apparent in the administration, or rather maladministration, of robodebt that led me to believe that the public service legislation was inadequate. Last Thursday, the Public Service Commission revealed that it had decided to investigate the conduct of at least 16 current and former public servants. Its disappointing but understandable perhaps that these public servants had taken their lead from the then Prime Minister, the member for Cook, in his observations about accountability and his view that the Public Service should be there simply to do the bidding of the executive.A year before the 2013 election, the then opposition leader and soon to be Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, put it bluntly to the Australian Financial Review, when he declared:… what Id like to be able to say to the public service is, Look, this is how we think it needs to be done. Rather than relying on them to tell us, Id like to be in a position to tell them on day one.Thats very different from the Westminster standard that the credibility of our democracy depends in large measure on a public service prepared and able to provide frank and fearless advice. In that regard its telling that, in his initial response to the findings of the robodebt royal commission, the member for Cook defiantly declared that the inquirys findings about him were based upon a fundamental misunderstanding of how government operates. I dont believe thats how Australians expect their government to operate.Its not just robodebt. Trust in government has been frayed by revelations of secret ministries, pork-barrelling, including sports rorts and car parks, the funnelling of billions to private consultants, the PwC scandal, dodgy offshore processing contracts, and the list goes on. Its going to take a lot to rebuild public confidence. The Australian electoral study points out that just 12 per cent of respondents believe the government is being run for all the people, only 30 per cent of Australians trust government and seven out of 10 believe that politicians are more interested in looking after themselves than the community.In regard to the Public Service Amendment Bill, one central question is: what are this governments plans for strengthening merit based appointments, as recommended by the Thodey review, and to constrain the ability of the Prime Minister of the day to terminate appointments? A clear statement of intent and a timetable for action would be a good start if this government plans to put its money where its mouth is on integrity—as would some clear indications from the government for a timetable to implement the key recommendations of the royal commissions report about government services: notably, the establishment of a customer experience reference group, which would provide streamlined insight to government regarding the experiences of people accessing income support, and that make more face-to-face customer service support options should be available for vulnerable recipients needing support.Even from the interaction that my office has with frustrated constituents dealing with the variables of Centrelink, the NDIS and other services, the need for this is self-evident, as it is for accepting the commissions closing observation—considering its difficulty in accessing some key documents—that section 34 of the Commonwealth FOIA Act should be amended to make clear that confidentiality should only be maintained over any cabinet documents or parts of documents where its reasonably justified. Documents should not be labelled cabinet-in-confidence merely to avoid inconvenient disclosure. The faith of the community in the quality of democracy and our public service demand it.

361,0,0,0,1,2,"Mitchell, Brian MP",129164,"Lyons","ALP","N/A",5794," Politicians need to lead a change in social attitudes to people receiving welfare payments. The evidence before the commission was that fraud in the welfare system was minuscule, but that is not the impression one would have got from what the ministers responsible for social security payments said over the years—theyre not my words; theyre the words of the royal commission. And yet we had the member for Bradfield, a senior minister in the former government and now Manager of Opposition Business in the Reps, trotting out the same lines about hardworking Australians paying for social security and completely ignoring the words of the royal commission.I want to address this point before I get to the body of my speech. Todays hardworking Australian is tomorrows person whos busted their back. Today theyre a hardworking Australian; tomorrow their relationship has broken down, theyve lost half their income and they need support. Today theyre a hardworking Australian; tomorrow they might suffer an emotional breakdown and need income support. We are in this together. This nasty politics of pitting hardworking Australians—taxpayers—against those who require income support at some time in their lives has got to end. It was a plea from the royal commission. Just stop it! And yet we had the member for Bradfield continuing it this morning. Im so distressed to hear it because what we had in those years of robodebt were hundreds of thousands of Australians damaged by having debts unfairly raised against them—money they did not owe—that they were ordered to repay. It was a disgraceful and shameful chapter in Australias history, and yet the member for Bradfield seems to have learnt nothing.For four years, from 2015 to 2019, robodebt unfairly and illegally racked up debts against innocent Australians—Australians who deserved help and assistance from their government but instead received betrayal and humiliation. Over four miserable years, robodebt billed $1.8 billion against nearly 435,000 Australians, including more than 4,300 in my electorate who had fake and illegal debt notices issued to them. Concerns about automated income average debt recovery, robodebt, emerged early. By late-2016, the Australian Council of Social Service was saying, Youve got to stop this. Our electorate offices—Im sure its the case for the Deputy Speaker and everybody in this chamber—were being inundated by people saying they were being forced to pay back debts they did not owe.By January 2017 Labor formally called for the program to be stopped. I recall, four weeks later, in February 2017, that I stood on that side of the chamber asking the government why it hadnt responded to our call for this scheme to be halted. I made many of the points Im making now back then. And yet it continued till November 2019, nearly three years later. The member for Bradfield would have us believe it was some sort of divine prophecy that they decided to go ahead with it.But why 2019, you may ask? Thats when ministers and senior public servants would have had to give evidence in a class action against the Commonwealth for the scheme. It was only then, four years after robodebt started stealing from Australians, that the Liberals finally admitted that they had no legal basis to raise the debts falsely issued to 435,000 victims. That was it. It took that, and they kept it operational up until the last minute. Presiding judge Justice Murphy referred to robodebt as a shameful chapter and a massive failure in public administration—not just a failure but a shameful chapter overseen from start to finish by the Member for Cook first as a minister and then as Prime Minister. We pledged at the election that we would have a royal commission, and we put one up under Catherine Holmes, a former Supreme Court justice in Queensland and commissioner of the Queensland floods commission—a very eminent Australian. She delivered a report with 57 recommendations. It makes for very tough but required reading for every member of this House. The testimony of former ministers and senators and of senior public officials displayed disturbing levels of wilful ignorance, and the heroes were the low-level officers who tried to sound the alarm. The heroes were also, of course, the victims and their families who testified. Never again should we see such a shameful chapter in Australian governance.","Pensions and Benefits","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) ","(11:51):"
362,0,0,0,1,2,"Wolahan, Keith MP",235654,"Menzies","LP","N/A",5794," I thank the speakers who have come before me. Australians expect us as the opposition to hold the government to account, and often that means that in motions like this we come up here and we fire back, but I wont be doing that today. There are times when we have to acknowledge when things were wrong on our side and there are lessons to be learnt. There are a few reasons for that. One is that its not honest to do otherwise. Opposition is a time to reflect on how you can do better if your party is given the honour of being in government again. People wont listen to you when you actually have valid criticisms if you dont look within.We all come to this place with our experiences. I was a barrister for 12 years before this. In the early days of the scheme, someone I know well came to me and said: My daughter is distraught. Shes got this letter, and I dont know what to do. I looked at it and I offered to help her pro bono, which means you dont charge. The more I looked into this, the more I realised something was going wrong quite early in this scheme. Then I heard of others that were in a similar position. What struck me quite early on with that one example was the unfairness of it and how it was not competent. As someone whos a Liberal and believes in the sanctity of the individual, due process and the presumption of innocence, it offended all of those. It was illiberal, it reversed the onus and it hurt people.And it hurt people on a large scale. We now know—I didnt know at the time—that close to 500,000 people were affected. I saw one number of 470,000. The scale of that did warrant a royal commission. It was warranted, and that process is something that we should review carefully. It is a 900-page report with many recommendations. We have an onus here, whether were in the executive or in the parliament, like we are, not to blindly follow every recommendation. Despite the distinguished qualifications of commissioners, theyre still people too, and its an administrative inquiry, so we must do a proper reflection upon all of the recommendations.We must also, going forward, recognise that we still have a duty to have a strong and sustainable safety net. Im proud of Australias safety net, and the member who spoke before me is right: any of us may find ourselves in the position where we rely on it. Even if you dont rely on it, I like to know that its there for my fellow Australians when they need it. That system should be one that is compassionate. It should still incentivise work for those who can work and for whom work is available. It must be affordable and sustainable. We have that duty to those who pay taxes, and we also have that duty because of the impact that excessive spending will have on inflation, which affects everyone.But, when you look at this particular scheme, in trying to achieve some of those objectives it overreached and it wasnt properly scrutinised. At all levels of government, we should be conscious of the feedback loops when we hear that something has gone wrong. If someone drafts legal advice that says something might be illegal, that should be properly considered and passed up and down the chain of decision-making. We must never tell decision-makers just what we think they want to hear; we should tell them the truth all the time, and that should be timely. It seems, from my reading of the evidence that came before the royal commission, that there was a breakdown in that flow of information, where honest, frank and timely advice wasnt being properly moved up the decision-making chain and probably wasnt being properly considered as well.This scheme was illiberal, it was unfair and it was incompetent. We must all learn the lessons from it, and we must do so in a way thats above politics. There is excessive joy about this scheme by some, and we see it in the House every day. I ask for us all to reflect on that. I understand why that would occur, but there are lessons to learn about how to have a competent, fair system of welfare in this country, because Australians deserve no less.","Pensions and Benefits","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WOLAHAN (Menzies) ","(11:56):"
363,0,0,0,1,2,"Burnell, Matt MP",300129,"Spence","ALP","N/A",5795," Id like to put on Hansard that maybe the member for Bradfield should read the good member for Menziess contribution. That was a fine contribution in this House.I have a list of thanks. I thank the member for Jagajaga for moving a motion in this place on an issue of such importance not just to the people of Australia but to the people of my electorate of Spence. Through the sad, sorry saga better known as robodebt, we had over 6,300 victims in my electorate of Spence. That number was multiplied further by the families affected by vicariously living through their ordeal at the hands of the previous government. Without indicating that this is by any means over, I thank the Minister for Government Services and the Attorney-General for their unwavering efforts to disinfect this dark chapter of Australias history with a dose of sunlight.I thank the former members for Aston, Fadden and Pearce—although not in the same manner as I have above. Despite this not being the only point of controversy that brought about the ends of their political careers, to an extent they would inevitably have seen the writing on the wall at some point throughout the robodebt time line, no matter how late, and they realised that their actions were not compatible with being a member of this place, let alone a minister. This is not an issue that is a partisan attack, despite what some in the opposition and some elements of the media would have you think. This is not Liberal versus Labor. In the time I have known the current members for Aston and Pearce, I have developed a strong feeling that they would do so much better than their predecessors. For that matter, I would like to express exactly the same hope for the newly-elected member for Fadden as well.Then there is the member for Cook. For some out in the community, it is a fact that they have a family member who is no longer with us, as a constant and eternal reminder of robodebt—something that will haunt them forever, something that nobody can take back and rectify. For others, seeing the member for Cook still sitting in this place feels like nothing more than a slap in the face. In this 47th Parliament, the member for Cook has delivered five speeches, three of which were nothing more than him defending himself against any number of scandals during his time as minister and, indeed, as Prime Minister.I note that the Leader of the Opposition called a royal commission into robodebt nothing more than a political witch-hunt, which is what one must do when one is harbouring a coven within ones party room. It is one of the most systemic failures of government, coupled with the most egregious examples of those who have been found wanting by the final report having made every attempt to shirk any responsibility for the part they played whilst holding some of the highest offices in this land.Despite the lack of responsibility shown by the ministers who were at the coalface of the scheme, I thank the brave victims of robodebt, families of robodebt victims, advocates and whistleblowers for coming forward, either to the royal commission itself or in the years leading up to this reckoning through all channels leading from the electoral offices of our local members of parliament—those are sometimes the best way to get the word up the food chain that something is seriously wrong. Seriously wrong is an absolute understatement. Despite that, when in government all the way to now, those opposite did everything they could to downplay this—and Im not talking about subjective things like undermining the role of the royal commission itself. Im talking about the mistruths and using lines like, Robodebt was something used by governments on all sides, or that it was in fact set up by the Minister for Government Services himself when in government. This is completely misleading all and sundry, or at least attempting to.The fact is that they knowingly tweaked the system that was used to help identify debts and then be checked by staff members. Instead, they had a scheme that took the human element out of it entirely. A computer punched out a debt notice, it was sent out to the unknowing victim of the robodebt and the onus was placed on them to prove their innocence. Some of these alleged debts could have been from years ago, meaning they were stuck having to find old payslips and bank statements, often at a cost to themselves, just to try to get this debt to go away.The moral of this story is that when you take the human element out of government, bad things can happen. We cant forget that lesson lightly, especially when we know that these acts and omissions by many senior figures in government and the public service at the time had a human cost attached to them. This is something that nobody should ever forget.

Thats because right now theyre supporting an Olympics infrastructure plan that will see the destruction of a local public school, with hundreds of schoolkids displaced, and a much-loved public park that is one of the only bits of community infrastructure in one of the fastest-growing areas in Brisbane.We know that the total cost of the Gabba demolition is apparently $2.7 billion, but Labor is keeping Queenslanders in the dark about what that actually covers. Does it cover the $100 million to move the school? Does it cover the warm-up track? Does it cover converting the stadium back into a cricket and AFL stadium after 2032? Does it cover the construction impacts on four major arterial roads that surround the stadium? We know, based on the average cost blowout of Olympics infrastructure, that the real cost could be as much as $6.7 billion—13 times what the federal government proposed to spend on social and affordable housing every year. Its very hard to overstate just how destructive this decision will be.","Olympic Games: Infrastructure","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CHANDLER-MATHER (Griffith) ","(12:07):"

Its disgraceful. Its not only the school but also Raymond Park, which is home to a local football club and community garden, and which hundreds of people use every day. Never mind the fact that the IAC has said that they dont need to destroy the Gabba stadium and they could just use the existing athletic track at the Carrara Stadium. This is billions of dollars in public money that is being used to destroy a school and a public park for a four-week sporting event.I want the parents of East Brisbane State School and the broader area to know that we stand with them. We are going to fight as hard as we can to get the federal government to drop its support for this disastrous decision and, at the very least, renegotiate an Olympics infrastructure plan that puts the parents of East Brisbane State School and the broader community of Brisbane first. They must renegotiate a plan that is what was promised in the first place, which is an Olympics that has a low impact on the city.The joke of it is that we keep hearing that this is going to have a long-term benefit for Brisbane. Right now, the long-term benefit for Brisbane is the destruction of a public school, the destruction of a public park, years of disruption and a huge infrastructure project that isnt going to give the benefit that Brisbane needs. What Brisbane really needs, by the way, is more public schools, more hospitals and more investment in local infrastructure, community parks, and public and affordable housing. Instead, were getting this disastrous decision, going against the wishes of over 90 per cent of the local area. I think its demonstrative of the fact that the Labor government will go around talking about how they care about public education and community infrastructure but in the same breath they will make a decision like this.Now their decision is to move East Brisbane State School entirely out of its existing catchment. Coorparoo Secondary College is a wonderful school, but when youre telling East Brisbane and Kangaroo Point—two of the fastest-growing areas in inner-city Brisbane—that theyre not going to have a public school, what does that say about how much Labor cares about public education? What does that say about how much Labor cares about community infrastructure and public parks? Again, this is all for a four-week sporting event and could cost upwards of $6.7 billion, based on the blowout costs. Imagine what $6.7 billion could do for Queensland. We now know that what Labor wants to do with it is destroy a school and a park.

389,0,0,0,1,2,"Perrett, Graham Douglas MP","HVP","Moreton","ALP","N/A",5797," I know the member for Griffith cares about education in his electorate, and I do feel for the East Brisbane community that will be moving down the road for their new education site. Ive had schools closed down in my electorate and its quite devastating. I know that the member for Griffith flies to Canberra to complain about aircraft noise rather than catching the train down here, but thats a matter for him. But, for the member for Griffiths benefit: while the Gabba stadium is in his electorate, the 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games are about much more than just the Gabba. The best part about these games is that 85 per cent of the facilities already exist. The Albanese government isnt funding the destruction of the Gabba at all. In fact, were funding the construction of a Brisbane arena, a new 17,000-seat indoor entertainment venue in the CBD, right alongside the Roma Street Parkland.I dont know how many times the member for Griffith—whos just exited the chamber—has gone to a concert or a show at the current Brisbane Entertainment Centre in Boondall. Its quite a journey from the south side, and that piece of Brisbane infrastructure is certainly showing its age. Brisbanes live music and entertainment need a venue in the CBD with excellent public transport access. The new arena will have this link to a newly built Roma Street station, thanks to the Palaszczuk government investing in Cross River Rail. There will be construction of five new sporting venues, including the Breakfast Creek indoor sports centre, the Chandler indoor sports centre, the Sunshine Coast indoor sports centre, the Moreton Bay indoor sports centre and the Redland Whitewater Centre. All will be upgraded and all will be legacy assets scattered throughout south-east Queensland, not just in Woolloongabba and Griffith.There will be some upgrades, along with temporary structures, to nine existing venues throughout south-east Queensland: the Wyaralong Flatwater Centre and precinct; the Sunshine Coast Stadium; the Brisbane Aquatic Centre and precinct; Barlow Park in Cairns—thats outside Griffith, I think!—the Toowoomba Sports Ground; the Brisbane International Shooting Centre in Belmont, which is well known to the member for Hunter; the Sunshine Coast mountain bike centre; the Anna Meares Velodrome and BMX tracks; and the Queensland Tennis Centre, which is not in Griffith at all but in Moreton, in the suburb of Tennyson. These will be great legacies for Queensland and Australia. The games and accompanying infrastructure will be a platform to boost and inspire more community participation in sport and promote an inclusive environment where women and girls and Australians of all abilities feel welcome and have ready access—which brings me back to the Gabba, where this motion started.Im not sure whether the member for Griffith has visited the Gabba lately or spoken to people with a disability about access and mobility once theyre in the stadium. But someone in a wheelchair having to use the service lift isnt acceptable in 2023 and certainly wouldnt be acceptable in 2032—nor would a major sports stadium not having dedicated change rooms and facilities for women.A new Gabba will also deliver an eco-friendly facility. I do note that at one stage the Greens political party position, as put forward by the former Greens councillor Jonathan Sriranganathan, was to tear down swathes of Toohey forest in my electorate, destroying metropolitan koala habitat, just to save the Gabba. I actually saw a koala in the Toohey forest on Sunday. I think it would be a badly thought out policy to destroy inner-city forest for the sake of protecting the Gabba.Swinging back to public transport, the Gabba will have, obviously, a new station right across the road, which will be crossed on an elevated concourse so there will be no more traffic problems. People in Brisbane going to the games will be able to hop on a train and hop off at the Gabba.Lastly, the member for Griffith has tried to compare Brisbanes Olympics and Paralympics with Victorias cancelled Commonwealth Games. I point out that the Olympics is the second biggest sporting event in the world, sitting just behind the FIFA Mens World Cup and just ahead of the FIFA Womens World Cup—go the Matildas tonight!These green games will see the world looking to Brisbane and Queensland and will deliver an unprecedented opportunity to showcase the state as a world-class tourism and business destination. It is also a chance to promote the Queensland arts sector. What a great opportunity for our musicians, artists and performers—and our First Nations people, because theyre going to have a central place at the games. They will be the heartbeat, whether through song or dance or stories and connection. It will be an opportunity for the world to immerse itself in the worlds oldest continual living culture: 65,000-plus years of knowledge, words and wisdom.The Paralympics and Olympics arent just about the rebuild of an old and tired stadium. Theyre about people from all over the world putting their eyes on Brisbane.","Olympic Games: Infrastructure","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PERRETT (Moreton) ","(12:12):"
390,0,0,0,1,2,"Bates, Stephen MP",300246,"Brisbane","AG","N/A",5798," From November 2022 to February 2023 I ran a survey across my electorate of Brisbane, and I thank the 713 residents who took the time to share their views and have their say, particularly around the Brisbane 2032 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The survey asked some simple questions: how do you feel about Brisbane hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games, and why do you feel this way; do you have any suggestions for ways the government can ensure the games have a positive legacy for Brisbane residents; and do you think that all infrastructure built with public money for the games should remain in public hands?On multiple occasions, respondents indicated their concern regarding the impact of the games on housing affordability, an issue that continues to be brought up with my office by constituents. Between the 1980s and the 2010s, Summer Olympics related developments displaced more than two million people. Theres a long history of city cleansing in the lead-up to international events, as happened in Brisbane during the 2014 G20 meeting and on the Gold Coast during the 2018 Commonwealth Games. As a result of Expo 88, house prices in South Brisbane rose by 238 per cent in the 11 years before the event. That same trend has occurred in Olympic host cities around the world, and, given Australias current housing crisis, this is extremely concerning. The 2032 games could provide an opportunity for the government to tackle the housing crisis head on by investing in publicly owned housing, by cracking down on short-term stays like Airbnbs and by capping rent increases.The Brisbane community overwhelmingly agreed that any infrastructure built for the games with public money should be kept in public hands. The athletes village, for example, will host 10,000 athletes and team officials for the Olympics and more than 5,000 for the Paralympics, all inside the Brisbane electorate. So, rather than selling off this housing, like we saw in Sydney and on the Gold Coast, this housing should be turned into beautiful, accessible, publicly-owned housing for anyone who needs it. My office is currently running a petition calling on the government to do just that, so, please, add your name to it.Our communities expect transparency in government, but neither the Labor state government nor the LNP city council have provided transparency around Brisbanes Olympic bid—or the planning that has been carried out since, for that matter. In fact, council held a closed-door meeting when they voted in favour of hosting the games, locking the public out and keeping the details private. This was the first closed-door meeting in 15 years, and the last time this happened was for the Clem7—a project now infamous in Brisbane, and one that went bankrupt. Compare this to Germany, where they held a referendum in the two cities that were considering hosting the games, Munich and Hamburg, and both cities residents voted no.In 2019 the Queensland government commissioned multinational accounting and advisory firm KPMG to analyse the economic impact of the games. It was initially estimated that the games would provide $7.4 billion worth of quantifiable economic benefits. Flash forward to May 2021: this figure was increased to $8.1 billion, but $3.5 billion of that was for ambiguous social benefits like health, prestige and civic pride. In November of last year it was revealed that the original $1 billion cost for the redevelopment of the Gabba stadium was not actually based on any business case or viability investigation; it just came from a press release put out by the state government. The Premier then announced that her government would assume control of the games infrastructure projects and scrap the planned independent body, the Olympic coordination authority. This is extremely alarming and further entrenches a lack of transparent decision-making and community consultation.Now, Brisbane residents should be excited by the 2032 Olympic Games. But we have to ensure that they are done right. Holding closed-door meetings, abolishing independent oversight bodies and making up cost shortfalls with civic pride will not ensure a positive legacy for our city. We need an open and transparent Olympics, real investment in public infrastructure and housing and to ensure that anything built with public money remains in public hands.","Olympic Games: Infrastructure","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BATES (Brisbane) ","(12:17):"
391,0,0,0,1,2,"Repacholi, Dan MP",298840,"Hunter","ALP","N/A",5799," I want to begin today by reminding the House that there are two parties in this place voting no to building more housing in Australia: the coalition, which is expected, and the petty, whingeing Greens. This is nothing more than a political stunt. They say we need to pick between housing and the Olympics. I have news for them: we are committed to both. If they really care about housing, why are they blocking the bill that would see more houses being built? Wouldnt building new houses right now be better than none at all? They are the definition of letting the perfect get in the way of the possible. If they were stuck in the cold, they would say no to the offer of a jumper because they wanted a heater.I will show some sympathy to those representing the Greens. Im not shocked that they are so out of touch with everyday Australians. Theyve probably never played sport before in their lives. No wonder they cant see why the Olympics are important and why its necessary to make sure that the games are of the highest standard possible. They just dont get it—and they are walking out of the chamber, once again. But, for me, it is the arrogance, over the lot, that is the frustrating part.Housing, education and health are all important, and they are also some of the top priorities. But they are not the only things deserving of funding. Just because the member for Griffith has never watched sport in his life, it doesnt mean its not important to other people. Your own interests dont define what is and isnt important and what does and does not deserve to be funded.Sport unites our country. It is a fundamental part of our national identity. Our country has never been more united than when Sydney hosted the 2000 Olympics. People still talk about it to this day. This is an opportunity for us to feel that sense of national pride and collective excitement again.The Greens say that they speak for lots of different groups in society, but one group they seem to have forgotten are our athletes. Athletes dedicate their lives to sport. They sacrifice so much, including time with their family and friends. An elite athlete does this for moments like a home Olympics. Olympics are the peak for athletes, and it is rare that they get to share the peak of their careers with all that they love. An Olympics at home makes this more possible.Ive been lucky enough to go to five Olympics. I know what it means to be an athlete. I know what it means to the cities that host them, and I see the benefits to all those in our country who unite and cheer on our athletes and give them the recognition and glory that they deserve. But the Greens want to take this away. They want to burn lifelong dreams and destroy opportunities to inspire our young people.The Olympics can light a flame in the young people of Australia and inspire them to work hard on their dreams. A home Olympics will be the breeding ground for our next generation of sporting superstars, and it gives current young athletes something to work towards. Athletes in this country deserve world-class facilities, and Olympics provide the perfect opportunity for them to be given these facilities by upgrades to stadiums like the Gabba. The new and upgraded facilities in Queensland will be used long after the Olympics are over. Just look at Stadium Australia in Sydney. I think we have made more than our moneys worth out of that. Its now hosting one of the biggest womens sporting events in the world, 23 years after it hosted the Olympic Games.The Greens make out that hosting the Olympics is all doom and gloom. There seem to think that there is no upside to it at all. They ignore the benefits, such as increased tourism and the boost to our local businesses and the economy as a whole. The Greens forget to mention the jobs that will be created by all the funding which goes towards the infrastructure. Its also an opportunity to showcase to the world the best of what our country do. The Olympics bring opportunities for a better future for our younger generations, because the world will take notice of Australia.I think this is a very worthy investment. I support hospitals and schools, but, unlike the Greens, I can truthfully say that I support providing more homes and also the Olympics. May I just say its also very disappointing to see the member for Brisbane and the member for Griffith not being here to finish this debate.","Olympic Games: Infrastructure","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr REPACHOLI (Hunter) ","(12:22):"

394,0,0,0,1,2,"Scrymgour, Marion MP","F2S","Lingiari","ALP","N/A",5800," I move:That this House:(1) acknowledges the sustained and dedicated effort by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) to increase the enrolment of all Australians, with a particular focus on the two cohorts of Australians who have long been under-represented on the electoral roll, being First Nations Australians and young people aged between 18 and 24 years;(2) recognises that as a result of the Government ensuring the AEC had the appropriate resources to improve enrolment:(a) for the first time since records have existed, enrolment of Australians aged between 18 and 24 years is now over 90 per cent; and(b) estimated First Nations enrolment has increased in every state and territory to the highest it has ever been so that:(i) nationwide it is now at 94.1 per cent, up from 84.5 per cent just six months ago; and(ii) in the Northern Territory it is now at 87.0 per cent, up from 76.7 per cent six months ago; and(3) condemns the former Government, for failing to appropriately resource the AEC to take action to improve enrolment of First Nations Australians, including by cutting AEC personnel in the Northern Territory who were addressing these matters.This is a proud moment for the Australian people and for the Australian government, because finally we are making huge strides in Indigenous enrolment. When we came to government, Indigenous enrolment was at 84 per cent. In just one year, we have raised this to 94 per cent. In one year we have enrolled 10 per cent of the Indigenous population. I want to thank the Australian Electoral Commission for its work. I know there are many hardworking AEC staff out there working with people on the ground to get them signed up to vote.Voting is important for our mob, particularly in the Northern Territory. For so long policy has been made around and for Aboriginal people, and for a long time Aboriginal people in large parts of Australia didnt have the right to vote. This was structural and intentionally provided for in the same Constitution which some opponents of the Voice have been trying to say shouldnt have race introduced into it. Lets just remember how things were planned out by the framers of that Constitution. Section 24 said the numbers of House of Representatives members for each state would depend on the state population. Section 25 said, and still says:… if by the law of any State all persons of any race are disqualified from voting at elections … persons of that race resident in that State shall not be counted.In other words, the framers of the Constitution were expecting that, in at least some states, people would be excluded from voting on racial grounds, and thats what happened to Aboriginal people in Western Australia, in Queensland and, from 1922, in the Northern Territory. They were prohibited from voting, and the way it worked was that you were prohibited from voting in your state or territory jurisdiction if you couldnt vote in a Commonwealth election.That wasnt fixed for Commonwealth elections until 1962. I was born in 1960. At that time the parliament I now stand in didnt accept me as having an equal say as a non-Aboriginal person in this country. That is not ancient history; this is one generation. Section 25 of our Constitution still contemplates and accepts racial discrimination in relation to voting at the state level of government in our country. People ask, Why do we need a Voice in the Constitution? Part of the answer to that question is that, without a Voice, the Constitution remains a document marked and scarred by our recent history.It took us 12 months to increase the Indigenous enrolment rate by over 10 per cent. In the Northern Territory this could have been achieved years ago, but instead what we saw under the Morrison Liberal-National government was a huge withdrawal of AEC resources. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame. Dont go talking about whats good for Indigenous people now. You clearly didnt have an interest when you were in government.This government cares. Come the 2023 referendum, more Indigenous people will have a say than ever before. In the Northern Territory there has been significant headway. For our remote communities this is huge. In 2022 the Indigenous enrolment rate was 76.7 per cent. It now sits at 89 per cent. This is a huge feat, and one we should all be proud of.I want to thank the Special Minister of State, Don Farrell, for his support and the resourcing of the AEC. Senator Farrell certainly has had many a letter from me saying that we need to do more on Indigenous enrolment. I thank the senator for his dedication and his commitment. Once again I reinforce and thank all the staff of the Australian Electoral Commission, who have done a fantastic job going around the Northern Territory and into our remote communities and enrolling a lot of our people who have been isolated or disengaged from the voting system.","Electoral Roll","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SCRYMGOUR (Lingiari) ","(12:27):"

399,0,0,0,1,2,"Stevens, James MP",176304,"Sturt","LP","N/A",5801," I rise to speak on this motion moved by the member for Lingiari. There are elements that are obviously extremely political that I dont agree with or accept as criticism of the coalition, but I certainly support the principle of this motion, which is celebrating improvements in Indigenous enrolment. Beyond question, I think thats an excellent achievement, but a job not done. Im certainly in support of ensuring that everyone who is entitled to participate in our democracy can participate in our democracy. It has absolutely been very regrettable and unacceptable that, for an extended period of time—probably always—the statistics around Indigenous enrolment have not met the population-wide levels. We want to have every Indigenous Australian participating in our democracy and we will address in any way we can ways to ensure that Indigenous enrolment is at least meeting the standards and statistics that are the case for the rest of the population.I certainly welcome that outcome, but it does provide an opportunity to address the second challenge, particularly in Northern Territory remote communities—and this has been highlighted in the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters hearings Ive participated in—of the intimidation of Indigenous voters. After the 2019 election we held our standard electoral matters inquiry into the election and received some very concerning evidence in that inquiry regarding the intimidation of Indigenous voters. The best encapsulation of this was evidence received from Mrs Bess Price, whose daughter now serves in the Senate here. In her contribution to the evidence she made a very important point. She said:In the 2019 federal election I was up in Milingimbi, up north. There was a Labor man there staring people down. He came and eyeballed me and threatened me for talking to people and informing them of what their rights were. He was aggressive throughout the day, and he often had members of the community walk in with other elders of the community to show them how to vote and who to vote for.We managed to get a hold of AEC staff inside the building, and we told them: Keep an eye out for these fellows. Theyre the ones who are going in. Ive seen people going in with them and showing them how to vote, and using language—Yolngu matha was broadcasting on the radio throughout the day saying who to vote for in language. We were told that the unions had paid that radio station to broadcast in language who to vote for, and it was Labor.How appalling and disgraceful!","Electoral Roll","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr STEVENS (Sturt) ","(12:32):"

Certainly, comment has been made about the way in which the process of community consultation is influenced and impacted through that sort of intimidation. I absolutely welcome improving and increasing Indigenous enrolment and, at the same time, also making sure that every element of Indigenous participation in our democracy is something that we respect and protect. Evidence of intimidation of voters anywhere, and particularly in Indigenous communities, is something that we need to look at closely and consider: who is doing this? How do we find the actors that are seeking to influence the democratic right of people to cast a secret ballot for the person they actually want to vote for, rather than being intimidated into voting for someone that theyre told to vote for? That evidence is very regrettable, and the success in Indigenous enrolment presents us now with a good opportunity to also address this concerning evidence and the claims of the intimidation and influence of people seeking to participate our democracy.","Electoral Roll","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[7]","N/A","N/A"

403,0,0,0,1,2,"Claydon, Sharon MP",248181,"Newcastle","ALP","N/A",5802," I am delighted to rise and speak on this motion put by my friend and colleague the member for Lingiari. We are lucky to live in a democracy where the right to vote is fundamental to our identity. But its not just that Australia has compulsory voting; a strong democracy depends on all citizens being able to participate equally, no matter who you are or where you live. But we know that there are barriers to voting in this country that affect some Australians more than others. Historically, there are two particular cohorts who have been underrepresented on the electoral roll, and they are First Nations Australians and young people aged between 18 and 24 years.We are a government that is determined to ensure we have a healthy democracy. A healthy democracy makes sure that all members of its community have equal access to the political process. I am pleased to stand here to acknowledge the dedicated work of the Australian Electoral Commission and some 80 community partners who are working with great success to help enrol and engage these underrepresented groups of voters. It is amazing just what can be achieved with some proper resourcing of the Australian Electoral Commission and some political goodwill.Among people aged between 18 and 24 years, for the first time since records have existed, enrolment is now over 90 per cent. The AEC set out with a target of achieving an enrolment rate of 87 per cent among this cohort by June, and it has easily surpassed this goal. First Nations enrolment is now at the highest level that it has ever been. What an amazing thing to celebrate! This is in every state and territory. Over the last six months the rate has risen from 84.45 per cent to a record high of 94.1 per cent. That means 60,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have enrolled to vote since last year. Now there is just a difference of 3.4 per cent between the estimated Indigenous enrolment rate and the national enrolment rate—what an amazing achievement! In New South Wales, Indigenous enrolment has increased over the last six months from 91.3 per cent to 97.5 per cent, the second highest enrolment rate in the country. In the Northern Territory, which has historically held the lowest First Nations enrolment rates, there has been a monumental jump from 76.7 per cent in December to 87 per cent today.These are successes that should be celebrated, but they have not just happened by chance. In the 2023-24 budget, the Albanese Labor government provided $16.1 million over two years to the AEC to increase First Nations enrolment and participation in future electoral events. The AEC has adopted new solutions and targeted approaches to achieve this goal. For example, direct enrolment is now easier for people who do not have a mail delivery service to their residence. Its a common issue in remote communities, where mail is delivered to a central point. Earlier this year, the Special Minister of State endorsed a regulatory change to introduce Medicare cards as an additional form of identity for enrolling, making it easier for people who dont have an Australian drivers licence or passport to prove who they are when theyre enrolling. I am proud to be part of a government that prioritises the enfranchisement of its people.Contrast that with the last 10 years, where we had a Liberal government that ripped resources out of the Electoral Commission and tried to introduce policies that would negatively affect turnout and Indigenous participation. This included trying, and thankfully failing, to introduce a bill that would require photo ID on election day. This was a policy that would have disproportionately affected Indigenous Australians living in remote communities. As we head towards a referendum on the Voice to Parliament later this year, ensuring that First Nations Australians have input into Australias democracy and a say in matters that impact their lives and community is especially important.According to the AEC commissioner, Tom Rogers:The referendum will have the best base for democratic participation of any federal electoral event in Australias history.That is something that every Australian should feel proud of. That is something that this government is especially proud of. I hope to see those voter numbers forever increase.","Electoral Roll","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CLAYDON (Newcastle—Deputy Speaker) ","(12:37):"

These delays within the defence industry have led to uncertainty for small and medium enterprises in particular, threatening many of those SME businesses and forcing them to consider leaving the industry.What is the industry body saying about this? Brent Clark, the CEO of the Australian Industry Defence Network, says this in relation to delay after delay by the Albanese government in the defence industry: Apparently our strategic circumstances are so dire and so consequential that the Defence Strategic Review had to change the Australian industry involvement to simply being an achieved item as long as we do not hold up gaining capability. We will say that any opportunity we have, we will say that to any journalist we can and we will say that to Defence when we have to do. This is not a Defence issue. This has nothing to do with the Department of Defence. This has everything to do with our politicians. We do not believe that this government, the Albanese government, is treating small and medium enterprises in a fair and equitable manner.He went on to say: The DSR has opened a can of worms that cannot be closed. The DSR, by virtue of saying that speed to capability trumps Australian industry involvement, means that at every turn the excuse of not using an Australian company will be viable. Why? Because you actually have to put effort, time and money into getting Australian companies qualified for supply chains. If I have a pre-qualified company from overseas, my speed to capability is faster. We are not having a go at any prime contractor in this; this is wholly and solely directed at the federal government—the failure of the Albanese Labor government. We acknowledge the governments agreed recommendation from the DSR, stating that Australian industry content and domestic production should be balanced against timely capability acquisition, and that requires financial support. The issue is that there isnt financial support. There is absolutely no new money from the Albanese government in the forward estimates in the next four years—not one new dollar.Members here could imagine if we were in government and we came in and said, No new money for education, no new money for health, no new money for the ABC or whatever. Imagine how those opposite would react. Worse still: weve actually heard the defence minister in this place come in and say its not how much money it is; its how you use the money. Can you imagine if we said that about schools? What would those opposite say? Theyd be hitting the roof. But, when it comes to Defence, the DSR states that we have a short time frame, and, for those watching, there is not one new dollar from this government in the next four years. In fact, CASG is cutting billions of dollars out of Defence. They need to cut another $4.3 billion out of Defence to achieve their aim, and this is actively removing small and medium enterprises from the supply chain.If we were at war, for example, the missiles for our frigates would be gone in 30 minutes. Then the ship has to sail back to shore. Where are the stockpiles? Weve got no stockpiles. What are the minimum stockpiles that this government has set in the last 18 months? Theyve ordered nothing when it comes to 155-millimetre munitions. We have enough munitions to last a week, all under the Albanese Labor government. With HIMARS missile capability delivered from the DSR—the only thing—they are first due to be delivered in 2026, and to date the project hasnt even been allocated a number for purchase. How many defence industry companies have the minister or the Minister for Defence Industry met with? There are very few. As Ive moved about South Australia, Victoria and Queensland, there have been very few.Labor is asleep at the wheel. Do better. Its not just words; show us your actions.

411,0,0,0,1,2,"Smith, David MP",276714,"Bean","ALP","N/A",5804," Im pleased to be able to rise to speak to this private members motion. Im pleased to have the opportunity to discuss all the good work the Albanese government is doing in defence, contracting and procurement. At the same time, I am perplexed; the member of the Petries motion seems to have forgotten the last decade. The motion decries the fact that our government has initiated reviews into Defence and defence procurement. This ignores the fact that these reviews remain necessary due to the shameful mismanagement in this space by the government of which the member was part.On the side of the House, we understand deeply the complexities of defending our country and the detail which underpins that important endeavour. We understand the vital importance of our defence industry not only for capability development, not only from the perspective of sovereign capabilities but also for growth and job creation. Indeed, I understand these issues well. Its no secret that I worked for many years for Professionals Australia, the union representing white-collar defence industry workers. I worked closely with Defence workers across the economy and at almost every level of the procurement and manufacturing process. I saw first-hand the atrophy and drift the previous government inflicted on the defence industry sector. The lack of action and the lack of direction left industry players at a loss and unable to make plans or see a future for themselves here. Our defence industry workforce found itself in a directionless state. I found this situation utterly frustrating and unacceptable, as did many of my colleagues. Thats why we came into government with a commitment to fix our defence posture and our defence industry policy, and thats exactly what we have been doing.Lets not forget the absolute mess in defence industry and procurement that we inherited upon taking government last year. The ANAO told us in October last year that a series of projects are facing major delays and budget blowouts. The combined value of these projects comes to more than $69 billion. As defence expert John Blaxland put it today, defence procurement has been messy, expensive and inefficient. What are some of these projects? One is the Hunter class frigate program, beset by major delays in the start of construction to the tune of four years, with a $15 billion blowout in costs, all hidden by those opposite when they were in government. Another is the C-27J Spartan battlefield airlifters. This capability was delivered four years late, and, despite their name, the C-27J Spartan battlefield airlifters cannot actually fly into a battlefield. Then we have the offshore patrol vessel project, a critical capability for our border security. This project is already one year behind schedule. Similarly, the evolved Cape class patrol boats are a year late, the new battlefield command system is three years behind schedule, and then there are defence satellite communications projects, which are running up to four years behind schedule. These projects are all critical to our security and enhanced defence capabilities. Their successful and timely completion are critical to the security of the country. A policy and culture of atrophy and drift from those opposite let these and other projects wither.This drift not only jeopardised our security but robbed our domestic defence industry of the certainty needed to make contract and investment decisions. When the member for Petrie complains about the challenges facing Australias defence industry and looks for someone to blame, Id suggest he find a mirror. Indeed, he is part of a government that had six defence ministers in nine years. Their record on the question is one of abject failure. It is a failure that we are here to correct. The Albanese government is committed to ending the drift and atrophy in Defence and building and strengthening our domestic defence industry. We will enhance and strengthen our defence industry by giving it clarity and guidance. Well give it clarity and guidance through our soon-to-be-released defence industry development strategy. Through this, we will grow our sovereign industrial base and provide more opportunities to our defence industry to participate in a meaningful way in big projects like AUKUS. We are getting on with fixing the mess left by those opposite. Stunts like this private members motion just demonstrate that they have learnt nothing.","Defence Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[5]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DAVID SMITH (Bean—Government Whip) ","(12:48):"
412,0,0,0,1,2,"Violi, Aaron MP",300147,"Casey","LP","N/A",5804," I want to commend the member for Petrie for this important PMB today. Its no doubt that if we get a strong defence industry it plays a key role in our national security. The Albanese Labor government unfortunately have become obsessed with reviews, roundtables and discussions, and its having a profound impact on all Australians. While Australians grapple with the rising costs of living, energy prices through the roof and some of the most uncertain times for our nation in terms of national security, the only action that this government has taken is to announce review after review. Importantly, this is having a devastating impact on Australias defence industry, which has been left grappling with uncertainty created by those opposite. Anyone who has worked in business knows how important certainty is for businesses. It allows them to invest capital, to get their workforce structure right and to service loans. The Albanese government is not providing this certainty for industry. The Australian Financial Review reported on 11 April this year:Australian defence firms say they have been forced to delay investment and hiring decisions because the federal government is holding off making acquisition decisions …With nothing but uncertainty from the people running this country, businesses cant invest in machinery, they cant invest in upskilling staff and they cant make plans to secure our ongoing national security. Thats what this government is playing with. This is despite the governments agreed recommendation of the Defence strategic review warning of Australias deteriorating strategic environment and calling for an increase in defence funding to meet our strategic circumstances. That funding has not been forthcoming from this government. The review found that Australias industry content and domestic production should be balanced against timely capability acquisitions, but this requires financial support from the government. Without financial support, we run the risk of losing more contracts overseas, which would negatively impact on our sovereign capability. We will lose the ability to make those things that are so crucial for our defence industries, our defence and our country. With pillar 2 of AUKUS having a focus on AI, quantum, hypersonics and cybersecurity, it is vital that we have a strong and robust defence industry to execute on these technologies and develop our sovereign capability.And its not just around this strategic review. Another great example of this government not being prepared to make the right decisions in our national security is not having a minister for the digital economy to make sure that these AI businesses, cyber businesses and cybersecurity can work in our defence industries but also in our domestic economy, building their strength. I had the opportunity last week at a Tech Council event to speak to quantum companies and to AI, and they were talking about the synergies and opportunities in defence industry and the commercial sector. This government is dropping the ball in both spaces, which impacts our national security. Its important that we support Australian businesses in the defence industry.One great example of an innovative business is SYPAQ, which has developed low-cost drones under a $1.1 million Defence Innovation Hub contract from the previous coalition government. These are drones made of cardboard. They come flat packed and can launch—flying up to 120 kilometres—and land by themselves. These have been manufactured here in Australia—down in Melbourne, actually—and are now being sent to Ukraine to help the Ukrainian forces. This is just one example of Australian innovation and ingenuity creating jobs in Australia and securing the national security.The Albanese Labor governments disconnect with the Australian defence industry should alarm all Australians because it shows their complete lack of understanding of the challenges our nation is facing. It shows a lack of urgency around what is arguably one of the most important roles of a federal government: protecting our borders and keeping our nation safe. I urge the government: dont spend so much time looking in the rear-vision mirror and talking about the previous government. Youre no longer in opposition; youre now in government. Now is the time to take action and make decisions. Stop talking about the past and actually take some ownership and deliver for the defence industries of Australia so we can have strong national security. Protect our dwindling defence budget, and advocate your Treasurer to increase that spending.","Defence Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[5]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VIOLI (Casey) ","(12:52):"

Our government is determined to provide the clarity and guidance that industry needs to make informed business decisions based on Australias priority. Later this year our government will release a defence industry development strategy that will set out a plan to grow the industrys workforce to deliver a viable industrial base and increase Australias defence export. Theres nothing that makes me prouder than seeing Australians apply their trade and their significant know-how to make stuff that is the best in the world.We are committed to supporting the Australian defence industry so we can make more of the critical defence equipment that we need here in this country. Were also delivering the AUKUS submarine program with our partners, which is the most transformative industrial endeavour in our history. It will exceed the scale, complexity and economic significance of the creation of an Australian automobile-manufacturing sector, which those opposite wrecked, or of the construction of the Snowy scheme.The program will create around 20,000 direct jobs over the next 30 years across industry, the ADF and the Australian Public Service: tradies of all sorts, operators, technicians, engineers, scientists, submariners, of course, and project managers—very important. At its peak, that AUKUS program will be building and sustaining nuclear powered and conventionally armed submarines in Australia and will create up to 8,500 direct jobs. Thats just pillar 1 of AUKUS—the submarines. Of course, therell be many more jobs and opportunities with pillar 2. Our decision to build infantry fighting vehicles in Australia will also support up to 600 direct jobs and many more indirect jobs.On 1 July, the government launched the Advanced Strategic Capabilities Accelerator, less than three months after the government received the Defence strategic review. Our government is investing $748 million in these capabilities over the next four years and $3.4 billion, with a b, over the next decade. This is an additional $591 million above planned spending on defence innovation over the decade.Were also focused on reforming Defence to make it a better customer for industry. Many defence projects are very complex and are at the cutting edge of technological, engineering and industrial capability, so they inevitably involve more risk. One problem—and there were many under the former government—was that defence ministers—and there were lots—failed to provide the leadership needed to effectively manage those risks. I cant recall, but I think the previous speaker said they had six ministers for defence over three terms of government under Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison. I actually think it was seven defence ministers, because you remember there was that bizarre time when there were Pyne and Paine and no-one really knew who was responsible for doing anything. As it turns out, no-one really was and nothing really got done, apart from requiring monthly reports on projects of concern or interest to the ministers for defence and defence industry.","Defence Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[5]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GOSLING (Solomon) ","(12:58):"

435,0,0,0,1,2,"Burnell, Matt MP",300129,"Spence","ALP","N/A",5807," I thank the member for Petrie for moving a motion on defence industry and the capability of our sovereign defence industry. I also join with the member for Herbert in thanking all our defence personnel for their service.Whether he intended this or not, the member for Petries motion gives our side of the chamber ample opportunity to play a bit of compare and contrast as to how we get from point A, a plan and an announcement, all the way through to point B, the delivery. I say this because I feel it would be unfair, inaccurate and counterproductive to say that those opposite do not want to see Australias defence spending and sovereign capability growing to suit our national interest in the broad sense. But we can look at a few key facts, like the Morrison government alone having three defence ministers in three years. That includes, at the tail end of the Morrison government, having their very own Leader of the Opposition himself on job. Seeing how he ran Home Affairs, frankly, makes us duty bound to examine things with a fine-tooth comb. It makes us want to look under the hood at what is actually going on within that space a little more intently.We are instantly talking about billions of dollars with our defence industry, and its only fair to review the delivery of a project beyond that point A—the announcement—against how things are faring in the approach to point B. The beginning of this examination occurred with the commissioning of this governments Defence strategic review, co-authored by the Hon. Stephen Smith, a former defence minister who served in that role in both the Gillard and Rudd governments, and Sir Angus Houston, a man who needs little further explanation of his pedigree other than to point to his serving as Chief of the Defence Force until his retirement in 2011. But the handing down of the DSR was only the starting point, and the member for Petries motion somewhat alludes to the reason why.For starters, there was the discovery that the Australian National Audit Office had identified major defence projects running years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget, with 28 projects that are a total of 97 years behind schedule and 18 projects running over budget. At least $6.5 billion of variations from the initial approved budgets were identified. We saw battlefield airlifters that cant fly into battlefields. We saw patrol boats that were built with materials that are prone to rusting, which appears problematic even from a laypersons perspective. I may not have been in the navy, but from my days as a merchant seafarer I can tell you that this is quite an obvious flaw on most types of boats. Without listing the projects, we can understand why if one falls into any of those categories it might be described as a project of concern.The Albanese Labor government understands that major defence projects are no small undertaking, requiring the hard work of personnel within the Department of Defence, the ADF and cutting-edge defence industry partners. This is by no means a simple task, but having a holistic view of our defence spend requires the government of the day, and ministers within the defence portfolio umbrella, to take an active role in monitoring projects to ensure this doesnt happen on a grand scale. Its easy to announce the spending of billions in defence as part of saying that defence spending has never been higher under a given government, but making sure that money has been spent wisely is just as critically important, albeit less flashy.Labor understands the importance of having a strong defence industry operating within its borders. As the member for Spence, Im particularly proud of the defence industry that is operating within the borders of my own electorate. Perfectly located in the vicinity are the RAAF Base Edinburgh and the Defence Science and Technology Group, in a location that is enviously connected to the Osborne Naval Shipyard, which is going to play a major role in the AUKUS build. Everyone from the defence primes to SME manufacturers knows that the future is bright in this space, with primes such as BAE Systems Australia, Saab Australia, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, General Dynamics and Northrup Grumman operating in Spence, not to mention the building of Boeings defence aircraft maintenance facility to support the P-8 Poseidon aircraft.I have many fond memories of last years Defence Industry Day held in my electorate of Spence. The Assistant Minister for Defence was kind enough to attend, give a keynote address and meet with members of the Edinburgh Industry Alliance on the day. I very much look forward to attending the next Defence Industry Day later this year. Weve seen positive signs within the industry since the election of the Albanese Labor government and the handing down of the DSR. Those in the industry that know me well will know I will always be fighting for the defence industry, as its an industry that has kept manufacturing alive in the northern suburbs of Adelaide.","Defence Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[5]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BURNELL (Spence) ","(13:08):"
436,0,0,0,1,2,"Wallace, Andrew MP",265967,"Fisher","LNP","N/A",5808," I rise in support of this motion that brought by the member for Petrie, who is the shadow defence industry minister. As a proud former government, when we were in government we as a team agreed to $210 billion worth of defence industry expenditure over 10 years. Its really interesting because, during the lead-up to the last election, when those opposite were in opposition, they said there was not a cigarette papers difference between the then opposition and the then government. We now know that that is not correct, because those opposite say one thing when theyre in opposition and do the exact opposite once they get the reins of power.Anybody who is anybody in the defence industry world would know that the DSR, the Defence strategic review, which was recently announced, had a very significant chilling effect on defence industry in this country. The shadow minister and I had the privilege of attending an AIDN—Australian Industry & Defence Network—dinner just a couple of weeks ago. The speeches that came out of that night, at a Queensland level and also, earlier, a national level, showed absolute desperation among defence industry contractors. They are staring down the barrel of having to lay workers off because of the chilling effect that the DSR has had on defence industry. Everybody has basically downed tools in the Australian defence industry because of this governments indecision.When we were in government, we made sovereign capability a catchcry. I didnt even know what it was until I came into parliament, but sovereign capability is incredibly important. I want to single out the efforts of people like Christopher Pyne, our previous defence industry minister, who really led the charge back then, and also the member for Durack and, of course, the current opposition leader. The coalition government has always believed in the importance of the protection of this country.The DSR acknowledged that previous reports into Defence acknowledged that there is no longer a 10-year strategic lead time for a kinetic war that could potentially happen in the Pacific. It acknowledged that those were the findings of previous reports, and it accepted them. Notwithstanding that, do you think that this government put an additional cent into Defence? Not only did they not put an additional cent into Defence but theyve cut a billion and a half dollars from the defence budget. That takes me back to my cigarette paper analogy. Those opposite, when we were in government, claimed that there would not be a cigarette papers difference between them and us. Really they say one thing and they mean another.It is incredibly important for this country, not only for jobs but for the protection and defence of this nation, that we continue down the route of sovereign capability. Of course, in this country we dont have the manufacturing base to be able to make fighter jets and things like that, but there are a lot of things that we can do in this country, and there are a lot of things that we can provide to the supply chain even of things like the F-35. Whilst we may not make fighter jets or helicopters, were great at building ships. We need to have that emphasis on sovereign capability in this country because—may it please God that this never happens—if this country were ever blockaded or there were a kinetic war on, we could not rely upon our just-in-time supply chains, as COVID has taught us. We need to make stuff here. To make stuff here, weve got to have the intellectual ability and experience to actually manufacture right here in Australia things that we rely on in conflict.","Defence Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[5]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WALLACE (Fisher) ","(13:13):"

Those working in this sector deserve to be paid fairly and compensated for the hours they spend not just face to face but also preparing for school. Play based learning is about listening and gathering the childrens ideas and presenting opportunities for these to be unpacked in a way that excites, engages and delights the child—be it learning to care and empathy through role-play in the family space, building skills to tie shoelaces or type on the computer, exploring mathematical concepts by sorting blocks, or learning about colours and textures when they gather leaves outside. Its about trying, failing and celebrating.If we want to heed these words, its clear that 600 hours is nowhere near enough to get this done.

Born in Launceston, George grew up on a farm in Low Head and attended school in George Town before he undertook an apprenticeship, working for a few local builders and for Comalco before spending three decades at the George Town Council as a building inspector, building surveyor and health inspector. In fact, all around George Town, George has left his legacy across the area, with many buildings, including houses, having been built or inspected by him. His son Colin said:I used to take him in the car, and hed say, I built that one … just about every house in George Town they had a crack at when he was a builder.After retiring in 2007, he was elected top of the poll in the 2009 local council election, the same year I was first elected to the council. I always found him to be very thoughtful and sincere and a great councillor who was very passionate about his local community. George eventually stepped away as a councillor following the death of his beloved wife, Pauline, after 54 years of marriage. Hes survived by three sons, 10 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, all of whom I know brought him so much joy. I particularly love the comment from Colin, who reflected on having George as his father:He did everything for us and tried to give us more than he ever had. You couldnt ask for a more genuine man—he was a great family man.Vale, George OSign.","OSign, Mr George Royden","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[7]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ARCHER (Bass) ","(16:09):"

In the incident, three vehicles caught fire and another four were extensively damaged. They included a B-double truck and a semitrailer carrying a military tank. Six people were transported to the Rockhampton and Gladstone hospitals, three with suspected spinal injuries. Diversions were put in place for people travelling between Gladstone and Rockhampton, which added significant travel time for many residents. A truck driver was killed yesterday in an accident at Mount Larcom. Yet what have we seen from this Labor government regarding rural and regional roads? We have seen review after review.The $120 billion 10-year infrastructure investment pipeline adopted by the former coalition government included many worthy land transport projects that had been identified in partnership with state and territory governments, local councils, freight industry stakeholders and communities.Fifteen roads in the Flynn electorate are included in Minister Kings infrastructure review, including the Gladstone port access road extension, the Cracow Road upgrade, overtaking lanes from Gavial-Gracemere Road to Burnett Highway, the Ginger Beer Creek upgrade and the Lowmead Road safety upgrades, to name a few.

Despite some challenges along the way, success has never been too far away for the Eastern Lions, including three championships between 2010 and 2020.

What worries me also is that these projects are only becoming more expensive.

After 15 months in office, theres not a single new project in Gippsland funded by the new government. I say to the minister: why are you punishing Gippslanders twice? They faced delays in these projects because the Andrews state government wouldnt stump up their 20 per cent to get the work started, and now theyre being caught up in your so-called independent review, which is basically a razor gang review trying to cut funding from worthy projects throughout regional Australia.

465,0,0,0,1,2,"Wilkie, Andrew MP","C2T","Clark","IND","N/A",5816," Australians need a social safety net that works for them, but, according to a group of residents in Vaucluse Gardens in Hobart, older Australians are increasingly being left behind by a safety net that is, quite frankly, not fit for purpose. Indeed, residents tell me how face-to-face services at Centrelink offices are diminishing, with the loss of a dedicated seniors counter forcing people to call or go online to access services. Moreover, Centrelinks phone systems are constantly overwhelmed by calls, with many reporting being stuck on hold for two, three or even four hours before being hung up on. Even if they get through, phone services often dont work well for older Australians, especially those with hearing loss. Add to this the fact that many senior struggle to access and use digital services and you can see why the drive away from face-to-face services is causing such anxiety.Whats more, the increasing prevalence of scams has people wary of digital correspondence, and the aftermath of robodebt has people terrified of incurring debts. Putting the onus on vulnerable Australians to contact Centrelink in ways they arent comfortable with is not only inconvenient; its discriminatory. Constituents contact my office weekly to report difficulties with Centrelink. Yes, Services Australia staff do great work under difficult circumstances, but as a system it is, quite simply, not up to the job right now.","Centrelink","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[27]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WILKIE (Clark) ","(16:39):"

A Yorta Yorta man, Ian was taken from his family when he was just three weeks old. This highly eloquent speaker set out succinctly what he believes the upcoming referendum is about. He argues that the referendum, at its heart, is about two questions. First, should Aboriginal people be able to speak? Second, should we allow Aboriginal people to speak about the things that are directly about them? Ian says the voice is not about fixing the past but what we want this country to look like in the future.Another speaker, the University of Melbournes Professor Kristen Rundle, explained succinctly why the proposed constitutional amendment takes the form it does, giving parliament the responsibility for the details, with the Constitutional change setting out the scaffolding. Professor Rundle said that she was committed to the voice because it is what Indigenous people had asked for and she trusted the process that had led to the Uluru Statement From the Heart and the Voice proposal as one of the most democratic ever undertaken in Australia.At the same function, Aunty Geraldine Atkinson, one of the founding co-chairs of the First Peoples Assembly of Victoria, said that a voice would lead to better outcomes on the ground for Aboriginal people as they would have a meaningful say on how funds would be spent and how programs would be run and operated.

A special whole-of-school assembly took place on Friday during New South Wales Education Week. Attendees included some of the schools oldest living alumni, the two Joans—Joan McGoldrick and Joan Stewart—both aged 93, who started kindergarten together in 1935, and 92-year-old Audrey Milne. Another special guest was the former Carrington school principal from 1991 to 1996—and my predecessor in this place, the former member for Newcastle—Sharon Grierson, who is, in fact, back in Parliament House this week.Carrington Public School opened on 16 September 1873 as Onebygamba Public School, which means mud crab place. It became Carrington Public School in 1889. In a traditionally working-class community adjacent to heavy industry and the working port of Newcastle, the school has always been the beating heart of Carringtons tightknit community, educating generations of Novocastrians. More than 20 per cent of students today are Aboriginal and 50 per cent come from low-socioeconomic families. Carrington Public School is providing quality public education to ensure all students get the best start in life.To mark the anniversary, students, staff and guests were presented with a commemorative T-shirt designed by artist Kulka Fahey in collaboration with the students.

472,0,0,0,1,2,"Chester, Darren MP","IPZ","Gippsland","NATS","N/A",5817," I move:That this House:(1) acknowledges that:(a) we have a world-class and sustainable native hardwood timber industry in Australia which delivers social, economic, cultural and environmental benefits for our nation;(b) timber industry workers provide invaluable skills and practical support to their communities during times of natural disasters, particularly bushfires;(c) banning native timber harvesting in Australia will result in more imported timber products, often sourced from countries with poorer environmental protocols; and(d) a sustainable native hardwood timber industry is part of the answer to reducing Australias carbon emissions as timber products sequester carbon in our floorboards, furniture and other timber products;(2) notes that the Victorian Governments illogical decision to ban all native hardwood timber harvesting on public land from 1 January 2024 is based on political science, not environmental science; and(3) urges the Government to:(a) recognise the sustainable native hardwood timber industry is an issue of national importance because of supply chain considerations and community safety;(b) include the future of the native hardwood timber industry as an issue for discussion at the next National Cabinet; and(c) support a taxpayer-funded public information campaign to explain the importance of the native hardwood timber industry and dispel the myths perpetuated by environmental activists.This motion is self-explanatory. It outlines in a very logical way the issues and the challenges facing our world-class and sustainable native hardwood timber industry in this nation, particularly in the state of Victoria. What the motion cant capture is the emotion, the anger, the frustration and the disbelief that lies at the heart of the decision to ban all harvesting of native hardwood timber in Victoria in what is a Dan-made disaster for the people of Victoria.People in my electorate of Gippsland and those in the electorate of Monash have been deceived. This has been an incredible act of treachery by the Premier of Victoria, who lied to Victorians repeatedly in the lead-up to making this snap announcement. Proud Gippslanders have worked in the bush and have provided a world-class product. Multiple generations of people have toiled and helped to keep our community safe and generate the economic prosperity of my region. They have been lied to by a treacherous Premier, who told them and guaranteed that the industry would remain in place until 2030. Without any notice whatsoever, he brought forward his announcement to 1 January next year—giving less than six months notice to these proud Gippslanders.The decision to phase out the native hardwood timber industry by 2030 was bad enough. It was based on political science, not on environmental science. At least there was time for the industry to work through some of the issues, particularly the issues around the access to fibre and log supply. This snap decision, with no consultation, showed no respect whatsoever for my community. It is devastating families today. People are losing their jobs today. People have lost their jobs already in places like the Latrobe Valley, Orbost and Heyfield.What worries me the most is that this decision is based on ignorance. Its city-based Labor MPs bowing down to environmental extremism and absolutism. Theyre saying that we must never cut down a tree on public land in Victoria again. It is bizarre and its dangerous. The alternative to sourcing our own native hardwood in a sustainable way is to import more timber from foreign countries that have lower environmental protocols. The other alternative in Victorias case is to raid other states, get a log supply from somewhere else. Thats happening already as well.There is a better way. The practical environmentalists in my region have been working with government to try to find a way to meet their expectations while also understanding that the demand for hardwood timber is not going away. The better way is the balanced and sustainable approach that the industry was trying to achieve. We in Gippsland believe in the reserves, in the national parks and in protecting old-growth forests—we believe in that. We also believe that public land, which is effectively a mixed-species plantation, is a better alternative to monoculture plantations of hardwood, which is what the Greens will have us doing in the future. A mixed-species plantation harvested on a rotational basis of decades has more biodiversity outcomes. The regrowth and revegetation that has to occur by law provides a better environmental outcome in our communities than the monoculture plantations which the Greens seem to think will answer all of our problems when it comes to hardwood timber supply to the future.Time is against me today, but I must make this point: people die when they live next door to poorly managed forest. Country communities are destroyed when decisions are made with no consideration of the impact on their social and economic life. And my community doesnt want handouts and they dont want a transition package—it will never be enough to replace their jobs and their lifestyles, and being forced to move away from the towns they love.The reason were debating this issue, which is ostensibly a state decision, in federal parliament is that it will have impacts on the cost of living, undermine our supply chains, reduce our sovereign capacity to make timber products and reduce community safety in times of bushfire, and the skills in that workforce will be gone and perhaps be on welfare on the federal government budget. So I urge the Prime Minister to take this issue to National Cabinet. I also urge the Prime Minister to consider a national information campaign so that people can actually understand how our world-class sustainable timber industry works in this country. Its worth fighting for.","Forestry Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CHESTER (Gippsland) ","(16:45):"

477,0,0,0,1,2,"Mitchell, Brian MP",129164,"Lyons","ALP","N/A",5818," I thank the member for Gippsland for providing me with the opportunity to speak about a very important industry in my electorate. I agree with the member: we have a world-class sustainable native hardwood industry in Australia that delivers social, economic, cultural and environmental benefits for regions and for the nation. Im not going to comment on what mainland state governments do, but I can tell the member for Gippsland that in Tasmania both the minority Liberal government and the Labor opposition are fully supportive of forestry. And, federally, you wont find much, if any, difference in forestry policy between the opposition and the Labor government. We went to the election in May last year supporting sustainable forestry, with a focus on growing a lot more plantations and building up the value-added sector, just like those opposite, and we are standing by that commitment. The Albanese government supports sustainable forestry, including sustainable native forestry. The native forestry sector provides more than $320 million to the national economy, and provided a net carbon sink of 35.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2020-21.Forestry and conservation are not mutually exclusive; they can and should be allies. Tasmanias native forestry sector supplies vital hardwoods and specialty timbers. The sector is highly regulated and strictly managed, with every tree taken replaced and with safeguards in place to protect fauna and flora. The cowboys have been run out of town. Its a different story overseas, as the member for Gippsland has already noted. If protesters get their way and kill the Australian native forestry sector, thousands of jobs will be lost, regional communities will be decimated and the global environment will be worse off. Trees will still be cut down, they will just be getting cut down in places where the environmental protections that underpin the Australian industry do not exist. Ive had the privilege to see timber-felling operations in Tasmania firsthand. Its serious stuff, with safety and environmental protection paramount, and a lot of money tied up in capital investment. Our Labor government supports the highly skilled jobs that forestry now attracts, including 6,000 direct and indirect jobs in Tasmania and more than 51,000 direct jobs nationally.One big difference between the former Liberal-National government and the Labor government is that were getting on with the job—were not just putting out press releases. When Tasmania Liberal senator Jonno Duniam was minister for forestry, he was responsible for the billion trees plantation program—400,000 hectares by 2030 was the goal. But by 2022, Senator Duniam had achieved just one per cent. If we stuck to Senator Dunams timetable, wed all be pushing up daisies and it would be well into the next century before the goal was achieved. I know hes only a young bloke, but the member for Gippsland, the member for Monash and I would be helping the trees grow by the time they were in the ground!In Tasmania, the minority Liberal government is in strife because mainland sawmillers are securing contracts from a state-government-owned grower, Sustainable Timber Tasmania. Local sawmillers are getting outbid unfairly for the work. I make this point because managing forestry can be a difficult business, whether youre a Liberal or a Labor government. But I can assure the member for Gippsland that forestry has the full throated support of Tasmanian Labor and the Tasmanian Labor federal MPs and senators.Lets look at some of the support the federal Labor government is providing to Australian forestry. Weve released $300 million in forestry support initiatives, including $100 million for the Accelerate Adoption of Wood Processing Innovation Program, launched nationally from my electorate earlier this year, which seeks to encourage higher-value products, use more from available resources and boost supplies for construction and manufacturing. Im proud to stand with my timber communities in supporting sustainable forestry in Tasmania.","Forestry Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) ","(16:51):"
478,0,0,0,1,2,"Broadbent, Russell MP","MT4","Monash","IND","N/A",5819," I couldnt complain about that speech from the member for Lyons. I just wish he were a Victorian politician rather than a Tasmanian politician. Regional Australia, from our point of view, has been dealt a terrible blow by whats happened in Victoria, and I come from that place too. I have lived regional forestry agreements through the Hawke-Keating government and every government since, including the Howard government, when we spent political blood and millions of dollars to get those regional forest agreements up for the states. We achieved great things on behalf of our communities to give a long-term, sustainable future for people like those the member for Lyons has just talked about.I acknowledge the member for Gippsland for bringing this very important motion before the chair to say: have a look at what theyve done in Victoria. I was at a rally while the member for Gippsland was away; I took his place at that rally to say that we as a federal parliament actually care whats going on. I didnt restrict that to Liberals and Nationals, Id like to say to the member for Lyons, because I know there are members of the Labor Party who care as well. I strongly supported the CFMEU Forestry Division, who worked out of my office to save the paper industry when it was in my electorate. The CFMEU Forestry Division worked out of my office, a Liberal Party members office, to gain what we did in those times. These were very important issues, because this industry was worth more than $1.42 billion to Victoria alone, and it affects thousands of jobs—not just the jobs on the line in the forest but jobs that go all the way out, right across our community, and I mean thousands of jobs.It is so true that people making decisions in Melbourne, for instance, in those Green seats, do not have any idea of not only what we went through before but how we argued for the sustainability of this industry and the fact that you can regrow these forests and that they are broadly beneficial to the management of the forests. As the member for Gippsland said, it is now dangerous to live around a forest that is not managed and doesnt have any cultural burning. So you may say, Right, were saving our forests from these terrible loggers, and then, in turn, you have wildfire go through, which just destroys the lot. It kills them, so the return of the forest after that takes quite a while.This is a real kick in the guts for my small communities, and its immoral for this reason. We are one of the wealthiest nations in the world, with the greatest opportunity for forest management and to lead the way internationally—as Tasmania is doing, as the member for Lyons pointed out. Its immoral because we are now going to import far more timber than we otherwise would to fulfil the needs that are here. The member for Gippsland talked about monoculture trees, particularly blue gums, that are said to replace. They may replace the fibre for the paper industry, but they will not replace the structural timber, because the make-up of the blue gum does not handle the length of timber you need before you have a knot to be able to give you structural strength without laminating. You have to laminate every bit of pith to get your outcome.So these are real issues that affect real people. I can only hope that a miracle comes, and the miracle would be that the Andrews government falls for some reason and a sensible government comes in and reverses this decision very quickly. Im here to plead for real people who are making great contributions and doing real jobs in country Victoria. Most of them live in the seat of Gippsland. That wealth that came out of that for the broader general public was more than just some timber or a tree that you see on the back of a truck going past your house every now and again. These are very important issues, and we bring them to the attention of the Australian people.","Forestry Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BROADBENT (Monash) ","(16:55):"
479,0,0,0,1,2,"Wilson, Josh MP",265970,"Fremantle","ALP","N/A",5820," Ill start with a few fundamental observations. In Australia and across the globe weve destroyed too much natural habitat already, and in Australia and across the globe we practice deforestation on a scale that has caused enormous harm to biodiversity on our planet and has put our climate system dangerously out of whack. Some estimates put the extent of deforestation in Australia over the last 200 years at 50 per cent. In 2021, Australia was named in a report by WWF as the only developed country on the list of deforestation hot spots, and, of course, we hold the unwelcome distinction of being the world leader in mammal extinctions.On that basis you may think that in a country like Australia, with all our resources and practical know-how, the status quo would at least be a cessation of further harm; unfortunately, youd be badly wrong if you thought that. Through all our activities—not just through forestry practices but in agriculture, industry and urban expansion—we continue to clear habitat in a way that pushes our biodiversity closer to the brink and continues to tip the carbon scale in the wrong direction. That doesnt mean that no clearing can or will ever occur again. It doesnt mean theres no place for very carefully managed and limited harvesting of non-plantation timber. It does mean we cant kid ourselves about the enormous harm thats already occurred.The motion refers to a sustainable native hardwood timber industry. It would have been more persuasive if it had acknowledged that the industry, for most its existence in this country, has been unsustainable and if it had acknowledged that the coalition government did nothing in particular to make it sustainable. The reality is that, after a long period in which the coalition government failed to show the stewardship required to arrest an entrenched trajectory of environmental decline, the Albanese government is making sure we can have a sustainable approach to a properly managed and renewable timber industry. If this is not done, the further harm to our environmental, social and economic wellbeing will be enormous and irreversible. Not only will there be the extinction of species, but entire ecosystems will be lost for ever—river systems and groundwater reserves pushed beyond recovery.This Labor government will not sit idle and watch that occur. Well not follow the coalitions method and leave the hard work for someone else or peddle dishonesty for short-term political gain by telling workers and communities that everything is fine and we can all keep driving towards a fast-approaching cliff. Already, the sensible and necessary measures of this government include a $300 million package to accelerate wood processing innovations, support new plantation capacity, combat illegally logged imports and provide $10 million for the Forestry Workforce Training Program. That matches the approach taken in my home state of Western Australia, where native forest logging will cease by 2024 and transitional programs include an investment of $350 million to expand WAs softwood plantations, in addition to the $80 million Native Forest Transition Plan to support affected workers, businesses and local communities in the south-west.In July I spent some time in the Great Western Woodlands, north-east of Mukinbudin in WA. Those woodlands represent the largest unfragmented temperate forest on our planet, with 16 million hectares across a range of woodland and scrubland habitats. That woodland contains more than 20 per cent of Australias flowering plant species and 30 per cent of Australias eucalypt species. In fact, the amount of floral diversity in those woodlands is comparable to the plant diversity in Canada, a country more than 60 times the size. But, of course, those woodlands are already massively reduced from their original scale because the WA Wheatbelt, which occupies 18 million hectares, was carved out of a good proportion of the incredible western woodlands when it was even greater than it is today.Timber is a renewable industry, and its a renewable material. We should produce and use timber in careful and sustainable ways. Its welcome, but in Australia weve reached the point where 87 per cent of our timber comes from plantations; we should get closer to 100 per cent as quickly as we can. Where native forest harvesting can sustainably occur, it ought to be in relatively few and small areas. Serious impacts on wild native forests and habitat, through logging or other land clearing activities, have to cease in this country and on the planet as soon as we can; otherwise, what would we expect, other than what the science shows us? Further biodiversity loss, environmental collapse and widespread and severe impacts of climate change—thats what we will get.The member for Gippsland is a very good fellow, and I reckon he would have been super frustrated over the last decade to have been part of a government that was utterly irresponsible in grasping some of the big challenges, especially when he represents a community that will be at the sharper end of some of those challenges. It is indisputable to say that climate change and environmental degradation, which are entrenched in this country, will affect rural and regional Australians more sharply than it will affect those who live in capital cities, more sharply than the people in my community. Correspondingly, the actions of a responsible government to rise up and meet those challenges will have the greatest benefits and opportunities for rural and regional Australians. The member for Gippsland and his colleagues, after 10 years of waste and neglect in government, can choose to change their tune and change their approach and be part of those solutions, or they can keep playing the silly games theyve been playing for those 10 years.","Forestry Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JOSH WILSON (Fremantle) ","(17:00):"

For the past 12 months, Ive been compelled to call out the prioritisation of ideology over need and theory over reality by this government. Ive shone light on the ideological decisions that have escalated both the costs of living and housing and energy crisis across communities in Australia .Today, I rise to ask the government to ensure that we dont continue washing over the reality of the needs of our country and our communities for the sake of metro based, ill-informed opinion that is often perpetuated by other countries, not from the experiences and practices of our own nation. Of course, Im talking about the sustainable hardwood timber industry.My very passionate colleague the member for Gippsland has fiercely represented his community and championed the sustainable practice that his local timber harvest has employed for many months now. Id like to provide a perspective of my own electorates hardworking industry for consideration. The North Coast forestry industry employs an estimated 3,800 people and contributes $184 million to the local economy. Local timber workers in my electorate of Cowper are fiercely proud of their ethical and sustainable practices—businesses like Hayden Timbers in Rollands Plains and logging contractors like Matt and Kristy Parker up in Dorrigo. I have visited logging sites in my electorate on many occasions and have seen firsthand the painstaking environmental practices they utilise every day. The true environmentalists in my state dont live in Sydney. Theyre not sitting in boardrooms deciding the green-aligned taglines that resonate with their marketing strategies. Theyre not strapping themselves to machinery attempting to gain more likes on Instagram. The true environmentalists in my state are out in rural and regional townships doing practical environmental work on a daily basis.Its not in a loggers best interest to negatively impact their environment. How could it be? The creation and management of thriving forests is literally what keeps them employed. Why would they want to destroy it? Shutting down our native timber industry is not just detrimental to the local business owners and workers in regional electorates like mine; it is detrimental to the countrys economy and, ironically, detrimental to the local and global environments that those opposite and on the crossbench consistently refer to. I should say that it was pleasing to hear in the speech by the member for Lyons that he supports the native forest industry. I hope that he goes and talks to his colleagues and explains how sustainable it is and how it should continue.A sustainable native hardwood practice is not deforestation. It is not land clearing. It is not irreversible. Our local native timber harvesters are positively impacting emissions through the planting of native saplings. They are responsibly managing local forests and protecting them from pests and introduced species. They are contributing to biodiversity outcomes. Comparatively, plantation timber, which is our only other local option, provides none of this. It is planted in cleared land and is a monoculture. Whether pine or hardwood plantations, these are monocultures. They are not contributing to our biodiversity targets. We also dont have enough of them to sustain our own building and manufacturing industries.The member for Gippsland spoke about the unfortunate reality that the meticulous and heavily regulated native hardwood practices that we employ in Australia are not shared by other countries around the world. Its from those countries that well be forced to purchase timber, at a financial cost much higher than what we achieve locally, and its those offshore forests that will be destroyed. I look forward to seeing these issues raised in the next National Cabinet and I hope to see facts about our critical, responsible native hardwood— (Time expired)","Forestry Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CONAGHAN (Cowper) ","(17:05):"

He has been an advocate around forestry for the time he has been in this parliament—possibly, before. I have to say that, in my experience, the only person I know who can match him for his fierce advocacy is Michael OConnor from the CFMMEU Manufacturing Division, who, like the member for Gippsland, does not make a secret of his position on native timber and the forestry industry, in representing his members in the way that he does.But the good news is that the Albanese government does support forestry timber and a sustainable forestry industry, as previous speakers on this side have mentioned. In my own electorate of Bendigo, we were successful in a previous round of grants that the minister for this area, Minister Murray Watt, announced, for a great local project, that I hope will seed future work. It is our First Nations Dja Dja Wurrung peoples corporation that received a grant to establish a local program where they will work on harvesting local timber through cultural thinning, for two reasons: for better bushfire management in our state parks and forests, but also to contribute towards a sustainable timber industry, for their organisation to create jobs for their First Nations people. Im not suggesting that this is in any way to replace what has been lost by changes in the Victorian landscape, but its a demonstration that, when we work with First Nations communities, where appropriate, where we can have cultural thinning or cultural harvesting, we can achieve a win-win all around.When it comes to our native forests and our native timber industry, theres a lot of work and a lot of lessons that we can learn from First Nations people. Its not as simple as some greenies would suggest—Just lock it up and walk away. That doesnt restore country—particularly in an area like mine, where we lost so much of our forest to the gold rush. What we have seen in my area, with a lot of our state parks, is the toothpick effect, where we have too many ironbarks trying to compete, and our First Nations community are quite right in saying: We have to thin; we actually have to take out a huge chunk of the trees that are there, because there is too much competition. Its also not restoring the land to the way it was, and thats what the ultimate goal is.There are other efforts that we are taking as a government. Our forestry industry, as we know, generates 51,000 jobs directly, and forest and timber wood products generated $26.6 billion in 2021-22. In 2020-21, the Australian softwood and hardwood plantation estates produced 87 per cent by volume of the logs harvested, and the remaining 13 per cent were native forest.The Albanese government is delivering on what the Morrison government failed to do. I do want to make this point. I can remember the big, grand speeches about a billion trees to be planted and new plantations by 2030. That was what the promise was, and that was what would help get us through our timber crisis. But only one per cent of those have actually been planted. The previous government needs to take responsibility for some of the crisis that were in. They didnt work with First Nations people to be able to be the advocates of where it is appropriate and necessary for there to be cultural thinning, as in the example I used earlier.Our government is working to deliver for the forestry industry in Australia. This includes $300 million in measures to support the forest industry sector. I raised one of the examples of how theyre delivering in that space in my electorate, but this is a complicated policy area, because it isnt just federal government responsibility. There is the crossover with states and territories. It is a space where there is a lot of interest.In my closing remarks I say we should listen to First Nations people on native forests, particularly on the issue of cultural thinning.

482,0,0,0,1,2,"Spender, Allegra MP",286042,"Wentworth","IND","N/A",5822," Last Sunday I had the pleasure of joining Wentworth locals in Christison Park, a beautiful stretch of land thats perched on top of the cliffs and provides amazing views of the ocean and Sydney Harbour. I was there alongside colleagues from Woollahra council to celebrate National Tree Day and join members of our community as part of Australias largest tree-planting and nature-care event. I was in the park, planting trees, tending to grasses and talking to Wentworth locals about the importance of conserving our natural environment combating the climate crisis. In that hour or two elsewhere across Australia, the staggering truth is that 52 hectares of unique and threatened species habitat were bulldozed—an area equivalent to 28 times the Sydney Opera House.Australia has the highest rate of deforestation in the developed world and, every year, we log about two per cent of our native forests. The consequences of this destruction are enormous: we are the mammal extinction capital of the world and, if we continue at our current rate, we will lose national treasures like the koala and greater glider forever. In southern New South Wales there are over 250 threatened species that have been affected by native logging in the last two decades, and most of this logging is to make low-value products like woodchip and paper pulp, which we could get from plantations instead.Beyond the damage to our environment, the logging of native forests is also making the climate crisis worse. Our native forests are an incredibly powerful carbon sink. For centuries they have taken carbon dioxide out of the air we breathe, stored it safely under the ground and used it to generate new life. When we cut them down and we burn whats left to help clear the land faster, forestry experts estimate that this generates emissions of up to 15 megatonnes each year. If we stopped logging native forests in southern NSW, it would be by far the largest carbon abatement project in the state.Whilst native forest logging is destroying our environment and accelerating the current crisis, its also costing us money. In the past two years alone, the New South Wales state Forestry Corporation has lost nearly $30 million in taxpayers money. In the last financial year, VicForests lost $54 million. In a cost-of-living crisis, where every dollar matters, this isnt how we should be spending peoples hard-earned money.The good news is that we have an opportunity to turn things around. We can protect our environment in ways that benefit our economy and provide new, high-paying jobs for people who currently work in native forest logging. This is a significant issue; I care very much about the livelihood of people who currently work in forestry, and I want to make sure that we find a way to support them through a change that is good for our environment and good for the economy. It needs to be good for those communities too.In NSW, transitioning to active forest management, sequestering carbon and sustainable tourism are estimated to have a net benefit of nearly $50 million, with plantations taking up the slack for making timber products. This transition must be carefully managed, and in New South Wales that means supporting the roughly 600 workers who are currently employed in native logging activities. We all want the best for our workers and our wildlife, so real support means a proper plan for transition. It doesnt mean creating a culture war that pits people in the cities against people in regional and rural Australia.Ending native forest logging would be good for our environment, good for our climate and good for our economy. I welcome the commitment the minister made to me in question time a few months ago that she would bring native forest logging under tough environmental laws, but I urge her to go further, to follow in the footsteps of her colleagues in Victoria and Western Australia to develop a national transition plan and to end native forest logging across Australia for good.","Forestry Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SPENDER (Wentworth) ","(17:15):"
483,0,0,0,1,2,"Rae, Sam MP",300122,"Hawke","ALP","N/A",5823," I begin by acknowledging the member for Gippsland, opposite, and noting his fierce advocacy for forestry—particularly native forestry—over a very long period of time in this place, which I respect immensely. In doing so I also make note of the member for Lyons, who spoke a little earlier on this same topic. Between them we have two fierce advocates for a sustainable forest industry here in this country from different sides of the parliament. That speaks of the importance of this industry to those of us here. The very great Bob Gordon—those that know him know—tells me that I might be the first forester in the House of Representatives, and I wear that particular mantle with a great deal of humility because, firstly, its a long time since I donned a hard hat and, secondly, most of my work in the forest sector has been in the policy space. Im acutely aware that when I hit the bush I need to be respectful.The Albanese Labor government recognises and values the important contribution the forest industry makes to Australia, particularly in regional areas. We understand that there are families, communities and regional economies that rely on forestry. In my home state of Victoria alone, the forest industry generates nearly 15,000 jobs, almost half of which are in wood product manufacturing. Across the country, nearly 51,000 Australians rely on the forest industry for work. Thats why the Albanese Labor government is investing in forestry to support manufacturing, skills, innovation and a sustainable future for the industry.Unfortunately, the former coalition government failed our forestry sector. Despite coming up with a grand plan for 400,000 hectares of new plantations and a billion trees by 2030, it only reached one per cent of this target before being tossed out by the Australian people last year. This failure to meet the growth need of the industry increased our reliance on imported products. These imports not only come from countries with questionable environmental and workforce standards but they can also undermine the potential of our domestic forest industry. Despite the significant challenge left by the coalition, the Albanese Labor government is wasting no time in delivering the support and investment that our forestry sector needs. The October budget included $300 million in new measures and were expanding the plantation estate, modernising our manufacturing processes and giving workers the skills they need in a modern, sustainable forestry industry.In April this year, 34 wood processors from right across Australia were awarded over $100 million to support them in all of their activities. In addition, the Support Plantation Establishment program will see $73.8 million invested in the establishment of up to 36,000 hectares of new plantations.","Forestry Industry","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RAE (Hawke) ","(17:20):"

These will be delivered in partnership with private industry, First Nations businesses, farm foresters and state and territory government forestry bodies. The Albanese Labor government is also partnering with the University of Tasmania to establish Australian Forest and Wood Innovation, a national research and development institute, and will deliver $100 million over the first four years of its operation. Importantly, were also investing $10 million in the Forestry Workforce Training Program, $4.4 million to combat illegally logged imports and $8.6 million to extend the regional forest hubs until 2027.The scale of our investment in forestry reflects our understanding of the important economic and environmental role it can play. We know that the forest and wood product industries generate tens of billions of dollars each year, and we also understand that, when responsibly managed, forestry can contribute to the responsible management of our natural environment. In particular, forestry can reduce our net carbon emissions through sequestration.Our native forests are an incredibly important asset for our country. Native forests remain an important source of hardwood products in Australia, delivering products that plantations cant, while also reducing our reliance on imports subject to less stringent environmental controls.

496,0,0,0,1,2,"Rae, Sam MP",300122,"Hawke","ALP","N/A",5824," I move:That this House:(1) recognises that the Government continues to strengthen Medicare through delivering the important service of the planned 58 Medicare Urgent Care Clinics which will take pressure off our emergency departments; and(2) notes that Medicare Urgent Care Clinics are designed to make it easier for Australian families to see a doctor or a nurse when they have an urgent, but not life threatening, need for care that is bulk billed.The Albanese government are delivering on our promise to roll out 58 urgent care centres across Australia. Its true that seeing a GP isnt easy. Too often, people are left waiting, or theyre unable to pay. It has never been harder to get an appointment or more expensive at the back end of it. The Albanese government is dealing with workforce shortages to address the root cause in a system that was left to languish over the Liberals wasted decade defined by missed opportunities and degradation of our primary health care system because they werent governing for all Australians; they were too busy governing for themselves. Theyve got no understanding of the people in my electorate of Hawke, and many others like it, and they dont care to know. Instead of investing in things that actually mattered to communities like mine, like our primary health care system, Medicare, child care, TAFE and so much more, they abandoned us when we needed a good government to step up and get things done.My community wont forget how they were treated by those opposite. It doesnt take long to find examples—like robodebt, recently re-litigated through the royal commission, unveiling the scale and size of the disdain they hold for our communities. In Melton alone, the centre of my electorate, 3,598 people were victimised by this illegitimate and illegal debt-recovery robodebt program. Thats more than 3,500 people in one part of my electorate who through no fault of their own were ruthlessly pursued by those opposite for debts they had not incurred. It was wrong and it can never happen again. Thats just one example of the way that my community has been treated by those opposite.So we have been given the task of helping Australia to recover. The Albanese government havent wasted a day when it comes to our record on fixing the mistakes of those opposite. During the election campaign, we said wed invest in our primary health care system. We said it was a priority. Our GPs and health workforce do amazing work across our communities. Theyre on the front lines and theyre always there when we need them most. But its no secret that our primary health system needs targeted and sustained investment to break the bottlenecks that are causing delays to care. Ive heard from locals all across my electorate that we need a solution for when you dont need the lights and sirens but waiting for a GP appointment just isnt an option.After almost 10 years of cuts and neglect by the former government, primary care is in the worst shape it has been in for 40 years—the worst shape it has been in in the history of Medicare. Bulk-billing rates have steadily declined, and only 14 per cent of medical graduates work in general practice, down from 50 per cent.Delivering an urgent care centre for Sunbury was one of my top priorities as a candidate running for election, and Ive worked really closely with Minister Butler as well as the state member for Sunbury, Josh Bull, to get this over the line. It opened up at the end of June and its already making a huge difference for locals, with fully bulk-billed services and no need for an appointment, and with all services being provided by highly trained and qualified doctors and nurses.Were doing what we said wed do. Were rolling out 58 Medicare urgent care centres all across Australia, and were kicking in almost $500 million to get this done. My Victorian colleagues are also seeing the benefits of this rollout in their electorates right across our state, whether its in Ballarat, Dunkley, Corio, Jagajaga, Bruce, Macnamara, Lalor or Nicholls. Many members in this place, just like me, are now seeing the direct benefits flow on to their electorates and their communities because we have gotten on with the job of rolling out these important centres.Ive heard loud and clear from those in my electorate that this is already making a big difference. Weve had 360 visits in the short period that the urgent care centre has been open. Whether its for sprains, broken bones, cuts, wounds, insect bites, minor ear and eye problems, or minor burns theyre putting in the work to deliver top-quality care for our community in Sunbury and, indeed, across Hawke. Its saving us time waiting in hospital emergency departments and in doing so its taking pressure off those hospital emergency departments so that we dont end up with a tertiary healthcare system that is clogged with minor ailments at the emergency end of it. Were strengthening Medicare, were making it easier for families to access quality care close to home and were meeting the needs of the community in a time frame that is realistic and that ultimately ensures that we have the best possible health care for those who need it most.","Medicare","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RAE (Hawke) ","(17:25):"

501,0,0,0,1,2,"Boyce, Colin MP",299498,"Flynn","LNP","N/A",5825," The member for Hawke claims that the Labor government is strengthening Medicare with urgent care clinics across Australia; however, there are a few things he failed to mention. The urgent care clinics promised for Rockhampton and Bundaberg remain undelivered, as the Labor government fails to meet the delivery deadline. Labor promised all 50 urgent care clinics announced during the election would be up and running by 1 July 2023, but only a handful have been established by the Labor Albanese government. It has come to my attention that these clinics have been established as a result of the Labor government simply taking over existing clinics, which fails to deliver one more doctor and one more consult for patients. Experts on the ground are even advising that the clinics will not take the pressure off of Australias health system as promised. The governments failure to establish and deliver the original 50 clinics within their own time frame is a blatant broken promise.Since this Labor government came to power it has become more difficult to get access to a GP. Our healthcare system is under serious pressure and now they have broken their promise on delivering urgent care clinics in Rockhampton and Bundaberg to relieve the local hospitals. A local doctor in my electorate has told me that he has 5,000 patients on his books. Labor promised local residents that they would establish this additional health service, yet their failure to meet the deadline proves that they cannot be trusted to deliver real and urgent outcomes.The Albanese government continues to prove that Labor only prioritises health during election campaigns and it fails when it comes to delivering the services that the people of the Flynn electorate need. For instance, in the election campaign Labor ran the platform policy of: Child care. Medicare. Aged care. Labor cares. Here are the facts. Child care is in crisis, Medicare is in crisis, aged care is in crisis and the Labor government is in crisis.Lets look at their record since they took office in May last year. Kindergartens in Biloela and Mount Morgan have been forced to close. GPs across the Flynn electorate are leaving the region and closing their clinics. An aged-care facility in Mount Morgan has announced that it will close. Labor also promised that every urgent care clinic would be open during the extended times of 8 am to 10 pm as a key part of their operation, but it was revealed in budget estimates that this wont even be the case.The Labor government was elected on a platform of strengthening Medicare and all weve seen so far is our Medicare system weaken. Weve seen 70 telehealth services cut from Medicare. Weve seen mental health service rebates slashed in half. Right around the country were seeing the ramping at our hospitals getting worse and worse. Labor promised that they would make it easier and cheaper to see a doctor, but the Labor government has ripped doctors out of rural and regional Australia by changing the distribution priority areas. Without an urgent and comprehensive workforce strategy to address the workforce crisis it will not be easier to see a GP, no matter how many headline promises they make.For all their rhetoric on prioritising health and aged care leading to the election, this Labor government continues to ignore the biggest issue facing both systems, which is workforce shortages. By refusing to develop a strategy to address this urgent issue our healthcare and aged-care systems remain under serious pressure. Labors promises have delivered only headlines with no practical outcomes. Australians must look to this governments actions and not its words. It is harming our aged-care system by fast-tracking undeliverable requirements, it has removed critical support from Australians struggling with their mental health and it has redirected desperately needed doctors away from rural and regional towns in Australia.Communities in my electorate of Flynn in the Rockhampton and Bundaberg regions are desperately awaiting an urgent care clinic that was supposed to be up and delivered months ago. However, it is becoming more and more evident that this Labor government has sold the Australian public a lie, and its the people of my electorate who are suffering the outcome.","Medicare","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BOYCE (Flynn) ","(17:30):"
502,0,0,0,1,2,"Lawrence, Tania MP",299150,"Hasluck","ALP","N/A",5826," Labor is the party of Medicare, which will celebrate its 40th birthday in February next year. This has been proven time and time again, perhaps never so emphatically as by this government this year, with policies and budget provision to support Medicare, as Minister Butler has said, into the 21st century. We have seen significantly cheaper medicines at a time when cost of living is an issue, a tripling of the bulk-billing incentive in the May budget for those most in need, extension of public dental services, more after-hours primary care, expansion of general practice and scope, a boost for mental health services and real support for health workers.The Medicare urgent care clinics are an excellent way to address pressures in the health system. There will be 58 of these delivered around the country during this term of government. I will focus my remarks on the clinics being rolled out in Western Australia. The areas earmarked by the health minister for Medicare urgent care clinics in WA are inner Perth, Rockingham, Joondalup, Midland, Murdoch and the regional locations of Bunbury and Broome. The Perth urgent care clinic at Morley and the Rockingham clinic are now operating, and the Joondalup clinic at Clarkson has been nominated and will be open soon. Midland lies in the centre of my electorate of Hasluck, and Im keen to see the establishment of the Medicare urgent care clinic there. The urgent care clinics will not only enable local residents to attend for urgent care across extended hours without having to worry about the cost of treatment but also mean that pressure is taken off hospital emergency departments.When the Joondalup urgent care clinic was announced it was welcomed by the Joondalup Health Campus, where there are about 100,000 presentations to the emergency department every year. A spokesperson for the hospital there said: A number of these patients are lower acuity presentations requiring urgent care rather than emergency care. Many of us have had the experience of presenting to the ED during a busy period and having to wait for hours for treatment. The urgent care clinics will reduce the need to go to hospitals and make the jobs of the nurses, doctors and support staff at emergency departments easier too. Once established, some of the pressure will be taken off the EDs at hospitals close to each of the urgent care clinics, including the Fiona Stanley and St John of God hospitals in Murdoch, Broome Hospital, Rockingham General Hospital and Royal Perth Hospital.I know that this will also be appreciated by the staff at the St John of God hospital at Midland, once the urgent care clinic is established there, for this hospital emergency department currently caters for over 6,000 presentations every month. It is a relatively new hospital, and it has a fabulous reputation amongst my community and the health profession. Any way that we can support the work of those doctors, nurses and associated health workers and support staff will enable them to continue to provide quality care into the future. The Midland urgent care clinic will service not only Midland but also Kalamunda, Guildford, the Swan Valley and the hills communities around Mundaring and beyond into the wheatbelt towns as well as the growing northern corridor centred around Ellenbrook. I have actually already made a representation to Minister Butler for a further urgent care clinic to be located in Ellenbrook, hopefully in the near future, as the northern corridor of Perth is one of the fastest growing populations not just in WA but across Australia.The coalition should have matched this promise and they should now be lauding it, but instead they continue to focus on their negativity. The member for Moore is currently moaning on his website about the Joondalup clinic not yet being operational. Will he then congratulate and praise the government and its policy when it starts operation in the coming weeks? Theres no point whingeing about a clinic or service that your party had no intention of providing in the first place. The government went to the election promising 50 clinics and expects to deliver 58 by the end of this year.As Paul Keating said:The underlying principle of Medicare was the health of any one of us should be important to all of us.I find it interesting that there is a whole generation of adults whove grown up never knowing life without the Medicare system, and I hope they treasure and value Medicare as much as my cohort and those older who might remember a time when the cost of medical treatment could be a significant obstacle to seeking it in a timely fashion. I look forward to hosting the minister for health in Hasluck and seeing the opening of the Medicare urgent care clinic in Midland in the coming months.","Medicare","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms LAWRENCE (Hasluck) ","(17:35):"
503,0,0,0,1,2,"McIntosh, Melissa MP",281513,"Lindsay","LP","N/A",5827," Today I rise to speak on the member for Hawkes motion relating to Medicare urgent care clinics. I find the level of self-congratulation quite extraordinary in relation to this motion and other motions in the health space put forward by Labor government members. Towards the end of the 2022 election campaign, the now Minister for Indigenous Australians made her way into my electorate of Lindsay and made an announcement at Nepean Hospital with the Labor candidate, saying that, if the Labor Party won office, Lindsay would have its own Medicare urgent care clinic. We are more than a year beyond the commitment, and yet there is no clinic open for residents from Emu Plains to Colyton and Londonderry to Luddenham. Right across my electorate of Lindsay, we do not have this urgent care clinic. Rather, we have seen this Labor government commit to a time line which has already been broken.We were told the urgent care clinics would be operational in the first year of the Albanese government. In fact, the Minister for Finance, Senator Gallagher, when probed by the shadow health minister, Senator Ruston, in Senate estimates told the committee that in November last year they were still working towards the 12-month deadline. Further down the track, the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the member for Hindmarsh, told Australians, on the ABCs Insiders, that 50 clinics would be up and running by the end of the last financial year.Some urgent care clinics have opened in Victoria. The state governments priority primary care clinics were taken over by the Albanese government and rebadged as a Medicare urgent care clinic. The minister, today, in a media release, said Westmead, which is in Western Sydney, was getting a Medicare urgent care clinic, but the clinic is actually in Wentworthville and not at the Westmead health education and innovation precinct, which would have been an ideal location. Of course, the clinic is being delivered in the Labor member for Parramattas electorate more quickly than other areas of Western Sydney.My community was promised this commitment. We know from the New South Wales Bureau of Health Information statistics that the emergency department at Nepean Hospital is struggling and needs support. This motion says that 58 clinics will take pressure off emergency departments. Well, Lindsay is waiting, and were sick and tired of excuses from the Labor government on its commitments to our community. The Nepean Blue Mountains Primary Health Networks website has been updated very recently to say that Lindsay would have an urgent care clinic in Penrith. Well, its actually going to be located in Jamisontown.I thank the GP service for their assistance in running the service. However, I am disappointed that the Labor government misled our community that the Medicare urgent care clinic would be co-located at Nepean Hospital. A co-location at the growing health precinct surrounding Nepean Hospital would have been fantastic, and this is a missed opportunity. Not only that, but the Minister for Indigenous Australians stood out the front of Nepean Hospital with the Labor candidate to get votes during the election campaign. Local families thinking about taking their kids to the clinic will think twice about whether to drive to Jamisontown or to drive straight to Nepean Hospital in Kingswood.On another note, the GP shortage is impacting Lindsay, and community members are rightly asking how the urgent care clinic will impact access to GPs when theyre working at the clinic. The Minister for Health and Aged Care recently changed regional arrangements for GP classifications to be closer to cities, noting the help that outer urban areas need with health workforce shortages. The minister is still refusing to answer questions around the staffing of the urgent care clinics, and, due to this and other issues, the Department of Health and Aged Care noted in a recent budget estimates hearing that in many cases the clinics will not be able to provide the extended opening hours of care that the Labor government committed to at the 2022 election. Id like to know the opening hours of the Lindsay clinic because my community doesnt know yet. Will they be short hours, or will they be the hours that were promised by the Labor government? Again, this just seems like another broken promise.Weve seen cuts to Medicare funded psychology sessions; community pharmacies are facing closures and job losses due to 60-day prescriptions; fast-acting insulin, Fiasp, is being removed from the PBS; and now there are delays to the promised delivery of the Medicare urgent care clinics. Lindsay and Australia need better from this Labor government.","Medicare","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs McINTOSH (Lindsay) ","(17:40):"
504,0,0,0,1,2,"Georganas, Steve MP","DZY","Adelaide","ALP","N/A",5827," Im proud today to be speaking on another commitment that the Albanese Labor government is delivering, and that is to establish the 56 Medicare urgent care clinics across Australia, with a total investment of $493.5 million over five years. Its a bit much to hear members on the other side criticising this particular policy, especially when you have a look at their record in government for 10 years, where we saw bulk-billing decline continuously. The public, hospitals and doctors were screaming out about bulk-billing, and they sat there and did nothing. So its a bit much listening to those on the other side criticising something that will add to our primary health care and is really needed. Primary care is in the worst shape it has been in for 40 years, with no action from the previous government in the last 10 years. What we saw under the previous government was 10 years of continuous cuts and neglect. As I said, bulk-billing rates were in decline, and only 14 per cent of medical graduates now go into general practice.Medicare urgent care clinics are just one way that this government is trying to help in strengthening Medicare and making it easier for Australians to receive the care that they need and deserve when they need it. All of these clinics will be bulk-billed and will be open seven days a week for extended hours. This means that more families will get top-quality care from a nurse or a doctor without having to wait in a hospital emergency department. We see the waiting lists around the country in hospital emergency departments, and that is because people cant afford the gap that they have to pay when they go to a doctor, so they front up to an emergency department, or they cant get in to see a doctor because we dont have enough of them. This will ease the pressure a bit and take those people who arent real emergency cases to these urgent clinics. This also means that, through the establishment of these clinics, well see a little bit of easing of the pressure on our hospitals.There are currently 16 urgent care clinics open nationally, with more opening in the coming few weeks and months. Im very proud to say that in South Australia—my home state and yours, Deputy Speaker Sharkie—were thrilled to be receiving five Medicare urgent care clinics around different areas, and one is proposed in the city of Adelaide in my electorate. It will service the inner suburbs surrounding the CBD, and itll take a great big burden off GPs and the emergency department. Primary Health Networks across the country are working hard to finalise the commissioning process for the urgent care clinics, while also ensuring that they are integrated—its very important that they be integrated—with local hospital and health systems and meet the needs of the local communities.Theres no doubt that hospitals and emergency departments across the country are under pressure. I dont think theres a single hospital in any major city that isnt under pressure. Since coming to government, weve made it a priority and a commitment to strengthen Medicare and reduce the pressure on our hospitals so they can provide the quality care that Australians deserve, and this is one way of easing that pressure. These Medicare urgent care clinics will save thousands of stressful, expensive and ultimately unnecessary trips to hospitals and emergency departments. You cant blame people for going to the emergency department given the state that our health system is in at the moment. When youve got a bad flu and a temperature and you cant get in to see a doctor because the waiting times could be two or three weeks and you need that care there and then, or when you cant afford the gap—many people just cannot afford the gap—the next choice is turning up to the emergency department. So freeing it up and reducing pressure will allow the emergency departments in our hospitals to focus on higher-urgency and life-threatening conditions.Again, Ill speak about the 10 years of cuts and neglect of Medicare by the former government. It has never been harder to see a doctor, and when you do youre often paying a gap fee that is higher than ever before in the Medicare era. Its not without any noise. For years previously, as I said, doctors, hospitals and health professionals were all screaming about— (Time expired)","Medicare","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GEORGANAS (Adelaide) ","(17:45):"
505,0,0,0,1,2,"Webster, Anne MP",281688,"Mallee","NATS","N/A",5828," The member for Hawke asked this chamber to recognise that the government continues to strengthen Medicare through delivering the planned 58 Medicare urgent care clinics. I suggest to him that hes a little premature in seeking this recognition, since the government has only delivered 16 clinics. I also suggest to this chamber that we return to this motion after the government has actually delivered the 58 clinics theyve promised. Again I ask, as I so often do in this House: what about regional, rural and remote communities, where the need for health care is most acute? What is the Albanese Labor government doing for us?Of the nine urgent care clinics opened in Victoria, six are within 25 kilometres of Melbournes CBD—and 550 kilometres from where I live. The other three are in Shepparton, Geelong and Ballarat—all large regional towns that already have ample healthcare facilities. Mind you, Im sure they would complain that they dont have enough. Why isnt the government prioritising Mildura, Horsham or Swan Hill in my electorate of Mallee? Does the government plan to provide those communities with urgent care clinics, where they are urgently needed?Some might accuse me of being cynical, but from where Im sitting it looks like the Labor government are doing with this policy what the Labor government do with all their policies: ignoring regional communities, who desperately need help, in favour of metropolitan and large regional centres who vote for them. Labor know most rural and remote communities dont typically favour them at election time, so when they get into power they just cut off the lifeblood of these communities and leave us to die on the vine. It is disgraceful.In the final analysis, however, this entire debate is practically moot from the perspective of people doing it tough in the rural and remote communities that I represent. The fact is, urgent care clinics might do more harm than good in country towns where there arent enough GPs as it is. Who is going to work in the care clinics? I know of one GP whos been taken out of his practice to work in the clinic. Nurses who already have more patients than they can handle, and who are already close to burnout, will be diverted to staff these clinics. Its a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul, and it wont work where I come from.One thing the government could do to channel more doctors to where they are most needed in country Australia would be to reverse the perverse decision to expand the distribution priority areas to include suburban and outer metropolitan regions. They wont, of course, because they expanded them for political reasons: to win votes in those urban electorates. Lets face it: Labor is deaf to the needs of regional electorates. Fancy politicising health! Who would have thought.The purpose of the DPA as implemented by the former coalition government was to address the maldistribution of doctors in rural areas. By extending it to most suburban areas of Australia, the Labor government has completely undermined the purpose of the DPA. The number of international doctors moving away from rural areas as soon as Labor made the expansion public increased by 57 per cent in just six months to the end of 2022, according to Senate estimates. If the government wanted to do something about the provision of health care in rural towns, it would reverse the expansion of the DPA, urgently. But the truth is that the government doesnt want to do anything for remote towns on health policy, or any other policy in regional centres. We know why: because there are no votes in it for them. Thats cynical, but its self-evident.Can the member for Hawke assure this chamber that the Labor governments urgent care clinics are intended for all Australians? Or are they only going to communities who vote Labor? If they do eventually get to remote communities, where they are needed most of all, can he assure this chamber that there will be a sufficient health workforce available to staff these clinics? Will the Labor government reverse their decision to expand the distribution priority areas, and what is the government planning to do to solve the chronic shortage of healthcare workers in regional and remote Australia?","Medicare","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr WEBSTER (Mallee) ","(17:50):"
506,0,0,0,1,2,"Repacholi, Dan MP",298840,"Hunter","ALP","N/A",5829," I thank my mate the member for Hawke for bringing the motion forward. Health care should be accessible to everyone regardless of their income, but the sad reality is that too often people find it too hard to find a doctor who bulk-bills. This means that people are choosing between paying to see a doctor and covering other essential costs. We know that, when we are unwell, we want to see a doctor as soon as we possibly can, but too often people are finding it hard to get in to their GP. This means that people are left to suffer while waiting days before getting a medical opinion. I strongly believe in two things when it comes to health care: when you need help, you should be able to get it, and your Medicare, not your credit card, should be your ticket to high-quality, world-class health care. That should just be part of the privilege of being an Australian, and once upon a time this was the case. Somewhere along the way, we lost our way and became a country where health care is more accessible and more affordable for some than it is for others. This is wrong. Someone earning a healthy wage is not more deserving of quality health care quickly available to them than someone who is struggling to put food on the table.Thats why I am proud to be a member of this government, which actually is strengthening Medicare, not cutting it. This government is delivering 58 Medicare urgent-care clinics. These clinics are so important. When you go to the emergency department of a hospital, youre having a bad day. Too often someones bad day is made even worse by having to wait hours to be seen by a doctor. This is because our emergency departments are under too much pressure, but the 58 Medicare urgent-care clinics will play a major role in taking away some of this pressure. These clinics are a way to make it easier for Australian families to see doctor when they need to. Some things are urgent but not life threatening, but sometimes the only option is to go to the emergency department, especially when it can take days to get to a GP. This adds to the pressure facing our hospitals. Having a Medicare urgent-care clinic near you means that, if you need medical attention urgently but are not in a position which is life threatening, you wont be stuck waiting in an emergency room for hours and hours. You wont be left hanging, waiting for the next available appointment for your GP.Not only will these clinics relieve the pressure on emergency departments; they will also bulk-bill. All you need when attending one of these clinics is your Medicare card. Regardless of your financial situation, you will have the care available to you when you need it. This is the way it should be, and my electorate is lucky enough to be receiving one of these new Medicare urgent-care clinics in Cessnock. Im excited to say that this clinic is scheduled to be opened next month. It was an honour to have the Prime Minister come to my electorate during the federal election campaign and announce that Cessnock would be receiving one of these clinics. I know from speaking to people around Cessnock that this clinic will be well received and will definitely be used by many who need it.Cessnock is a perfect case study for why these clinics are so desperately needed. Cessnock is rapidly growing, with a population edging over 60,000, but the hospital has not kept up with the population growth. This is not a reflection on the staff; they are all amazing and do a great job. To them I say: thank you for the hard work that you all put in and the hours you do and efforts you make to keep us all safe and well. But the emergency department is just under too much pressure. Making matters worse, there are limited GPs which do have bulk-billing available, and the ones which do are under lots and lots of pressure right now as well. The urgent-care clinic will mean that Cessnocks growing population will not have to wait hours in the emergency room at the Cessnock Hospital or be forced to make the half-hour drive to Maitland Hospital to be seen by a doctor.My electorate and the community of Cessnock need this clinic, and I want to thank the Prime Minister and Minister for Health for looking out for the health of the people in the Hunter.","Medicare","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr REPACHOLI (Hunter) ","(17:54):"
507,0,0,0,1,2,"Hamilton, Garth MP",291387,"Groom","LNP","N/A",5830," Far be it from me to offer advice to the new backbencher, my good friend the member for Hawke, on this motion, but it does remind me of another situation where Labor have gone out and claimed a victory before it happened. I was reflecting on this, and remembering when the then opposition leader introduced himself to Arnold Schwarzenegger as the next Prime Minister of Australia. It was a little cringeworthy, but theres a lesson to be learned: dont get out too early and claim the win before it has happened. That might be something to say here.Very clearly, were talking about delivery of 58 of these urgent care clinics but, by their own admission, its only 16. I point out, as have others previously, that eight of those are merely rebadged urgent care clinics that were delivered by the Victorian state government. So were down to eight and were off by 50-odd, but its a good start. I join in the condemnation that has been engaged in gleefully on my side in pointing out this error in factual content in this celebration. But, firstly, I just want to sum up what I believe to be the governments defence against claims that they havent actually done what they said they were going to do. When I go through it, at best it comes down to this: our promises were so watery, tempered and vacuous that how could you possibly hold us to account? That seems to be the defence here, We stumbled into this. The first announcement was that they were going to deliver it in the next year and then they doubled down by saying, Yes, well deliver these by the beginning of the financial year 2023-2024. So its, We stumbled into this, and near enough is good enough. Off by 50, but 50 out of 58 seems to be the defence that we have.In seriousness, and not making light of it, I come from a region known for its health care, where health care is the largest employer in town and has been for a long time. Toowoomba services much of south-western Queensland. We draw people up from the Lockyer Valley and also service a lot of northern New South Wales. People come to our region for health care because we have outstanding health facilities, and we have done so for quite a long time. But I guess this raises the point that this was a good promise to make—this was a very good promise for an opposition to make going into an election, because it matters. Looking after health care matters, and I think thats important to acknowledge.In my hometown I do see ambulance ramping and I see people choosing to go to the emergency department rather than to a GP, and I see those things on a regular basis. These are problems that we must face. I know that its happening in Toowoomba, in Queensland and around Australia—these are challenges that are felt. I ran my last survey recently and, once again, the issues that came up in Toowoomba were crime, the cost of living and health care. People move to Toowoomba expecting great health care to be provided continuously, so when the then opposition made these commitments they were good commitments. I think people expected that when they became the government, when they had the power to deliver on their promises, that they would. If I were just walking in here today and read this statement then I would think: Fantastic, they did! Look at this: 58 of these have been delivered. What a fantastic outcome! But of course we find that only 16 have been delivered and that eight of those were actually just rebadged and were delivered by somebody else.I fear Im putting a bit of a wet blanket on the celebrations by the government, but they are premature. What we can say is that this is the continuation of a theme from this government: making great promises and then failing to deliver them when they have the power to deliver them. Of course, theres not a person in Australia who hasnt heard the number 275. That was a significant promise made 97 times—thats the other number we all know, $275 repeated 97 times. Its a promise that was made and a promise that wasnt delivered. There were cheaper mortgages, an amazing promise for any government to make, Were going to make mortgages cheaper. My favourite one, though, was the now Treasurer making the claim that there was much they could do about the cost of living, including reducing the cost of groceries. What an incredible promise to make and what an incredible promise to break.In all these areas, these are important issues; these are issues that are important to Australians. Labor recognised that they were important but they have now walked away from commitments to deliver them. I dont think they realise just how important they were to Australians but they were important to their campaign to win government, and this falls into farce when it is interrogated in any way.","Medicare","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HAMILTON (Groom) ","(17:59):"

510,0,0,0,1,2,"Broadbent, Russell MP","MT4","Monash","IND","N/A",5830," by leave—On behalf of the member for Forde, I move:That this House:(1) recognises that:(a) since 2007, the National Student Wellbeing Program (formerly the National School Chaplaincy Program) has been assisting Australian students in key areas, fostering student wellbeing, increasing connectedness and school and community engagement through tailored pastoral care;(b) on average, chaplains have 15,724 conversations with students per week, across the country;(c) every term, chaplains run 7,025 programs, supporting 313,109 students;(d) the program works and is delivering measurable results for children; and(e) a 2022 report from the University of Western Australia entitled An Outcome Evaluation of School Chaplaincy noted the program had a considerable impact on:(i) improved attendance;(ii) a focus on learning; and(iii) improved behaviour;(2) notes that:(a) since its creation, under Prime Minister Howards Government, the Coalition has supported the work of the National Student Wellbeing Program; and(b) by providing further funding of $245.7 million, the previous Government reaffirmed this commitment to the $60 million a year program, which provides $20,000 towards the cost of hiring a chaplain for over 3,000 schools; and(3) thanks all chaplains for their ongoing efforts in providing social, emotional and spiritual support to Australian students.The National School Chaplaincy Program has supported the wellbeing of students and school communities since its establishment in 2006. The program supports more than 3,000 school communities each year. The National School Chaplaincy Program has played a valuable role in supporting student wellbeing in school communities in a variety of ways, adapting delivery for both the student and the school environment. Each school has bespoke arrangements, often determined by need, location and the sociodemographic make-up of the community. Types of offerings are far reaching and can include individual student support, breakfast clubs, simply checking with students during lunch breaks or even joining a game of soccer. There is indirect support as well, with services for the broader school community, teachers, support admin staff, parents, carers and families.A recent review of the program found that chaplains simply being present is critical because they can create a more safe and supportive school environment; identify and respond to wellbeing issues early—for example, identifying behavioural or social issues and helping students with strategies to overcome them—empower students by providing them with encouragement, advice and strategies; build relationships with students; provide a stable and consistent adult figure or role model; and be available for students by acting as an approachable go-to person that is viewed as separate from other staff.Students have faced significant pressures over recent years, from natural disasters to the COVID pandemic and extended state lockdowns. Were seeing a decline in student participation in sporting activities and community events, exacerbating social isolation and loneliness. There was a report yesterday that found that—as reported on 3AW, which drew my attention to it—loneliness is a factor across our society, but the report found it was most prevalent in 14- to 24-year-olds. They had the biggest problem with loneliness, and it talks about that isolation. The number of young people experiencing mental health challenges has also risen over recent years, from one in five children to one in four. The current cost-of-living pressures being faced by families across the country only exacerbate that pressure and highlight the need for more of these trusted services like the National School Chaplaincy Program.One of the key measures in the budget for students is the student wellbeing boost, a Labor election commitment. Before the election, the Prime Minister promised that this would fund school counsellors and psychologists, with extra funding for camps and excursions, as well as sporting and social activities, that improve childrens wellbeing. The total commitment of the package was $203.7 million over two years, and this included $10.8 million to develop a mental health check tool. This left $192.9 million to deliver mental health and wellbeing support services to students. The department advised that there are around 4,046,000 primary and secondary students in Australia. If you deduct that $10.8 million, which is going to be used to develop a mental health check tool, this leaves around $47.67 per student. What sort of wellbeing boost can be delivered for $48?More than 10,000 public submissions were made to the government. A high proportion of respondents—25 per cent—were parents and guardians, 14 per cent were other members of the public and 14 per cent were teachers. More than 43 per cent of respondents to the survey were based in Queensland, and 74 per cent of those were not school based stakeholders. The evaluation found that the National School Chaplaincy Program allowed a holistic approach to wellbeing, meaning chaplains could work alongside students and others to identify and respond to different wellbeing needs. This means chaplains can identify and respond to all wellbeing needs—mental, physical, social, spiritual, intellectual and economic. Its a great program.We had a chaplain at school. I went to a church based school. Our chaplain was a popular member of the staff contingent, and I remember with fondness his ability to move easily amongst the students. This program has been an excellent program, and I expect the government will continue on in support of students at this time when theyve never needed this program more than they do today.","Schools","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BROADBENT (Monash) ","(18:05):"

We know that students who are happy and supported have a greatly enhanced capacity to learn and thrive, and it sets them up for the rest of their lives.We also know, thanks to the Productivity Commissions recent report, that one in five young people from 11 to 17 years of age experience a high level of psychological distress. This reality should be unacceptable to us all. But this is not confined to a single demographic. It affects youth across Australia, and particularly those in out-of-home care, those with disabilities and First Nations students. The upheaval brought about by COVID-19 and recent natural disasters has also exacerbated these conditions, and it has been a particularly tough time for young people in Australia over the past few years.Student attendance, as a gauge of student engagement, reflects the state of wellbeing in our educational system, and, sadly, falls in attendance have been seen in all sectors—primary and secondary, urban and rural, government and non-government schools. In 2015, nearly 78 per cent of students attended school on nine of 10 days, but, by 2019, this had dipped to 73 per cent. Following the pandemic in 2022, that rate has plummeted further to a mere 49.9 per cent.To address this crisis, the government is embarking on a transformative journey, the National Student Wellbeing Program. Its not a mere change in name; its a promise to our students and their guardians that we are committed to their welfare. This program will empower schools to engage student wellbeing officers or chaplains. Sixty-one million dollars has been funded annually over five years, and schools can access funding of up to $20,280, with additional support for remote areas available. These officers and chaplains will provide much-needed support for students and their families. This will include pastoral care; essential services, like breakfast clubs; excursions; and workshops for parents. Their presence will help bridge the gap not only in the education system but in the broader lives of these young Australians.Our commitment is not solely financial, though; it is backed by passionate voices across the educational spectrum. Sally Egan, formerly of the National Catholic Education Commission, underscores the importance of these funds, saying that these much-needed funds will help to support the provision of additional professionally qualified staff, and that addressing student wellbeing is crucial to support student engagement in learning. Margery Evans of Independent Schools Australia has said that the measures in the budget for the wellbeing of students show that the government understands the importance of these issues.This initiative builds on a strong foundation. An independent review of the former National School Chaplaincy Program highlighted its significant role in supporting student welfare. The review recommended expanding qualifications to include mental health competencies. Consequently, the renamed program, the National Student Wellbeing Program, takes a more inclusive stance and allows schools and parents the choice to engage a secular student welfare officer as an alternative to a chaplain.But our support doesnt stop there. The Student Wellbeing Boost is an integral part of our commitment. This is a $500 million investment aimed at helping students overcome the pandemics mental health impacts. The Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Emma McBride, notes:Its been a tough two years for students and the Albanese Government has a plan to help them bounce back from the pandemic.Thats so important. This boost includes a voluntary mental-health-check tool, providing schools with the means to identify and assist students in need. Additionally, $192 million will be distributed to schools for mental health and wellbeing support. This can encompass hiring more psychologists and counsellors, organising activities to enhance wellbeing and implementing proven mental health initiatives.Our goal is clear: to create a better and fairer education system that caters to both academic achievement and emotional wellbeing.

I recently heard from Jack from Mooloolaba, who talked about his chaplain, Chappy Stu. Jack is a family violence survivor who entered high school with a whole array of struggles. Chappy Stu took Jack under his wing, paid for leadership training, spent lunchtimes with him and looked after him. Jack went on to graduate high school with a scholarship to study law and returned to his high school to help kids just like him. He credits his chaplain for pulling him out of a downward spiral to nowhere.Our chaplains dont just transform lives; they often save lives. The University of Western Australias national school chaplaincy evaluation showed that 87 per cent of schoolteachers, student services and executives found that chaplains made their students feel loved and safe; 81 per cent identified that chaplains enhanced students school participation; and a majority found they positively added to learning, health promotion, filling basic material needs and cultivating a positive sense of culture and identity. These are fantastic outcomes, which show that the chaplaincy program is working. Any good government would get behind a program with this kind of support and with these kinds of outcomes.Today I call on the Albanese government to continue investing in the National School Chaplaincy Program in the long term. I call on them to restore the DGR status to Scripture Union and all other charitable organisations providing chaplaincy services to schools, institutions and local communities. If the government were fair dinkum about the welfare of young people and the importance of chaplaincy to young people, why on earth would they have removed the DGR status from Chaplaincy Queensland? It beggars belief.Scripture Union, Queenslands largest school based chaplaincy provider, estimates that chaplains have as many as 26,000 pastoral care conversations every week with students, their families and their teachers. An average chaplain working three days a week will have a weekly load of 23 students in need of pastoral care. Ive heard stories of chaplains working 12-hour days just to fit all their work in. Theyre running breakfast programs before the sun rises and hosting community events long after the sun sets. School chappies show compassion and devotion to making our community safer, better engaged and more inclusive.I want to conclude by paying tribute to those school chappies in my electorate who go above and beyond. I want to say a very big thank you, from me and from your school communities, to Shane Brigg; Michelle Winser; Scott Carroll; Mark Green; Mel Abesamis; Justin Davis; Renee Chopping; Peta Simpson, who I saw on the weekend, and it was good to see you, Peta; Anita Kelly; Mike Turner; Chris Boughen; Megan Hayes; Brad Wooing; Theresa Sayooli; Nova van Maanenberg; Jayde Treloar; Anita Baills; Donna Turner; Mitch Lovell; Mandy McDonald; Cathie Clancy; Dave Larkin; and all those people work in this sector.I have been to many chaplaincy fundraising events. The realisation of the concept of chaplaincy, of looking after the welfare of young people in schools, wouldnt have happened but for the decision of John Howard all those years ago. We continued that funding over the nine years of the latest iteration of a coalition government. We are committed to looking after the welfare of young people. I am really concerned that the government would make this into a political statement by removing the DGR status of some of these organisations. What does the government have against these religious bodies? I do not know. I call upon them to return that DGR status today.","Schools","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WALLACE (Fisher) ","(18:15):"
517,0,0,0,1,2,"Perrett, Graham Douglas MP","HVP","Moreton","ALP","N/A",5833," The National Student Wellbeing Program supports over 3,000 public schools right across Australia. One of the great improvements made by the Albanese government was to enable all state schools to have choice. Communities have the choice of either a chaplain or a qualified student wellbeing officer. This flexibility is really important for schools, as it allows them to cater for their specific needs and what suits their community. Its also important for those schools situated in lower-socioeconomic communities to have choice. Many of these schools dont have the luxury of a well-funded and well-resourced church group to help pay the wages of a chaplain. The more stretched a community is, the more chance theyre unable to fund a chaplain, and—lets be honest—the kids in that school probably have more challenges. So the option to employ a qualified wellbeing officer is important for such communities. Also, not all parents or communities are comfortable for their children to speak to someone who may not hold the same faith or non-faith beliefs. The ABS tells us that less than eight per cent of Australians regularly attend religious services nowadays.The National Student Wellbeing Programs officers and chaplains work in collaboration with school communities to support the wellbeing of school students through providing pastoral care, organising volunteer activities with the school community, running programs such as breakfast clubs and lunchtime activities, and coordinating school excursions and parent carer workshops. In their role working with school communities, the NSWP student wellbeing officers and chaplains do not provide religious instruction or religious counselling—an important reminder. They may be of any faith or of no faith. They must not proselytise in a state school; they must respect, accept and be sensitive to other views, values and beliefs; and they must promote a safe and inclusive school community. We are talking about children here. They must comply with state and territory laws and policies in relation to child protection matters, and they must have relevant and valid state and territory working with children or vulnerable people checks. They must meet the qualification requirements of the NSWP and must undertake the cyberbullying professional learning package delivered by the eSafety Commission.The effects they have locally can be profound. We know that. In my electorate, at Wellers Hill State School, Robyn Maxwell, besides providing pastoral care to students, parents and staff, also coordinates the Modelling Affirmation, Trust, Encouragement and Support group. At Salisbury State School, Angeline Pang works with the school student support team, including the guidance officer and welfare officer, to provide a safe place for students to talk about their struggles, such as family problems, confusing relationships, friendship issues, peer pressure, self-esteem issues, bullying, stress and anxiety. I thank Angeline. At Sunnybank State High School, Ben Archbold provides emotional and social support to the students and families by creating an environment for students to get things off their chest as well as coordinating programs to enhance students lives, develop skills or expand students views of the world. John Erichsen at Coopers Plains State School is involved with school camps and excursions, providing assistance in classrooms and running lunchtime programs for students and staff. Mr T at MacGregor State School only joined the school in March this year but is already busy helping students with social and emotional support and developing knowledge, understanding and skills that support learning, positive behaviour and constructive social relationships. Mrs V at Corinda State School has a professional background in special needs and disability as well as nursing and early childhood education and a diploma in social science. Well done, Mrs V. She runs positive and fun activities for students and assists in fostering a supportive and caring school community.I could go on with many other examples of schools across my electorate of Moreton, across Queensland and across Australia where they are delivering the National Student Wellbeing Program. We know that this can be an effective program with the right people. We know that the National Student Wellbeing Program can change lives and, dare I say, even save lives. But it must have the ability and flexibility to deliver for the needs of schools and their communities. As I said, if we let chaplains only operate in schools that have the resources to pay for the chaplain, the communities that are poorest and hardest up will actually miss out. Thats why we made these important changes to the National Student Wellbeing Program.","Schools","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PERRETT (Moreton) ","(18:20):"

519,0,0,0,1,2,"MemberContinuation",219646,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr McCORMACK: The program supports more than 3,000 school communities each year, and this is a good motion put forward by the member for Forde. It is calling on the government to do more. And why would that be necessary? Well, you only have to look at the statistics out of recent reviews et cetera, which show that each term chaplains run 5,711 programs supporting almost a quarter of a million students.Particularly during COVID-19 we saw how tough it was for teachers—and we have many good teachers in this country—when their students werent doing the face-to face learning. Chaplains undertook activities outside their normal duties as a result of the global pandemic, and the statistics speak for themselves. They provided care packages and food parcels—42 per cent of them were doing that. There was encouragement and morale boosting for school communities, with 46 per cent of them doing that. Just during COVID-19, the following percentages of chaplains noted somewhat more interaction online of 56 per cent; interaction via phone of 51 per cent; mental health issues of 68 per cent; family conflict issues of 57 per cent; school behaviour issues of 57 per cent; friendship and peer issues of 42 per cent; and bullying and harassment issues of 30 per cent. And theyre addressing those challenges. The chaplains are very well-meaning people who have experience and expertise, and who are addressing those issues. But for the chaplains, that work may well not be done.Again, I know that the total commitment to the package by this government is $203.7 million over two years. That includes a $10.8 million contribution to develop a mental health check tool, and thats important. That leaves $192.9 million to deliver mental health and wellbeing support to students. The department advises that there are around 4,046,585 primary and secondary students across the nation. My concern is that if you take away the $10.8 million which is going to be used to develop the mental health check tool then it leaves only around $47.67 per student. We have to ask what sort of wellbeing boost can be delivered for $48?Mental health is such an important thing, it really is. As I said at the outset, schooling has changed. Contributions by teachers and, certainly, after-hours care have changed. In my day, often one parent went out and earned the income and the other parent, usually the mum, was at home when the kids got home. But, these days, many kids are latchkey kids. Again, thats why chaplains are important; they fill the gaps left by necessarily two-income families and they fill the gaps that are sometimes there because of family breakdown. There are all manner of reasons. But the National School Chaplaincy Program has played a valuable role in supporting student wellbeing in school communities in so many ways and in so many areas.Often, the problems which are seen in metropolitan areas are exacerbated in regional areas because of remoteness and the lack of available resources and personnel. Again, I commend the member for Forde for bringing this very important motion to parliament and I note the various items he has put towards it.","Schools","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"
520,0,0,0,1,2,"Thwaites, Kate MP",282212,"Jagajaga","ALP","N/A",5835," It is so important that we do all we can to support student wellbeing. We know that the pandemic and all that came with it made it hard for students, not only in how they engaged in their education but also in the many other life skills that young people get from being in a school environment. I know from travelling around my electorate at the moment, talking to students, teachers and principals, that theyre still finding that theyre dealing with some of the longer-term consequences of that period we spent in COVID.So I want to start by acknowledging all of the people in my community who I know spend so much time thinking about and working on helping to address student wellbeing. In particular is the work of teachers and principals in my community. The pandemic has changed the way many of them think about wellbeing, and theres plenty thats being done locally to set up new ways for students to receive wellbeing support and to feel like they have a safe place when theyre at school and theyre struggling—somewhere they can go for support. More broadly, in my community there are organisations which are doing great work to engage with young people. Id like, particularly, to commend a local organisation, the Pat Cronin Foundation. It was formed by parents Matt and Robyn after their son Pat died from a coward punch—a punch in the back of the head. In the years since, Matt and Robyn have grown the foundation and they reach out to young people in schools, sporting clubs, youth groups and others to educate them about safety, respect and why violence is never the answer. I want to recognise them for the incredible work they do, and continue to do, for young peoples and students wellbeing.Our government is funding a lot of work to support student wellbeing. Ill start by talking particularly about the Student Wellbeing Boost. This is a program that includes $10.8 million for a new voluntary mental health check tool to enable schools to ensure students get the support they need and $192 million in additional one-off funding to every school to support students mental health and wellbeing. This is extra funding that principals can spend on supports such as extra psychologists and school counsellors, camps, excursions and activities that improve student wellbeing and wellbeing engagement in mental health initiatives. As I just said, it is so necessary at this time as all schools are continuing to think about how they can help students be back in the classroom and how they can help them with the socialisation that they missed out on during the period when we were in lockdown. I visited one secondary school in my community recently. The principal there said to me that he felt like some of the behaviour he was still seeing from students in year 9, the middle year of their secondary school, was more like what hed expect from students in primary school. So there is a lot of work and support that we need to do. Our government is certainly, through this Student Wellbeing Boost and other programs, providing the support thats much needed.We are committed to providing support through the National Student Wellbeing Program. Were providing $61 million per year for a new five-year agreement. Schools that participate in the program can receive up to $20,280 in most areas, with extra for remote or very remote schools, to engage student wellbeing officers or chaplains. This staffing, focused on wellbeing, will be supporting students and the wider school community, delivering parcel care services and delivering support services, such as breakfast and lunch clubs, excursions and parent workshops. This funding has been widely welcomed across the community and by organisations that work with and in schools. The Australian Council of State School Organisations have said they are extremely pleased by the announcement the government made. The former head of Independent Schools Australia, Margery Evans, said:The measures in the Budget for the wellbeing of students … show that the Government understands the importance of these issues.The National Catholic Education Commission said:These much-needed funds will help to support the provision of additional professionally qualified staff. Addressing student wellbeing is crucial to support student engagement in learning.Of course, we do know there is more to be done. That is why the government has tasked the Expert Panel of the Review to Inform a Better and Fairer Education System with advising on how the next schools agreement can contribute to improving student mental health and wellbeing. In its work, the panel has already stated an important point:Students with good social and emotional wellbeing are more engaged with learning and tend to have higher levels of academic achievement and attainment.So there is a recognition of the challenge we have in front of us. There is a recognition of the support that needs to go into our schools. This will continue to be a focus of work for our government, and I know how important that is to my community and to communities right across Australia.","Schools","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms THWAITES (Jagajaga) ","(18:42):"

These workers do not receive paid leave entitlements. They may struggle to make financial plans for the future. They are more likely to expect to lose their jobs for involuntary reasons, with 22.5 per cent of casual workers expected to move jobs, expecting to lose their jobs for economic reasons or expecting their seasonal, temporary, fixed-term casual jobs to end, compared to 11.6 per cent of permanent employees. Theyre more likely to be underemployed—17.3 per cent of casual employees are underemployed, compared with 2.3 per cent of permanent employees. They are more likely to be female—53.4 per cent of all casual employees are female, and 23.7 per cent of female employees are casual. The problem is: currently, the definition of casuals within the Fair Work Act is based only on the original offer of employment made to the employee, without taking into account any subsequent conduct of the parties.It is always a surprise to me, when I am talking to young people in my electorate who are in their first job, when they say to me that they are permanent casuals. I take the time to tell them that they dont exist—that permanent casual is an oxymoron. But they are told by their employers that that is the status of their employment. We know thats not the case, and this government is going to do something about it.There are employers exploiting the loophole where any subsequent conduct of the parties is not taken into consideration, treating employees as casuals even if they work regular and predictable hours for long periods of time. There are plenty of casual workers who have been stuck in casual employment arrangements for too long. They are being used as though they are permanent workers, without the security of permanent employment, just because of what is written in the employment contract.The former government compounded this problem. They institutionalised job insecurity for casual workers. In 2021, while the courts were considering the question of how to determine employment status, the previous government introduced legislation, as part of an omnibus bill, to legitimise a blatantly unfair definition of casual employment. Then, extraordinarily, the coalition government voted down the other provisions in its own bill. The minister at the time, Senator Michaelia Cash, and the coalition government voted against all the other parts of their own legislation. They voted against their own legislation that would have criminalised wage theft and they voted against their own legislation that would have modified the better off overall test, because the only commitment that ultimately mattered that day was to make sure that they got the section of the bill through which would take rights away from casual workers. We know what they did with penalty rates. The pattern was set. What was left was an unreasonable definition that has now been in effect for two years, a definition that effectively disregards whether or not a casual worker was objectively working in a permanent job. If the contract said you were working as a casual, that was the end of the story, even if you were being told that you were a permanent casual. This government will seek to change that this year.The Albanese government is standing up for casual employees and will introduce a fair, objective definition of casual to provide clearer pathways to permanent work. As part of the governments next set of workplace reforms, we will close the loophole that leaves people stuck with being classified as casuals when they actually work permanent, regular hours. The government will introduce a fair, new definition that will restore the traditional understanding of casual employment—that is, casual employment will be determined by considering whether there is a firm advance commitment to work, but this concept is to be understood by reference to the totality of the employment relationship, including post-contractual conduct and non-contractual mutual understandings.This is an area of industrial relations that needs action. We need to ensure that people arent staying casual employees, without entitlements, for longer than the employer actually sees them as casual employees. This needs to change. It needs to change for young people and it also needs to change for a lot of older people who are now being employed under this definition.","Industrial Relations","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms RYAN (Lalor—Chief Government Whip) ","(18:48):"

528,0,0,0,1,2,"Spender, Allegra MP",286042,"Wentworth","IND","N/A",5837," I thank the member for Lalor for the opportunity to speak about industrial relations reform and how best to support Australian workers, including casuals. The Financial Review reported that the minister has declared that the next round of IR reforms will be a contest on wages. If youre listening, Minister, Im up for that contest.Lets start where we agree. Wage growth has been too slow for too long. This is something that workers have experienced not just under the coalition government but also under the previous Labor government. Both sides need to do better. To do that, we need healthy, productive policy debates which focus on the outcomes that will deliver for workers, as well as the consequences and trade-offs of each option. We shouldnt fight about who does or doesnt care about workers or families, or who is or isnt in the pocket of businesses or unions. Lets keep the focus where it belongs: on policies and outcomes.So what is the governments policy? Its to raise wages by striking at underpayment, giving workers more bargaining power, converting more casual workers to permanent work and cracking down on platform operators with more flexible working arrangements. There are a number of trade-offs here. First is that it prioritises wage growth over everything else. For some workers, a wage rise is vitally important and, understandably, trumps all other considerations. But the Susan McKinnon Foundation has shown recently the diversity of what matters to workers. Almost a third say higher pay is the most important consideration for them, but 21 per cent rate job security, 17 per cent prefer flexibility and seven per cent say a shorter commute is more important than more pay. Its notable that almost two-thirds of part-time workers rate shift flexibility as more important than pay. For workers who value things other than wages, forcing employers to focus on pay ultimately means neglecting other important values.The second trade-off is that this change is essentially a one-off benefit. Workers will enjoy wage growth while the economy adjusts to the new rules, but it doesnt provide the foundations for ongoing wage growth. If IR reform makes workplaces less flexible and less dynamic, it will be harder for firms to grow and harder for employers to fund pay rises in the future.The third trade-off is that cracking down on new forms of work reduces competition for workers. You can protect workers rights legally with rules and courts or economically by ensuring unhappy workers can easily and quickly find employment elsewhere. We certainly need basic rights to be protected, and I support the governments efforts to ensure this protection, but the overall balance of legal and economic protections will vary by workers and industries. We shouldnt neglect the upsides of having a lot of competing employers, and the Labor members for Fenner or Fraser know all about the dangers of monopsony.Labor market competition isnt just an issue for digital platforms either. Small businesses are a huge source of employment, and each tranche of IR reform has imposed significant burdens on them. The smallest have been carved out, but many small businesses such as local cafes, gyms and retailers are still affected. If we keep adding to the regulatory burden, we shouldnt be surprised if small-business owners decide to call it quits and we end up with fewer opportunities for Australian workers.I can respect the governments position, but we need to ensure that the trade-offs are worthwhile. The best thing is for workers to have a dynamic labour market that supports choice, flexibility and ongoing wage growth—one that accommodates the different preferences of different employers and employees and ensures healthy competition for workers, which drives improvements in wages and conditions.This debate is just getting started, and I look forward to engaging more with stakeholders on all sides. I hope we can have a positive and constructive debate which focuses on the policy options and their trade-offs, weighs up what is practical for businesses to implement and focuses on how to better support outcomes for Australian workers and Australian businesses.","Industrial Relations","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SPENDER (Wentworth) ","(18:53):"

A decade of economic mismanagement, war raging in Eastern Europe and the enduring consequences of global pandemic put pressure on our economy—pressure that is felt the hardest by working families. Last year there were 2.7 million casual workers in Australia, 300,000 more than the previous year, and 800,000 working regular hours. These are not just numbers; those are real Australians experiencing job insecurity in an already uncertain context. Having to worry about the possibility of losing your job contributes to the anxiety of providing for your family. Casual workers dont get paid leave. Casuals may struggle to plan for the future. Casuals are twice as likely to change jobs, whether because of economic reasons or because of seasonally available vacancies.I dont know this because I have seen the statistics; I know because I have experienced this myself. When I arrived in Australia, my first job I had was security guard. I found myself in this situation, waiting weekly for the roster to find out if the last pay slip was going to be enough. In addition to this, how many of these jobs are in industries that more often than not pay minimum wage? They are retail workers, hospitality workers, warehouse and logistics workers.We must not overlook the fact that casual workers are more likely to be underemployed and that they are more likely to be female. Over 23 per cent of female workers are casuals. How are we going to close the gender pay gap if more women are experiencing job insecurity? I have a huge respect for casual workers. I know how hard it is going to work worrying about not being able to provide for your loved ones—those loved ones that you barely get to see because these jobs often include rotating rosters, night shifts and weekend work.We have a responsibility to stand up for those who are doing it tougher and to care for those who are under the heaviest pressure because those before us were incapable of empathy. Today, the coalition sit across this chamber and accusingly talk about the cost-of-living crisis and inflation, and they expect us to believe that they are the peoples champions. Well, they are not. They institutionalised job insecurity. In 2021 they introduced a bill with the purpose of legitimising an unfair definition of casual employment. They did it with that sole purpose because they later voted against every other part of this legislation. They voted against criminalising wage theft. They voted against workers interests.The Albanese Labor government will do things differently. We are putting workers rights as a priority, and we are committed to improving their working conditions. We will introduce a fairer definition of casual employment with clearer pathways to job security. We will close the loophole that leaves people stuck as casuals, even if they are working regular hours. It will be at the employees discretion to express their intention to become a permanent employee. Many will not, and they will not be forced to convert either. We are not against businesses; we are here to work together—government, business owners and workers—to get the best outcome for everyone.There will be no net cost for businesses. As it is now, they will either pay casual loading or leave entitlements. They will not have to pay both. We are not doing anything special. We are just sticking to our word. We are doing what we promised, and we are making sure that no-one gets left behind.","Industrial Relations","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LIM (Tangney) ","(18:57):"

In rural Australia, a lot of the time its just one or two of these businesses that form the very backbone of an entire community. The government must continue to support these businesses to keep them viable, not to tie them up and reduce their productivity with more red tape.If Labor had bothered to ask anyone in the bush about managing workforce challenges then they would have known that flexibility is key. I think its important to remind the Canberra bureaucracy that not everybody clocks on at nine and knocks off at five. Across the north-west, the west coast and King Island we cant afford to have a clock on, clock off mentality. Wed go broke. In our region, weve got a do the job mentality—a complete the job and get it done mentality. I could spend the next three minutes listing the names of business owners that have never clocked off in their working lives. They work 24/7, around the clock.In that vein, I recently went along to a regional meeting of our Master Builders association in Devonport. It was a great meeting. There were a roomful of builders, and if they tell me that theyve got a problem then I listen. The problem is Labors proposed IR reforms. In the electorate of Braddon, there are just over 1,000 small building and construction businesses. Between them they employ around 4,000 tradies. Thats about nine per cent of the population. For the benefit of those opposite, I feel obliged to explain how the building and construction industry actually works. We have a building sector that is a very complex, very finely tuned, well-balanced and highly efficient system of business owners, apprentices, independent contractors and subbies. Thats right: subcontractors.. Yet Labor believes this successful, time-proven model needs changing—changing from a model that is flexible, independent and responsive to one that is rigid, beholden to union movements and bound by red tape.At this meeting, I was told that Labors proposed IR reforms are one of the worst possible things that could ever happen to the building and construction industry in the state of Tasmania. Independent contractors and subbies could find themselves subject to changes which would ultimately force them to relinquish their autonomy and become employees. This would mean they would lose their freedom to choose their working hours, their projects and their clients and their ability to negotiate their own fees and conditions. One subcontractor said that he hopes that the people responsible for bringing this new legislation will be held 100 per cent accountable when the construction industry is totally destroyed.Its never a good time for government to make it harder for business owners. Its never a good time for governments to make it harder for workers or jobseekers to find flexible employment that suits their specific needs and their own requirements. Yet that is exactly what the Albanese government is proposing. Well, Im proposing more utes and fewer suits.","Industrial Relations","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PEARCE (Braddon) ","(19:02):"
531,0,0,0,1,2,"Templeman, Susan MP",181810,"Macquarie","ALP","N/A",5839," Many businesses need the flexibility of casual workers, especially small businesses. In fact, many employees need the flexibility of being casual. Musicians and artists, students, mums, carers, microbusinesses and a whole lot of other workers dont always want to be locked into a permanent part-time roster. They want the ability to pick up more shifts when their commitments allow or to move between a couple of employers when there is demand.But there are other casual workers who are only casual because they havent been able to move into permanent employment, even though they might have been working the same shifts for many years. There are about 850,000 casual employees with regular working arrangements. They dont have access to leave entitlements and are, in fact, in a much less stable situation than permanent workers, with job insecurity hovering constantly. Its hard to make financial plans. Theyre twice as likely to expect to lose their job for involuntary reasons. Theyre also more likely to be underemployed, and theyre more likely to be female. Fifty-three per cent of all casual employees are female, and 23.7 per cent of female employees are casual.Were committed to standing up for casual workers who want to become permanent employees. What were doing is saying that, if a workers pattern of work is no longer casual, they should have the choice to move to permanent employment and gain the benefits of secure employment. It wont be something that everyone whos in that situation actually wants to do. It means being paid a lower hourly rate in return for access to sick leave, holiday pay and other entitlements.I think there are a couple of things to clarify here. Casual workers already have some of the same entitlements as permanent part-time or full-time workers. For instance, under the superannuation guarantee legislation, all employers must already pay a minimum of 11 per cent super for all eligible staff, whether theyre full time, part time or casual. This legislation ensures that working Australians are guaranteed to have some level of retirement savings, and we were very pleased to make that change. The 10 days domestic and family violence leave thats come into effect this year is payable to all workers, whether they are casual or permanent.These are things that we have already implemented to provide greater security for casual workers. But were also going to close a loophole in the Fair Work Act thats being exploited by some employers. Currently, the definition of casual is based only on the original offer of employment made to that employee. It doesnt take into account any subsequent changes that might have occurred, or what is known as the subsequent conduct of the parties. So even if people are now working regular and predictable hours, theyre still treated as the casuals they were when they were first hired. Theyre being used as permanent workers without the security of permanent work because of whats written in their employment contract.The former government compounded this problem by legislating an unreasonable definition for casuals, and that has now been in effect for two years. It basically disregards whether or not a casual worker was objectively working in a permanent job. Were going to seek to change that and introduce a fair and objective definition of casual to provide a clear pathway to permanent work. That is, a casual employment will be determined by considering whether theres any firm advance commitment to work. But this concept has to be understood by reference to the total employment situation. And there will be clear processes for changing employment status from casual to permanent which will be at the employees discretion. When a boss expects someone to work guaranteed hours as though they were an permanent employee, the worker will have the option to say, I would rather be a permanent worker.For the vast majority of casuals, nothing changes: no forced conversion and no giving up the casual loading. Theres no net cost to business: employers pay a loading if someone is casual and they pay a leave entitlement if someone is permanent. They dont pay both to the same person. Most people will sort this out at the workplace level, but well ensure that Fair Work can arbitrate binding decisions where necessary.We dont expect a large number of casuals will choose to be permanent, but there are people for whom a conversion to permanent would be life changing. It may appeal more to older workers, or to workers supporting a family, than it will to students, for instance. Its a fair approach, and its another step to increasing security for workers.","Industrial Relations","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) ","(19:07):"
532,0,0,0,1,2,"Ware, Jenny MP",300123,"Hughes","LP","N/A",5840," I rise to speak on this motion, which demonstrates Labors interventionist approach to industrial relations in this country. This motion concerns the casual workers of Australia and is a concerted effort by the government to restrict casual work and demonise those employees who, for various reasons, choose this form of work.The Australian labour market is diverse and provides various forms of work for people of different circumstances and different needs. There are currently 2.7 million casual employees in Australia. This represents approximately 23.5 per cent of all those employed. This percentage has essentially been unchanged for more than 25 years. In my electorate of Hughes there are approximately 15,000 casual workers. Casual workers receive an immediate 25 per cent leave loading on their wage instead of various forms of leave. The government is now proposing to redefine the notion of a casual employee, making it more difficult for Australian workers to choose higher take-home pay and flexibility when needed.A new test on how a casual worker is defined could mean that people who have a regular work pattern can no longer be a casual employee. The casual work options are critically important to provide job opportunities for hundreds of thousands of students, parents, carers and others wanting flexibility in how and when they work and who prioritise higher take-home income over entitlements like leave. Casual work works particularly for our young, for those aged 18 to 34. Casual work works for them.The government, however, and particularly unions, increasingly object to casual work as part of a campaign against insecure work. However, this argument makes no sense when, at present, with almost full employment and skill shortages, Australians who do not want to work casually have rarely had more options to pursue ongoing full- or part-time work. Casual work was, until recently, plagued by legal uncertainty and messy backpay risks. However, this was considered and then corrected by the High Court in 2021, resulting in the parliament legislating a clear and reliable definition of casual employment. That definition should remain. It is baffling to understand why the Labor government now wants to act against the interests of casual workers, the businesses in which they work and the wider community to deliberately recreate that uncertainty.It is now easier than ever in the history of industrial relations in this country for casual employees to convert to permanent work, either full-time or part-time. The government has been vague in how it would redefine casual work. What is clear is that it is deliberately complicating the existing Fair Work Act to override the stated intention of an employer and an employee and the express basis on which casuals are hired, making casual work contingent on post-contractual conduct. This would require an ongoing and continuous re-examination of daily patterns of work, recreating uncertainty and deliberately reversing the successful and sensible corrections made by the High Court and parliament in 2021. Its also going to place additional administrative burdens on small businesses in particular and also medium-sized businesses. Those businesses in my electorate that Ive spoken to about this have indicated that this could well result in the businesses simply cutting back on staff numbers overall, leading to increased unemployment.Another consideration is that casual employees, particularly young people, are less likely to join trade unions. Casuals can also have different priorities in enterprise bargaining to union members working full-time and part-time. Therefore, the government legislating rights to convert them from casual to ongoing employment could simply be an opportunity to repay union mates with a view to swelling the ranks of union membership.Casual work has been a legitimate part of Australian employment for more than a century. It is critical to doing business, attracting investment and supporting jobs. The government should take their hands off redefining the way that casual workers work in this country.","Industrial Relations","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WARE (Hughes) ","(19:12):"
533,0,0,0,1,2,"Burnell, Matt MP",300129,"Spence","ALP","N/A",5840," I rise to speak in favour of the motion moved by the member for Lalor. This should come as no surprise, given the side of the chamber Im standing on. Standing up for the rights and conditions of workers isnt just something thats in our DNA; it is something that we should be fighting for in opposition and it is something we should be legislating for when in government. As the motion suggests, this means casual workers too—a part of the workforce that accounts for one-quarter of Australias employees. This, of course, fluctuates over time.During the COVID-19 pandemic many casual workers were not eligible for JobKeeper. For employees engaged on a casual basis this was cold comfort to many trying to do the right thing as they tested positive for COVID, meaning the government had to step in to cover for them while they recovered from a virus that many of them contracted whilst at work.We find casual workers forgoing entitlements, such as personal leave and annual leave, for an additional loading on their wages—whether it be 15 per cent or 20 per cent—although forgoing workplace entitlements is only a small part of the overall story. We often find casual employees in situations of underemployment, whether that be working fewer hours than they would like to or working that particular job or another job to supplement those hours in a position or industry that is lower than their levels of qualification or experience.Casual engagements can be as short as the balance of the days shift. This is what the state of play currently is given that the current definition within the Fair Work Act only concerns itself with the original offer of employment made to an employee. That definition considers the fact that for many casual employees this type of employment can be in a pattern that lasts months or, for that matter, years—or sometimes for just a shift at a time. After a certain number of rockstar shifts, there comes a time for all involved when a worker begins to feel part of the team for all intents and purposes—other than for the provisions of the Fair Work Act that is.Business groups use the word flexibility as a good thing, but, as soon we consider whether an employee would like to trade in loading for the entitlements and job security of someone who has filled the same work pattern for many moons, somehow flexibility is bad. It would appear that business groups are inflexible with their definition of what constitutes the good kind of flexibility. There is indeed a place for casual employment. Many use it to work in sporadic patterns in line with their university timetables. Some use it as a way to gradually return to work. But some employees would choose to jettison 20 or 25 per cent of loading on their wages for the ability to call in sick when they are sick, take a period of annual leave to recharge their batteries without worrying about the loss of income or even be able to rest up during a public holiday that they are being paid for.As we can all understand, being told that you will be engaged casually on a continuous basis by an employer offers zero guarantees that will eventuate beyond what the employee is engaged to do at the time. This precariousness hurts. It hurts on the job, seeing fellow co-workers take leave and holidays with their families. It can hurt at home, too, even in the process of trying to purchase a home. They can come to a lender, with their employer offering a pattern of casual employment dating back to kingdom come, but, ultimately, this means very little when they are employed casually.To address these issues faced by many casual workers in our labour force, the Albanese Labor government is introducing an objective definition of a casual employee to provide a clearer pathway to permanent and secure work, a clearer way for employees to discuss situations where their employment ventures across what is considered casually engaged and provisions where an employee can engage with their employer to work through a process of casual conversion, with the existing framework remaining in effect. For the vast majority of casuals, this wont necessarily have any great impact. But, for the estimated 850,000 who are engaged in casual employment on a regular pattern of work, this can mean they have a path forward toward more stable and secure working conditions with their employer.If employers continue to relent against this added level of flexibility into the working arrangements between themselves and any casual employees who have worked regularly over a large period of time, it means that, every time they use that word flexibility, it just rings hollow. I am sure that this is not actually the case, and that is why the Albanese government wants to open up and allow for a type of flexibility that appears to be craved by many industry groups. On that front, the Albanese Labor government is more than happy to oblige.","Industrial Relations","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BURNELL (Spence) ","(19:17):"
