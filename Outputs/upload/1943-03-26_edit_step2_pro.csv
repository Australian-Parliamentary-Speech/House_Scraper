Since then, the honorable member has submitted additional evidence to me regarding the circumstances in which hire-car drivers in Hobart find themselves. He pointed out that many, if not all, were earning less than the basic wage, and he has asked that the petrol ration be increased so as to enable them to earn at least the basic wage. These facts have been placed before the Liquid Fuel Control Board.

54,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"BEASLEY, John","JOM","N/A","ALP","N/A",2466,"- Yesterday, the honorable member for Hume (Mr. Collins) asked whether the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Scully) had received any information concerning a resolution carried at the 59th Annual Convention of the Graziers Federal Council relating to the Australian Meat Board. I am advised that the Minister has received a copy of a resolution carried by the convention at its meeting in June. The resolution conveyed to the Minister reads as follows: -That this Graziers Federal Council expresses its confidence in the Australian Meat Board and its conviction that such Board is the appropriate authority to formulate and control any measures necessary for the rationalization of the industry, to meet changing conditions associated with war-time.To give effect to the above resolution, this convention request the Minister for Commerce to gazette regulations which will extend the present functions and powers of the Australian Meat Board to cover all meat, whether for export, home or service consumption.The Minister this week received a further resolution on the subject of meat control. This was carried at last weeks conference of the New South Wales Graziers Association. For the information of honorable members I point out that the Graziers Association is affiliated with the Graziers Federal Council. This later resolution reads -That this annual conference of the Graziers Association of New South Wales deplores the action taken by the Senate in disallowing the National Security (Meat) Regulations, and considers that such action has gravely menaced the interests of producers who, recognizing that Government control of the industry under war-time conditions in order to meet the enormously increased demands of the services, British Ministry of Food and civilian requirements, is justified; and urgently requests the Graziers Federal Council to make immediate representations to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture to have the Meat Industry Commission reinstated, in order that producers interests may be adequately safeguarded on the basis of -fixing prices of all meats not on the hooks to the producer at seaboard;licensing of operators and meat works, making it obligatory upon them to treat stock on producers account upon adequate notice being given;fixing of uniform treatment charges;provision for price differentials to take care of normal State premiums and seasonal variations;right of producer to sell - (i) in the paddock; (ii) in the yards; (iii) to works or operators on the hooks; andthat the interest of fat stock selling agents be preserved.In addition to the resolutions which I have quoted, the Minister yesterday received through the secretary of the Graziers Federal Council a copy of the presidential address delivered at the annual conference of the Graziers Association by Mr. H. R.Cowdery. The portion relevant to the question raised by the honorable member reads -During the last year your executive has given more time and thought to the problem of organizing the meat industry than to any other single matter. The Commonwealth Government definitely made up its mind to bring forward a plan to control the industry, and in the light of service requirements and of the requirements of the United Kingdom, especially for canned and dehydrated meats, I am satisfied that a measure of control is necessary.Our concern was to see that whatever bases were determined for various types of meat adequate prices to the producer would be assured. The industrys representatives upon the Commonwealth Meat Industry Commission and upon the State meat boards were working towards that end. Much valuable work had been done when the regulations establishing the commission were disallowed by the Senate. I want to say publicly that this association was not a party to the action of the Senate, which to me, appears to be irresponsible Whatever may have been the shortcomings of the commission, our attitude was that it was performing an urgent essential work, and we were prepared to co-operate. The Senates action invited the introduction of legislation which it might not be able to block, and which would place what should be a temporary wartime control upon the statute book permanently. I hope that the Government will be able to restore the position, substantially as it was, by regulation.","MEAT INDUSTRY.","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[12]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

57,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BEASLEY, John","JOM","West Sydney","ALP","Minister for Supply and Shipping",2467,". - by leave - In the House of Representatives, on the 10th March, 1943, the honorable member for Parkes (Sir Charles Marr) asked a question concerning a number of companies that arc being forced to refund money to the public for breaches of the prices regulations, and asked whether it would be possible to enumerate the companies by name, and to indicate whether any Adelaide companies are involved. The Minister for Trade and Customs has given the honorable membars question consideration, and has referred the matter to the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner who advises as follows : -The honorable members question raises a number of highly technical matters in connexion with the administration of price control. It is not correct to refer to the firms and trades concerned as . necessarily having committed breaches of the prices regulations. Under Prices Regulation Orders, traders are required to conduct their businesses on the basis of the cost to them of the goods in which they deal, plus the gross profit margin they are obtaining on certain prescribed dates. As part of the machinery for policing this system of price control, it is customary for the officers of the Prices Branch to examine balance-sheets and trading accounts with a view to ascertaining what changes have taken place in gross and net profits since the war broke out. If the gross profit percentage on the cost of goods handled has risen substantially, traders are requested to furnish explanations as to why they obtain higher gross profit margins during -the war than before the war. There are quite a number of reasons which have been advanced and accepted by the Prices Commissioner as being consistent with the observance of the National Security (Prices) Regulations.The National Security (Prices) Regulations are based upon individual sales of goods. The price of any article during the war should not exceed the cost to the trader plus his basic gross profit margin. It is quite possible, however, for this condition to be observed, and yet for the gross profit margin as a whole, to rise. For one thing, the nature of the trade may alter in such a way as to increase the proportion of goods sold on which a relatively high gross profit margin was obtained before the war. This has taken place, for example, with firms who were handling Japanese goods which sold at a low price, and on which gross profit was relatively low. Secondly, the conditions of a full years trading during the war might differ fundamentally from the prewar conditions in that no special sales involving heavy sacrifices of profit were necessary. This would enable a trader to obtain more profit, whilst still observing the conditions that operated on the prescribed date. There would thus be no breach of the Prices Regulations. In another case again, the traders business may alter in an important degree as between an indent business and normal wholesale operations. The greater the proportion of normal wholesale operations the greater would be the increase in gross profit as compared with pre-war.These and other facts have to bc considered by the Commonwealth Prices Commissioner in deciding whether traders have committed a breach of the Prices Regulations. It is the normal practice to supplement the examination of the accounts of a trader by an inspection of books to ascertain what gross profit margin was actually charged on a wide variety of articles. If it is found that the pre-war gross profit margin has been exceeded, there is clear evidence of legal breaches, and the normal course is to take legal proceedings. Already there have been, over COO prosecutions for Prices breaches, and in spite of the legal difficulties involved, only a few eases have been lost in the Courts. Where legal proceedings are not taken, and there is evidence of a substantial increase in gross profit margins, it is the practice of the Prices Commissioner to discuss the position with the trader concerned. In some cases, traders show an increase in gross profit margin during the war, but are still earning a relatively low net profit on funds employed. This is because their business was relatively unprofitable before the war, or might even have involved a loss. Such a position could be corrected by the trader approaching the Prices Commissioner with a view to having his gross profit margin raised. On the other hand, where net profit is very high, the Prices Commissioner is empowered to reduce gross profit margins. In discussing variations in gross profit margins with traders who show substantial increases in both gross and net profits, these factors are taken into account. Without this form of check upon the operations of traders, it would be difficult to maintain an effective system of price control. Normally, agreement is reached between the trader concerned and the Prices Commissioner, and this sometimes involves the trader in making refunds direct to Government Departments where large sales have been made to these Departments. In other cases, the prices of goods to the public are reduced. The Prices Commissioner is empowered to fix the gross profit margin on any  commodity or for a group of commodities as a whole, and he is acting entirely in the public interests in checking the rise in profits that may take place under war-time conditions. There is little doubt that this method of controlling prices has protected the public and the Government against excess profits.Finally, in the ordinary work of price fixation on estimated future costs, it is frequently impossible to fix a price which will give exactly the results intended. Sometimes the approved prices may be too low; sometimes they may be too high. In the latter cases traders are required to refund the excess to the public by a reduction of gross profit margin for future trading. On the other hand, where the results are too adverse to the trader, an increase in gross profit is permitted. These are normal operations under price control.As indicated already, traders who have been called to discuss their profit position with the Prices Commissioner have not necessarily committed breaches of the Prices Regulations. In some cases where it has been necessary to exercise strong legal control, the Minister for Trade and Customs has  declared  the traders, that is, he has declared all goods and services handled by such traders to be declared goods under the National Security (Prices) Regulations. This enables the Prices Commissioner to fix maximum prices for the goods in which the trader in question deals. Where a trader is not  declared , no public announcement is made. It would be unfair to the trader concerned to do so, because there is no evidence of a breach of the Prices Regulations, though the Prices Commissioner may think that the gross profit margin should be reduced.

75,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HUGHES, William Morris","DQC","North Sydney","N/A","Leader of the United Australia party",2470,". - This bill reaffirms the principle of preference to returned soldiers within the ambit of the powers of the Commonwealth, and- especially in regard to employment in the Commonwealth Public Service. To that extent the bill is welcomed. Because time is short, I shall confine my remarks to those portions of the measure which seem to me to leave something to be desired. The Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin), in explaining the bill, said at the outset that it was inadequate as a fulfilment of the policy of preference in employment for returned soldiers. He hoped, he said, that when that grant of powers which had been recommended by the Constitution Conference had been made, a wider measure, covering the whole field of employment in industry, would be drafted and presented to Parliament. That is what we all hope.Under this bill the system of preference in making appointments to the Commonwealth Public Service, which has been followed since 1915, will not be varied, other than by such modifications and amplifications as experience has shown to be desirable. This policy has never been restricted during those 27 years, but it has been amplified, though not widely. The degree of preference provided under the bill is-Temporary Employment. full preference (present practice).Permanent Appointment.Fourth Division positions -For positions to be filled by appointment from outside the Service - Full preference (present practice).For positions normally filled by advancement of young officers who must he provided for (positions such as postman, mail officer, lineman, mechanic) - Continuation, of practice followed since 1926 (50 per cent, of vacancies to be reserved for returned soldiers). This will involve a restriction of present numbers in recruitment and advancement of young officers.Third division positions -For professional and technical positions to be filled by appointment from outside the Service - full preference (present practice).For positions of clerk - 50 per cent, of appointments to be returned soldiers and 50 per cent, available for youths.Age limits - present maximum age, 50 years, to stand.The Prime Minister pointed out that in the present war, problems had arisen which did not exist, or were not substantial in the last war, arising out of the employment of hundreds of thousands of persons in munitions factories and on war work generally. The right honorable gentleman said that many of those workers had wished to enlist, but had been prevented from doing so; and he considered that they were entitled to the same preference and privileges as the returned soldier. The Prime Minister referred also to employees of the Civil Constructional Corps who. work on aerodromes in operational areas. They are subject to all the risks and hazards of war to which they would not be exposed in following their occupations in normal times. I shall deal with that class of person in a few moments.Whilst much can be said for the principles that the Prime Minister has enunciated, I see no clear line of demarcation between the civilian to whom this preference is to be given and. his fellow employees. They are not soldiers. True, some of them wanted to be soldiers, but the fact remains that they are not soldiers. Will any honorable member contend that the mere fact that they were willing to enlist but were prevented from enlisting is equivalent to service on the battlefield? It is not. That is why we distinguish the soldier from the civilian. When the air raid sirens sound, the order given to civilians is to take shelter. But the order to the soldier when the battle begins is to go into action, to expose himself to danger. That is the vital distinction between the soldier and the civilian. That service - the readiness to die, to place himself in the forefront of the battle and to go where he istold - dwarfs all others. To that discipline and service the civilian is a stranger. For that reason, I make a great distinction between the soldier and the civilian, between the man in the factory and the man on the battlefield. It is necessary to reserve people for other duties than military service. We cannot carry on a war without them. But that applies to every civilian in the Commonwealth. We must all play our part; that is our duty in the war. But there is a world of difference between the soldier and the civilian. The soldier is exposed to risks from which the civilian is sheltered. I see a very great difficulty in distinguishing between the different classes of persons in the workshop. The preference which the Government proposes will cover such a multitude as to make it worthless. Under present conditions, it may well apply to 600,000 men now under arms. If that number is to be swollen by another 400,000 men, preference will be valueless.The preference about which I speak is preference to soldiers who have fought, or who have been ready to fight. If they have not been in the forefront of battle, the reason is that the orders of their superior officer placed them where they were, and there they were as necessary to victory as if they had been in the front line. I shall not dwell unduly upon the advantages of civil life compared with army life, because they are so obvious. The days work may be arduous, the hours long, but we go home and sleep in a peaceful bed undisturbed by the enemy. Therefore, I am opposed to extending the principle of preference to persons other than members of the services. The principle of preference to soldiers must be confined to members of the forces.I now desire to refer briefly to the principle of preference to returned soldiers on government jobs. The Prime Minister saw difficulty in granting that preference, but I see none. When this matter arose during the last war, a Labour government decided that every contractor should give preference of employment to returned soldiers. As to the power to enforce that preference, I am concerned, not with the legal authority, but with the power residing in the person who lets a contract over the person who submits tenders for it. When the Commonwealth Government is practically the only big employer in the country that can allocate work, it is in a very powerful position. Yesterday, honorable members were speaking of the coal-miner. He is in a strong position because nobody else can cut coal. People who speak glibly about the employment of free labour in the mines do not know what they are talking about. If all the free labour in Australia were offered for use in the coalmining industry it would not be sufficient to get enough coal to send one steamship from Australia to Honolulu. Let us look at the position of contractors seeking workers. The Commonwealth Government is the great employer of labour to-day. Hundreds of millions of pounds is being spent by the Commonwealth Government, and it is in a position to say to contractors :  If you want to share in this work you must give preference in employment to ex-service men . I shall not emphasize that point further. It is obvious.I turn now to another point. Whatever the contract forms say, every contractor in Australia knows that in all his contracts he must give preference to unionists. This is not only implied, but it is also explicitly stated in some contracts. If the Government has power to enforce preference to unionists, as, in fact, it is doing to-day, it also has power to enforce preference to returned soldiers. I wish to make my position quite clear. In 1915, when I introduced the original measure which gave preference to returned soldiers, I was the head of one of the most militant industrial organizations in Australia, as well as of the Government. I believed, not only in unionism, but also in preference to unionists. I have retained those opinions through the changing years. But I believed then, as I believe now, in preference to returned soldiers as returned soldiers and not as unionists. I think it is a very obvious evasion of a plain duty to say to returned soldiers,  Yes, you may have preference if you become unionists . The returned soldiers could have had such preference by staying at home. But their country was in deadly peril and they rushed to its defence. As soldiers, they have earned and richly deserved preference. I have always said, and have never attempted to hide my opinion, that returned soldiers should join unions, but that is another matter entirely. I say that if a returned soldier is looking for a job an employer who wants a man should be obliged to engage him. That is a point that the Opposition will urge in connexion with this measure. We desire that condition to be stated in black and white so that every man will know where he stands. We are not offering returned, soldiers golden crowns, but we must offer them work if they are fit for work. Of course they must be fit for a job. It would be of no use to give a onelegged ex-soldier the job of carrying bricks up a ladder. Obviously he could not do the work. A man must have some apparent fitness for the job on which he is to be employed.The Opposition will press for provision in this measure that the preference shall be confined to members of the fighting services, male and female. We do not consider that the preference should go beyond the fighting services to civilians, except those who are employed in the mercantile marine in danger zones and such waters as may be proclaimed.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1943","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

77,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HUGHES, William Morris","DQC","N/A","N/A","N/A",2472,"- Yes, I thank the honorable member for Moreton (Mr. Francis) for his reminder. Civilians employed in the mercantile marine and in aviation are engaged in military operations, and the extension of the provision of preference to them would be a recognition of the great work that the mercantile marine and the civil air services are doing - a recognition that is long overdue. I congratulate the Government upon having included such personnel in the bill. Subject to these exceptions, the bill should be confined to personnel engaged in defence services. I point out that the number of persons employed at this moment by contractors for the Government is larger than the number normally employed by the Public Service. Preference to returned soldiers should apply to all work directly done by the Government and to work carried out by private employers for the Government.The Prime Minister has said that to deal with this subject at present is unreal. Because there were more jobs waiting than we have men available to take them, he would have us believe that there is no need for this measure. In a community in which there were no sick people, it would be of no use passing an act of Parliament to deal with health, and in a country where every body wa3 employed and every body was contented with labour conditions, it would be of no use to bring down a bill dealing with employment and hours of labour. But, as a matter of fact, this bill deals with an existing situation, and a situation that will continue to exist perhaps for years.I turn now to another point. It is proposed to reserve 50 per cent, of the appointments to the service for youths. In my opinion, this is not justified. There are young men between the ages of IS and 21 years in the fighting forces who are capable of filling positions in the Public Service, and there are many young men who have lied gloriously for their countrys sake in saying that they were eighteen years of age when in fact they were only sixteen or seventeen years of age. The Public Service will have at its disposal youths who could fill, for the time being, the positions which the men on active service would normally fill, and from which they would be advanced. The advancement of the me/, who are in the fighting services must be anticipated and provided for.I leave the matter at this point. The bill reaffirms the principle of preference to returned soldiers which has been, the law of this country for 27 years, which has served as a guide to the community and as evidence that we . do not forget our soldiers. We have kept them ever fresh in our memory. Their deeds of valour and sacrifice are not to be repaid by tributes of words, but by deeds. The principle of preference to returned soldiers is the outward and invisible sign of our gratitude - a gratitude which is enduring and must be substantial. The Opposition is determined that it shall be as substantial as our power can make it.I say to the Attorney-General that I question very much whether there is, at present, any limitation whatever to our power to legislate for the employment of soldiers. I do not believe that our defence powers fall short in anything that it is necessary for us to do for the defence of the country, and in the conditions that arise therefrom. The principle by which the High Court has been guided is that there must be a relation between the thing done, and the defence of the country. The relations between the employment of returned personnel and the war is obvious. I venture to say that if the Government took its courage in its hands and brought in a measure of preference to returned soldiers not only in the government service but in industry generally it would be intra vires the powers of the Commonwealth.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1943","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is a non-party bill. It is also, I suggest, essentially a bill for examination at the committee stage. As to certain details to which the right honorable gentleman referred there may be differences of opinion. We may agree on the general principle, hut differ as to the proper and just way to give effect to it. For that reason the Government welcomes the contribution made to the problem by the right honorable member. The problem has been stated, in principle, by the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) and the right honorable member for North Sydney, but the application of the principle is extraordinarily difficult because of the changing aspects of the war and the great difference between service rendered in this war and service rendered in the last war. The problem of preference in relation to the last war was comparatively simple, but in relation to this war it is most difficult.I wish to refer to the question of legislative power. The question is: Has the Commonwealth Parliament power to pass a law giving preference to service personnel in respect of all employment throughout Australia? If it has such power, it follows logically that employment in and by State governments and State instrumentalities can be dealt with as well as employment by private employers.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1943","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That proposal has not yet been carried into effect except in, I think, two or three of the States. Therefore, that doubt- is not at present resolved. That is one of the reasons why the Government would have preferred this matter to be dealt with more comprehensively during the next sittings of the Parliament, and in an atmosphere entirely free from party politics. As a matter of fact, unless the principle of preference for ex-servicemen be divorced from party politics, their interests will be prejudiced.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1943","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The real problem will be, how can employment, and security in it, be provided, for all? Therefore, in dealing with preference, we must always have in mind the outstanding objective that employment must be available to all the people of this country, particularly because in this war, which in Australia is becoming a total war, it may fairly be said that every citizen is doing what he or she is directed to do.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1943","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I agree with the right honorable gentleman that that is not an answer to the bill, but is merely one aspect of the problem which deserves consideration. We must never lose sight of it.Three departmental committees have been engaged on the problem. The first committee dealt with it as far back as June, 1941. The points which that committee then made were very important: First, that it was desirable that there should be uniformity of legislation on this topic in the State parliaments as well as the Commonwealth. Apparently, all who were concerned believed at that time that the Commonwealth Parliament could not legislate universally for preference. Further, none of the States has so far dealt legislatively with the problem in relation to the present war; consequently, in that respect the Commonwealth Parliament is taking the lead. Secondly- and this is very important in view of the right honorable gentlemans recent comment - the committee said this -The subcommittee is of opinion that the whole question of preference should bo reconsidered if Australia should become a theatre of war. The sub-committee also considered the position of non-combatant auxiliary services, rejected volunteers, munition workers, and persons in other reserved occupations, but was of opinion that there was no present justification-This was early in 1941 - for the extension of preference to those classes of persons. If, however, Australia should become a theatre of war, their position in regard to preference, and indeed that of the entire Australian population, should be reconsidered.Although, I suppose, it would not be correct to say that Australia - referring to the continent itself - has become .a theatre of war in the full sense, the danger of that i3 always present. The whole position of war service in Australia has, therefore, changed during the last fifteen months. Thirdly, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, all the committees have agreed upon some system of recruitment of young people to the Commonwealth service. The bill provides that that system shall be continued when the Public Service Board approves, but with a limit of 50 per cent, on such recruits","N/A","COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1943","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I ask honorable members to give the Government power to extend the benefits, of the measure to persons who have served in combat areas or in danger zones. That would hardly include the firemen, and it would not include the factory worker, except in unforeseen circumstances.

I believe that the only contracts in which reference is made to an award or to the organized union are clothing contracts. As all honorable members know, in the clothing trade, great difficulty arises not with contractors who employ persons bound by the award, but with contractors who give out their work to what are called out-workers, namely, sub-contractors, who work under conditions which practically amount to  sweating . The objective of the provision in the clothing contracts of the Department of Supply and Shipping is to ensure that clothing shall be manufactured under decent conditions. It has little relation to the general question of preference to unionists. I am assured by the permanent head of the Department of Supply and Shipping that that is the object of that provision. There is nothing that would prevent the inclusion in contracts of some provision as to soldiers, but then that is not adequate. You say to your contractor, You have to give preference to soldiers , but he hands out sub-contracts to maybe 50 other people. The only solution is the direct one - compelling preference at the point of employment. The only way in which to deal with the matter would be by a law relating to employment which would require that substantial preference be given, not merely by contractors to the Commonwealth Government, but also by all employers. In that way, you will protect those who have served in combat, or who have served the nation in capacities which, though not equivalent to service in the fighting forces, are fairly analogous.I favour the broadest application of the principle of benefiting the serviceman. I see difficulties about the Commonwealths power, but I do claim that this is the first instalment of this principle in Australia.No State government has attempted to do H.

Let me first of all say a few words about the respects in which it goes too far.The operative provision of this bill is to be found in clause 2, which adds a new section, 6a, to the principal act. I direct, particular attention to the fact that the proposed sub-sections go far beyond preference to members of the fighting services. In my view, if there is one truth that is elementary in this matter, it is this: That, once you go beyond preference to members of the fighting services, you commit yourself to a sea of possibilities, and you will end by destroying the real value of preference. Preference is to be extended to merchant seamen, for whose work I have, in common with all other honorable members, the greatest admiration. They are men who work in circumstances of the greatest danger. There are also many hundreds of thousands of workers in factories in Great Britain who have worked in circumstances of enormous danger. But they are not members of the fighting services.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1943","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is not given because some one has survived, or challenged, or dared danger. It is a very meritorious thing, for people to undertake great dangers and hazards, but that is not the basis on which preference is given. Surely, the basis on which you give preference to a returned member of the fighting services is that something has been taken out of his life. He has gone away from his job, abandoned that task for two, three or four years. When he comes back he finds some one who has not abandoned his task is so much more advanced, perhaps so much more skilled, than he is. Preference is given to compensate him for that loss, to restore him bv preference to the position he would have been in if he had not abandoned it to become a member of the fighting services.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1943","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

146,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MENZIES, Robert","N76","N/A","N/A","N/A",2480,"- Yes, all members of the fighting services. Those people have gone out of civil occupation. But take the case of a man working in the munitions industry. He is doing work of great national value, and he may in certain circumstances, such as a bombing attack, do work in circumstances of danger. But the fundamental fact is that he is, by the very nature of that work, continuing his civil life, so that in point of skill and employability he finishes his war service a better man than when he started it. The man who has been in the fighting services, in point of civil employability, in nine cases out of ten, finishes war a worse man, in that he is less competent and less experienced than he would have been had the war not occurred. That is the true principle on which preference should be based. That is why I say that this bill goes too far in extending preference to people, however meritorious their service may have been, who do not come within the proposition.My other criticism is that the bill in some respects is completely inadequate. Once the Government decides that it will introduce a Public Service Bill, it confines the subject-matter with which it can deal, and this bill deals only with the Commonwealth Public Service. It touches a small fragment of the problem, and, what is perhaps more regrettable, it exercises only a small portion of the Commonwealth power. I am familiar with all the difficulties and the doubts that exist or arise in relation to the legal powers of the Commonwealth, but I say - and I have no doubt that the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) will agree - that, whatever doubt there may be as to the outer limits of the Commonwealths legal power to deal with preference, there can be no question as to the Commonwealths power to require preference, first, in its own Public Service, with which this bill deals; secondly, in ill authorities set up under Commonwealth law; and, thirdly, in employment under all contracts given to contractors with whom the Commonwealth deals.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1943","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Those are the three categories on which there can be no argument about the powers of the Commonwealth. For my purposes, it is sufficient to say that; but, as there is a good deal of public interest in this question of whether the Commonwealth power in relation to repatriation is at present truncated, I refer very briefly to a well-known legal authority on this matter. My own view is, and always has been, that just as the defence power of the Commonwealth takes a large sweep of functions, just as that power enables the Commonwealth Government and the Commonwealth Parliament to convert people from being civilians into soldiers, to convert a country at peace to a country at war, just as it authorizes all sorts of steps for this purpose it leaves us, when the war is over, to reverse the process. The reverse process must equally be within the competence of the Commonwealth Parliament. What a curious view it would be of the defence power of the Commonwealth if you could move people from point A to point B and then have no power to move them back from point B to point A. The true view was categorically enunciated in the High Court in the case the Attorney-General v Balding, with which the Attorney-General is familiar, and which is reported 27 C.L.R. 398. The question that arose had to do with preferential payment in respect of certain money. The then Chief Justice, Sir Adrian Knox, Mr. Justice Isaacs, Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy, Mr. Justice Powers and Mr. Justice Rich, the then Full Bench of the High Court, said this -In our opinion the Commonwealth Parliament had power under Section 51 (vi.) of the Constitution (the defence power) to enact this provision. It is a provision for the re-establishment in civil life of persons who have served in the defence forces of the Commonwealth when they are discharged from such service. That is a matter so intimately connected with the defence of the Commonwealth as manifestly to be included within the scope of the power.That is a short but very authoritative and clear statement regarding the extent of the Commonwealths power in this matter.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1943","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If the Commonwealth Government can authorize a commission to give preference to unionists, it can compel a commission to give preference to returned soldiers. Therefore, I referred to these two examples in passing for the purpose of showing that there is an undoubted area of power within which the Commonwealth can operate in order to give effective preference to the people who come within the true principle upon which preference ought to be awarded. Because I believe that, I consider that this bill is, fundamentally, hopelessly inadequate. It goes too far in the nature of the preference which it awards, but stops too short in the area which it covers, and I arn left wondering why, in such haste, such an inadequate and unsatisfying bill was produced to the > House.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1943","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

158,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ROSEVEAR, John","L08","Dalley","N/A","N/A",2482,".- Obviously, the intention of the amendment submitted by the right honorable member for Kooyong (Mr. Menzies) is to insert in tins bill certain provisions which the Senate has incorporated in the Australian Soldiers Repatriation Bill. For that reason, I shall oppose the amendment. The principle of preference, upon which the Senate insists, is evidence that the Senate is pulling, not only its own leg, but also the leg of the public. The right honorable member for Kooyong first claimed that the bill went too far, and then he inconsistently declared that it did not go far enough. We meet, in all deliberative chambers, the person who claims that a motion goes too far, but that an amendment does not go far enough. Usually, that person has an entirely destructive mind. The amendment is an attempt to wreck the bill in order to rescue some of the sentiments which have been expressed by the Senate.It is true that any bill which seeks to give preference to returned soldiers in this war will have to solve remarkable problems. This war is, to Australia, entirely different from the last Avar, particularly with regard to preference to returned soldiers. In the last war, Australia was in a zone of comparative safety; but even the greatest optimist would not contend that the country is not in danger now, and that if the forces now screening this country are broken, any part of Australia is a potential battlefield. In the last war, Australia provided soldiers, sailors and some airmen, who fought many thousands of miles from these shores, but Australia made practically little contribution to equipping its army. Since 1939, we have been compelled to adopt new methods, because we are now responsible for equipping our forces. Australia has an army of volunteers and conscripts, and an equally large army in 1he workshops, which is providing the troops with the sinews of war. From time to time, we impress upon the workers that the front line of defence is as much in1 the workshops as on the battle field. We encourage the belief that in these days of mechanized warfare, the responsibility and the duty of the workers is equally as great as that of the fighting forces, even though the danger to life and limb is not so imminent. When we speak of total war, in which all elements of the community, on both the military and industrial fronts, are involved by methods of compulsion, we add to the complications of repatriation, and of the application of the principle of preference to returned soldiers.The right honorable member for Kooyong asked :  If the bill is passed in its present form, and men other than those in the fighting forces are included, what will be the value of the preference ?  He claimed that preference to returned soldiers is granted, not because they went, into danger zones, but because they earned it. Many other sections of the community have also earned recognition in the matter of repatriation. The right honorable gentleman said that these men earned the preference because something was taken out of their lives. During the period of their military service, they lost some of the skill that they possessed when in industry, and some time will elapse after the war before they will regain their touch. Whilst that is largely true of a large number of soldiers, it must be remembered that mechanized warfare has enabled many unskilled men to learn a trade. Aviation will undoubtedly be the most common means of transport in future. At the expense of the Government, many men have been trained as highly skilled aviators. That opportunity would never have presented itself to them if they had remained in civil life.","N/A","COMMONWEALTH PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1943","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not desire to offer any criticism of what has been done or said, or proposed in either House. I inform the country that I accepted a commission to conduct His Majestys Government in this country with the full realization that I would not have a majority of supporters in the Parliament, but I believed that there would bo a disposition on the part of the Government and the Parliament to endeavour to make decisions on important bills which would meet the requirements of the country, and would be as satisfactory as could be achieved in the circumstances, and in compliance with the wishes of the majority of the members of the Parliament. I hoped that we would be able to deal with the domestic and internal problems of the country on the basis of good government, and, at the same time, devote the best of our capacities to the overriding duty which the war imposes upon us. I stand by all those desires. I am most anxious that this Parliament shall fulfil its trusteeship to the people. I hoped that any differences of opinion between the Houses would be so composed as to provide a solution acceptable to both, and, at the same time, be of service to the people of Australia as a whole. I very much regret that the circumstances of the last few weeks have made the task of government extraordinarily difficult. Even in peace-time a government meeting Parliament with the balance as it is in this House, and with a majority against it on general policy in the other House, would require to apply its best capacity to the problems of government; hut these are not even normal times. The best capacity of the Government cannot be directed to the carrying on of the routine business of our domestic order in these days; it has to be concentrated upon the task of seeing that the country is sustained against the enemy. I say no more than to express the hope that by meeting again next Wednesday the members of each House of the Parliament may bring to the problems of the Government and of the country a degree of co-operation which will be successful.","N/A","SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The right honorable gentleman has not had the assistance from the members of the Senate that he might have had: I say that with extreme regret, because members of the party to which I belong are involved. I said last week in a somewhat jocular vein that honorable gentlemen of the Senate were acting in a way which would justify the abolition of that body. What they have now done would justify it still more. I do not hold with all the legislation brought in by this Government. I would not wish to go out on the hustings to support what the Government has done, in certain respects. But there was no. need for the Senate to take the step it took yesterday in relation to the particular measure that was before it. The members of the Senate behaved like children in refusing to consider the bill introduced for the purpose of granting votes to certain members of the fighting services. They adopted a childish, and an obstructionist, attitude, such as I hope the members of this House would not adopt. I do not associate myself with them in that connexion. I am ashamed of what was done. I can understand the feeling of the Leader of the Government, and I do not wonder at it. This sort of thing must be abhorrent to the public of this country. I realize that some of the great newspapers of the country are backing the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, and have said that the Senate has  come into its own  and has come to life.

The friction has been generated in this chamber itself. As John Selden said, when two men ride on the same horse, one must ride in front. Under the bi-cameral system of government, one House must be in front, and that is the House of Representatives ; but that does not entitle this House to push the other House off altogether. Action taken in this chamber has, I think, provoked the Senate to defer consideration of the Commonwealth Electoral (War-time) Bill. I refer to the refusal of this House to discuss the National Security Bill, which had been sent from the Senate. If the House of Representatives does not wish to discuss measures received from the other chamber, the Senate has the right to refuse to consider proposals made by the House of Representatives. We should try to obviate the causes of friction between the two Houses of this Parliament and between the parliaments of the Commonwealth and of the States.","N/A","SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am not voicing anything new when I say that this Parliament hae never been on an even keel since the last general elections. It would perhaps be more correct to say that it has been on. too even a keel since that time. We have been cursed with a Government that will not govern, and with an Opposition that will not oppose. That situation still obtains, and for all practical purposes, the Opposition to which I belong might as well not exist. It would be a good thing if certain members of the Opposition took their rightful places on the government benches, and did it quickly. The only other alternative is to follow the course which is opposed by the honorable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr. Perkins) and to make an appeal to our masters, the electors.

I say that as one who would go the whole distance, and wholeheartedly, in company with the honorable member for Eden-Monaro, in conducting the obsequies of a place which does not seem to be entirely necessary for our governmental purposes.I sincerely hope that the motion submitted by the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) will be carried. It appears to be a very reasonable and orderly motion, and entirely coincides with my view of the purpose for which this Parliament meets: that, having failed to complete our work this week, we should decide to work next week. Our position is almost like that of the hod-carrier who, not having carried all his bricks on one day, decides that he will cease work at half-past five in the evening and resume work at 7 oclock on the following morning.

The Government, through the Prime Minister, rather seems to believe that, in the special circumstances of the case - that is to say, in view of the fact that a dreadful war is being waged - the objects which it has in view, and which, I am sure, it is very spiritedly endeavouring to carry out, have been, in some degree at all events, frustrated. I assure you, Mr. Speaker, that I was a member of a Government which had arrayed against it a Senate which was so unanimous in its disapproval of and opposition to the Government as to make the Senate of the present day appear a pigmy by comparison. Still, we got along as best we could. This Government, I am sure, will also get along as best it can. It has a very difficult task. I sympathize with it, because the balance of the parties, which makes government difficult, is the creation not of this Parliament, but of the electorate itself. So much must be fairly acknowledged. I am glad that this House is to meet next Wednesday.

179,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HOLT, Harold","009MC","Fawkner","N/A","N/A",2486,".- I consider that the Prime Minister (Mr.Curtin) has acted wisely in proposing a somewhat longer interval between the sittings than has been the practice within recent weeks, because in the meantime he and his Government will have the opportunity to recover that sense of proportion and balance which apparently they have lost as the result of a condition known as  endofthesession jitters . What is it that justifies the extraordinary statements that have been made by the Prime Minister and some other honorable members? We have heard it said that this Parliament has not been able to do its work on the major matters which the Government has had to introduce in order to forward the war effort of this country. I invite the House to reflect for a few moments on some evidence of the workability of this Parliament. As one of its members, I challenge - and I consider that the House itself is entitled to challenge - the statement of the honorable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) that this is the worst Parliament in the history of the Commonwealth. I say to him that I know of no parliament in the history of the Commonwealth which, in a comparatively short period, has had to deal with more matters of great moment than those with which this Parliament has dealt. I refresh the memory of the House on the fact that, in the short life of this Parliament, it has dealt with and passed a major measure of constitutional reform in the uniform income tax legislation. The bill dealing with the Militia was another highly important and controversial measure. The House has also dealt with unprecedented financial obligations, imposing new and novel burdens upon the people of the Commonwealth. The legislative and administrative record of this Parliament will have an important and honoured place with the records of past Commonwealth Parliaments. That has been done in the most difficult practical situation in which any Parliament could be placed. The fault does not lie with individual members, or with the people. By a tragic twist of fate, this Parliament assembled after the last elections with the parties almost evenly divided, the two independents in this House not owing definite allegiance, or disclosed allegiance, to one or another set of policies.Despite those difficulties, this Parliament has carried on. In view of the position in which this Parliament was placed immediately after the general elections, with the parties fairly evenly divided, it is proper to remind the Prime Minister that if he, as Leader of the Government wanted to give to this country the best possible war effort of which it was capable, he was bound to use the talents and political experience of members of all parties in forming a non-party administration. Let the responsibility for that not having been done lie where it should lie. We on this side have at all times generously left the offer open. We have been prepared to make the best talent within our ranks available, not necessarily to a leader of our choosing, but to the Leader of the present Government. That offer has been open to the Prime Minister all the time. If the Prime Minister finds himself in a hopeless administrative situation as regards the work of the Parliament, the people of Australia will demand to know why he has not taken the obvious course, and instead now contemplates plunging this country into a war-time election many months before the necessity for it arises. These are things upon which the right honorable gentleman should reflect, and, therefore, it is well that there will be a long week-end in which he and his colleagues may do so. He may well ask himself whether the Parliament has indeed reached such a stage that it will not work. Let us consider how the present situation arose. We must remember that as late as breakfast-time this morning the Prime Minister and most of his colleagues believed that the Parliament would rise to-day and adjourn for a period of some months.","N/A","SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Government and its supporters are entitled to its opinion on that subject. Obviously, there are many organizations representing the classes of persons who are likely to be affected by that measure. The persons and bodies concerned are entitled to reflect upon it, and to submit their views for our consideration. The Prime Minister would be acting wisely if he allowed both the measures which have been the cause of this difficulty to stand over until the Parliament meets again after the forthcoming recess. The Opposition has not suggested a lengthy recess between these sittings and the next meeting of the Parliament; the gap could be made one month, two months, or three months, to suit the convenience of the Administration. There is no justification at all for forcing these measures through the Parliament, and there can be no possible justification for saying that refusal to pass them in the closing days of this sessional period means that the Parliament has suddenly become unworkable. I hope that over the week-end the attack of jitters will pass, and that a sense of proportion will return, so that the Parliament may continue with the useful work that it has been able to do during this period of the war.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[7]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I now desire to inform the honorable member that, as I previously advised him, there is an acute shortage of hotel accommodation in capital cities which is due partly to the large number of personnel from the fighting forces and to some extent to manpower difficulties. However, a hostel has recently been opened in the Marcus Clark building, Sydney, for troops on leave in Sydney, and it is anticipated that this will relieve the accommodation problem. With a view to ensuring that existing hotels in Sydney accept guests to the full capacity of their accommodation, suitable representations are now being made to the New South Wales Government and the man-power authorities.","AUSTRALIAN ARMY: HOTEL ACCOMODATION IN SYDNEY.","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[4]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In the course of my reply, I stated that Mr. Vance Palmer has been engaged for the purpose of assisting in the preparation of material dealing with absenteeism, and that I would ascertain what other cost was involved.I now desire to inform the honorable member that the cost of the section will comprise the salaries of the persons required to compile and prepare for publication, information about industrial welfare for industry, workers and the public. Arrangements have been made for the section to work in close collaboration with the Department of Information, upon which it will rely for the distribution of material for newspaper publication. The main part of the sections work is the preparation of technical bulletins and pamphlets covering such subjects as the establishment and operation of factory canteens, the improvement of working conditions in foundries, the ventilation of factories under black-out conditions, &c. In addition to Mr. VancE Palmer, two persons are employed full time on other aspects of publication work, viz., a permanent officer of the Australian Broadcasting Commission lately transferred to the department on loan, and a Victorian public servant who has been on loan to the department for the past eleven months. Further, the departments plans provide for the engagement of one other journalist. It may be necessary also from time to time to employ other persons temporarily to assist with special work. For example, recently two officers were borrowed for three weeks from the Rationing Commission.Excluding temporary staff required for special work and the remuneration of Mr. Palmer, who is paid on a fee basis, the estimated cost of the additional employees - including provision for clerical and typing assistance - required to establish the section is approximately £1,750 per annum. It is considered that this sum is moderate in view of the results that will be achieved from the publication for general use of technical and other information on industrial conditions which is becoming available to the department.","DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE: PUBLICRELATIONS AND PUBLICITY BRANCH.","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[7]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
