3,0,0,0,1,1,"ODowd, Ken, MP",139441,"Flynn","LNP","N/A",7585," I present the 28th report of the Petitions Committee for the 46th Parliament, together with 73 petitions and 96ministerial responses to petitions previously presented—you might need a forklift for them!In the last sitting week I tabled the committees report on its inquiry into petitioning security and accessibility. During this inquiry, the committee conducted a thorough examination of the security features of the House e-petitions system and considered what impact they had had on the public accessibility of petitioning.The committee also considered whether additional security features, such as the use of official records to verify identity should be implemented, if an age requirement should be imposed on petitioning and whether the current practice of users self-declaring their Australian citizenship or residency was enough to uphold the legitimacy of the petitioning process.Throughout the inquiry, the committee were particularly mindful of how any change to the system would impact on a persons democratic right to petition the House, and to ensure that the process for petitioning electronically was, as far as possible, no more onerous than signing or creating a paper petition by hand.The committees final report on the inquiry provides a thorough presentation and analysis of the evidence received, including from some international and domestic jurisdictions that support petitioning. In the report, the committee concluded that any proposed changes to the current system security or processes, beyond routine upgrades, would disadvantage certain cohorts of the community and diminish their right to accessible petitioning. The committee therefore made no recommendations for change, but instead will continue to monitor the current process and conduct reviews as necessary.I look forward to further updating the House on the work of the Petitions Committee.HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVESPETITIONS COMMITTEEREPORT No. 28Petitions and Ministerial Responses9 August 2021MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEEChair Mr Ken ODowd MPDeputy Chair Hon Justine Elliot MPMrs Bridget Archer MPMs Lisa Chesters MPMs Gladys Liu MPMr Julian Simmonds MPMr James Stevens MPMs Susan Templeman MPReport summarising the petitions and Ministerial responses being presented.The committee met in private session on 26 May, 2 June, 16 June, 23 June, 15 July, and 4 August 20211.

7,0,0,0,1,1,"Christensen, George, MP",230485,"Dawson","LNP","N/A",7691," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.This quote is oft-misattributed to Mahatma Ghandi but is directly applicable to the Human Rights (Children Born Alive Protection) Bill 2021 before us today.To protect its most vulnerable, in 1990, Australia ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which, according to the Australian Child Rights Taskforce, means that Australia has a duty to ensure that all children in Australia enjoy these rights.Article 6 of the convention commits Australia to recognising that every child has the inherent right to life; and ensuring to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child.Article 24 of the convention commits Australia to recognising the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health. Our nation has signed up to striving to ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to such health care services. Further, Article 24 says Australia shall take appropriate measures to diminish infant and child mortality.In short, Australia has committed to every child having the right to life, every child having access to health care and reducing the deaths of babies.Yet, in this nation, potentially hundreds of babies are born alive as a result of abortion procedures without any significant subsequent intervention. Our most vulnerable are simply left to die.The data is sketchy with no information available from most states but a research paper that I asked the Parliamentary Library to undertake found that in a single year, 33 babies aborted after 20 weeks gestation were born alive in Victoria while, in Queensland, 204 babies were born alive as a result of abortions over a 10-year period.In fact, in Queensland, the problem is systemic with Queensland Healths Clinical Guidelines for Termination of Pregnancy stating: If [during an abortion] a live birth occurs… Do not provide life sustaining treatment… Document the time and date of death.How is this policy, how are these deaths, in accordance with our international obligation as a nation to every child having the right to life, every child having access to health care and reducing the deaths of babies?How are we treating our most vulnerable members and what does it say about our nation?Let me be clear: I am pro-life. I think abortion is an evil and it results in a death of a child and often ongoing mental harm for a parent. I would rather no child be aborted in this country or elsewhere.But whether you are pro-life or so-called pro-choice, I do not know that anyone but the most cold-blooded sociopath could say that a child born alive is not a child and thus does not have any rights.So the Human Rights (Children Born Alive Protection) Bill 2021 seeks to use our constitutional external affairs power to address the fact that we have policies and practices across the country that result in us breaching our international obligations and that result in the lives of babies unnecessarily being lost.It does so by placing a duty of care on medical practitioners to provide exactly the same medical care and treatment to a child born alive as a result of an abortion as they would a child born in any other circumstances.Under this bill, breaching that duty would incur a penalty and there is a new obligation for medical practitioners to report to the federal department of health on children born alive as a result of abortions.A survey conducted by the recognised polling company YouGov just last month demonstrated that support for my bill is extremely strong across all sectors of the community.The findings send a very clear message.More than three times as many people support care for these babies rather than oppose care.The majority of people expect any baby should be afforded medical care, regardless of the circumstances of their birth.The survey shows that view is held by both coalition and Labor voters.That view is held by people aged 18 to 34 and those aged over 65.Its a view shared by both men and women, and those living in the inner city and the outer regions.Some have tried to claim—quite falsely—that this bill would require doctors, under threat of penalty, to keep non-viable babies alive. This is not true.Section 9 of the bill states that the medical care and treatment to be provided to a baby born alive as a result of an abortion to be commensurate to the circumstances, not including the fact that they were born as a result of a termination, and goes on to state that this could be life-saving treatment or, indeed, palliative care as the case may be.Some have said this bill would keep babies alive that have congenital deformities. Well, again, only if the baby was viable.And if the baby was viable but had congenital deformities, which is another way of saying the baby was born with disabilities, what is the problem?Are people saying that children born with disabilities should be left to die? That is a very dark road indeed that I will never be taking.Others have claimed that this bill perpetuates a myth that children are born alive a result of abortions.Well, the available data I garnered via the Parliamentary Library shows that to be a false claim, but even if that claim was correct—which it is not—what harm would this bill actually do?If no viable child is ever born alive as a result of an abortion then this bill has no effect.But if one child, just one, was born alive in such circumstances and that child was viable then this bill would not only have an effect but it would be more important than probably most laws on the books because it would save a life that otherwise would have been discarded like it was medical waste.The fact is there is little to argue against in this bill, unless of course an objector felt that a baby born alive as a result of an abortion should be left to die because it was born as a result of an abortion.Such a position would be in contravention of our international obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.And this goes to the constitutionality of this bill.Some have said that abortion is a state issue but when it comes to providing medical treatment and care to a child and sustaining the life of a child that is a federal matter by virtue of the external affairs power of section 51(xxix) of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia and the fact that the Commonwealth of Australia is signatory to article 6 and article 24 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.I note that there has been some speculation that the bill could breach civil medical conscription provisions inherent in section 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution.As such, I have sought expert opinion from constitutional lawyers courtesy of the Human Rights Law Alliance who have concluded:Our opinion is that there is no Constitutional impediment to the Bill as it does not constitute civil conscription. Specifically:… We think that, properly considered, the Bill would not be characterised as a law with respect to the provision of … medical and dental services within the meaning of s(ection) 51(xxiiiA), and that the civil conscription provision therefore would not apply to it.… Even if the civil conscription prohibition did apply to the Bill, we consider that the Bill, if enacted, would not authorise any form of civil conscription due to its conformity with Australias international human rights obligations, and therefore would not be unconstitutional for breaching the civil conscription prohibition.The bill is constitutional and could pass this parliament.What is perhaps not constitutional are the deaths of viable babies occurring as a result of abortions across this country.I say not constitutional, once again to point out that our external affairs power and our ratification of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child means that, as per article 6 of that convention, Australia recognises:… that every child has the inherent right to life.And Australia:… shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child.And as per article 24 of that convention, Australia recognises:… the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health.And Australia:… shall strive to ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to such health care services.And also Australia:… shall pursue full implementation of this right and, in particular, shall take appropriate measures … to diminish infant and child mortality.Every death of a viable baby born alive as a result of an abortion that happens here means that these fundamental rights of a child enshrined in a UN convention are absent in this country.This needs to be remedied.Lives need to be saved.This bill, the Human Rights (Children Born Alive Protection) Bill 2021, seeks to protect the most vulnerable in our society.The question of whether or not it will go forward from here is going to be a test of the true measure of this House, this parliament and our society.In closing, I want to thank Matthew Sait from the parliamentary council for helping draft this bill. I want to thank my colleague the member for Stirling, who is seconding this bill. I want to thank my colleague at the table the Minister for Regional Health and also the Deputy Prime Minister in supporting this bill.

13,0,0,0,1,1,"Young, Terry, MP",201906,"Longman","LNP","N/A",7695," I move:That this House:(1) notes that the Governments Job-ready Graduates Package is getting more Australians into the degrees that will get them the skills and qualifications to get a job;(2) further notes that the latest data shows there are more Australians studying at university than ever before;(3) recognises that the largest increases in new enrolments are for courses made cheaper by the Job‑ready Graduates Package; and(4) notes that the Government is providing a record $20 billion investment in the higher education sector in 2021.When that final school bell rings and our high-school years come to an end, we make what is possibly one of the hardest decisions of our lives. At school we all had much the same subjects to choose from—English, maths, science, physical education and so on. It was a daily routine we all stuck to. But, when we leave school, our lives are our own and we must forge our own paths. Some people might decide to take up a trade and some might decide to go straight to university while others might hold off on university and travel the world. Whatever you choose to do in this country is okay.These days there are many pathways towards your ultimate career goal. For those people who choose to attend university and get a degree, the Morrison government is creating more opportunities and programs that will provide the best opportunity of getting a job upon graduation. The Job-ready Graduates Package is creating up to 30,000 additional university places in 2021 and bringing down the cost of degrees in key areas. This is just the first step in our plan to create up to 100,000 extra university places by 2030, which will pave the way for even more opportunities for our school leavers and job-ready graduates.Degrees are expensive, and we understand that its not easy to pay for your university degree straight out of school, particularly for those people who are unable to be supported by their parents. Even if a student chooses to take out a HECS-HELP loan, that money has to be paid back eventually. The last thing we as a government want is for a young person to rack up a three- to four-year university debt and graduate with a degree that has very little likelihood of helping them find work. That debt can follow a person around for years or even decades.We also want to reduce the chances of having skills shortages now and in the future, particularly in emerging industries. We want our university graduates to have the best chance of getting work once their studies have been completed, and the way to do that is to steer them towards studying for industries that need workers.One way to entice people into these programs is by lowering their cost. Under the Job-ready Graduates Package the cost of an agriculture degree is down by 59 per cent. The cost of a maths degree is also down by 59 per cent. The cost of a nursing or teaching degree has gone down by 42 per cent. The cost of a science, engineering or IT degree has gone down by 18 per cent. Importantly, we are already seeing evidence that the Job-ready Graduates Package is getting more Australians into the degree that will get them the skills and qualifications they require in order to get a job. In fact, the data from our universities has shown that the largest increases in new university enrolments are for courses in these in-demand fields. The University of Queensland has offered double the number of places in its agriculture program.In my electorate of Longman, the University of the Sunshine Coast, with campuses at Caboolture and Petrie, offers a wide range of these key programs right on our doorstep. In fact, more Australians are now studying the courses that will give them the best chance of getting into a job. Commencements are up 14 per cent in science, 13 per cent in IT, 10 per cent in engineering, 14 per cent in agriculture, 11 per cent in education and eight per cent in health.We are providing a record $20.4 billion investment in higher education in 2021, while funding is up more than 37 per cent since we came to government. We are now seeing the results of our policies. Australias unemployment rate has fallen to 4.9 per cent under the Morrison government, which is the lowest it has been in a decade. Youth unemployment is at its lowest rate in 12 years. I am so pleased that a commonsense approach has been used and that university funding is now demand driven, rather than the old model where students were graduating and in some cases were never able to use the degree they worked so hard for, as there were no jobs in that field. This government will continue to back Australians to get into a job now and into the future.

17,0,0,0,1,1,"Leigh, Andrew, MP","BU8","Fenner","ALP","N/A",7697," The convention on these things is to thank the member for Longman for bringing on the debate and to say how pleased I am that he has done it, but Id be a hypocrite if I did that. The fact is that this is the most antiuniversity government in Australian history. It is bizarre that the member would bring on a motion praising the governments university policies. He should hang his head in shame for the way in which this government has treated universities. Universities are vital to Australias future. Attending university boosts earnings by around 50 per cent compared to finishing high school, translating to some $600,000 of additional earnings for the median woman and $800,000 for the median man.Universities are also critical to Australias exports. They were our fourth-largest export earner before the pandemic hit. Universities employ some 130,000 full-time equivalent workers, and in regional areas they support some 14,000 jobs. The research done in universities is fundamental to Australias prosperity, and at a time like this even those opposite should recognise the value of funding science. Yet the sector is set to lose nearly $4 billion in revenue in 2020 and 2021. The mere $1 billion the government provided in last years budget hasnt been renewed in this years, and when it came to JobKeeper the government changed the rules three times to keep out universities. No, wait; it wasnt all universities. No, they let a couple through. Who did they let through? It was the private universities. Bond University got millions of dollars and New York Universitys Sydney campus got JobKeeper, yet Australian public universities were excluded from JobKeeper.The governments own budget papers show that, because of the Job-ready Graduates Package, Commonwealth funding of universities will be lower and student debt will rise. The fact is that this comes after an ongoing series of attacks by the Morrison government on universities. They killed the demand driven system, bringing back command and control by the Molonglo. Youd think that a party that calls itself Liberal might actually support the demand driven system which allows students to decide where places will be, but, no, they went back to command and control. They botched the China relationship, causing significant challenges for Australias higher education sector. Then, as a result of their bungles in vaccination and quarantine they are further hurting the higher education sector—not just because international students cant come, but because domestic students are caught interstate and because valued faculty cant be brought here to Australia.Let me go through a couple of the particular universities. Charles Sturt University is having to cut bachelor degrees in outdoor education, sustainable agriculture and information technology. Macquarie University is having to cut up to 31 programs in science and engineering. The University of Newcastle is cutting eight undergraduate degrees, including in technology, renewable energy systems and computer science. Swinburne University of Technology is cutting design and languages programs. Central Queensland University is closing campuses. The University of the Sunshine Coast is cutting programs in STEM. The University of Queensland is cutting programs in agriculture and engineering. Murdoch University is cutting programs in physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology and engineering. Across all institutions weve had nearly 2,000 courses cancelled and nearly 200 programs cancelled.At my former university, the Australian National University, the ANU Research School of Earth Sciences, which has done groundbreaking work in plate tectonics, has lost five professors. ANUs physics department, clearly the best in Australia, has lost 20 professorial positions and 40 per cent of PhD students. This is despite the fact that it is one of the most successful centres at research commercialisation. Deakin University has lost nearly 3,000 staff. La Trobe University has lost over 3,000 staff. Monash University has lost 1,000 staff. The Australian National University has literally been decimated—one in 10 staff have gone. Of course, these are only the numbers that the National Tertiary Education Union can pull out. ABS data shows 30,000 fewer Australians working in higher education than at the start of the year. Even the philistines believed in the humanities—in arts, culture, trade and languages—but not this government, the most anti-university government in Australias history.","Job-ready Graduates Package","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr LEIGH (Fenner) ","(10:22):"
18,0,0,0,1,1,"Bell, Angie, MP",282981,"Moncrieff","LNP","N/A",7698," I would like to outline to all Australians that the fact is that one of the biggest threats facing our nations economic recovery is a shortage of skills—a shortage of skills in the right places. During this global pandemic, businesses cannot rely on building a bigger workforce from overseas or from immigration. These levers can no longer be pulled by government at this time to supply workforces that Australian businesses have historically relied upon.The Morrison governments economic plan is delivering jobs for Australians and is skilling the next generation of workers. The Job-ready Graduates Package is part of that plan. Australia will bounce back from COVID-19 through developing our countrys greatest asset and our greatest resource: our own people. Thats why we have seen the development of this governments Job-ready Graduates Package, to ensure more Australians study in the areas that will get them the skills and qualifications to get a job and to have a career and a future in Australias jobs market.We recently released the national skills priority list through the National Skills Commission. This is the national picture of jobs in demand today and into the future. Today, over 150 occupations face skill shortages nationally. These are most commonly technicians and trades, followed by professionals; machinery operators and drivers; and managers, as well as community and personal service workers. But were also seeing huge demand for accountants, auditors and engineers—all areas that our Job-ready Graduates Package is designed to address.The latest data shows there are more Australians studying at university than ever before. Importantly, more Australians are studying the courses that are likely to get them jobs. Commencements are up. I thank the member for Longman for putting forward this motion and I reiterate the numbers that he outlined: science is up 14 per cent; agriculture is up 14 per cent; IT is up 13 per cent; engineering is up 10 per cent; education is up 11 per cent; and health is up eight per cent. These are all areas of demand in jobs. The Job-ready Graduates Package is creating up to 30,000 additional university places in 2021, up to 100,000 places by 2030, and bringing down the cost of degrees in these key future jobs areas.Let me outline a few of the areas where degrees have actually come down in cost under this Job-ready Graduates Package: agriculture is down 59 per cent; maths is down 59 per cent; nursing and teaching has gone down 42 per cent; and the cost of a science, engineering or IT degree has gone down 18 per cent. According to universities and tertiary access centres, new commencements are actually up 7.3 per cent. The University of Queensland has offered double the number of places in agriculture. That doesnt agree with what the member for Fenner just outlined in this chamber. Nationally, in 2021, enrolments in science are up 6,200 and enrolments in engineering are up 2,200. The Job-ready Graduates Package is working. For example, ANU has increased enrolments in both science and engineering degrees in 2021. The number of commencing science students increased by 32 per cent, and the number of commencing engineering students increased by 66 per cent, compared to 2020. Nobody can argue that these areas are not areas of demand now and into the decades ahead of us.This government is investing $903.5 million over four years for more places and more support for more students. In the 2020 budget there was $298.5 million in additional funding for undergraduate places this year. There was $252 million for up to 50,000 additional short-course places and $1 billion to back university research during the pandemic. This governments policies have already seen the youth unemployment rate at the lowest level in 12 years, according to the April 2021 figures. Well continue to back young Australians to get them into work.While right now on the Gold Coast were hurting in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, our best days lie ahead of us. In my electorate of Moncrieff, in the middle of the nations playground on the Gold Coast, were seeing a boom in opportunities that will deliver jobs to support our growth and development, as well as our vibrant local economy. But were also seeing the sorts of shortages the nationals skills priority list has identified. If were going to realise that future, were going to need more workers with the right skills and the right education. On the Gold Coast, we need more skilled and trained people to help build the Gold Coast and grow our local economy. Thats what this package does.","Job-ready Graduates Package","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms BELL (Moncrieff) ","(10:27):"
19,0,0,0,1,1,"Perrett, Graham, MP","HVP","Moreton","ALP","N/A",7699," Im pleased to speak on the motion moved by the Member for Longman—a motion erroneously claiming that the Morrison governments Job-ready Graduates Package is getting more Australians into degrees, providing skills and qualifications to obtain employment, and that there are more Australians studying at university than ever before. Lets pick the coalition claims apart one at a time. You might remember that the job-ready graduates legislation was touted by the Morrison government as a measure to redirect university enrolments to areas of study linked to jobs that are in demand in the labour market. It is a fine concept, but the actual effect of the legislation was quite different. The coalition have actually increased the student fee load and cut funding from the Commonwealth to universities. Treasurer Frydenberg gets the savings, and students get a pile of debt. Many students are paying more for their degrees; on average, Australian students are paying seven per cent more, and 40 per cent of students have seen fees for their degree double. Students in humanities, commerce and communication degrees have all been forced to pay more and rack up more debt to obtain their degree.The Morrison government doesnt believe graduates of those degrees are employable, but I would argue there are valuable skillsets among those graduates—in fact, the data doesnt back up the governments basis for the legislation. The Universities Australia Chief Executive Catriona Jackson was quoted saying in August last year that, in 2020, the overall employment rate for humanities, culture and social sciences was 87 per cent. That was three years after completing their degree and was the same rate for science and mathematics degrees. We know from the Morrison governments own budget papers that funding for Australian universities will fall by 10 per cent over the next three years—nothing to celebrate. If that werent bad enough on its own, it comes at a time when $1 billion in emergency funding to support research jobs has been cut off and universities are facing a projected revenue loss of $16 billion from international students being locked out. Because of the job-ready graduates legislation, some universities have been forced to abolish courses such as neuroscience, arts, education, maths and Asian languages—courses which would create skills crucial to Australias recovery from the pandemic recession.Lets look at the claims made in the motion by the member for Longman, that there are more Australians studying at university than ever before and that the largest increases in new enrolments are for courses made cheaper by the Job-ready Graduates Package. Data in March this year did show an increase in enrolments in 2021 compared to 2020, but the linking of that increase in enrolments to the Job-ready Graduates Package has been debunked by education experts. Professor Andrew Norton is a higher education policy expert from the ANU. He was quoted in March as saying the increase was more likely to result from the announcement last November of 12,000 priority places, which allowed universities to go over their caps, and the 50,000 government subsidised short courses. He said, The cause is not the job ready graduates program, and the increase will not be sustained beyond 2021. Professor Norton is not the only expert to disagree with the idea that the increased enrolments come from the job-ready graduates legislation. Professor Paddy Nixon, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Canberra, also was quoted earlier this year as saying that a surge in enrolments at his university in the bachelors of nursing and medical imaging programs was unlikely to be a result of the legislation. Professor Nixon said, The surge in these enrolments was unsurprising, given the pandemic. He said, My theory would be that the salience of nursing and health generally is that these areas are in the minds of many people, and so would attract more applicants than previously. Professor Norton pointed out also that the effect of the job ready graduates legislation is that universities dont generate more money by taking on more students.The Morrison government has cut real funding for universities during a pandemic. On top of that, it deliberately and methodically changed the rules three times so universities could not get JobKeeper to keep their staff employed. At least 17,300 university jobs were lost in 2020, and university revenue fell by $1.8 billion compared to 2019. International education was worth more than $17 billion to Australias economy. Immediately before the pandemic it was our fourth-largest export after iron ore, coal and gas—all products that are not value added, Id point out. If the Prime Minister had done his job—if the Prime Minister had provided quarantine facilities and had bothered to order enough vaccination for all Australians—we would not still have more than 35,000 Australian stuck overseas, and international students could return. He might then might deserve a pat on the back. Legislation that makes it harder and more expensive for students to go to university does not require a pat on the back. I point that out to the member for Longman. (Time expired) The time allotted for this debate has expired.

21,0,0,0,1,1,"Wilson, Tim, MP","IMW","Goldstein","LP","N/A",7700," I move:That this House:(1) notes that the 2021-22 budget continues to support significant reforms in Australias onshore waste and recycling industries, including:(a) $67 million to support new food and garden organic waste initiatives that assist Australian households to better understand what can be recycled, divert the amount of waste going to landfill and produce top quality compost;(b) an additional $5.9 million to expand the existing National Product Stewardship Investment Fund to invest in innovative industry-led solutions to improve the way products are designed, reused, repaired and recycled; and(c) $5 million to help small businesses to adopt the Australasian Recycling Label to help make recycling easier and to boost recycling rates;(2) further notes that the $190 million Recycling Modernisation Fund is leveraging more than $600 million of investment in state-of-the-art recycling infrastructure to sort, process and remanufacture waste materials onshore; and(3) congratulates the Government for its leadership in driving a once in a generation $1 billion transformation of our waste and recycling industries that will reduce Australias waste footprint by 10 million tonnes, protect our environment and create more than 10,000 jobs over the next decade.Its a great privilege to be able to move this motion in this chamber, Mr Speaker, because as you and I and other members in this chamber know, one of the foundation pillars of being a Liberal is a sense of responsibility to ourselves and to each other—as well as to our environment, to steward it for future generations. A critical part of this is the challenge of waste and resource management. In fact, one of the reasons why I am a free-marketeer is that I believe in the efficient use of the worlds scarce resources. The way to do that is through the utilisation and repurposing of waste and making it valuable, as part of a circular economy, so that people want to use it and re-use it and not needlessly diminish the worlds scarce resources.Part of the challenge of doing that is making sure that government measures are there to support and incentivise the efficient use of the worlds scarce resources: to repurpose them, reuse them, make sure they have a continued life and value-add to the Australian community and economy and stop the diminution of other resources into the future. Thats why the Commonwealth government, the Morrison government, has made such a strong priority of Australias waste and recycling industries, particularly, of course, from the leadership of the Prime Minister but also from the Assistant Minister for Waste Reduction and Environmental Management, the member for Brisbane, who has made this a core part of his work. We congratulate him as well for his contribution.Australia currently generates 2.94 million tonnes of waste each year, 60 per cent of which is recycled and the rest thrown away, ending up in landfill; being sent overseas, often, to be burnt; or in our ocean. Plastic pollution is choking our precious waterways. In just 30 years time therell be more plastic than fish in our oceans. This is why we are so strongly committed to practical pathways that address recycling and reduce the amount of waste that goes into the ocean, including through the billion-dollar transformation of our waste and recycling industry, which includes $190 million for our Recycling Modernisation Fund to leverage over $600 million of recycling infrastructure to sort, process and remanufacture waste materials.As many members will know, previously Australia has, as many countries have, simply exported our waste for a fee. Now we are taking responsibility for it, as we should. There is $100 million for the Australian Recycling Investment Fund, for products using clean energy technologies to support recycling. There is $49.4 million to help halve Australias food waste by 2030. I know that my own local councils Bayside and Glen Eira are investing significantly in what they call FOGO to make sure theres a reduction in food waste, including the regularised pick-up, I understand, from next year of food and garden waste, with landfill waste pick-ups reduced to every second week to try and incentivise and encourage households to do the right thing.We have the National Waste Policy Action Plan, to reduce waste, increase recycling rates and build capacity in our domestic recycling industry, including $59.6 million to the National Waste Policy Action Plan from the Commonwealth, to implement the waste export ban and to improve our waste data, because if you know the nature of the problem you can help fix it. There is $7.8 million on product stewardship for oil containers; a world-leading ban on the export of waste, plastic, paper, glass and tyres; $20 million for projects to reduce plastic waste and boost plastic recycling. At every point, were implementing practical plans that will improve the recycling and waste management industries in this country as part of the broader framework of our environmental agenda to make sure that its not just rhetoric but were delivering in communities across our states and of course across the Commonwealth.We should also celebrate those people who see the opportunity and seize it, not just to take responsibility, though that is a critical part of the conversation and something that we can all do. They see how there are opportunities in waste management and recycling—companies like SomerSide, which was founded by Gabby Samkova, who Ive spoken about previously in this chamber, a 27-year-old Brighton local who creates towels using recycled plastic bottles. Each towel contains around 14 used plastic bottles that would otherwise have gone into landfill. It is stories like Gabbys that highlight how enterprise can come off the back of recycling to repurpose items in a circular economy and reduce waste. There are companies like CopperRock, a waste and recycling centre thats based in Cheltenham. It is owned by John, who began his stint in the industry 23 years ago, working as skip truck driver. They have an enormous amount of experience, working with local soccer clubs and community organisations to reduce their waste footprint.

25,0,0,0,1,1,"Wilson, Josh, MP",265970,"Fremantle","ALP","N/A",7702," [by video link] Im glad to speak on this motion. The issue of waste and recycling is very important. The problem of waste in Australia, and in our world, is massive. Its also a big opportunity. We can move towards a more sustainable set of arrangements, and, by doing so, we can see new industry and new manufacturing created.Its a big problem because its a fundamentally broken market. We heard the member for Goldstein spout his credentials as a free marketeer. If you were a free marketeer and you looked at the circumstances worldwide and in Australia when it comes to waste and recycling, youd run through all of your hankies, having a very bitter weep, because this is a profoundly broken market, where companies produce items according to a linear model, resources get used once, they get turned into things that are often disposed of after very brief use and then they get left in our environment, and the cost falls on all of us. Until we address that broken market, were going to see more of the same.Were going to see a continuation of the eight million tonnes annually of plastic that goes into the ocean that accumulate in fish and birds and that is finding its way into us. Weve seen nanoparticles of plastic in rainfall. We are finding plastic in species that live in the deepest ocean trenches on the planet. Until we do something about that, its going to keep getting worse. A circular economy is a sustainable economy. It means we use the limited resources that we have better, and we need to do more of that.The governments made a big song and dance about waste and recycling, essentially as a fig leaf to cover its failures in other areas of environmental stewardship. The member for Goldstein talks about environmental stewardship, but weve seen precious little of that from this government after three terms, three prime ministers and nine years. It presides over a failed environmental protection framework that sees more and more Australian species pushed to the edge of extinction, and it has taken no action on climate change. Along it comes with this zeal for waste and recycling, but, sadly, despite sprinkling money here and there and making announcements and talking a good game when it comes to the circular economy, its failed when it comes to waste and recycling too. The numbers dont lie, as is always the case. Australia barely recycles 10 per cent of its plastic. That has not changed under this government.You think about the big pieces that need to be addressed—infrastructure on the one hand, product stewardship on the other—and theres been literally no new infrastructure created under this government to deal with processing material and recycling material for reuse. The $100 million Recycling Investment Fund that the member for Goldstein mentioned didnt advance a single dollar until just recently, and then it only advanced funds for a project that was already going ahead. None of the new infrastructure facilities that have been agreed with the states and territories have been delivered. There have been no new co-regulatory product stewardship schemes. If you look at something like APCO, a voluntary scheme, it hasnt even been accredited yet. It has targets, like trying to achieve 20 per cent incorporation of recycled material into plastic packaging by 2025. Twenty per cent is its target, and where we sitting now? Were sitting at four per cent.We are doing abysmally when it comes to these things, because the government has essentially been late to the game. Its taken a hands-off approach. Its initiatives have failed. The funding mechanisms have not seen a dollar landed. Weve switched off the exporting of mixed plastics, which is a good thing, but it was forced on us by the decision of other countries that they would no longer take our low-quality waste. The reality is: weve got nowhere for that 75,000 tonnes of mixed plastics to go. If you talk to people in the industry at the moment, they will tell you quite openly that those mixed plastics are going into landfill.This is the government that crows about what its done when it comes to waste and recycling. What its done is recognised the realities internationally when it comes to not being able to send our low-quality contaminated waste to be burnt or thrown into rivers in other countries. It hasnt introduced one operational piece of infrastructure yet, and mixed plastics will be going into landfill. We need less talk, fewer fig leaves, less of the tricked-up self-congratulation and more cold-eyed focus on the failures of this government when it comes to waste and recycling.","Waste Management and Recycling","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JOSH WILSON (Fremantle) ","(10:43):"
26,0,0,0,1,1,"Allen, Katrina, MP",282986,"Higgins","LP","N/A",7704," I would like to thank the member for Goldstein for moving this motion today, and Im proud to make a contribution to it. Just like him, Im a waste warrior and I care deeply about our environment as well.Many Australians wont know that the average Australian generates nearly three tonnes of waste every year and that more than a tonne of this is thrown away, relegated to landfills, sent overseas, burnt or dumped into the ocean—until now. This thing has changed in Australia. We know that almost 60 kilograms of plastic waste per person is produced each year, and that if plastic pollution continues, as it has, in 30 years our precious seas will be home to more plastic than fish. This is not a world any of us want to live in. The Morrison government unequivocally showed its support in the last budget by funding waste reduction measures, increasing recycling rates and building capacity in Australias recycling industry. You cannot do this without industry and sector capacity. Im proud to recall our parliamentary inquiry into our recycling industry; I encourage all to look at its final report, From rubbish to resources: building a circular economy,and its 24 recommendations.The Morrison government is driving a $1 billion transformation of the industry. Putting $190 million towards the Recycling Modernisation Fund will allow millions in infrastructure to be leveraged in order to sort, process and manufacture waste materials. Not only will this allow Australia to phase in recycling of 645,000 tonnes every year, in alignment with the Morrison governments world-leading export ban—as the Prime Minister has said, Its our waste, its our responsibility; this fund will create 10,000 new jobs over the next 10 years by expanding Australias recycling industry and infrastructure. That translates to an increase of 32 per cent of jobs in the Australian waste and recycling sector.I was very pleased to speak to the Australian waste conference earlier this year. All the Australian states and territories, bar Northern Territory, have Recycling Modernisation Fund agreements in place, with 52 new infrastructure projects across the country. Just one instance is in Victoria: the Morrison government has funded equipment to produce a new patented system for concrete slab foundations made from 100 per cent recycled plastic. This kind of innovation is valued by the government, and grants like this will continue as Australia phases in our waste export ban.The Morrison government is establishing a Food Waste for Healthy Soils Fund to divert 3.4 million tonnes of organic material from landfill for productive use in agricultural soils. This is all about returning todays organic waste back to the soil to ensure that soil grows our food for tomorrow, and our topsoil in Australia needs this organic waste. By achieving the Morrison governments goal of 80 per cent recovery for organic waste Australia will generate $401 million in industry value and add that to the Australian economy. It will create up to 2,700 additional jobs and it will avoid over two million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.The Morrison government has also committed $20 million towards product stewardship, whereby responsibility is shared for managing the environmental impacts of products we use every day. Gone are the days when companies can wilfully ignore their products ongoing environmental effects. The Morrison government is committed to this, and 20 businesses have already been supported through this scheme. One of those organisations is the Australian Food and Grocery Council, which has been granted less than a million dollars to work to bring the food and grocery supply chain together to deliver a national scheme to enhance the collection and processing of plastic packaging. If you go into your supermarket you can already see these sorts of initiatives being rolled out. This will help us to recover plastics—an estimated 189,000 tonnes each year. This is about getting on with the job of helping Australias future.The Morrison government understands that we need to invest in this sector and to continue to support Australian businesses which are not just innovative but future focused. Thats why were supporting small and medium-sized businesses to adopt the Australasian recycling scheme. This will help them to improve their recycling of packaging and to compete with larger businesses, and it will help Australians to be better informed about the purchase theyre making and foster an attitude thats considerate of their role in the environment and our worlds future.This billion-dollar transformation of the recycling sector is once in a generation, and I commend the Morrison government for their leadership and investment in Australias future—an investment that will see Australias waste footprint fall by 10 million tonnes. It will help to protect our environment and it will help to create 10,000 jobs over the next decade. Whats not to like about that?","Waste Management and Recycling","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALLEN (Higgins) ","(10:48):"
27,0,0,0,1,1,"Steggall, Zali, MP",175696,"Warringah","IND","N/A",7705," [by video link] There is no doubt that plastic is a huge problem that we have in Australia. It is everywhere and it is [inaudible]. We need to do more. In every school I visit in every corner of Warringah—and, I have no doubt, in every school in Australia—it is the No. 1 [inaudible]. It is always front of mind and it worries my constituents very much.It really is no surprise that so many are concerned [inaudible] this global waste crisis that we have. Waste forms islands in the Pacific and it is found [inaudible] vulnerable creatures. A study published last week found that over 1,550 wildlife species have eaten plastic. Its also found in our food, on top of our mountains and on our coasts. Its everywhere. And in this pandemic weve made it worse; it hasnt helped. In 2019 the world was poised to improve our record. We were poised to shift away from single-use plastics and jurisdictions had plastic bans coming in. Unfortunately, a lot of those have been offset by the pandemic, which has forced many to pause those initiatives, and weve seen a vast surge in the use of single-use items and plastics. Weve had disruption and weve seen disposable personal protective equipment, like masks, gloves and gowns, protecting from the spread of the virus. These are plastic and, whilst theyre playing an important role in helping our frontline workers and communities to ward off the virus, theyre having a very negative effect on our environment.Now is the time to futureproof our systems to deal with future influxes of plastics, which are likely to happen again and again, in line with our national circular economy goals. The Australian Council of Recycling has said that household waste production and recycling contamination has increased despite growing awareness, and business and commercial recycling has deceased. These are worrying trends. I would ask the government: where is our national campaign on encouraging people, whilst they are at home in this pandemic, to do something about their own personal use? Waste is ending up in the environment, clogging up waterways, sewerage systems and beaches, and it is choking animals. The amount of plastics use now happening is just incredible. The risks of the masks at the moment—unfortunately were seeing them all over our environment. Weve seen, unfortunately, a growth in use of take-away because, for example, here in Warringah, were all in lockdown. Too often plastics are still being used in the packaging of foods, drinks, groceries and online shopping. We need to make sure that stops. It can only stop by behaviour change, which requires information campaigns and legislation. We require legislation to ensure we stop single-use plastics. We need to improve infrastructure to promote circularity and we need to invest in research and development, corporate action and government policy.I call on the government to not come to the House to congratulate itself and claim big wins when we are not even scratching the surface of what really needs to be done. We need to see leadership. This is a problem that we cant delay. We need to manage that surge in waste and also the surge in PPE waste that has come with COVID in the last 18 months. We need dedicated programs for this kind of waste. These are the kinds of things the government really should be focusing on and funding. We also need to address the broader problems of environmental management and protection. At the end of the day, this will all come back and compound.I am proud to say that here in Warringah we have great progress being made. We have Ocean Action Pod, which is seeking to raise awareness of plastics in our ocean and the waste build-up in those areas. Ive also implemented the Roadmap to Zero, which is implementing awareness and providing education to individuals, businesses and schools on how they can reduce their waste. We have great leadership in the electorate, with companies like Worn Up, which is recycling school uniforms; and BlockTexx, which is recovering polyester and cellulose from textiles in clothing, diverting textiles from landfill and using them in a more sustainable manner. We have so many companies leading the way. Government needs to do more.

28,0,0,0,1,1,"Wilson, Rick, MP",198084,"OConnor","LP","N/A",7706," I rise today to support the government funding initiatives that will help fulfil our commitment to enhancing domestic and industrial recycling and supporting Australias waste export ban. As a farmer, Ive been conscious all my life of the need to minimise our waste, being largely responsible for its disposal on farm. Our family food scraps and organic waste usually ended up being fed to a chook who laid the eggs, or were made into compost to keep the veggie garden looking great. But inorganic waste was always a problem—tyres, oils and plastic items that would never break down in a thousand years.I take this opportunity to commend the government on driving a $1 billion transformation of our waste and recycling industry, and in particular the budget commitments towards food and organic waste. These include the $67 million for a new food and organic garden waste initiative and establishing a Food Waste for Healthy Soils Fund to divert 3.4 million tonnes of organic material from landfill for productive use in agriculture soils. This fund complements other Australian government actions in this space, including the $190 million Recycling Modernisation Fund, which supports new infrastructure to sort, process and remanufacture materials such as plastics, paper, tyres and glass. As our waste export ban phases in, Australia must look at recycling some 645,000 tonnes of inorganic waste domestically. To achieve this we need additional recycling infrastructure.At this juncture, I would like to update the House on a significant shovel-ready project in my electorate of OConnor which illustrates how even small towns can dream big when it comes to recycling. The Shire of Coolgardie sits at the crossroads of two major transport routes in my electorate and is perfectly positioned to receive waste from a vast catchment area. The north-south railway line carries minerals over 600 kilometres from the Northern Goldfields via Kalgoorlie and Norseman to the Esperance port. The east-west national highway is the main road freight route from Perth to Adelaide and onwards to the eastern states. The Shire of Coolgardie has capitalised on geographical and logistical opportunities to propose a waste recycling hub that will process the huge volumes of plastics, tyres and conveyor belt rubber created by mining operations in the greater Goldfields region and beyond. In addition, they plan to process household and other waste backloaded from Perth, Esperance and potentially further afield.I have met with the Shire of Coolgardie on numerous occasions, and they are enthusiastic about creating an integrated waste sorting and processing facility at their class-3 landfill site. They have advanced plans for a pilot plastics and tyre pyrolysis plant, which will convert 98 per cent of the total waste to energy-rich fuel and by-products without harmful burning or emissions. To this end, they have established a memorandum of understanding with some of Australias biggest miners in the Central Goldfields region, which produce minerals to the value of over $6.8 billion. The Shire of Coolgardie alone represents the largest mineral value, comprising $3.4 billion. Furthermore, this has enabled the shire to enter into negotiations with Circular Economy Alliance Australia to create a circular economy hub linked to the soon to be established Global Centre of Excellence in Circular Economy. The shire also has in-principle agreements with the Shire of Esperance and the eastern metropolitan group of local government authorities in Perth to sort and process commercial and industrial waste in Coolgardie which would otherwise be destined for local landfill.Currently, WA trucks approximately 30,000 tonnes of unwanted plastics to South Australia for processing. The most recent update from the shire indicates they are fast-tracking their tyre and plastic pyrolysis plant, having received multiple responses to their expressions of interest regarding the most appropriate technologies from across the world. They have also gone to tender for a tyre shredder. In the near future, I see this innovative shire using large volumes of industrial waste to create syngas and diesel, a by-product that is truly carbon free and marketable to industry. Other by-products from the tyre and plastic pyrolysis plant will be used by the shire for road building into one of their local Aboriginal communities. Finally, the shire hope to mobilise their local unskilled labour force, providing training and employment opportunities particularly for their indigenous community members.I commend the Shire of Coolgardie for their vision and passion for this transformational project and acknowledge the enormous work done on this project by the executive team, led by CEO James Trail. My commitment to Coolgardie is to work with Assistant Minister Evans to ensure that this project, which is so vital to the entire Goldfields region, receives the necessary support to get it off the ground.","Waste Management and Recycling","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RICK WILSON (OConnor) ","(10:58):"
29,0,0,0,1,1,"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",182468,"Kingsford Smith","ALP","N/A",7707," [by video link] [inaudible] over substance. Why youd want to move a motion in an area where youve had abject failure is beyond me, and that is exactly what has occurred with this Morrison government and improving recycling in Australia. They have been a massive failure.In the wake of other nations decisions to stop accepting Australias recycled material, I had a meeting with a recycling officer at a local council in the area that I represent. I asked that officer where most of the material that we put into our yellow recycling bins is now going if China, Indonesia and other nations are no longer accepting our recycling material. The answer horrified me. The council officer said that most of it just goes into landfill. When the Australian people go out of their way to sort their recycled materials—to put them into the yellow recycling bins, which are accepted and picked up on a separate basis to our other waste—they expect that that material is actually going to be recycled. But unfortunately in Australia under the Morrison government the majority of that material now goes into landfill. That is an absolute disgrace.Only 18 per cent of plastic in packaging is recycled. Thats well short of the target of 70 per cent by 2025 by this government, and recycled content and plastic packaging is only around four per cent, with the 20 per cent target to be reached by 2025 again being missed.We know that for eight long years the coalition government has done virtually nothing when it comes to waste and recycling. Its a shame that it took a ban on imports from China and Indonesia and other key nations for Australia to finally do something under the Morrison government. Again, its a recurring theme under this government—always reacting, never leading.The Australian community in our waste and resource management sector have been crying out for a national program of reforms that would not only reduce landfill and plastic pollution but increase the rate of recycling. In order to improve Australias poor rate of recycling when it comes to environmentally harmful materials like plastic, its vital that we dramatically improve our local processing and manufacturing capacity. But that will only be viable if there are end markets for the materials.In addition to supporting procurement policies there needs to be greater product producer responsibility when it comes to product design and the incorporation of recycled content. But this government, the Morrison government, has shown its incapable of developing policies that actually encourage recycling and lead to the creation of new companies and opportunities for industries to grow. Wheres the leadership on that in Australia?We know that the export ban of mixed plastic that was in place from 1 July is in disarray. The industry itself has confirmed that Australia is not ready to reprocess additional plastics from the 1 July date. As a result, where does it end up? In landfill. There are more plastics going into landfill. And, despite the Morrison government being warned by its own commission report that stockpiling landfill of mixed plastic, as a result of its reforms, was not a low risk, the only response from the minister for the environment is to blame the sector, the states and territories and local government. Again, its a familiar theme of this government—they dont take responsibility for anything—I dont hold a hose, mate.Information provided by a recent Senate inquiry into hazardous waste shows that the government was put on notice of the risk more than a decade ago, and we know that the Recycling Modernisation Fund has only spent around two per cent of its $190 million and so far only $4.5 million has been spent on the relevant waste processing projects. That follows a failure of the $100 million Australian Recycling Investment Fund that was announced in May 2019, which has not spent or advanced a single dollar. That says everything about this governments failure when it comes to recycling—the principal investment fund that they set up to encourage recycling in Australia hasnt spent a single dollar, because this government has failed. When the Australian people are asking themselves, Whats the point of those yellow bins anymore?, they should be asking, Whats the point of the Morrison government?","Waste Management and Recycling","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr THISTLETHWAITE (Kingsford Smith) ","(11:03):"

They are making it crystal clear: time is up. This statement hasnt come out of thin air, though. The world recognises that time is up. Time is up on new coal, new oil and new gas. Its time for pollution to start ratcheting down and for new renewables to go up.In just the last month weve seen people killed in climate induced flash flooding across Europe and Asia. Across America and around the Mediterranean people are dying in climate fuelled fires. During a pandemic, we are seeing death and destruction from the climate crisis, the climate crisis which is being driven by coal, oil and gas.This is not the first warning, but it is dramatic. It is far-reaching. It will send a powerful message to banks and investors that the jig is up—that, no, we cannot keep burning this stuff forever. But, here, Liberal and Labor are talking about opening up new gas projects in the Northern Territory, using public money to do it. In the Northern Territory, the Beetaloo Basin and the associated Northern Territory basins contain 68 years worth of Australias pollution. It must say in the ground, but Labor and Liberal are talking about taking money that could be going to schools and hospitals and using it to open it up and make the climate crisis worse.Why dont Liberal and Labor members get it? Banks get it; super funds and insurance agencies get it; state governments get it; firefighters, police and ambulance officers get it; kids get it. Why dont politicians get it? Is it the donations? Is it the millions of dollars that coal, oil and gas corporations shovel into the old parties election funds that makes them wilfully blind, silent and complicit? Is it that simple? Is money all that it takes to pay off the government and the opposition to look the other way while a few coal and gas billionaires and big corporations wreck the only place that weve got to live in? Or is it the jobs, the jobs for the boys, the jobs for the former men of the Liberal and Labor parties, who, once they leave parliament, end up with the lobbyists or on the boards of the corporations poisoning our politicians with donations—the likes of Martin Ferguson, Ian Macfarlane, John Anderson and Mark Vaile? How well paid are these gigs that members are willing to sell every one of us out? Do they pay enough so that your conscience is clear?Or are politicians just scared—scared of losing power after being attacked in the pages of News Ltd? How is it that fear of climate deniers like Andrew Bolt and Tim Blair is worse than the fear of our kids losing their lives? Or is it fear of the big corporations? In this country the big corporations have way too much power. Theyre like the drug cartels. Theyve addicted our politicians. They extort public cash and outrageous approvals. They get so much special treatment to railroad farmers, local communities and traditional owners, and they often pay no tax and send their profits offshore, tax-free.But, members, we cannot deny the reality that we face. Members, you all know this. You might tell yourselves that its not our problem, that theres nothing that you can do. But we all know the fires will be back. There will be more summers burnt by this governments and this oppositions failures. They know that politicians will be called out again and again on the world stage. Whenever this pandemic is over, the climate crisis will be there and it will keep getting worse. Young people have been forced to endure so much during this pandemic, and they have lost some of the best years of their lives to COVID and this governments failures. But now they are facing a climate crisis. And right now this government is going to court to argue that it doesnt have a duty of care to our childrens future. Its clear that the coal, oil and gas corporations in this place have too much power, and you just need to look at the fact that they pay no tax as proof of that.It is time to take responsibility. This is our decade for change. We must act. And the good news is: the next election is closer than we think. For a few hundred votes, we can kick this government out, put the Greens in balance of power and make the next government go further and faster on the climate crisis.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BANDT (Melbourne—Leader of the Australian Greens) ","(11:08):"

38,0,0,0,1,1,"Haines, Helen, MP",282335,"Indi","IND","N/A",7710," Today the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will publish a distressing finding. Global temperatures are set to pass the critical 1.5 degrees threshold by the early 2030s, an entire decade earlier than expected. Two hundred and thirty experts reviewed 14,000 scientific papers in the last three years to give us this sobering statistic. As an academic, as a medical scientist, I know the work that goes into reports like these. This is empirical science and its alarming.The IPCC report will also find that human induced climate change was a major cause of the Black Summer bushfires that tore through my electorate, and many other electorates in this nation, 18 months ago. Just this week weve seen horrifying visions of wildfires engulfing towns across Greece, Turkey and Italy. California continues to burn, just like Canada did last month. Its hard for my communities to look at that footage. The emergency sirens are still ringing in our ears, and—it hurts me to say this—its almost certain that those sirens will be ringing in our ears again. Temperatures in North East Victoria have already shot up one degree. They will go up another 2.4 degrees by 2050. That means double the number of extreme heat days and a 44 per cent increase in extreme fire danger days. The climate change crisis is well and truly here.The United Nations ranks Australia last out of nearly 200 countries when it comes to actions to reduce emissions. Thats right: dead, motherless last. Weve had our strongest diplomatic allies, like the UK and the US, begging Australia to step up and join them in their ambition. The EU carbon tariff is happening, whether the trade minister likes it or not, and the US will be next. And still the government bury their head in the tar sands. The International Energy Agency wants us to halt immediately any new coal, oil and gas projects. Instead, the government pump $50 million in taxpayer subsidies to frack the Beetaloo Basin, and they do that without any consent from the traditional owners. Our precious Great Barrier Reef is dying too. When UNESCO moved to label it as in danger last month, the environment minister jumped on a jumbo jet to lobby oil-rich nations like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain to block the decision. I was shocked to see ministers of this government call that a win. As the head of the UNESCO marine program said, It doesnt matter what were calling it on paper, the facts are the facts; the science is the science.COP26 in Glasgow is only months away. Our Prime Minister must seize the moment in Glasgow to turn this nations appalling record on climate around. This is a moment for courage, for leadership, but the only place weve seen real proposals for action on climate in this parliament is right here on the crossbench. There is hope if the moment is seized—proposals like the member for Warringahs net zero 2050 bill, which I was proud to second, or proposals like the local power plant, which I introduced, which charts an ambitious path for renewables in regional Australia. But, while the crossbench comes with solutions, this government presents excuses—and young people are wearing the costs of this reckless inaction, and my heart goes out to them.Young people right now are spending some of the best years of their lives restricted by COVID. Theyre staring down the barrel of recession and endless debt, and now were handing over a world to them which is quite literally burning. The mental health toll of this is immense. In the past, climate debates were fought on clear fault lines—scientists versus sceptics, industrialists versus ecologists, young versus old. Well, youd be hard pressed to find these divisions in Indi; we have one of the highest median ages in Australia, yet our older folk are in lock step with our youth on climate. Farmers and businesses stand with our youth. Young people like Charlie Paterson, Lachie Sands, Cheyane Vaughan and Jessica Patterson—school captains and vice-captains from Benalla—marched in Benalla, side-by-side with people of all ages. Declan Thomas, from Yea, is leading an Indi youth advisory panel to advise me on issues like climate change. I will fight for young people like these any day of the week, any hour of the day. I promised to do it in my first speech; I promised to do it every day I am here. I am resolute, and I know other people in Indi stand beside me too. I will keep fighting for courage and hope and leadership.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr HAINES (Indi) ","(11:13):"

We cant believe, down here in Tasmania, that the government has not pulled out all stops, that the government doesnt treat climate change as a genuine emergency and respond as though its a genuine emergency. How on earth can the federal government not respond to the International Energy Agency and its very clear advice—that there must be no more carbon based energy production from this year, no more coal-fired power stations, no more oil, no more gas projects? And what about the latest IPCC report, which were expecting out later tonight, advising that the average global temperatures will by 2030 increase by 1.5 degrees centigrade, which will be a full decade earlier than we expected as recently as only three years ago?The fact is we have an emergency.

42,0,0,0,1,1,"Stevens, James, MP",176304,"Sturt","LP","N/A",7712," Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. Ill happily take the opportunity. I assume someones communicating with the member for Clark on the situation, but, nonetheless, Ill take my opportunity to make a contribution on this motion.I welcome the opportunity to talk about what the Commonwealth government is doing to undertake the three important elements of the energy transformation in this country, not only reducing emissions but also ensuring that we are reducing electricity prices and making sure that we have a reliable energy and electricity system. As a South Australian, Ive got particular interest in the latter two points being done in concert with the challenge of emissions reduction, because its very important that, in this country, as we reduce our emissions, were also ensuring that the collateral outcome of that doesnt involve dramatic escalation of electricity prices for struggling families and businesses and, of course, the additional lack of reliability that is a risk if were not ensuring that we have a transition that provides not only a reduction in carbon but also a stable, reliable electricity grid that is affordable.I welcome the news today from AGL in my home state of South Australia that they are building a new battery system on Torrens Island, a 250-megawatt-hour plant that goes with a lot of the other grid-scale battery schemes that are being invested in in my home state and across the nation, in many cases with support from the Commonwealth government through ARENA and other agencies. In South Australia, we now regularly have the situation where the entire grid consumption for our state is being provided from renewable energy. Im proud of that and want to see that growing into the future.Recent decisions around an interconnector to New South Wales will put South Australia in an enhanced position to export more renewable energy out of South Australia to the national electricity market. We already have the 800-megawatt interconnector through the Heywood line to Victoria and now were talking about building a 750-megawatt interconnector through New South Wales. That will put South Australia in the position to install a lot more renewable energy generation in South Australia and have the interstate export markets for our renewable energy there to firm up investment decisions, attract capital and see us investing in more renewable energy generation in South Australia, where there is a market and a home, which makes it a lot more viable. That will see a continued increase in renewable generation for South Australia, continued periods of time where renewables are the entirety of generated electricity while also ensuring that the affordability is there and the firmament of supply is there, because the challenges of intermittent electricity generation are still there with the renewables that were installing. The more diverse generation weve got the better, and equally the ability to send that electricity interstate makes them a lot more economically viable.Im also very proud of the partnership between the CEFC and the South Australian state government to provide finance for home-scale battery installation in South Australia. We now have, on some metrics, the largest distributed grid on the planet, and this involves us being able to marry up installed PV solar on rooftops with a storage solution that genuinely means that a household in Adelaide can generate electricity when the suns shining but be able to use it when the actual demand profile is there. One of the real challenges so far has been that you dont necessarily want to consume the energy at the same time that youre generating it, so storage at the local level is vital for that.As I said, weve got the largest distributed storage grid in the world and we proudly want to continue to expand that. Its these technology solutions that are going to see us address the important objective of reducing emissions. Of course, as a government we are very ambitious to get to net zero as soon as it is possible to do so. But the Prime Minister has made it clear that we wont mislead the Australian people by setting targets that we dont have a plan to achieve. Thats what our government is about: practically investing in technologies that can see us meet those objectives while reducing emissions while also ensuring affordability and stability in the grid. Ive outlined some of the things that were doing. Im proud to be a part of a government that is investing in those initiatives and many more to achieve these important objectives.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr STEVENS (Sturt) ","(11:21):"

44,0,0,0,1,1,"Swanson, Meryl, MP",264170,"Paterson","ALP","N/A",7713," I move:That this House:(1) notes that:(a) many Australian workers are being employed by labour hire companies on low wages and without access to entitlements such as annual leave, sick leave and parental leave;(b) these workers are often working alongside other workers doing the same job, with the same roster who are employed on higher wages and with access to leave entitlements;(c) the use of labour hire to avoid paying fair wages and conditions by Australian companies is growing, particularly in Australias mining industry;(d) the Federal Court of Australia in the Workpac v Rossato case determined that a worker who was defined as a casual employee by labour hire company Workpac was in fact a full time employee working a full time roster and therefore entitled to leave entitlements; and(e) Workpac have appealed this decision in the High Court of Australia and the Government has intervened in the case to support the submission of Workpac that Mr Rossato is a casual employee and should not receive leave entitlements;(2) recognises that the increasing use of labour hire companies by employers to avoid paying fair wages and conditions is reducing the incomes of workers and families, and is having a detrimental impact on their livelihoods, particularly in regional Australia; and(3) calls on the Government to support Labors policy and legislation in the Parliament that will ensure workers who do the same job receive the same pay.I am grateful to the member for Watson, who has just joined us in the chamber, for agreeing to second this motion. It is an incredibly important motion for all Australian workers, and he is equally passionate about stopping worker exploitation.The resources sector plays a critical role in our national economy and never more so than at this time, when we are reliant on iron ore and coal being extracted and exported whilst many of our major economies are in lockdown, including in my own area of the Hunter. The workers of this sector are being left behind because of the Morrison government. My electorate of Paterson is proudly part of the Hunter region and workers across the Hunter are being exploited because their government has been weak and, staying true to their narrow-minded ideology, they are leaving workers behind. If you are doing the same job as the person alongside you, you should be getting the same rate of pay.Labor has a plan to ensure that workers in the mining sector receive the same pay for the same job. It is very simple: if you do the work, you deserve the pay and the entitlements that go with it. Last week, casual miners hopes were, sadly, dashed due to this government selling them out by teaming up with some greedy bosses to overturn their rights. The High Court decision was backed by the federal government and this has dashed the hopes of casual coalminers seeking justice and, more importantly, a pathway to permanency.I commend the miners union for its work in fighting back against this terrible injustice. We know the WorkPac v Rossato appeal judgement winds back significant wins for casuals established in the WorkPac v Skene Federal Court decisions, including a commonsense definition of casual based on the reality of work arrangements and a pathway to compensation for exploited casuals. In short, if you are working full-time hours doing the full-time job, you are a full-time employee and you deserve to be treated as such.I agree with the mining and energy union general President Tony Maher, who stated that the decision was deeply disappointing for coalminers, who were desperate for change in this industry. I have a clear message for the workers and the miners in my electorate in this industry: dont get angry, just get even at the ballot box, because this government has sold you out and the legislation was passed by the Morrison government. In March, well have the opportunity to have our say.","Employment","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SWANSON (Paterson) ","(11:27):"

52,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation","IMW","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr TIM WILSON: It is about the power of the unions to dictate and decide how people work, on what terms and in what circumstances, because they are the beneficiaries of the Australian Labor Partys largesse. They use the power they have in this chamber to benefit the few rather than to empower Australians to make their own choices and make their own decisions about how they wish to live their lives.If you believe the members of the opposition, labour hire is an incredible sector which employs millions of Australians and seeks to undermine workers across the board. The reality is nothing like that. Labour hire is a discrete sector of employment arrangements which has been stable at around two per cent of workers over the last decades. Critically, labour hire provides a pathway for some people to secure employment on their terms and for their circumstances. I have labour hire companies that operate out of the wonderful electorate of Goldstein and work to provide pathways for people to secure employment and jobs—again, for their circumstances and on terms that suit them, not union bosses.We know that labour hire employees have exactly the same rights and protections as other employees when it comes to issues like unfair dismissal rights, award entitlements, general protections and, of course, workplace health and safety protections. What we make sure of, is that, when people secure employment on their own terms, based on their own circumstances, we empower people who may not otherwise be able to do so to secure employment. We provide a pathway where, for instance, women who may have particular circumstances to do with their family arrangements or their responsibilities to others can secure employment on their terms and in their circumstances, so they can stand on their own two feet. The same is true in any family arrangement. I know many people who, because of the casualised nature of other issues they face in their lives, may not want the rigidity of a nine-to-five job on terms that suit law but dont suit them. Ultimately, the focus of what this government is seeking to do is to make sure it provides pathways for every Australian who wants a job to be able to get a job—to have a go to get a go.Labor wants to stand right in the middle of any pathway that enables people to freely choose the terms and circumstances of their employment. This is the direct consequence, in part, of a significant decision made by the courts. We have introduced a new statutory definition of casual employment that makes it clear that a casual employee is someone who has no firm advance commitment to continuing and indefinite work according to an agreed pattern of work. Doing this, and providing a pathway for universal casual conversion entitlement, means casual employees now have more opportunity to convert to permanent employment. This just requires employers—except for small businesses—to offer full-time or part-time employment to eligible casuals after 12 months of employment, unless there are reasonable grounds not to do so. What we have done is provided a pathway for people to be able to convert their working behaviour based on their interests. Weve worked with small business and employees to be able to provide choices that seek what they want.But, of course, we know full well that that has been opposed every step of the way by the Australian Labor Party. Why? Because it empowers workers and it doesnt empower unions. In February 2021, Anthony Albanese and Labor voted against providing casuals with a more secure pathway to permanency and removing the $39 billion double-dipping liability on business. I was wrong, actually, in my comments before about the reason Labor voted against these initiatives being because they thought it would empower workers and not empower unions. It is because it would empower workers to be able to make choices and decisions about their own employment arrangements. But the reason they voted against it wasnt because it didnt empower unions; its because it didnt empower union bosses, who are their mates, who are the people, just like superannuation funds and others, whose terms they want to dictate and empower—at the expense of average Australians.","Employment","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

Those opposite: dont pretend you support mineworkers when at the same time you try to cut their pay. What weve got, in the member for Paterson, is someone who backs the industry and backs workers getting fair payment.What we just heard from the member for Goldstein, where he referred to empowerment, is extraordinary. Im yet to meet the worker who wants to be empowered to get a pay cut. Im yet to meet the worker who says, If only I had the authority to be able to be paid less. The workers who would be protected by whats being proposed by the member for Paterson, the workers who would be protected by same job, same pay, want to be empowered with a better take-home pay. Ive met with these workers at Moranbah; Ive met with these workers throughout Central Queensland. And its not just the mining industry where this happens. People are employed by a company, and the workforce is usually represented by a union, because union workplaces do get better rates of pay. We dont resile from that for one minute. But, once an enterprise agreement is in place, some of these employers go off to a labour hire company. And, because those workers are technically employed by someone else, they come in and undercut the enterprise agreement rate. So you get two people working side by side on the exact same roster, where one receives a radically lower rate of pay.Whats the answer? Whats the policy solution that the previous speaker, the member for Goldstein, just referred to? He said, You can deal with this through casual conversion. What does his model mean? Well, if youre already employed by labour hire, the casual conversion legislation they put through doesnt let you change employer; you only get to convert within the labour hire firm. So hes offering the person who is already being paid less than the person they work side by side with to go from casual to permanent, still for the labour hire company, and be paid even less per hour still. The proposal that the member for Goldstein has just put forward as a way of dealing with the issue of two people working side by side, doing the exact same job, and one of them is being paid much less per hour than the other is: Lets just make the gap even wider.Australians have a good sense of whats reasonable and whats not, and it is reasonable that, if youre doing the same job on the same shift at the same workplace, then you get the same rate of pay. The member for Paterson will have had many conversations with mining workers throughout the Hunter, where they will tell you upfront their frustration at this not happening. Dont forget, in an industry like mining, when youve got these concerns, its not simply a difference in pay; its also a difference in security. What does that mean in the mining industry, an industry where safety concerns are not about whether or not you have a minor injury; safety concerns are about whether or not you are at risk of dying at work? People told me in Central Queensland—and mining workers everywhere will tell you, and the mining union will tell you, but those opposite might not know this—that people in less secure work are less likely to speak up about safety issues. How do the workers know this? Because theyve got examples of labour hire people who did speak up about safety issues and they never saw them for another shift.Job security is a safety issue. Job security is about us being a country where, if people have security of their job, they have security in their take-home pay and they have security in knowing that theyll be able to pay their rent, pay their mortgage, pay their bills. Its a security that this side of the House will defend for the workers of Australia and its a security that those opposite are deliberately designing to remove from the Australian workforce. Everybody who sees the injustice of different rates of pay for the exact same job should know theres only one way to fix this, and its a change of government at the next election and following whats been put forward by the member for Paterson.","Employment","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BURKE (Watson—Manager of Opposition Business) ","(11:37):"
55,0,0,0,1,1,"Templeman, Susan, MP",181810,"Macquarie","ALP","N/A",7717," There are so many things to think about in the world that were facing that its easy for people to push aside the stuff that doesnt seem directly relevant to them. For some people, labour hire isnt part of their immediate world. But its effects on working conditions and wages are far-reaching, whether we think about it or not, which is why Im very pleased to speak on the motion moved by the member for Paterson.Australian workers and Australian consumers are affected by the increase in labour hire. It is a nonsense to say that people choose labour hire because it empowers them in some way to negotiate a better deal. They do it because they have no choice. They cannot go directly to the organisation and get the job that they want. It is being channelled through labour hire. Im going to talk about that in the private sector as well as the public sector.You cant tell, when youre looking at the person who is caring for your loved one in aged care, whether theyre employed by a labour hire company or not. You cant tell, when you speak to someone on the phone at Services Australia, whether theyre employed by a labour hire company or not. You cant tell when youre looking at a mining site or a building site. But there are two really serious consequences that occur for people employed by a labour hire company. One is that these workers are on lower wages, without access to entitlements that give security and dignity to peoples lives—things like annual leave, sick leave and parental leave. A consequence is that they may not be in a position to ensure that the environment that they work in is as safe as it should be. They dont have the voice they would have as a permanent worker. Theyre without all sorts of security. That means that, financially, they cant get a bank loan, they cant buy home or even build up a reserve to start their own business. In the COVID environment weve seen that, along with all those things, people in insecure work are the first to lose their work, the least likely to have a buffer and the most likely to miss out on financial support.Think of the longer-term effect on wages that this scenario has created. The value of wages that people get has continued to fall under Liberal prime ministers. While wages grew an average of 3.6 per cent under Labor, its been less than half that under this government. Long before COVID hit, wages were flatlining. Ross Garnaut describes the pre-COVID economic environment created by the Liberals as the dog days—a time of listless growth and historically low wages.The reason so many people were feeling pressure on their family budget pre-COVID was that we came from a time when workers were seeing their fortnightly pay rise by, on average, $100 a week every year or two. Thats what we used to have—a steady increase. But these days it takes an average worker seven years to increase their pay by $100 a fortnight—stagnant, dormant, listless, sluggish; I feel a bit like Monty Python, saying those things! We have had flatlining wages. It begs the question: how many essentials were families going without pre-COVID because of the failure on wages? Right now, many are in much more dire straits. Its pretty simple: when it comes to labour hire rorts, the government are ripping off casual workers. Workers doing the same job at the same site should get the same pay. That should be the standard.But theres another consequence, and thats in the public sector—about not just the pay but the quality of service my constituents receive when they interact with a department heavily reliant on labour hire; Veterans Affairs is a case in point. It was confirmed earlier this year that the level of labour hire staffing in DVA is 42 per cent. Forty-two per cent of staff are employed not by the department but through a labour hire firm. This is a department with an increase in claim and client numbers far in excess of what had been predicted when the Liberals first put these artificial caps on the numbers of staff within departments. In 2012 DVA thought it would have less than a quarter of a million clients in 2020; in reality it has more than 320,000 clients. Its case load is extraordinary. The CPSU says its members report that some colleagues are managing more than 250 cases. This is one of the consequences, and it has to stop. We have to tackle these issues, and Labor will. Secure work has financial, economic and mental health benefits across our society.","Employment","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) ","(11:42):"
56,0,0,0,1,1,"McBride, Emma, MP",248353,"Dobell","ALP","N/A",7718," [by video link] Im pleased to speak on the motion moved by the member for Paterson. Last week we saw the High Court overturn the Federal Courts decision in the case of WorkPac v Rossato, in yet another blow for casual workers who are fighting for job security. Casuals are already facing an uphill battle because of the Morrison governments push to legitimise the concept of permanent casuals—casual workers who stand side by side with full-time employees, working the same hours day in, day out, only to take home substantially less pay. This government has turned its back on the Australian value of same job, same pay. It has legitimised wage theft and allowed job insecurity to grow.Lets look at the facts. Pay rates for labour hire casuals are on average about 30 per cent less than those of permanent workers, and thats if they dont take leave; the difference is closer to 40 per cent if they do take leave. The widespread use of casual labour hire in construction, manufacturing and mining is a blatant cost-cutting measure that leaves regional communities hundreds of millions of dollars a year worse off. Australia has the highest proportion of temporary labour in the developed world. About 40 per cent of Australian workers have casual or insecure jobs, like gig work or labour hire. In the medical and health sectors close to 23 per cent of the workforce is casual; in building and construction its 23.6 per cent; and in the accommodation sector its 44 per cent. For these workers, financial insecurity is the norm.Thanks to deregulation of the labour market over the last 30 years, too many Australians are now stuck in limbo as permanent casuals. It is commonly accepted that casuals are paid a loading to compensate them for insecure work and lack of paid leave. But most casuals are still receiving less than permanent workers doing the same job. In fact, for many casuals, the longer they remain trapped in insecure work, the more likely they are to be paid less than their permanent co-workers. Half of all casuals would prefer to have a permanent job with paid leave, but in some industries workers arent given a choice.Its casuals who have also borne the brunt of this pandemic. In March last year, when the first wave hit, many casuals lost work and many were excluded from JobKeeper. Its now 18 months later, half of the country is in lockdown, and casuals have once again been plunged into uncertainty. Some have lost hours, while others are still working on the front line as essential workers in retail, aged care, disability support, transport and cleaning—people on low wages who cant work from home or access sick leave if anything goes wrong. On the other side of this crisis, we must make sure that Australians who want secure jobs can find them, especially in regional Australia.To finish, Id like to turn to the impacts of casual work on mental health and wellbeing. The link between insecure work, financial distress and mental health crisis is well known. As soon as the sector you work in is at risk, your mental health is at risk; and, as the demands of your work grow and the control you have over your circumstances drops, the risk increases. Over the last 18 months, hundreds of thousands of Australians have found themselves out of work as businesses have folded or workforces have been trimmed, and many people are experiencing mental health problems for the first time in their lives. We know that almost one in five Australians will struggle with their mental health in any year. But some Australians are much more likely to experience mental health problems, including those looking for work or those in insecure work.Mental ill-health has been described by some as a second-wave or shadow pandemic, and this government is risking peoples lives if it doesnt create more opportunities for secure work. In the National Suicide Prevention Advisers Interim Advice Report, it was recommended that the government should develop a Commonwealth process for reviewing new policies or initiatives to ensure they assess any impacts—positively or negatively—on suicide risk or behaviour. The Prime Minister says mental health is a priority, and I believe him, but he cant ignore the impacts of his policies on mental health and wellbeing, especially when it comes to the casualisation of the workforce.We know from the Productivity Commissions final report in its mental health inquiry that mental ill-health is costing the Australian economy upwards of $200 billion a year, a sum that is reported as being a conservative estimate. We know that these arent just numbers in a ledger. These are real people, and their lives are at risk as they struggle to find work and struggle for more secure work. The Prime Minister says mental health is a priority, but every day, in the policies and the decisions of his government, hes risking peoples mental health and their wellbeing. Our communities deserve better. Local people deserve better. Casual workers across Australia deserve better.","Employment","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms McBRIDE (Dobell) ","(11:47):"
57,0,0,0,1,1,"Wells, Anika, MP",264121,"Lilley","ALP","N/A",7719," Im here on behalf of casual and labour hire workers on the north side because insecure work and low wages have created a perfect storm for them, and this Morrison government does not care. When South-East Queensland went into lockdown last week to stop the spread of the delta variant in our community, north-side workers in insecure work—people who were casuals, contract workers, gig economy workers and labour hire workers—suddenly saw their hours slashed or taken away altogether overnight. These workers instantly fell through a trapdoor into a financial abyss, with no annual leave, no sick pay, no holiday pay, no family leave.The current industrial relations landscape we find ourselves in is not one that is here by chance or by happenstance of the free market, as those on the other side of the House would lead workers to believe. No, workers are worse off today because of deliberate policy decisions made by consecutive Liberal-National governments who value profits over people; who think we live in a corporation, not a community; and who care more about the national budget than the household budget of a family living in Boondall. Under the Liberal-National government, the nature of Australias workforce has been shifting for a decade. Over one-third of the workforce is currently in insecure or non-standard forms of work, directly impacting many workers ability to provide for their families and to plan for the future. Wages are projected to decrease over the next few years, while the cost of living continues to climb.How did we get here? Well, here are just a few examples of the Morrison governments cold and systemic war on workers. In 2019 the former Minister for Finance declared that wages were low by design, as part of the Morrison governments deliberate economic strategy. In February 2020 the Morrison government created an amnesty for dodgy employers who had not paid their workers adequate super entitlements. Earlier this year, in the midst of a global pandemic, the Morrison government wrote to the Fair Work Commission cautioning against an increase in the minimum wage. And who could forget the Morrison governments crowning glory built with thorns for Australian workers, Work Choices 2.0? It was designed to strip workers of their legal rights and, when it looked like the bill wasnt going to pass, the Morrison government vindictively took out the wage theft provisions, the only provisions which Labor had agreed to support.At every step of the way, the Morrison government has sent dog whistles to dodgy employers that its okay to rip their workers off, and I have seen the consequences of that every day in my community. There is no more egregious example of the Morrison government giving the green light to a dodgy boss than the Prime Minister and his mate Alan Joyce. The Morrison government has handed out $2 billion in corporate welfare to Qantas without any conditions that that money be given directly to the workers, the workers who paid the taxes that were the money in the first place. With $2 billion worth of taxpayer funds in their pockets, Qantas has slashed their workforce, denied workers who have been stood down from taking sick leave, frozen their wages for two years and tried to outsource 2,000 jobs to a labour hire company because workers have stronger bargaining abilities as a unionised workforce.Since the Federal Courts decision that Qantas acted illegally when trying to outsource those 2,000 jobs, we have heard nothing from the Prime Minister—not in the media, not in the parliament, not a word about it. The Prime Minister has Alan Joyces number on speed dial. He needs to pick up the phone and tell Alan Joyce to reinstate the 2,000 workers who were stood down when it was announced that their jobs would be outsourced to a labour hire company. He also needs to tell Alan Joyce that any taxpayer support that is given to Qantas must be used to keep workers in their jobs, jobs on the north side of Brisbane.As your federal member I will always fight to protect the jobs of northsiders and protect them from wage theft and the exploitation of honest workers. Only Labor have a plan to tackle exploitative, insecure work. A federal Labor government will defend your penalty rates and your rights at work. We will legislate to properly define casual work. We will explicitly insert job security into the Fair Work Act. We will crack down on cowboy labour firms to guarantee same job, same pay. We will put a cap on back-to-back short-term contracts for the same job and enforce portable entitlements for workers in insecure industries. When the election comes, Australian workers will remember who fought for their rights in a pandemic and which Prime Minister did them over at every single opportunity.","Employment","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WELLS (Lilley) ","(11:52):"

60,0,0,0,1,1,"Perrett, Graham, MP","HVP","Moreton","ALP","N/A",7721," I continue to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 and related legislation. I would particularly point out that overseas students are our fourth biggest export. Not too long ago, before gas crept up, it was our third biggest. When you look at iron ore, coal and gas theyre not value added in the way that educating overseas students is. So rather than the Morrison government helping protect an industry that was worth $40 billion just five minutes ago, the Morrison government has taken delight in attacking higher education providers at a time, during a pandemic, when they most need a helping hand.Higher education providers have been snubbed, insulted and abandoned during this pandemic. Prime Minister Morrison very deliberately changed the JobKeeper rules three times to make sure universities could not get the support they needed. If thats not systemic bias motivated by short-term cultural wars or misguided political war games then I dont know what is. How short-sighted is that, to attack our fourth-largest export and neglect a $40 billion industry?At least 17,300 university workers lost their jobs in 2020 because the Morrison government denied them JobKeeper: academics, tutors, cleaners, gardeners and cafeteria staff, many with families to support. It is expected that at least 7,000 researchers will lose their jobs over the course of this pandemic and, as I heard from university vice-chancellors over the last few weeks, were in danger of losing our greatest research minds for good. Once theyre gone, they may never return. In the middle of a crisis, the government cut support to universities that was meant to keep Australias world-class research alive.","Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Cost Recovery and Other Measures) Bill 2021, Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (Charges) Amendment Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PERRETT (Moreton) ","(11:58):"

62,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation","HVP","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr PERRETT: Ill take that interjection from the member for Cowan. We know that academics need a bit of certainty. The government provided $1 billion in the 2020 budget, and I commend them for that, partly to cover the impact of falling international student revenue. Then, this year, basically with no return of international students in sight because of the bungled vaccine rollout, they have cut that funding and the pipeline is dry. It means that the students who would flow on for two, three or four years arent coming—theres nothing coming down the pipeline.Its hard to understand why the government has attacked universities as viciously as it has. We know that; weve seen a drop from 20 per cent down to 12 per cent. International education was the fourth-largest export industry before the COVID pandemic. It supported about 250,000 jobs across the Australian economy—and remember thats in the bush as well. We know that universities are major employers in regional areas; they support over 14,000 jobs—not that youll ever hear recognition of this fact from the mouth of a National Party MP. In the city, universities keep communities afloat: its good economics. But thats especially so in the bush. Every one dollar invested in higher education research and development is linked to a five-dollar return to GDP. Every one dollar invested in university teaching and scholarship from government contributes three dollars of additional taxation revenue. It makes economic sense to support universities during this pandemic crisis. But instead of supporting our fourth-largest export, the Prime Minister goes from one exercise in marketing spin to the next without actually achieving anything or doing what hes paid for—for doing his job.There are more than 35,000 Australians still stuck overseas and more than 200,000 international students who cant get back to Australia for study. Some are holding on, but that is tenuous. The Prime Minister had two jobs: the vaccine rollout and effective quarantine, and he has failed in both. If he had done his job, set up national quarantine facilities and managed the vaccine rollout, those 35,000 Australians would have returned home by now and international students would be coming back to study rather than being poached by Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. Theyre poaching our students and poaching our fourth-largest export. Sadly, neither of those things have been achieved in terms of vaccine rollout and effective quarantine.Its astounding that not only have the Morrison government failed to set up national quarantine facilities but theyve failed to manage the vaccine rollout and failed to support universities through this crisis. And they made things even worse for universities with their Job-Ready Graduates Package. This scheme, introduced into parliament last year in the midst of the pandemic, was designed to cut Commonwealth funding to cover the cost of many university courses and, at the same time, to increase student fees overall. Universities—which, remember, have already lost more than $3 billion—will receive less money to teach some courses, like science, engineering and teaching. Those are not unimportant courses; some may say they are the very courses which form the backbone of a skilled workforce, of a smart Australia. Real funding for higher education will fall by 10 per cent over the next three years. Some students who commenced study this year face fee hikes of double the previous fees. Those students are going to be left with a mountain of student debt when they enter the workforce.All of the actions and inactions of the Morrison government have consequences and one of those consequences is that it will make it harder for Australia to recover from the COVID-19 recession. I mentioned before that Ive been speaking to many of the vice-chancellors of universities right across Australia in the past couple of weeks. What struck me as I listened to their despair was that there is still no pathway for international students to return to Australia. It struck me how badly this has been handled by the Morrison government. Several of the VCs mentioned the Prime Minister, early last year, telling students to go home. Remember that? Remember the Prime Minister saying, Go home? It was a comment that perfectly bookends with Prime Minister Morrisons Where the bloody hell are you? campaign when he headed Tourism Australia, before Fran Bailey, the then Minister for Small Business and Tourism, sacked him. Those two comments were horrible comments as a message to the rest of the world. I say that, particularly, as a Queenslander and being from a state that thrives on tourism. Some vice-chancellors were concerned that the Prime Ministers comment would be remembered by those students. They took it home. They took it to their hearts: students who were here at the time and whose view of Australia will be permanently soured when they could have been our best ambassadors, better than DFAT in a way because theyre not funded. They actually go out to the rest of the world and sell Australia.Its hard to be a leader during a crisis. It tests people. Cometh the hour, cometh the man or woman. Its a shame that we dont have a leader in this nation who is up to the task. Its not what our nation needs at the moment.Theres no doubt that the Morrison government has damaged Australias world-class higher education system, placing thousands of university workers jobs at risk and jeopardising Australian research. International student numbers are not going to magically return to full capacity when the vaccine rollout is eventually completed. I say that in the hope that it will be eventually completed. As I said, these pipelines are heading elsewhere, to Canada, to the United Kingdom, to the United States. Its going to take time to undo the Morrison governments mismanagement during this pandemic. Recovering from the COVID-19 recession is going to take world-class leadership. Were going to need a skilled workforce, and we will only obtain that by having world-class higher education systems.Labor supports the bills before the House because they are likely to reduce charges on international education providers, but sadly, this small reduction in charges will only partly offset the hiked up fees facing providers due to the TEQSA legislation that is before the Senate this week. I move:That all words after That be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes:(1) that the Government has damaged Australias world-class higher education system, placing thousands of university workers jobs at risk, and jeopardising Australian research; and(2) the Governments actions will make it harder for Australia to recover from the COVID-19 recession.","Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Cost Recovery and Other Measures) Bill 2021, Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (Charges) Amendment Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[5]","N/A","N/A"

68,0,0,0,1,1,"Bell, Angie, MP",282981,"Moncrieff","LNP","N/A",7723," Im pleased to hear that those on the other side agree with these bills. We know that, before COVID-19 hit, the Gold Coast international education sector contributed $1.6 billion to the local economy and $40 billion to the national economy. It has taken a hard hit. It was the first sector to be damaged, and unfortunately it will be the last one to recover.Before I outline the detail in the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 and the related legislation, I would like to highlight the assistance that the federal government has delivered for international education providers since the pandemic hit. JobKeeper, of course, was a huge help to education providers in Moncrieff, across the Gold Coast and, indeed, across the country. Australians should know that its the Morrison government that has assisted Queenslanders, including international education providers, with $30 billion of financial support already delivered.We continue to support individuals through the South-East Queensland lockdown with COVID-19 disaster payments of up to $750 a week—and Im very pleased that the lockdown was lifted yesterday at 4 pm. Those who were in lockdown can apply from yesterday through Services Australia, and I encourage those whove lost work hours to do so. We on this side continue to stand behind Australians as we always have. In April this year the Morrison government provided more than $53 million of targeted support for international education providers most affected by COVID-19 border closures. The measures have benefited thousands of domestic and international students and Australian businesses who support local jobs.Let me outline for Australians what these measures are and then some real life examples from my electorate. There are an extra 5,000 short-course places for domestic students, and around 100 eligible non-university higher education providers—or NUHEPs, as theyre known—in 2021-22 are being supported with $21.6 million in funding. Short courses are to be offered in any discipline. This will support NUHEPs affected by the decline in international enrolments to pivot their businesses to domestic delivery. Priority has been given to those on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students, known as CRICOS. Around 30,000 existing and prospective students will benefit from lower fees through the extension of FEE-HELP loan fee exemption until the end of this year.An innovation fund was announced as part of the $53.6 million package of measures to support international education providers in the 2021-22 federal budget. There is $9.7 million to establish the innovation grant fund to allow eligible private higher education and English language intensive courses for overseas students or ELICOS providers registered on CRICOS to apply for up to $150,000. Applicants were required to demonstrate the effect of border closures on business turnover, outline their efforts to adapt to the current operating environment and demonstrate how they would benefit from the grant funding. I can now report back to the House that three schools in my electorate of Moncrieff—Inforum Education Australia, Shafston International College and BROWNS English Language School—in just the last week have been awarded grants of $149,500 from this fund, which will help provide them the opportunity to adjust their business models, to grow their market base and to improve online delivery.When I spoke to Richard Brown last week, he was still full of passion for his sector. We agree that this grant will by no means replace the students that theyve lost or the revenue and the staff, but it will assist him to engage with stakeholders he needs to reinvent his business model. Richard told me that he very much appreciated this assistance, as its been difficult to carry the blows of the last 18 months during the pandemic. His plea, in which I join, is for all Australians to get vaccinated as soon as possible so that the international education sector can once again thrive and prosper on the Gold Coast and indeed across the country.Another important measure taken to help the sector is regulatory fee relief and this is what these four bills are particularly about. Some $17.7 million will see domestic fees and charges collected by CRICOS, TEQSA and ASQA waived until 31 December 2021. These measures have taken effect from 1 July this year. Regulatory fee relief will apply across the tertiary and international education sector and no action is required from providers; fees will automatically be waived. This will support the ongoing operations of more than 3,500 providers registered with ASQA as they deliver quality training to around four million students who access Australias VET system each year.The revised cost recovery arrangements for registrations on the CRICOS will commence from 1 January 2022. These bills give effect to the governments decision to implement an updated cost recovery model for the CRICOS, announced in 2021-22 budget, to better align the charging framework with the Australian government charging framework from 1 January 2022. The government had delayed the introduction of an updated cost recovery model for the Department of Education, Skills and Employment, along with TEQSA and ASQA, due to external factors including the COVID-19 pandemic.Currently the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Act 1997 gives authority to the department to collect annual registration and entry-to-market charges on behalf of all ESOS agencies. The ESOS act sets out the ESOS agencies for different providers. Broadly, they are: ASQA and ESOS agencies for registered VET providers;TEQSA for registered higher education providers and the secretary of the department for school providers. The updated cost recovery model will involve the department, ASQA and TEQSA recovering their own costs related to CRICOS activities. The department will charge for its regulatory responsibility as the ESOS agency for school providers, and charge all CRICOS registered providers for its cross-sectoral CRICOS regulatory effort. This just means that education providers are going to be paying less in fees in the long run. The department has sought stakeholder feedback on the updated cost recovery model. A cost recovery implementation statement will be released later this year.Now, while international education providers may question the timing of the new arrangements, they represent an overall reduction in the departments collection of CRICOS charges from the sector and will help to maintain the quality and reputation of Australias international education sector, positioning it for recovery and hopefully regrowth into the future. It is a long road back, but the government are doing everything they can to assist this particular sector. The registration charges bill will provide the legislative authority for the department to stop collecting the EMC and ARC on behalf of all ESOS agencies. It will also enable the department to recover the costs of administering and regulating CRICOS providers activities through a CRICOS annual registration charge for its cross-sectoral provider registration and international student management system and CRICOS activities, and administering the ESOS framework, along with a school initial registration charge and school renewal registration charge. It sounds quite complex, but we all know that this bundle of bills will help Australian education providers, and thats why those on the other side are agreeing to these bills.The amount of charges will be prescribed by regulations setting out the amount or method for calculating the amount to be made by the Governor-General through the executive council. The cost recovery bill will amend the ESOS Act to require registered providers to be in good standing with all ESOS agencies in regard to their CRICOS regulatory fees and charges. It will also clarify the monitoring powers of ESOS agencies by making it explicit that they are able to undertake the function of a compliance audit on CRICOS registered providers they are the ESOS agency for. The bill will also amend the ESOS Act to make the CRICOS annual registration charge payable within a 30-day period beginning on the day after a written notice is given to the provider from the secretary of the department, instead of the last business day in February of the year. In practice, the annual charges will be required to be paid at a similar time through this amendment, though this amendment will allow future flexibility in the timing of annual charges if necessary for unforeseen circumstances. The amendments will require registered providers to pay the fees and charges relevant to them as and when they fall due, including any penalties for late payment. Failure by a provider to pay the relevant fees and charges will constitute a breach of its conditions of registration.The Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Amendment Bill 2021, also one of the bills in this bundle, will amend the Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Act 2012 to add a definition of total enrolments to the TPS levies act. This definition was previously contained in the registration charges act but is being repealed from that act as a consequence of this package of amendments. The definition will also clarify that an enrolment will be included in the calculation for the TPS levy when a student has an enrolment in a course and has also undertaken study in that relevant period.Finally, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 will amend the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (Charges) Act 2021 to remove references to the old charging framework. Thank goodness Im almost at the end; I wont have to say TEQSA again! Thats a summary of what these bills are for. They will help the international higher education sector. I commend the bills to the House.","Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Cost Recovery and Other Measures) Bill 2021, Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (Charges) Amendment Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms BELL (Moncrieff) ","(12:07):"
69,0,0,0,1,1,"Plibersek, Tanya, MP","83M","Sydney","ALP","N/A",7726," [by video link] Id like to congratulate the member for Moncrieff for getting through all of those acronyms! I want to thank the member for Moreton for introducing the second reading amendment to this bill. I rise to speak in favour of the second reading amendment moved by the member for Moreton.Of course Labor supports these bills, which aim to streamline cost recovery arrangements for the regulation of education providers who provide services to international students. The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 repeals and replaces current charging provisions with a new framework, although most of the details, of course, will be set by regulation, which as you would know, Acting Deputy Speaker Vasta, is generally not the ideal way to arrange these matters. But the pattern from this government of trying to avoid transparency and accountability for its decisions continues.Nevertheless, we will be supporting the bills. They make minor and consequential amendments arising from the original bill. The three related bills make minor and consequential amendments arising from the registration charges bill, and we will support them all. Labor, in principle, agrees with cost recovery in this area, although we did oppose the introduction of cost recovery in the TEQSA legislation that is in the Senate at the moment because its a very bad time to be adding additional costs to higher education providers. Higher education providers have had an extraordinarily difficult couple of years, with Australias international borders closed and a very important source of revenue for their operations consequently being unavailable to them. So while we support cost recovery in principle we dont believe now is a great time to be doing it.In regard to the legislation being debated today, while we opposed the broad shift to expanded cost recovery in the TEQSA legislation, this particular set of bills is expected to reduce charges on international education providers and prevent providers from being double charged for the same regulatory activity. So well be supporting todays legislation. We support any reduction in charges at the moment, but this reduction in charges will only partially offset the hiked fees relating to the TEQSA bill that Labor has opposed.Weve moved a second reading amendment today because of the continued concerns we have about the way this government has undermined the university sector, particularly in the last couple of years. The government has systemically been trashing Australias higher education system—the message has been sent to students and staff and to the parents who are hopeful that their kids will one day get a university education. If you look at the last 12 to 18 months, weve had a university system that is absolutely desperate and crying out for help from a government that not only continues to turn its back and turn a deaf ear but acts in a hostile way with universities. Thousands of university staff are losing their jobs around Australia. Thousands of students have seen their fees more than double. More students than ever are wanting to go to university and too many are being turned away. No other industry of this size has received overt hostility like we have seen from the government towards the university sector, with the government changing the rules of JobKeeper three times to make sure universities were excluded from receiving JobKeeper. Casinos got JobKeeper but our great public universities did not get JobKeeper.While all of this was happening, the government introduced legislation that more than doubled the cost of a degree for thousands of students. Think about the year 12 kids who were doing their final exams last year. They had their heart set on a particular degree. In the middle of last year, we had the lockdowns, the disrupted learning, the uncertainty. Rites of passage were interrupted—the school formals that didnt happen, the 18th-birthday parties the kids didnt get to go to. Those kids, thousands of them, were told that the cost of the degree they had their heart set on would more than double. And look at year 12 this year. In New South Wales weve been in lockdown for weeks. Year 12 students have been told they will be doing their final exams, and now they are being told they probably wont be doing their final exams. In Victoria and Queensland theres a great deal of uncertainty as well. These kids have had two years from hell. This years year 12s were in year 11 last year and experiencing all of those disruptions. They were hoping that they would get to do their final exams this year and experience all the rites of passage that teenagers look forward to. Why doesnt this government make it cheaper and easier for these kids to get an education? Whether its at TAFE or university, now is the time to make it cheaper and easier for these kids to get an education after school. We know that they wont be having the same gap-year jobs that many of their friends would have had in previous years. They certainly wont be doing any gap-year travel. Let these kids go to uni or TAFE and let them do it in a way thats affordable and accessible to them.The university system has been crying out for assistance from this government and, on top of the confusion, the uncertainty and cost recovery in this instance, they are also looking at decreased real funding for the university sector. Real funding for higher education will fall by about 10 per cent over the next three years. The budget papers confirm that, because of job-ready graduates, funding for the Commonwealth Grants Scheme, which subsidises student fees, will fall and student debt levels will increase. We know that fees have been going up; as I said, more than doubling in some cases. A Bachelor of Arts will see fees increase by more than 113 per cent. For a four-year degree, students are looking to pay close to $60,000. These are American sized university debts, and our kids shouldnt be lumbered with them at the same time as theyre trying to save a deposit in an increasingly unaffordable housing market. At the same time as theyre thinking of starting a family, these kids are lumbered with these $60,000 debts. Law and commerce students will have their fees increased by nearly 28 per cent. This isnt just bad for individual students—although, of course, it is terrible for individual students—and its not just bad for the university sector, which reports losing about 18,000 jobs, although, if you look at the ABS statistics, it looks like more like 30,000 jobs were lost from higher education. This is also bad for our national prosperity.When we look at countries that are doing well economically in the modern world, they are countries that invest in research and development and higher education. We know that a skilled workforce is the key to our economic prosperity in the future. Before COVID, we had real problems in our economy. Wages were going nowhere, business investment had stalled, growth was low, labour productivity was going backwards for the first time in 25 years and, according to research by Harvard University, we had one of the least complex economies in the world. Why is that a problem? We as a nation have always done so well from our commodity exports, and they will continue to be a huge and important part of our economic prosperity in the future. But we know that, if we are relying on raw commodities for our national wealth, were very subject to changes in international markets. There are the different demands for our goods; of course, sometimes that might be because economies are changing internationally. Sometimes it is because other countries decide to introduce trade barriers when it comes to our commodity exports. Either way, the more complex and value added in our economy, the more irons we have in the fire and the more likely we as a nation are to continue our prosperity. Our university sector is key to this, both because of the research and development done by our universities—a large part of that obviously subsidised by international student fees—and because we know that an educated workforce, a workforce where youve got people going to high-quality vocational education or high-quality university education after theyve finished their secondary school, is much more likely to underpin continued prosperity for Australia in the future.The absence of international students will have cost the Australian economy $18 billion. Thats a loss to universities, and its a loss to the landlords, the restaurant owners, the cafe owners and the businesses that support those international students who are spending money in our local economy. Its a loss to the businesses that rely on the work that international students do in the Australian labour market. But its also a loss to us as a nation, because we know that the return on investment that governments get from investment in higher education is a return of 200 to 300 per cent, according to the OECD. As we cut funding to universities, as we allow this sector to flounder, we have endangered our prosperity in the future—the prosperity of individual Australians and the prosperity of our nation.I want to conclude with a few words about jobs in tertiary education. Tertiary education is our largest services export and our fourth largest export overall. If any other export industry was shedding jobs at the rate that the university sector is shedding jobs, there would be a national rescue package from this government. It is a mark of their hostility towards higher education that there has been no assistance for universities. Universities have identified 18,000 jobs that have been lost, but that doesnt cover the contracts that have expired, the research that hasnt been renewed. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that job losses so far are closer to 30,000 from the university sector. This is serious. Of course its professors and academics, but its also cafeteria workers, librarians, admin assistants, gardeners and construction workers, because added investment in universities has ground to an absolute halt. This is serious. These people have families. Theyve lost their jobs, they have families and they have a government that just doesnt care. The government doesnt care about the jobs that are being lost in universities today, and the government doesnt care that they are making it harder and more expensive for year 12 kids this year and the kids who graduated last year to get an education. If we look at the United States, theyre actually trying to make a college education more affordable for their young people in this really difficult time. Were doing the exact opposite in Australia. Were taking a university sector that is democratic, that has tried to give more people a go at getting their dream job, that has invited people who are the first in their family ever to go to university—weve invited them into our universities; weve gone out and tried to get them to have a shot at university—and this government is shutting that down. Shame! What a shameful thing to do in a year like this.","Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Cost Recovery and Other Measures) Bill 2021, Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (Charges) Amendment Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) ","(12:18):"
70,0,0,0,1,1,"Hammond, Celia, MP",80072,"Curtin","LP","N/A",7729," Im pleased to speak in support of this package of bills, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 and related bills. I want to make a couple of points to start with. I do note that universities, like many sectors of the Australian economy, have been hit hard by COVID. In February 2021, the Universities Australia issued a press release saying that revenue across the sector had decreased by 4.9 per cent from 2019-20. Of course this varies across universities ], with some hit harder than others, and I particularly note in that respect that at least three universities in the country reported operating revenue increases, which is quite surprising. I also acknowledge that there have been significant job losses across the sector, and all of this is regrettable. However, I also note the loss of 4.9 per cent in operating revenue is significantly less than a lot of sectors, such as in tourism and in hospitality.With respect to these bills, they relate to international students and they dont just relate to universities. According to the departments monthly update of international student enrolments, in May 2021 there were 525,892 international students studying in higher education, VET, schools, ELICOS and non-award sectors in Australia. Higher ed made up 54 per cent of those; VET, 37 per cent; schools, two per cent; ELICOS, five per cent; and non-award, two per cent. The majority of students come from China, at 29 per cent, followed by India on 18 per cent, Nepal on eight per cent, Vietnam on four per cent and Malaysia on three per cent. Given the impact of COVID, its not surprising that these numbers are 17 per cent down on the same time last year. The most significantly hit sector is the ELICOS sector, which is down 64 per cent on its enrolments in 2020. Non-award is down 65 per cent, schools are down 31 per cent, universities are down 12 per cent and the VET sector is only down by 0.5 per cent.The decrease in enrolments of international students in 2021 and 2020 has caused significant discussion and some alarmist predictions about the future of Australian international education. There is no doubt that education providers are feeling the bite of this at the moment, and there will be pipeline impacts over at least the next three years. However, an examination of the historical data on international enrolments in Australia shows that while the overall enrolments have been steadily increasing over the past three decades, there have been periods in which it has been hit by a variety of factors. There have been dips and troughs. I note particularly the period between 2011 and 2014, where there was a 10 per cent decrease between 2010 and 2011 and a further nine per cent decrease between 2011 and 2012.Its also worth noting that the mix of our international education sectors has not been static over that time period. By way of comparison with the current statistics, I note that in the year 2000 there were 188,277 international students enrolled with Australian education providers—almost one-third of the numbers today. At that time, higher education had roughly the same proportion—57 per cent. VET was significantly lower, on 16 per cent, schools had six per cent and ELICOS had 19 per cent.The mix of countries from which international students came was also significantly different from what it is today. The two largest cohorts came from Singapore and Hong Kong, both at 11 per cent. Malaysia was at 10 per cent and Indonesia at nine per cent. And its worth noting that India, which is currently sitting at 18 per cent, was only 5.6 per cent of student enrolments in the year 2000. I make these points to illustrate that, while its taking a hit at the moment because of the COVID-19 pandemic, our education sector will rebound. It has rebounded before. It may look different, but changes have occurred before. And there are very good reasons as to why some changes need to and will take place now.The federal minister has recently announced a process to develop a 10-year strategy for international education in Australia—and it is timely. I would say that the starting point for this should be: what are our universities for? I note, with regret—and I know that others who have worked in the university sector also feel regret about this—comments that are made, when talking about international education, only focus on the economics of it. I dont want to downplay the economics of international students. It is vitally important to our country; it is vitally important to our universities. But that is not the sole, the only or even the most important reason as to why we engage in international education. Its also not the reason why we have universities. So, with respect to the federal minister, I would say, in developing that international strategy, lets go back to basics. Lets use that to shape our international strategy for the way forward. Should we be looking at a better diversification of countries from which we draw our international student population? That has a lot of social and cultural benefits for our country, and for their countries when those students go back. And if you talk about economics, it also means were less dependent on one particular marketplace or one particular country for our international students.We should also look at increasing the diversification of courses that students enrol in—dont have all of our international students enrolling in specific courses, such as management or commerce, where they all currently tend to enrol. Lets diversify that. Lets have a national plan for diversifying where our students come from and the types of courses that they enrol in. By all means spread it across the country. Our regional universities and our city universities all could benefit from a really well-thought-out international strategy. Within that, we should also look at the diversification of the levels of study that they undertake, right from ELICOS up to higher degrees. As we develop that strategy, Im still forever confident that our international student enrolments will rebound. The reason why I say this is that Australias education system is excellent and it has an international reputation for excellence. The most recent survey of international students in Australia, which was the 2020 International Student Experience Survey, shows that 91 per cent of international students expressed that they had a positive experience living in Australia. This was in 2020, during COVID, and 91 per cent were still saying they had a positive experience.Part of the reason—not the only reason at all—why we have such reputational excellence is the regulatory framework that underpins the sector. The Education Services for Overseas Students Act, the ESOS Act, establishes requirements and standards for the quality assurance of institutions offering education and training courses to international students in Australia on a student visa. The ESOS Act also provides tuition fee protection for international students. Australian education providers, both public and private, must be approved for registration on the CRICOS, the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students, before they can promote or deliver courses to overseas students. CRICOS lists all Australian education providers approved to teach overseas students and the courses that they offer. CRICOS-registered providers must have met and continue to meet the requirements for the ESOS Act and the National Code of Practice for Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students. Any providers wishing to deliver English-language intensive courses for overseas students or foundation program courses must also meet the ELICOS or foundation program standards as relevant.At present, the Australian government recovers the cost of administering the ESOS Act and regulating education providers. The registration, regulatory compliance and enforcement functions under the ESOS Act are actually shared across three ESOS agencies—the department, as the ESOS agency for schools; ASQA, as the ESOS agency for the vocational education and training sector and standalone ELICOS; and TEQSA, as the ESOS agency for the higher education sector and foundation programs. These bills give effect to the governments decision, as part of the 2021-22 budget, to implement an updated cost-recovery model for registration under CRICOS. Pursuant to these bills, the responsibility for implementing cost-recovery arrangements will move to the individual ESOS agencies. In effect, this means that ASQA and TEQSA will recover the cost of their activities, and the department will charge for its regulatory responsibility as the ESOS agency for all school providers and charge all CRICOS-registered providers for its cross-sectoral regulatory effort.By way of finishing, I acknowledge, as I said at the outset, that Australian international education providers across the board—were not just talking universities here; in fact the sector which has been most hit is our ELICOS providers—have been impacted by COVID. It is also very likely that our sector will change over the coming years. But I look at this with optimism. Such change is not unprecedented and nor is it something which should be feared. Provided our educational sector, from schools through to higher education, continues to offer excellent educational offerings, it will continue to be an extremely vital and critically important sector within Australia and contribute to the success of our nation in social, cultural, diplomatic and, yes, economic ways. An efficient, effective and sustainable regulatory environment and regulatory bodies is a key component of this. Im therefore very happy to support the bills.","Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Cost Recovery and Other Measures) Bill 2021, Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (Charges) Amendment Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms HAMMOND (Curtin) ","(12:33):"
71,0,0,0,1,1,"Kearney, Ged, MP","LTU","Cooper","ALP","N/A",7732," [by video link] I am pleased to join with my colleagues, particularly with the member for Sydney, in speaking on this bill. And I thank the member for Moreton, who moved the amendment in support of Australias university workers, students and institutions. Labor supports these bills, which aim to streamline cost recovery arrangements for education providers who provide services to international students. The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 repeals and replaces current charging provisions with a new framework. Were disappointed to see that much of this framework will be set through regulation, but that just continues this governments track record of avoiding any sense of transparency and accountability. The three related bills make minor and consequential amendments arising from the registration charges bill, and so we support the legislation.While weve opposed parts of the broader shift to expanded cost recovery for higher education providers, this legislation is expected to reduce charges on international education providers and to prevent providers from being double charged for the same regulatory activities. Its worth noting, though, that this reduction in charges will only partly offset the hiked-up fees that providers are facing because of government actions this week in the Senate. Its funny how many times I find myself saying these kinds of things when it comes to this government. Sure, theyre giving a little on this side but theyre taking again on the other. Theyre saying one thing but they mean another. Theyre telling the Australian people one thing but theyre doing something else entirely. And thats absolutely the case when it comes to higher education.Higher education has a proud history in this country. The licence plates on my car have a little by-line on the bottom, Victoria—the Education State. Were proud of our education system in Australia, and thats due to the efforts of Labor governments over the past century investing so significantly and to the passion of academics over so many years. Weve grown over decades to be the higher ed powerhouse of the world. For a long time in my electorate, right here in Cooper, weve been proud to have so many international students call our community home—students who are studying at La Trobe University, RMIT, Melbourne uni, you name it. Theyve come here to study at our world-class universities. Its something were proud of, both right here in my community and as a country.Our universities are massive employers. La Trobe University is the largest employer in my electorate. Thousands of my constituents are contributing to the education of our next generation. Theyre proud to work in universities. Theyre teaching our kids and theyre helping them plan their futures. Theyre making sure that learning resources are accessible. Workers at the university are keeping these kids fed on campus and keeping the surrounds clean. Theyre contributing to the functioning of these enormous institutions that are so vital to our social, cultural and economic wellbeing as a community. Theyre proud of their jobs and were proud of them. Its with them in mind that I speak here today in support of assistance for our universities, for the workers in them and for the students.It is undeniable that the government has abandoned them. This Morrison government has abandoned our universities, the workers and the students. This is a trend that started before the pandemic, but it has now snowballed into something else entirely. There is no mincing words on this. Our universities are in a dire position, and the blame can only flow in one direction: the Morrison government. They have refused to support our universities every step of the way. The universities have been crying out for assistance for a year and a half now, to no avail. When the pandemic started, the flow of international students stopped entirely, as we know, and universities moved to online delivery models. They were posed with so many challenges but, my goodness, they worked hard to overcome them!How do you carry out medical research when youre at home? How can you train a nurse or a vet—even an engineer or a teacher—from home without the practical experience they need? They were faced with challenges beyond the pale. University staff, whether they were tutors, lecturers or support and admin staff, stepped up to the task and they made it happen. But, as COVID drew on, the situation became dire. The numbers were crunched—by university qualified accountants, might I add!—and support was surely needed in the absence of such a significant portion of their students.I distinctly remember the relief that was felt when JobKeeper was announced. We immediately reached out to the universities, who employ so many of our constituents, asking if they were eligible—and for all intents and purposes they were. The relief was something I cant put into words; you could hear it over the phone as we spoke to them, and I certainly felt it myself.With the following week came an announcement from the Treasurer: universities were no longer deemed eligible for JobKeeper. The thousands of employees at the universities in and around my electorate were not going to be supported by the government through the toughest time most of us had seen. Dont be fooled; this wasnt an oversight. The government deliberately changed the rules to exclude university workers as if their work werent as important as that of the rest of the workforce that was experiencing the tough times. In fact, they changed the JobKeeper rules three separate times to make sure the workers werent supported. It was a complete and utter disgrace. As a result, universities have announced over 18,000 job losses and redundancies since the pandemic began.Here in my electorate of Cooper, hundreds of university workers have lost their jobs. But this figure tells only part of the story. Many casual workers have lost their hours and their jobs, and many staff havent had their short-term contracts renewed. Recent data from the ABS shows there are 30,000 fewer Australians working in higher ed than there were at the start of last year. This is a sector that is now being systematically hollowed out by a government that just doesnt care.The impact on the workers is one part of the equation, but the massive impact on the students is another. As a result of these job cuts, university students are seeing their once sought after university degrees reduced to something that barely resembles a prior qualification. Teaching hours are massively reduced. The quality of resources cannot be anywhere near the standards teaching staff want and need them to be. Options for study have declined dramatically. At La Trobe University, the all-important history department is at really severe risk.Not only that, the actual cost of degrees is skyrocketing. This years budget papers confirm that, because of the governments so-called job-ready graduates scheme, funding will fall and student debt levels will rise. I know that this semester tens of thousands of Australian students have started university facing fee hikes, with many having had their fees doubled. Those studying a Bachelor of Arts have had their fees increased by more than 113 per cent. For a four-year degree, students will be paying around $60,000. Law and commerce students have had their fees increased by nearly 28 per cent. Youre paying inflated fees for a degree that, in most cases, may not be near the quality of the degree you signed up for in the first place. Boy, oh, boy! Young people have a lot to thank this government for!I know that, across the board, young people in my electorate are furious with this government. This is a government that has allowed the scourge of insecure work to take hold, affecting the vast majority of young people. Now, because of insecure work, theyre excluded by the government from wage subsidies. For many of them, this means theyre now out of a job. Many will turn to education and training as a pathway to getting a new job, but this government, as well as attacking universities, has underresourced and underfunded TAFE. So where will our young people turn? Will they turn to the jobs program this government cant seem to get right, or to emerging industries? I know that, here in Cooper, the government certainly isnt investing in those. Theyre not acting on climate change. Theyre not acting on housing affordability. Theyre abandoning young people in this country. They just dont care.So young people and academics, in their wisdom, are trying to appeal to the Morrison governments own interests. We know that this government doesnt care about young people, workers or education, but youd think that, at the very least, it could see the economic benefits of a successful university sector. International education was a $40 billion export industry. Its estimated that, by the end of the year, that number will be down to $22 billion. In my electorate we see the flow-on economic effects that universities bring, with all of those students shopping and renting here, and the incomes of all of the workers being spent in the local economy. Its huge, and its vital to the survival of so many businesses.We on this side of the House know that, while this is a crucial part of the picture, the value of universities isnt purely economic. Because our universities are hollowed out, we and our society lose vital knowledge. We lose the experts, the researchers and the historians, and, with them, our students and our young people lose the opportunity to learn from them and to take this knowledge and apply it to the jobs of the future. This loss is monumental. Its hard to put figures into words. I know La Trobe Universitys history department is under threat. This is how catastrophic a loss this is—losing historians and the teaching of our history, because this uncaring, irresponsible Morrison government cant find it within itself to support the university sector. Its just a disgrace.I say to the workers and students at La Trobe and at universities across the country: we are on your side. We are standing with you. We will fight tooth and nail against the governments cuts to the university sector, and we will continue to fight for proper support for you. University workers deserve to be recognised as the vital workers they are. Students deserve the quality education that Australia has become so renowned for, and Australians deserve an education system that is up to scratch and a government that is up to the task of delivering it. The Morrison government doesnt even come close.","Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Cost Recovery and Other Measures) Bill 2021, Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (Charges) Amendment Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms KEARNEY (Cooper) ","(12:44):"
72,0,0,0,1,1,"Gorman, Patrick, MP",74519,"Perth","ALP","N/A",7735," The government says we need this legislation, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 and associated bills, to fix issues with fees for higher education, when we all know that the actual problem in higher education right now is cuts. When it comes to the fees question, weve seen that this governments only solution to higher education is to increase fees for thousands of students across Australia.I think about the young people in university, seeing their entire university world changing over the course of their degree—course cuts, fee increases. Who is left to explain this government policy to them? We know the Prime Minister refuses to meet with chancellors. We know the Prime Minister refuses to meet even with a delegation led by a former Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. So, instead, these changes are left to academics to explain. Academics are fabulous at transferring knowledge from one generation to the next. Im joined by two fabulous academics: Dr Anne Aly, who had a fabulous career in academia at Edith Cowan University before joining us in this place; and Dr Andrew Leigh, a former professor of economics at the Australian National University. But, wherever you are working as an academic, it shouldnt be your job to explain why the government is making higher education more expensive and less accessible for people. But thats what this government has left the academics who work today to do. They are explaining to their students why theyre paying more than they have, why theyre getting less face-to-face teaching than theyve ever received. Indeed, some of these academics, these sessional tutors, werent able to get JobKeeper and have lost hours and time in research. This government has treated academics with absolute disdain over the last 18 months. Clearly they are the people it thought about least when it thought about who it could support through this pandemic.We know the opportunity to attend university is both a privilege and a right for generations of Australians. When I went to university it didnt matter how much money my parents had, and it didnt matter if I had saved up tens of thousands of dollars; all that mattered was that I had the academic requirements and the passion to go and study. It really upsets me that a generation of young Australians wont feel the same and will have to make an economic choice. The government, when it pushed through changes last year under the cover of a global pandemic, said it wanted to put more market forces and more economic choice into the decisions students make.Young Australians know that if you have a go, you get a go is a hollow slogan when it comes to higher education. Its fair to say that young Australians today probably think they have been dealt a very harsh hand. For a year and a half they have faced challenge after challenge. Right now they need support from the federal government like never before, but instead this government has hit them with a knowledge tax; thats the only thing it has done to support students over the course of the pandemic.The government thought it was appropriate last year to increase the costs of some degrees by 113 per cent. If students choose to do a humanities degree they will face as much as $14,500 in fees in their first year, and it will go up every single year after that. By the completion of their degree, they could be facing a debt of some $60,000. A debt of $60,000 will take those students some 15 to 20 years to repay.We see a lot of debate about what should happen with superannuation and what should happen with housing policy. But the government never acknowledges that the gift it is giving hundreds of thousands of young Australians is a $60,000 debt that they will walk into the workforce with on day one. For some students thats bumping up to US-style debts of some $100,000 or more. And, while students are paying even more than they ever have for their education, the governments saying, The students are now paying for it, so were going to pull money out.Weve seen in this years budget the government locked in a real funding cut of some 10 per cent for higher education. While students are having these 40 per cent increases in their fees, the governments pulling out 10 per cent of their funding. This is a government that defends its trillion dollars of debt as careful fiscal management—thats a quote of those opposite—but doesnt seem to be able to find any money to invest in the next generation. Young people and students across Australia must be thinking: Who is going to stand on our side? Who is on our side when it comes to higher education?If you look at the history of what Labor has done when we have been in office, there is no doubt that we have invested in education and invested in opportunity for young Australians. We saw university funding increase from some $8 billion in 2007 to some $14 billion in 2013. When you compare that to the $3 billion cut out of the TAFE sector under this government, you know that there is a difference in the way that people see our role in this place in providing opportunity for our future workforce. Theyre the numbers, but, if you think about the actual lives changed, an extra 220,000 students got an opportunity to go to university because of those changes by the Labor government. Under then education minister and then Prime Minister Julia Gillard we saw an increase in opportunity for young Australians. Thats what we should be focusing on when were doing our work in this place.If you look at the sorts of students that started to go to university, we saw financially disadvantaged student enrolments increase by 66 per cent and we saw Indigenous undergraduate enrolments increase by 105 per cent—a doubling of the Indigenous undergraduate cohort over the course of that six years. That changes peoples lives. Even more encouraging, students with a disability increased by 123 per cent over that period of time. Thats how you give people opportunity. Thats how you expand access to higher education for all—not with the sort of legislation that weve seen put before us today and in recent years from this government.Think about what weve learnt out of this pandemic and what weve learnt out of our need for a highly skilled and trained workforce: we might be forced, with closed international borders, to rely on the capacity of our own people. This government saw all that happening and decided it would instead whack nursing students with an eight per cent fee increase, whack agriculture students with a 10 per cent fee increase and whack clinical psychology students with a 15 per cent fee increase. Engineering students are seeing their fees increase by 16 per cent, maths students are seeing their fees increase by 17 per cent, law students are seeing their fees increase by 28 per cent, and medical students are seeing their fees increase by 32 per cent. Thats this governments response to the need to skill our own people.Where thats actually happening is in the courses that are lucky enough to continue, because the other thing that weve seen is this huge cut in the number of courses, as universities struggle with cuts in their funding and cuts in international student numbers and are not receiving a single cent of JobKeeper. Some 17,000 university staff have lost their jobs over the last year and a half—thats 13 per cent of the university workforce gone, kicked out. Some 14,000 jobs in regional Australia are supported by our university sector, and they are under threat as well. I note that to the members of the National Party who are in the House right now. Last month we saw some 200 workers lose their jobs at La Trobe University. In Western Australia, we are seeing universities having to make incredibly difficult decisions because of the choices of this government.The University of Western Australia is planning to gut its social science courses: research positions gone; entire disciplines removed; sociology, anthropology and others gone; and those are just the start of the cuts. Some $40 million will be cut from the UWA budget because the university is not getting enough support to continue to run the programs it has run in the past. Its Western Australias oldest university, and some of these disciplines have been taught for nearly a century. We know that up to 300 jobs will be cut from UWA. Indeed, the vice-chancellor acknowledged that these cuts will impact everybody at the university. Its not the only university thats been forced to cut staff. Murdoch University has opened voluntary redundancies across the campus to facilitate a $25 million cut in funding. Yet we hear nothing from the Prime Minister about this. I want to thank the students currently at UWA who are campaigning against these cuts and campaigning to save their courses. Theyre campaigning not for themselves, because they will probably be able to continue their courses until they graduate, but because they know that these disciplines are so important. I want to say to these students, Thank you for the work youre doing and for standing up against these mean cuts. I particularly thank Katherine Ong, with whom Ive been fortunate to speak. Shes leading some of these student campaigns. I thank Linc Murray, to whom I spoke on Friday. They just cant understand why these courses are being cut. I also thank Nicole McEwen and some of the other student activists who have been making sure that students really know whats happening in their courses.Sarah Ison, a reporter from the West Australian newspaper, spoke to Dr Tauel Harper, a lecturer in media and communications at UWA. The article said:Media and communications lecturer Tauel Harper said his research informed his teaching and the proposal to move him to teaching only was devastating. My research is my lifes work, he said.Hes done work thats been relied on by the WA parliament, the Victorian police and the Victorian Department of Premier and Cabinet about how we counter violent extremism and how we prevent it from having a home here in Australia. These are the sorts of things that will no longer be researched because of these cuts. The government had a choice last year. They chose three times not to give JobKeeper to our universities—not once, not twice, but three times they actively came in here and said, No, universities will make do with what theyve got, despite the fact that they were so hard hit by international students being unable to return to study. Its estimated that universities have lost $3 billion from border closures alone. When JobKeeper passed through the parliament, the Treasurer described it as, One of the most important days in the parliaments history. For universities it was one of the most devastating, a clear sign that this government did not see supporting universities as part of its job. The government proudly declared that JobKeeper was worth $130 billion as part of a $251 billion package of unprecedented economic support. But not a cent of JobKeeper went to Australian universities. The Treasurer said of the global pandemic that Australia stood on the edge of the economic abyss. But this government left those universities standing there alone.We know that higher education is important. Its been important to my life. My parents were fortunate enough to attend Claremont Teachers College as a result of former Prime Minister Whitlam opening up higher education to people with backgrounds that were less fortunate than those whod studied there in previous decades. I was fortunate to attend Curtin University, a university I have incredibly fond memories of. It gave me a world-class education, and I want to say thank you to every one of my lecturers and the academics at Curtin University. When you can attend university in person, you have the joy of making friends, and some of them become lifelong friends. At Curtin University I met Zaneta Mascarenhas. Curtin University is located in the federal electorate of Swan. Curtin University is WAs largest university, and since we met some 20 years ago Zaneta and I have stayed in touch. My son Leo and her son Lincoln now have play dates and they are very good friends. Every day that I have known Zaneta Mascarenhas she has been passionate about access education, ensuring that every Australian can fulfil their potential whatever their background, whatever the income of their parents. She is exactly the sort of person we need in this chamber. Im very excited that she has chosen to put herself forward for federal parliament as a candidate for the seat of Swan. She was born in Kalgoorlie and grew up in regional WA. She is currently the manager at a local WA energy consultancy. She has had a long career working as an engineer—none of this cosplay stuff that we see from those opposite. She has actually worked as an engineer in mining and engineering, making sure we keep the Australian economy going, and she serves on the South Metropolitan TAFE council—a true commitment to tertiary education, both TAFE and university.I think putting an engineer in the parliament is the right sort of thing to do right now. Its getting those skills that you get from a fabulous university, like Curtin University, and applying that very rational thinking to the policy challenges we face. Its having someone who is grounded in the practical application of realities and of science—someone who understands that science is fact as opposed to an optional extra in your policy formulation. And Swan desperately needs someone who will stand up for them, for the working families in Vic Park, for the pensioners in South Perth and for the students in Bentley.

75,0,0,0,1,1,"Gosling, Luke, MP",245392,"Solomon","ALP","N/A",7738," Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and its great to see you in the chair! I want to thank the member for Sydney, the member for Moreton and the member for Perth. I agree wholeheartedly with everything that has been said to date. I want to talk about a couple of issues to do with overseas students and international education generally, as well as speak in particular about this bill, Education Services For Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021, and the related bills. As weve heard from previous speakers, Labor does not oppose these cognate bills. The legislation is of course far from perfect; however, on this side of the House were supporting it. As we have done through the pandemic and in general, the opposition is not in the business of opposing legislation for the sake of relentless opposition—as weve seen in past oppositions. But even when we extend support for legislation from the government it does not mean we abandon our scrutiny or refrain from criticising the government, where thats warranted.Its always an interesting experience to rise and speak on legislation brought forward by the government that impacts universities and higher education. This government has a troubled track record when it comes to unis, and the sting from this track record is made much worse when we consider the size and contribution of this sector to our economy. I can inform the House that in my electorate of Solomon—thats Greater Darwin, Darwin and Palmerston in particular—Charles Darwin University has made an immense contribution to our life in the north: to our cultural life; obviously to our academic life; and to our economy. Nationally, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, international education was the fourth-largest export industry in Australia. Students came to Darwin from all over the globe, looking for a world-class education, and to universities around the country. They were looking for those qualifications which would guarantee some employment and for the experience of studying and living in our remarkable nation.These students enriched the quality of campus life at universities across Australia and of course they worked in a variety of roles in our economy, in small to large businesses. The revenue generated from this total holistic process was significant. International education contributed $37.5 billion in export earnings to the economy per annum, universities employed about 130,000 full-time-equivalent workers in academic and professional roles, and the sector supported over 250,000 jobs throughout our economy. So it was significant indeed and very much deserving of more attention and support that the sector has received from those opposite.When the pandemic hit Australia, the sector was badly impacted by both the closure of borders and the inability of students to travel here. The sector needed support to cushion this impact and to make the bounce back to normal easier and quicker. What did this government do to support this large and important industry? Not only did they not do anything, their actions betrayed a cavalier disregard for the continuing viability of universities and higher education in this country. Anyone would think that they were blind to their own life story and to the role of universities to their current circumstances. The fact that theyre sitting in the seats that they are is in no small part because of the university degrees that they received. But then, as is often the case with those opposite, once they achieve that position of power or influence, it must have been their own brilliance alone that got them to where they were, not the contribution of so many people in academic institutions that assisted their learning.Lets not forget that this government changed the rules and requirements for JobKeeper three separate times to deliberately exclude universities. The fourth biggest sector in Australia, as I mentioned earlier, was treated like that when, were well aware, there were big companies whose revenue and profits were going up and who received JobKeeper support but not our universities.That once booming export sector will lose $3.8 billion in revenue across 2021. At least 17,300 workers employed by universities lost their jobs last year, and the job losses have continued this year. Those losses are in critical areas of research and expertise, which, apparently, we hear from those opposite, are important to them, and research and expertise apparently is pretty important in the future of work, the pandemic that we face, and our want to leap ahead when it comes to high-value, high-tech items to export and to manufacture. We need those critical areas of research and expertise, and these losses which have taken place across disciplines and faculties constitute a serious hit to the intellectual capacity of our nation. So it is hitting intellectual capacity, hitting the economy and hitting the R&D that we hear those opposite understand are important to our future.This lack of support has led to 7,000 research positions effectively disappearing. The people who occupied those positions will either go overseas or, unfortunately, leave research altogether. The tragedy of this is that, once removed, that capacity is very difficult to replace. This loss of research and teaching capacity can even be found in the discipline of Asian studies. Who would have thought that Asian studies would be important in the Asian century? Universities across Australia have cut back on Asian studies, including the teaching of Asian languages. That is just dumb. It is dumb, but universities have to make hard decisions when theyre faced with such a lack of support from a dumb government that doesnt seem to connect the dots between our future in this region and the need for our universities to be training people of all ages, not only in Asian languages but in Asian studies in general.Lets have a think what that defunding means for languages here in Australia. We are living through some of the biggest changes ever experienced in our region. It is an era of complexity, and we hear that often. The challenges that we face in Indo-Pacific are significant. What we need is obviously the ability to defend ourselves from any threats and we need to be able to protect Australia and her interests. What we also need is for really smart people who will become the diplomats of the future to be able to speak languages, to be able to understand intimately our region so that they can effectively apply that trade craft in order to secure Australia and our interests. We want to equip the next generation with the language and knowledge needed for that understanding. Its absolutely critical. So the government needs a plan to deal with this looming knowledge crisis, and I call upon those opposite to act immediately to properly fund our universities, including those Asian studies programs.International education in Australia may have taken a mighty battering from the pandemic and the indifference of those opposite, but the industry survives, and we must look to the future to restore and resuscitate this important sector to our economy and to our future. I dont know if this legislation will achieve this; I doubt it. The backbone of this sector was always international students themselves, and we need to bring them back. And I should stress that I am not calling for international students to be brought back at the expense of Australians stranded overseas. Thats another major failure of this government. Had they acted quickly last year, all stranded Australians could have been evacuated home by now. Had those opposite built a national network of effective quarantine facilities, as they were advised to do in advice that they themselves sought, these evacuated Australians would have had somewhere to safety quarantine upon returning home. But I digress.The future viability of higher education in this country rests on being able to bring international students back to Australia, and we can do this, but we need somewhere for these students to quarantine when they arrive here. But thats not hotels—to the geniuses opposite—because hotel quarantine leaks. Weve counted about 28 leaks so far; maybe there have been more. But hotel quarantine leaks. We need dedicated quarantine facilities, because those hotel quarantine leaks are costing our economy billions—thats with a b, billions.One such place suitable for a dedicated national quarantine centre is the Top End. Those opposite would know that Howard Springs has been providing a wonderful service to our nation in getting stranded Australians home. The Olympians are there at the moment, and Australians who need to travel to the Northern Territory will continue to quarantine there. Weve also got another facility, called Bladin Point. It can take 1,500 people per fortnight. Ive written to the Home Affairs minister about the centre. I understand that she has visited it recently. I hope she very much enjoyed her visit to the Top End and I hope she saw how effective Bladin Village could be in quarantining international students so we can get those international students back into our universities—because we are being done like a dinner internationally. Other countries governments that are being smarter than our current Australian government are making sure that international students know theyre loved, know theyre welcome back, and have got avenues through which they can quarantine and resume that relationship with their universities.Last year in October, when the Prime Minister received advice on standing up more dedicated quarantine facilities, if we had stood up Bladin Village, as one example—but there are others, as we know, in Queensland and in Victoria, or near any capital city—we could have got tens of thousands of stranded Australians home and we could have started to get many more international students home.Currently, weve got half the Australian population in lockdown, some due to leaks from hotel quarantine. So I stress again, for those opposite, that bringing international students back into Australia has got to be done safely. That means dedicated quarantine facilities. Weve got that facility up in Darwin, and I encourage them to use it.The COVID pandemic has in many ways changed the world and the way we live. Some of these changes will be with us forever, but others will be transitory. Im glad the government has put this package of legislation to the House. However, it does not go far enough towards rebuilding the international education sector, so I call on the government to put politics aside and act to save our universities and our international education sector.No great nation treats its tertiary education sector this way. Compared to our competitors, we are losing big time. Other nations are making headway, and we are totally squandering our competitive advantages in attracting overseas students. I encourage those opposite, the current Australian government, to do better. Listen to the advice you were given a long time ago, pull your finger out and secure pathways to Australia for international students. As I mentioned, in Darwin we have a dedicated quarantine facility that has been largely unused. Get the international students in and give them the jabs that they need, if they havent already got them. They will have a great education in the Northern Territory, where we are COVID free—touch wood! We have a great record when it comes to dealing with COVID. Lets get the international students home.","Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Cost Recovery and Other Measures) Bill 2021, Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (Charges) Amendment Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GOSLING (Solomon) ","(13:11):"

I reiterate some of the points that have been made about Labors support for the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 and cognate bills, which aim to streamline cost-recovery arrangements for the regulation of education providers who provide services to international students.I would like to commend the member for Sydney for bringing forward the bill, the member for Moreton for the amendment that he has moved and speakers on both sides who have contributed thus far to the debate on this bill. I found the contribution by the member for Curtin to be particularly refreshing. It is refreshing to see an individual who has the level of experience in the higher education sector that she brings to this parliament contributing to this kind of debate and bringing that experience here. It is refreshing, particularly, to hear her acknowledgement of the value of Australias education system—not just its economic value but its value in terms of its diplomatic efforts and cultural connections with other countries—and that this doesnt affect just our university students but a range of providers to international students. As somebody who worked in ELICOS, taught ELICOS and worked as an administrator at a university, as a teacher at a university and as a researcher and professor at universities, Im proud to stand up and speak in defence of all of those providers within the higher education sector who provide education services to international students.As I mentioned, Labor supports these bills, because Labor will always support bills that make it easier and cheaper for students to access education and for providers to deliver quality education to Australian students. These bills, though they make minor and consequential amendments arising from the registration charges bill, do contribute in some way to a broader shift to full cost-recovery for the regulation of higher education providers. Labor has, however, proceeded with caution, particularly around the fact that most of the details to be set in these bills will be set through regulation, which is something that members on this side have spoken against because that does not lend itself to the kind of transparency that Australians expect and the accountability that Australians should be getting from their government.So, whilst were not opposed to cost recovery in principle if its well thought out, and we will not oppose these bills, we will be raising those issues, the ways in which these bills fall short and the regulation of the provisions set in these bills.Ill have more to say about universities, particularly the devastating impact on universities not just through COVID but through this governments actions, both active and passive, where it has either actively attacked the university sector or—","Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Cost Recovery and Other Measures) Bill 2021, Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (Charges) Amendment Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALY (Cowan) ","(13:26):"

He was fluent in Armenian, Arabic, French and English and ran a hardware store in Cairo, but he wanted the better life for his family that Australia offered. He worked hard, and he was a tireless volunteer in his later years. After Marie died in 2004, hed spend every morning in my office, having a cup of tea, reading the paper and opening mail.Ardashes was passionate. He would take anyone not accepting a Labor how-to-vote card at prepoll as a personal insult, and he disliked Liberals and the Greens equally. He wore a cap every single day and would often be seen around Marrickville in a campaign shirt, not just during elections.Ardashes had a heart of gold and made a great contribution to his new country, Australia.

Over a year on I continue to be approached by constituents who are struggling to get their money back for cancelled flights and bookings or who have grudgingly been given flight refunds or travel credits with improbable time lines for use, all of which goes to show clearly that current Australian consumer law just isnt cutting it. That needs to be remedied, which is why I’m supporting CHOICE magazines call for a suite of reforms to provide greater clarity, consistency and fairness for travellers who cant get the travel services they paid for due to circumstances outside their control. Indeed, CHOICEs recommendations would ensure that consumers are informed and protected, including measures to lift standards of service, easier processes for customer refunds, fairer travel credits and vouchers, and clearer procedures for disputes to be heard and resolved.We know the pandemic has been tough on many people, including, I should add, on many travel agents whove worked tirelessly to help their clients.

At the meeting I had the opportunity to share updates regarding the vaccine rollout. Most of the women had already received their first dose of the vaccine, which was fantastic to hear.In 2020, the wonderful and selfless members of the QCWA at Mermaid Beach volunteered for a total of 13,200 hours in our Gold Coast community. They supported those who needed it most during the pandemic. The community spirit is exactly what the Gold Coast is known for.As part of these 13,200 hours, the ladies knitted small beanies for premature and stillborn babies in our Gold Coast hospitals and knitted toys for babies in the NICU to help provide small comfort for those families who experience heartache, trauma and uncertainty. They also make fidget blankets to support those with dementia to use when they receive their treatment. At the beginning of the pandemic, the QCWA in Mermaid Beach made hundreds of litres of soup and donated to HAVAFEED Community Relief in the Mermaid Beach Community Centre. They support those less fortunate, who are doing it tough.I commend President Jan Woolmer and her team: Secretary Carmel Caswell, vice-presidents Kathy Walsh and Linda Marino, Treasurer Dawn Johansson and all the members for the outstanding work they do in our community.

This time last year, Australia had none, because this time last year the Prime Minister and his government were too busy doing a victory lap.

This will be crucial to our ability to remain open in regional Victoria as we fight COVID-19. Localised restrictions are needed to ensure our survival, not only from the virus but also from the broader economic and social impact of continual lockdowns. Regional Victoria, where more than 1.6 million people live and work to provide food and fibre to the world, has been shackled and gutted by these repeated restrictions. Regional townships such as Mildura and Horsham have shown they are willing to do their part and have done so effectively when COVID cases have occurred.

Charlie comes from a sporting family, with his mother representing Australia in two sports and his uncle being a renowned Australian cricketer. He made it to the semifinals for the 800 metres—a fantastic effort. Tascott local Nicola McDermott was introduced to athletics when she was seven and quickly found her niche in high jump. Nicola always had a dream to go to the Olympics. She not only made it, but she won a silver medal and broke the Australian national record.

101,0,0,0,1,1,"Morrison, Scott, MP","E3L","Cook","LP","N/A",7751," I want to extend the countrys congratulations and thanks to our Australian Olympic team, as well as to the organisers of the Tokyo Olympic Games, for what has been a truly extraordinary fortnight. These were the games that the world needed, and Japan and the Olympic movement delivered those games. These were the games that Australia needed, and our magnificent athletes have delivered.Weve had wonderful Olympic Games before—Melbourne and Sydney, of course, on home soil, and Athens, amongst many others—but these games lifted us in a very different way, at a very crucial time for our nation. The Australian Olympic team generally has inspired us. The Australian got it right with their headline Good sports and good at sport, achievement and character going hand in hand. The achievements are for the history books, and they tell part of the story: sixth on the medal tally; 17 gold, seven silver, 22 bronze—equalling, with Athens, our best ever gold medal tally; 99 individual members of the Australian team taking home medals across 15 sports and 20 disciplines. Olympic heroes and champions, indeed, for the ages.Chief amongst them, the mighty Emma McKeon, now atop the pantheon of Australian and world sport: four gold, three bronze—the most medals by an Australian at an Olympic Games, and only the second woman in history to win that many. Now with more Olympic medals than any other Australian Olympian, Emma was joined in triumph by Kaylee McKeown and Ariarne Titmus, our queen machine of the pool. Kaylee, with three gold medals and a bronze, inspired by the memory of her late father, who she lost last year. Ariarne, with two gold, a silver and a bronze. I spoke to Ariarnes and Emmas parents during the games, and, like all the families we saw during the games, they were proud of their loved ones long before their Tokyo triumphs. The pride isnt in the medals, though the medals represent great achievement; the pride is in seeing the emergence of such determination, dedication, discipline and sacrifice.We shouldnt be under any illusion. All of our athletes made great sacrifices in their careers, their finances and their studies to go to Tokyo, sacrifices compounded by the delays and the restrictions of a gruelling pandemic, but they all found ways through to make their way to Tokyo. The gold medallists: Matthew Wearn, Mathew Belcher and Will Ryan in the sailing; the paddlers Tom Green and Jean van der Westhuyzen, and the incredible Jess Fox at her third Olympics; Zac Stubblety-Cook, and the womens relay teams in the swimming; Logan Martin in the inaugural freestyle BMX competition; and 18-year-old Keegan Palmer in skateboarding. And after 25 years without an oarsome foursome we ended up with two in one day—the mens and the womens fours.There were others who moved us in ways, of course, we wont forget: Peter Bol, the 800-metre runner, who expressed so passionately his love for this country—a truly great Australian story; Harry Garside, the boxer who learned ballet and won Australias first medal in the sport in 33 years; and Skye Nicolson, devastated at her narrow loss in the quarter finals at the womens boxing. We spoke on the phone, and Skye said, Im so proud to be representing my beautiful country. I was in awe of what our athletes gave. Genevieve Gregson ruptured her Achilles on the last hurdle of the steeplechase. It was her birthday. Gen described to all of us how to deal with setbacks, saying, Its raw; its hard; Im not okay, yet I will be. Saya Sakakibara in the BMX was competing not just for her country but for her brother Kai, who was seriously injured while competing last year. In Sayas race, another competitors bike touched her wheel, and she crashed. She thought shed let everyone down. But Kai put it best when he said: Saya, I know this isnt what you wanted, but either way Im really proud. Lets go prepare for the next one. We echo Kais thoughts and words. We saw that resilience with Patrick Tiernan, giving his all in the 10,000 metres and pushing his way through every mental barrier.There were others too who inspired us: Jian Fang Lay, a six-time Olympian in table tennis, and Andrew Hoy, who came back for his eighth Olympics—at 62, our oldest medallist yet and an inspiration to many of us in this chamber, I suspect. We know there are big things ahead for Rohan Browning and his mullet, as well as our high jump silver medallist, Nicola McDermott—who I spoke to today—with her remarkable sense of calm. All the teams—the Kookaburras continued on their incredible journey; the Matildas delivered their best performance yet; and the Boomers, led by the great leader Patty Mills, brought us ever so much closer to that Everest in mens basketball, and we have the foothold in it now as a result of his leadership.But, for me, the moment that really captured these games was the decathlon—the final event, the 1,500 metres, and two Australians, Ash Moloney and Cedric Dubler. Ash had the chance at a medal; Cedric didnt. So Cedric decided to back his teammate. He was on his tail, pushing him on. We could see the intensity. The lip-readers could make out the words, and I dont think they were parliamentary! Im sure the image of Ash and Cedric heading round the track will be iconic—Cedric beckoning his teammate, Keep going, go faster, give more, dont give up. Thats the story of these games: keep going, dont tire, dont give up, do what you have to do, focus on the finish line ahead.The world owes a great debt to the government of Japan, to the Olympic movement and, in particular, to Prime Minister Suga and the Japanese people, who we commend for their great staging of these games. They persevered with these games, and they were vindicated. The critics said there would be no atmosphere. Instead, we rediscovered that sport isnt about the crowds; its about the heart and soul of those who compete, which was on display. We saw that at the Tokyo Olympics, and we will see it in the Paralympics, which we look forward to, which are now only weeks away. We wish our Paralympian athletes the same success that those who have already competed in the Tokyo Olympics have had. There will be stories there that echo these. This is a country that I think celebrates the Paralympics like few others. We stand our heroes of the Paralympics against and with all of our other great athletes in this nation. We celebrate them with great pride and we wish them all the best.The focus on the athletes is what we, of course, will take ahead as we move now to the Brisbane 2032 Games—which kicked off the games for us—and we commend all of those who have been involved in that endeavour. I have no doubt that kids pretending to swim in their living rooms while watching the Olympics or doing high jumps, as we saw last night, over a sack of pillows are watching and thinking that it may well be them in 2032. Its great that they now have that hope to look forward to.I know that the character of the Australian Olympic team is shared by the Australians that they have represented. Australians have the grit, the determination and the character to prevail. There may not be gold medals, as I wrote recently, for being a single parent, for running a small business, for doing the night shift in an emergency department or aged-care facility, for being out there at the vaccination hubs or for volunteering for your local surf lifesaving club or your local bushfire brigade, but, if there were, Australia would be at the top of the gold medal tally, Im quite certain. This is why Im so confident Australia will pull through this current challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic. We wont let it beat us. We wont let our frustration get the better of us. We wont let negativity overwhelm our optimism. We will urge each other on. We will put our heads down and keep pressing on, and we will succeed. That is the Australian way.","Tokyo Olympic Games","STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr MORRISON (Cook—Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service) ","(14:02):"

These Olympics were a beacon of hope in a world where people needed something to smile and cheer about. And Australians certainly had full bottle on that!We saw so many young Australians reach the unreachable in the past fortnight, so many who followed Cathys path to personal triumph. I say to every one of our Olympians: you were selected with good reason, and, when you got to Tokyo, you did our nation proud. You performed magnificently as athletes, as human beings and as representatives of your country. You gave us demonstration after demonstration of everything that is great about the Olympics. We saw talent. We saw determination. We saw records broken. We saw personal bests beaten. We saw some dreams realised, some not quite. We saw physical and mental grit. We saw dignity and humility. We saw humour. What it all added up to was true sportsmanship—and, indeed, 17 gold medals, including Emma McKeon becoming our greatest Olympian.But some of the sweetest moments werent ones about outright victory. There was the extraordinary story of Peter Bol, once a refugee and an almost accidental athlete. Running fourth in the 800 metres, he lifted all of Australia. Then there was, for me, something Ill never forget: the wonderful 10,000-metre runner, Patrick Tiernan, falling over about 100 metres or so from the finish line, but getting up and making sure that he finished. There was nothing left in the tank, but there he crossed the line.Patty Mills and the Boomers showed us the sweetness of bronze. He gave that wonderful interview after the game where he said he looked forward to hanging his bronze medal at his mums and dads, who had given up so much for him to make it. He is a proud Indigenous Australian who has never forgotten where he came from, and a proud ambassador for our nation as well as his people. After that came the interview with Andrew Gaze on TV, with Andrew trying to hold back tears and then giving up, and the wonderful exuberance of feeling, quite rightly, that he was part of it—and indeed his dad, Lindsay, talking about when he began coaching, when there were just 100 or 200 registered players in basketball throughout the whole of Australia, and how that sport has been built and how this bronze medal will help to build it even further in the future.There was Nicola McDermott, soaring so magnificently to silver in the high jump—and writing in her diary after every jump, so that shes got contemporaneous notes there for the future—and Ash Moloney showing us what may be an amazing new dawn with his bronze medal in the decathlon, egged on by Cedric Dubler in the last 1,500 metres. What mateship, what commitment and what goodwill.Behind all these amazing athletes we got glimpses of sacrifices made, of myriad costs of dedication. We saw the guidance of coaches and, above all, the love and support of families. We saw those broadcasts back to rooms in Australia around the country of people cheering on their loved ones. From the bigger Australian family, may all our Olympians feel our love, our support and our gratitude. Thanks for lifting us up. Thanks for your effort. Thanks for your achievement. Thanks also to those people in the administration, including the Australian administration and, of course, the great John Coates, whos gone on to play an important role in the IOC and will always be seen, quite rightly, as an Australian representative. John, you are a good mate and you are a great Australian who has served your country and served sport well indeed.A big thanks as well to the government and the people of Japan for hosting these games. It was a big call to bring on the games and to maintain them, but youve done the world a big favour. We look forward to watching the Paralympics over coming weeks, again an incredible inspiration every time they are held. We wish all of our athletes all the best in the coming weeks.

That plan has been set out, and it focuses our efforts as a country forward. Each day, we are taking a step further, closer to that goal. Each day, we are getting further along this journey.

In addition to that, 30 lives have been lost this year to COVID, and 941 in total have been lost. Every single one of those deaths is a terrible tragedy for those families. It is a terrible tragedy. But we also know that in this country we have been able to prevent and avoid more than 30,000 deaths because of the collective actions of Australians in this country and the responses that have been put in place. Overseas, people dont just know someone who might have had COVID; they know someone who has died of COVID. In too many cases, they know many people who have died of COVID. In this country, our experience has been very different. And it hasnt just been the saving of lives which has been so paramount in our thinking as a government as we have responded, as we have continued to bring Australians together, to bring the states and territories together, as we have done throughout, on over 50 occasions over the course of this pandemic. But it has also been about saving livelihoods. There have been more than 30,000 lives saved and a million Australians back in jobs since last years COVID recession.At the end of these lockdowns, I know one thing will happen, and that is that the Australian economy will surge back. I know that because that is exactly what occurred after the last COVID recession, after the last impact. We will see how things pan out over the months ahead, but I know this: the supports that we put in to support the Australian economy—whether it was last year through JobKeeper and the COVID supplement and the cash-flow boost and the many supplements we put in place—saw the Australian economy through and ensured that we were one of the few countries in the world that had an economy larger on the other side of the pandemic than at the beginning and more people in work than before. At the same time we had prevented, through collective actions, 30,000 Australians, at least, from perishing. That puts Australia in a league amongst very few countries in the world today. It remains now for us to complete that job as we move towards the end of this year and we see 70 per cent of our country vaccinated, hopefully 80 per cent.

Its a very difficult time for Australians right now. Weve got millions of people who are in lockdown in New South Wales, in Victoria and, indeed, in Cairns today as well, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. The economy will bounce back as it has done so before. We are there providing significant economic support in partnership with the state governments. We have announced income support for workers who have lost hours of work of between $450 or $750 a week. Around $2 billion has already been paid out to around one million Australians, including 700,000 Australians who reside in New South Wales. Today, legislation passed the parliament to make those COVID disaster payments tax-free. There are now tax-free COVID disaster payments of $450 and $750.There is also business support. Today, in partnership with the Marshall government, we announced a $40 million package, around $40 million of support for around 20,000 businesses in South Australia. Businesses in the tourism sector, businesses in the hospitality sector, businesses in the recreation sector in South Australia will get economic support. Weve also reached an agreement with the Victorian government. We are providing hundreds of millions of dollars to businesses across that state. In New South Wales, we have a fifty-fifty arrangement, where businesses with a turnover of up to $250 million who have lost 30 per cent or more of turnover or seen a decline of 30 per cent or more in turnover will be eligible for payments of up to $100,000 a week. This is significant economic support and this economic support will help Australian small- and medium-size businesses get to the other side.We know that when we were facing an unemployment rate that could have reached as high as 15 per cent, our economy bounced back. Today in the most recent data it was at 4.9 per cent. We heard from the Reserve Bank just last week in its statement of monetary policy that the recovery has been quicker and stronger, and that Australias experience is that when restrictions are lifted spending recovers strongly. Weve also heard from Standard & Poors that, in its words, it doesnt expect the current lockdowns across Australia to weigh heavily on the nations AAA rating.

The member is correct: last week there were 1.33 million vaccinations in Australia. 1.33 million Australians, or almost the entire population of Adelaide, as the Prime Minister said, stepped forward to be vaccinated. We believe it is a record for vaccinations for any week for any form of vaccine in Australian history.

The things that we have done as a nation have been the rings of containment of borders, testing, tracing, distancing and vaccination.Right now, in terms of vaccination, weve reached 13.7 million total vaccinations. Thats over 9.1 million first vaccinations. What we also see is 4.6 million second vaccinations. Indeed, what weve seen now is well over seven million AstraZeneca vaccinations. I want to thank the member for Maribyrnong, who has been a very strong supporter of the AstraZeneca program. There are others whove taken different views. Hes been a strong supporter of that program.I want to thank all of those who have advocated for this vaccination program. What we are seeing is that we have now passed 75 per cent, or three-quarters, of the over-60s in this nation. Weve now passed 81 per cent of the over-70s in this nation. These vaccinations are saving lives and protecting lives. Theres more work to be done, but every week more Australians are stepping forward.

It makes a significant contribution to Australian agriculture, which is a $66 billion industry. That is despite the droughts and the reduced flows down the Murray River that that region has experienced.Because of the challenges we naturally face in Australian agriculture, we adopt technology, science and research more quickly than nearly any other industry in the country. We do this because we have to.Thats why, as part of the governments Ag2030 plan, one of the seven key pillars that were investing in—to ensure we build resilience in but also grow Australian agriculture and support the over 330,000 jobs in agriculture today—is innovation, the new pillar of Australian agriculture, and thats through some reforms of our 15 commodity research and development corporations, whether they be cotton, grains or dairy, to make sure we get back to first principles—value to the levy payer, value to the taxpayer—by removing the duplication of research across those organisations and commercialising them, getting a rate of return on the investment of over $1.1 billion a year that the Australian taxpayer and farmers contribute to having the cutting-edge technology to give our farmers the tools they need to continue to grow agriculture.Thats also about supporting it in a digital sense, and Im proud to say that we launched the growAG website. Thats about bringing together all the research that these 15 research and development corporations are producing, and not only making sure that there is no duplication but saying to the world what opportunities are here in Australia. Already we are seeing international players wanting to partner with our research and development corporations and investing in jobs here in innovation in agriculture.Were also creating physical platforms: eight drought innovation hubs, one of which is in Nichols at Dookie college. This is about making sure that we have investment in infrastructure out near our primary producers so that the extension and adoption of that technology will continue—to ensure also that they are able to dictate the type of research thats important to them, not just for drought but also through these research and development corporations, getting value for money for that $1.1 billion that is placed out there.But one of the things we havent done well is the commercialisation of the best and brightest in this world. Thats why last week we announced programs with $34 million worth of grants to incentivise those ideas—to go from ideas to actual adoption and commercialisation, to get a return that will be reinvested back into our most precious asset, our human capital, who are out there in the new pillar of agriculture.This is about putting the environment around agriculture to continue to grow and to reach its goal of $100 billion by 2030.","Agriculture Industry","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[9]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LITTLEPROUD (Maranoa—Minister for Agriculture and Northern Australia and Deputy Leader of the National Party) ","(14:43):"

The Morrison government is absolutely focused on making Australia a place that is free from violence against women and their children. We demonstrated our ongoing commitment to ending family and domestic violence in the 2021-22 budget, where we made the largest-ever commitment to womens safety with a $1.1 billion package.This work must continue, and it must continue with real recognition that home is not always a safe place to be, particularly in a global pandemic. Lockdowns and health orders across the country mean that women and their families are facing new challenges. But a lockdown does not, and should not, ever mean that you cannot escape violence. This government, through our partnerships, is continuing to provide support to vulnerable families, including direct financial support. This years budget included a new escaping violence payment, which will provide immediate financial assistance to support women leaving a violent relationship. Theres also $12.6 million for additional projects under the Safe Places initiative, to upgrade, purchase and make fit-for-purpose emergency accommodation for women and children. And we will continue to focus on initiatives like Safe Places for regional and rural women, where theres often much less access to emergency accommodation and where it can be much harder to seek help in a community where everyone knows you and you know everyone.The upcoming womens safety summit on 6 and 7 September is a very important event managed by the Minister for Women and the Minister for Womens Safety, in the other place. It will be a critical step in developing the next national plan. The summit will provide us not only with an opportunity to shine a light on the terrible violence that women from all walks of life experience but, importantly, with a chance to listen to the victim-survivors, the experts and those on the frontline, who face these awful challenges daily. The summit will discuss key issues for womens safety, including financial security, policing, the justice responses, sexual violence; and the often unique challenges facing, for example, migrant communities and Indigenous Australians. The summit will put these voices on the national stage to ensure that these experiences contribute to what must be a comprehensive and effective national plan.The Morrison government and I know this whole parliament remains resolute in the task of ending violence against women and their children, no matter what form it takes. Through our budget package, and through the next national action plan, we will all continue to work towards this goal.","Domestic and Family Violence","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[13]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms LEY (Farrer—Minister for the Environment) ","(14:59):"

Sometimes its lost that there were approximately 80 million cases last year and there have been over 120 million cases this year alone, so far, as part of a global pandemic. There were 1.8 million lives lost last year, and there have been nearly 2½ million lives lost already this year. The pandemic that so many predicted would finish within one year has accelerated and expanded globally during the course of this second year.Against that background, weve maintained, extended and expanded our long-term national health plan. As part of that, COVID protection has been fundamental; I went through some of those elements earlier on. Critically, we have put in place arguably the most significant reform of Medicare since its formation with the creation of telehealth. Over 68 million consultations have now been carried out. Thats had a profound effect on the delivery of health services around Australia not just in response to COVID but on an enduring basis. It has helped transform the way that health services will be provided to older Australians, to parents with young children and in particular to people in rural, remote and Indigenous Australia. At the same time one of the things weve had to do is ensure powerful mental health supports. Weve not seen an increase in the suicide rate, despite predictions, and thats an immense national achievement. But we have not seen a decrease in the suicide rate, despite all efforts. So theres more work to be done on that front.But what we have done is to put in place mental health support in the pandemic, which has inevitably saved lives and protected lives. That has been expanded just on the weekend with the extension of the HeadtoHelp program in Victoria and the expansion of it to New South Wales, with 10 new clinics, including seven across Sydney and three across rural and regional New South Wales. But, at the same time, weve expanded Medicare, going from $19 billion when we came in to $30 billion, $31 billion, $32 billion and $33 billion over the forward estimates. Weve seen, in the last year, 30 million diagnostic services and weve seen well over 100 million pathology services that have all saved lives and protected lives. And there has been expansion of the PBS, with a new drug commencing on 1 August: Evrysdi for spinal muscular atrophy, which will give a hundred children a chance at a better life, a longer life and a safer life.

And, of course, she has provided great support to our businesses.At the start of the pandemic, our government acted very decisively on our international borders. Without a doubt, this has helped to spare us from the worst impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we now face a significant challenge: the delta variant is one of the most significant challenges that we have had to face during this pandemic, not just here in Australia but right across the world. As we ramp up our vaccine delivery, we know that we have to remain vigilant. So while COVID-19 has certainly challenged all of us, Australias travel exemption regime has kept us safe from widespread COVID transmission and thats why our borders remain effectively closed. That being said, we cant seal ourselves off from the rest of the world. We need to bring vaccines in, we need to keep our postal links and our cargo links open, and we need skilled workers. We need those skilled workers to support our industries here in Australia. We know that, whilst we have many skilled workers here, we still need to look at bringing more skilled workers in to supplement that workforce.I want to take this opportunity now to thank the Australian Border Force for the great work they have done, day after day. They have been particularly efficient at ensuring the vital supplies like our Pfizer vaccines are expedited. This has ensured that we have been able to ramp up the delivery of our vaccine strategy, with more than a million doses now being given every week. On several days last week, there were record numbers of vaccinations.Our four-stage plan, our national plan, has set out a pathway back to normal life. We want to make sure that Australians are able to travel as freely as they possibly can, and work is now well underway, with the Australian Border Force, with the Australian Federal Police, and supported by many of our industries right across Australia, to make sure when it is appropriate and it is safe for us to open our borders we will be in a position to do so.

This inquiry was referred in February 2021, and in March we presented an interim report responding to immediate issues raised by the pandemic and how we might attract outstanding global talent to Australia.With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia shut its borders to the world. As a result, more than half a million temporary migrants left our shores. Many of those temporary migrants were skilled migrants. Net overseas migration continues to be in negative territory, with a further 77,000 people expected to leave Australia in the 2021-22 financial year. The lack of skilled migrants and near record low unemployment have resulted in major skill shortages in the Australian economy, impacting the viability of business. Even despite lockdowns, todays job ad figures are up 38 per cent on pre-COVID rates.The committee received evidence of significant skill shortages emerging in the economy during the pandemic and the importance of skilled migrants in creating more jobs for Australians. Restaurateur Chris Lucas outlined the impact skill shortages are having on his business and its ability to create jobs. He told the committee:We cant get the sushi chefs so we cant open the restaurant at all. Every sushi master that comes into the restaurant trains another five or six young Australian chefs, so its starting to impact on our ability to train local people, to bring them up to local standard.In order to address critical labour shortages during the pandemic, the government established the Priority Migration Skilled Occupation List, or PMSOL. In the interim report, the committee recommended that the government include a broader range of occupations on the PMSOL, including veterinarians, chefs and civil and electrical engineers. The government implemented these recommendations and have added more than 20 occupations to the PMSOL.The final report builds on the interim report and seeks to place the skilled migration program in context. The final report considers whether the skilled migration settings are serving Australias interests, and its tradition of being selective about who we take in, while ensuring businesses can get the skills they need. Skilled migration is one of the policy levers that governments can use to address skill shortages. Other levers include higher education, vocational education and employment services programs. Andrew Kotzur, CEO of Kotzur silo manufacturers in regional New South Wales, told the committee:Migration, including skilled migration, is only one part—albeit an important one—of the solution. Business and government also need to work together to grow the skills base, to reduce other constraints—lets call that the red tape—and improve the productivity of our existing labour and capital assets. The inflexibility, complexity and cost of the current migration system means it is less efficient and less effective than it could be.The committee found that there needs to be greater coordination of effort across governments and across jurisdictions to clearly identify and quantify labour shortages and put in place the most appropriate policy response to address them. The committee recommends the development of a national workforce plan led by a cross-jurisdictional interagency committee to provide a more comprehensive picture of workforce gaps in our economy.Another key issue that emerged during the inquiry was the role of the skilled occupation lists that underpin Australias skilled migration program. Such lists need to be more flexible and responsive to workforce shortages. Its become clear that the Australia and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations, better known as ANZSCO, which was never designed to be used for the skilled migration program, is out of date, not fit for purpose and should be replaced by an alternative system to be developed by the National Skills Commission.The committee heard that businesses are missing out on skilled migrants who may choose countries where the pathway to permanent residency is clearer. Ron Curry, from the Interactive Games and Entertainment Association, told the committee:The fact that these kinds of roles do not lead to permanent residency makes hiring senior and niche talent exceedingly difficult. The prospect of having to leave the country after a relatively short amount of time is less than enticing, in particular for the kind of senior talent that mightve come with families.The committee therefore recommends providing skilled migrants a clearer pathway to permanency but with conditions and length of time to permanency varying depending on skill level. The committee has addressed issues around the administration of the skilled migration program. Weve recommended more incentives for migrants to move to regional Australia; encouragement for the brightest international students to remain to address persistent skill shortages; and streamlining processes and service improvements in the Department of Home Affairs.I note that Labor have not dissented from this report, but they play politics in their additional comments. Labors comments show theyre not interested in regional Australia or the industries most affected by the economic impact of the pandemic. Labor remain divided on the no more migrants dog whistling of Senator Keneally and the prioritise every non-economic migrant of the member for Bruce. The coalition have spent years cleaning up Labors mess. Labors record on migration is bad, and we wont be taking advice from them.Finally I want to take the opportunity to thank all my committee colleagues and everyone who has made a submission, assisted with a site visit or given evidence to this inquiry, as well as the secretariat and Annie Phillips from my office, for their work on this report. I commend the report to the House.","Migration Joint Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LEESER (Berowra) ","(15:19):"
222,0,0,0,1,1,"Hill, Julian, MP",86256,"Bruce","ALP","N/A",7773," by leave—Ill keep my remarks as brief as possible but note that Im speaking on behalf of the deputy chair and all other Labor members of the committee, and there is no opportunity in the Federation Chamber. At the outset, I thank the chair. I really want to make four points. Labor members agree with most although not all of the report, but thats not saying much. The first point is what a missed opportunity this report is. Australia has right now a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform our migration program. The borders wont stay shut forever and neither should they, but, true to form, the government have squibbed it with this report. The report into skilled migration is a missed opportunity to rethink the program for when the borders open, to attract younger, highly skilled migrants and boost Australias long-term economic prospects and wealth and get wages moving again. The recommendations, as outlined, are reactive, piecemeal administrative tinkering overall, lacking deep thought and real change—setting up a new committee, changing one coding system for another. People could well view this inquiry, at its worst, as a low-rent complaint shop run by the government to make it easier for employers to bring in migrants, yet doing nothing to boost Australian wages or our long-term national wealth.Australia is a nation built great by migration—permanent skilled migration overwhelmingly—and that should continue. Yet the government has not taken this as an opportunity for any deep thinking. Most tellingly, the report is completely and totally silent on the most substantive, thoughtful submission we received, from the Grattan Institute. I dont agree with all their ideas, but at least it was a deep attempt to provide an intellectual rigour and evidence based argument to boost the economic value Australia gets from migration.I do support most of the recommendations about regional migration. I think it was a bit of a cheap shot from the chair—whom I consider a friend and who is actually a terrific chair of this committee—to suggest that Labor is not supportive of doing more for regional migration. But the report fails to address the integrity concerns regarding the global talent investment visa, which has been described by a former deputy secretary of immigration as a cronies dream. The Grattan Institute also raised concerns regarding this program. It needs evaluation.The second point I want to make is that this report is a remarkable and blatant repudiation by government members of Peter Duttons tenure as minister for immigration. Its a complete reversal of his changes to skilled migration and a vindication of Labors criticism. Ill just point to three issues. Government members, rightly, have recommended restoring pathways to permanent migration. This is a huge shift in policy, ensuring that skilled visa holders can settle permanently in this country, send their kids to school, get an education, join their local community, start doing business and build careers. We heard from business after business, in regions and cities, how ridiculous it was that people could come here on some kind of permanent insecurity underclass program that leaves them vulnerable to exploitation and holds down wages. To their credit, the government members listened and rolled the former ministers changes. Secondly, they recommended fixing the confusion in the skills shortages lists, consolidating them back into one list and also, I hope, helping to deal with the lack of transparency about the rent-seeking mystery of who ends up on the list or not.Thirdly—and this is my personal favourite—they recommended bringing back good old-fashioned customer service, having human beings available to liaise with industry and assist applicants with complex cases. OMG! It is long overdue but can only be achieved with additional resources, reversing some of the massive cuts—thousands of staff cut—by this government over many years, which the report conveniently fails to mention. It is constantly bemusing in committees, including this one, to watch government MPs get frustrated with public servants because they dont have the resources, yet they never take responsibility for the cuts that theyve made. They fail to join the dots. The Public Service is not a magic pudding. Its a critical national institution that the government should steward and invest in, not attack and cut.Also—and I wont dwell on this—there have been the TAFE cuts. We need to invest more in the training system. TAFE is not doing its job. Thats why we need migrants. Thats what the evidence says. The government members never want to talk about the $3 billion of cuts to TAFE from Tony Abbott as Prime Minister onwards. If we could insert emojis into Hansard, at this point Id choose the eye roll and the facepalm. It is disappointing but telling that government members did not rule out privatisation or outsourcing of the visa system, and its disappointing that throughout the inquiry government members kept pushing for more foreign workers to be allowed in at the expense of stranded Australians. I acknowledge theres a skills shortage in many parts of the country; no question, thats what the evidence says. But what I dont accept is that we write a blank cheque to foreign workers at the expense of 38,000 stranded Australians. Thats the equation and thats the trade-off that they dont want to acknowledge.The third point is the most shocking revelation throughout the inquiry, and that is that no government department seems to know anything about or has done any analysis of the impact of temporary migration on Australian wages—nothing, zip, just blank looks. Home Affairs employment just looked confused. The Temporary Skilled Migration Income Threshold is the minimum salary you have to pay a temporary skilled migrant. Its been frozen for eight long years under this government, since the Prime Minister started off as the minister, at $53,900. Its a damaging freeze thats put downward pressure on wages, especially at the lower end of the market. Evidence was presented and there was significant media commentary throughout the inquiry. The Reserve Bank of Australia Governor talked about the impact of the migration program on wages. The McKell Institute issued a report. Freezing wages for eight long years creates not a floor in wages but a ceiling on wages for Australian workers and temporary work visa holders alike across several sectors, as the National Skills Commission data showed. The gap between the TSMIT and annual average wages is now $26,000. Thats what happens when you freeze it. Its a gap of $26,000, which makes it far more attractive in many sectors to hire a temporary work visa holder, rather than an Australian worker—not everywhere, but in too many sectors.Labor believes that Australias post-pandemic migration program must deliver genuine highly skilled migrants, who are properly paid. It goes to the composition of the program. This is not an antimigrant comment. It goes to the composition of the program, which this report just didnt tackle. The committee, sort of to its credit, I think at the insistence of Labor members throughout the inquiry, was embarrassed into recommending a gradual increase in the TSMIT. That is a big shift, but its not nearly enough. Theyve had a report from their own hand-picked expert since 2017, which theyve failed to act on, saying raise and index the TSMIT. Significantly raising the TSMIT and ensuring its ongoing indexation would act as a safeguard against the types of temporary migrant worker exploitation and wage stagnation that have become systemic features of the pre-COVID labour market—deliberate features.Predictably government members proposed to relax labour market testing in multiple places throughout the report. Labor members do not agree with the extent of the governments weakening of this important regime to ensure Australians always get a first go at jobs. We do acknowledge in the report—and this is a shift for us—the case in limited circumstances while the borders are closed for a change, and we pointed to those. Its not true to say what has been alleged by the government. But this is part of the Morrison governments ongoing push to undermine labour market testing, reducing incentives for business to employ Australian workers.The final point is on international students. We welcome ideas to improve post-study work rights and pathways to permanency for the highest-performing international students in a critical skills shortage area. Its a little bit academic, given the state of the sector with the borders closed, but thats for another debate. Were especially pleased that the report acknowledges the situation of the current international student graduates, 485 visa holders, who are stuck offshore. Their visas are going to expire before they can use them. Labor members raised these issues with the department through the inquiry. These young people have made an investment in our country, and they were made a promise by our country of post-study work rights in return. With the borders closed, theyre stuck offshore and theres no commitment—just radio silence from the government—to extend or allow renewal of the visas when they can safely come back. This is incredibly damaging to Australias reputation in what was our fourth-biggest export sector, and denies Australia a proven source of highly skilled and well adapted young migrants. Australia can do much better by these graduates, and the government must urgently address this issue.I thank the chair for the way he conducted the inquiry. As was noted, we agree with most of the recommendations, but theyre a massive missed opportunity. I do not accept and strongly reject the characterisation that Labor is somehow anti-regions or anti-regional skilled workers. Weve done our best in good faith to acknowledge those points, but the government have to acknowledge the trade-off with stranded Australians because of their failure to build quarantine facilities and failure to secure enough vaccines.","Migration Joint Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HILL (Bruce) ","(15:25):"
223,0,0,0,1,1,"Drum, Damian, MP",56430,"Nicholls","Nats","N/A",7776," by leave—I would like to thank the chair, Mr Julian Leeser, for the work he did as chair of this committee. Its an important report and the inquiry certainly got out into the regions, which was worthy. Certainly the information that we were able to take in as evidence was very important when it came to putting the recommendations together. I would also like to thank my coalition colleagues and my Labor colleagues in this committee. As I think most people in this House would understand when it comes to skilled migration and unskilled migration, the Labor Party come from a long way away from where we need to be. When we talked to businesses and industries about the actual real need that we have, it was always a struggle to reach a medium where we could actually move forward with policy.However, I think the report lands in a pretty good space. It talks largely about how we can make it easier in relation to areas such as market testing. Right now in Australia, when a business needs to get a sheet metal worker, a diesel mechanic or another specialist in, they have to advertise in print, and the print advertisement in the local papers costs thousands and thousands of dollars. They have to do that for 28 days. Its quite ridiculous, when you can simply go onto seek.com and see that there are 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000 vacancies for these positions.We spent a lot of the time understanding why these provisions are in place, where we have to prove what everybody in Australia already knows: there is an incredible shortage in certain sectors in the employment sphere. Right now if you go online and pull up chefs, you will see that there are around 5,000 vacancies in Australia. There are about 3½ thousand vacancies for restaurant managers. Yet, if anybody wants to bring an overseas worker in for either of those two areas, they have to advertise for a month in their local newspaper, at a cost of thousands and thousands of dollars. Its ridiculous. When we put that to the Department of Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business, they rejected the idea that they should have a better understanding of the various sectors right throughout regional Australia or in fact metropolitan Australia. We made recommendations in that regard.I think the real understanding is that the pathways to permanency provisions that we have put in place will benefit Australia greatly. There is the realisation that the employment situation in so many different sectors is completely different in regional Australia to what it is in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. This goes to so many of the trades. Tradies can be expensive in Melbourne and Sydney, but at least you can get one. You put an advert in the paper or you go on seek.com and you fill that position relatively easily. In the regions, its not like that, and this report highlights, through the evidence that we were able to receive, that disparity.I again want to acknowledge the chair. I want to acknowledge the way that the Labor Party, even though they start from a long way away, have worked hard—Maria Vamvakinou, as the deputy chair, and Julian Hill—and come together to put the report in a way so that we can move forward and accept the report as a whole. I thank the committee for its work.","Migration Joint Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DRUM (Nicholls—Chief Nationals Whip) ","(15:34):"

This government has a problem with transparency. It has a problem with rorting taxpayer funds. It has a problem every time the parliament says that there should be more transparency, as those opposite reject those efforts. And so it is the case when it comes to the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Amendment (Improved Grants Reporting) Bill 2021. This bill is the private senators bill of my colleague Senator Gallagher. Right there in the title is all were trying to achieve with this private senators bill, with this bill before the House that should be considered immediately. All it does is require the government, where a minister has made an allocation of money that is contrary to departmental advice, to notify the finance minister within 30 days of that and for that to then be tabled in the parliament within five sitting days of that being received.This is not an especially onerous ask for a government that isnt up to its neck in rorts. This is the most wasteful government in this country since Federation. It is a government that has a serial problem with serial rorting. We know why the government doesnt want a bar of this bill. We know why it wants to put it on the never-never. We know why it doesnt want it considered immediately. Its because the issues with this government—with rorting, with a lack of transparency—go all the way to the Prime Minister and his office. Thats one of the key lessons weve learned from all the interrogation in the Senate—again, a credit to Senator Gallagher and the team over there in the Senate; a credit to the member for Ballarat when it comes to the car parks program, and a credit to the member for Scullin and others who have done their best to shine a light on the serial misuse of public money that we see on a regular basis when it comes to those opposite.As the member for Ballarat said in question time today, when she was asking the Prime Minister to justify all of this rorting, particularly when it comes to car parks, this Prime Minister said five times in a 50-second span that the ministers make decisions about the allocation of this public money. If the ministers make those decisions, then surely the Australian people need, deserve and have a right to expect that those decisions are reported in a timely way. The reason this Prime Minister and this government dont want that to happen, whether its in this House or in the Senate, is that they know the Prime Minister himself is up to his neck in these rorts.When the Prime Minister was answering the member for Ballarats question, he talked about a hunting licence. A hunting licence is a budget term for when an expenditure review committee delegates a decision to a minister. Its called a hunting licence for the minister to go away and make a decision and to justify that decision to the ERC. What were really talking about here isnt a hunting licence; were talking about a licence to rort. The current arrangements—encouraged, given succour by this Prime Minister—are a licence to rort. All we are trying to do here, with this legislation, with this bill, is to say that, when a minister makes a decision contrary to departmental advice, it is reported in a timely way so that the parliament can consider it—in the hope that a minister who is about to make a dodgy decision of the kind that so many of those opposite have made on such a regular basis would think twice about it if they knew it would be reported to the parliament. Those opposite dont want a bar of it because of the Prime Ministers own involvement.Im not talking here, unfortunately, about a nod and a wink or anything like that. We know from our questioning and from the forensic work of our colleagues here and in the other place that a lot of this work—the colour coded spreadsheets, the marginal seats, the shovelling of money in the direction of vulnerable sitting members—has been a climate, an arrangement, which has been fostered by the Prime Minister from the beginning. Thats what were discovering more and more about.This government has never seen a bucket of public money that it didnt want to rort. The list now is getting embarrassingly long for those opposite: sports rorts; dodgy land deals; the rorting of the Safer Communities Fund, if you can believe it; billions of dollars of JobKeeper money being sprayed around on already profitable companies that didnt need help, at the same time as the government was refusing to step in and help those small businesses that genuinely needed help. When you think about the most egregious revelations—in recent times, anyway—about the car park rorts, then you do see a pattern of behaviour here. The parliament needs to take steps to rein in this kind of rorting.Lest the public think that this is a problem limited to one minister or another minister, that its maybe now the education minister or maybe Minister Fletcher and not a widespread problem—Ive already talked about the Prime Ministers own involvement—then think about the Treasurer. When the Treasurer was under pressure, or thought he was under pressure in his own seat at the last election—this has been uncovered in the last couple of months—he promised millions of dollars for a train station that shortly wouldnt exist. This is the kind of madness that has prevailed amongst those opposite as they clamber all over each other to try and rort these buckets of public money for their own base electoral and political benefit. Thats why this bill is necessary, and thats why the second reading should be considered immediately.You dont have to be long in this place to hear the lectures, the rubbish in lecturing tones, from those opposite about the fiscal position, about the budget position. Those opposite printed the mugs that said they were back in black, despite the fact that they have delivered eight deficits now and the Intergenerational report says there are going to be 40 more, consecutively, and despite the fact that they multiplied the levels of debt so as to describe them as a debt and deficit disaster, when they were a mere fraction of current debt levels. We get all these lectures from those opposite about economic responsibility and budget responsibility at the same time as theyre shovelling out money, spraying money all over the place in the least responsible manner in order to protect their own political prospects. With this kind of rorting and this kind of spending, its no wonder this country is a trillion dollars in debt for the first time in his history. With this kind of wasteful spending, this kind of irresponsibility and this kind of rorting, no wonder this country doesnt have enough to show for the trillion dollars of debt that those opposite have racked up. So spare us the lectures about economic responsibility, when it seems like day after day after day we hear a new revelation about the wasteful rorting of taxpayer dollars for base political purposes.The reason we want this considered now is that the time has long passed since this government, and future governments, deserved a dose of transparency to try and prevent the kind of situation that, under those opposite, we are seeing emerge with the encouragement of the Prime Minister. Whether its sports rorts or land rorts or safer communities or JobKeeper or car parks, the pattern of behaviour that exists in this government puts at risk public faith in this place, public faith in politics and public faith in Australians own democracy. That faith, that trust, is not exactly thick on the ground at the moment, as you might have noticed, Deputy Speaker Andrews. What we need to do in this place is work out what meaningful changes we can make to make sure that this spending is a little bit more transparent, that people have to justify decisions when they knock back departmental advice, so that ministers will think twice before taking the kinds of decisions that we have seen come to light in recent weeks and recent months—really, since the Prime Minister took office a couple of years ago.It says it all about this government that they dont want a bar of this bill. It says it all about this government that they are trying their best to protect their Prime Minister, their cabinet ministers and others from the kind of scrutiny that Australians have a right to expect and that Australians deserve. Its their money. Their money should be directed towards the right kinds of purposes in the national interest and not just in the political interest of a government which has become addicted to rorting taxpayer funds.","Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Amendment (Waiver of Debt and Act of Grace Payments) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr CHALMERS (Rankin) ","(15:40):"

228,0,0,0,1,1,"King, Catherine, MP","00AMR","Ballarat","ALP","N/A",7780," I second the amendment. This is an important debate, and I think it is telling that the government is so unwilling to actually have a debate about the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Amendment (Waiver of Debt and Act of Grace Payments) Bill 2019. It is telling because we know the reason the government doesnt want to debate this bill, doesnt want to see greater transparency in its decision-making and doesnt want an independent anticorruption commission, is that it is up to its neck in rorting. That is what we have seen over the course of the last eight years of this government, in particular, through the efforts of the Australian National Audit Office, an incredible, important institution in this countrys democracy which the government has sought to reduce the funding for. What weve seen from the Australian National Audit Office is that there is a very significant problem that this government has with the way in which it uses taxpayer funding.The bill that we are seeking to bring on for second reading debate here makes a minor change. Its not a massive change in terms of transparency, but it is an important one. The change its seeking to make is that, where ministers make a decision to allocate funds to a project in their own electorate or they take a decision that is against the recommendation of their own department, within 30 days they report that to the Minister for Finance—they are actually required to report that now, but theres no time limit on when they need to do that—and the Minister for Finance then, within five sitting days, tables that report in the parliament. Its an important way of getting transparency, because it provides a bit of a handbrake on ministers to think. If you are going to make a decision like that, which benefits you personally in your own electorate, as weve seen in the cases of airport rorts, sports rorts, community safety rorts, regional rorts or car park rorts; if you are going to make a decision that goes counter to the recommendations of your own department; or if you are going to make a recommendation that significantly advantage you electorally then you need to be accountable to the parliament for that, because it can take months and months and months for those letters to the Minister for Finance to ever see the light of day. Sometimes its literally years before they see the light of day. By shortening that time frame, it is saying to ministers: If youre going to make that decision, thats the decision youre going to make. But you need to tell the parliament that you have made that decision within that shorter time frame—within the month to five days in terms of the sitting period.The reasons we need to see these sorts of changes, the reasons we need an independent anticorruption commission and the reasons this bill itself is so important are the lengths this government has decided to go to in order to rort taxpayers funds. We saw it in the portfolio I represent. It started with the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages, basically a program, again, with no guidelines, millions of dollars of money going out the door, no process for application and no clear transparency about why decisions were being made. There were some questions the Audit Office started to ask about that program. Weve all seen it in the Building Better Regions Fund, a program that the Audit Office is currently investigating and due to report in May next year. Weve seen the way theyve used that.You only have to listen to the speakers on the other side of the chamber when it comes to budget time. They get up time after time and they say, I want to thank the minister for this project, this project and this project. Have a listen to some of our people who cant say the same things, because they know that that money is constantly going into Liberal Party and National Party seats at the expense of Labor Party and other seats.But then, of course, you look at the Urban Congestion Fund. This isnt just a small amount of money. Sports rorts was bad enough—the colour coded spreadsheets. A minister lost her job over it but now has been rehabilitated. You really have to question how on earth thats happened—seriously. We saw that with sports rorts, but what weve seen with the Urban Congestion Fund is that the government didnt learn from that. Okay, weve got a lesson here. We need to be more transparent, we need to be more careful about how we are making decisions, we need to be more equitable about how we make decisions across geographical areas in the country. What they learned for the Urban Congestion Fund is lets not have any process at all. Theres no process at all. Blatantly, before an election campaign, they used this funding as a way in which to garner votes, particularly in seats that they were worried about or seats that they were targeting.This fund in particular, the Urban Congestion Fund, is $4.7 billion worth of funding. Its not the $200 million that we saw in sports rorts. Its not even the $250 million we see in the Building Better Regions Fund. Its a $4.7 billion program that the government have made 177 decisions under. Part of that program was the subject of the audit report—the car parks rorts. What we saw in that is that, despite the fact that Treasury officials were telling the government, You need to have a proper set of guidelines, you need eligibility criteria, you need to actually run a proper process for this, the government ignored all of that advice and basically took a decision on 20 marginal seats. It canvassed those projects between the Prime Ministers office and Minister Tudge. It went out to Liberal Party candidates in the election campaign and asked them what car parks they wanted in their seats; went to patron senators, as the Liberal Party calls them, and asked them what projects they wanted in their seats; and targeted these 20 marginal seats. There were multiple emails between the Prime Ministers office and the minister, deciding on these projects. The department recommends a number and says, We havent talked to all the states. Weve talked to New South Wales; theyve said there are a couple of car parks here. From what weve seen in the public domain about where urban congestion is, these are some areas where the fund might help. The government ignores all of that and basically decides on these 20 marginal seats for the projects.It goes to the heart of the Prime Ministers offices decision-making. It goes absolutely to the heart of the corruption that sits within this government. This is rorting on an industrial scale, and they will keep doing it unless we put measures in place such as those in this bill and we have an independent anticorruption commission—because what have they learnt in the course of the last eight years? Theyve learnt that this works. If we keep pork-barrelling and rorting into these seats, we might win some of them. Thats what theyve learnt. The only way we can teach this government the lesson that this is not okay, that this is fundamentally undermining the democracy that we so care about, is to vote them out of office. But, until we can do that, putting in place measures such as this bill, sensibly moved by Senator Gallagher—and it should be debated and voted on in this place now—is the only opportunity weve got to say to this government, You need to do better and there needs to be greater transparency in your decision-making.If this government had spent as much time getting the vaccine rollout right as it has rorting public money, we wouldnt be in the sort of mess were in when it comes to getting out of COVID-19. There is a saying in public health and in the medical sphere—and, more broadly, about transparency—that the best disinfectant is sunlight. And that is what this bill tries to do. It tries to shine a light on the decision-making of ministers and make them accountable for the decisions that theyre making, make sure that theyre not seeking to hide decisions around recommendations that theyre making and make sure that the parliament has an early opportunity to know about those decisions that are against departmental recommendations, in a way that hopefully puts a brake on some of the excesses that we have seen.Were not talking, as I said, about a small number of projects here or there; we are talking about billions of dollars of taxpayers money. Whether its $30 million in the Leppington Triangle scandal, whether its the $600 million in the car parks scandal, whether its the $4.7 billion that I can bet your bottom dollar this government is going to rort again as it comes up into the next election or whether its the millions of dollars of the community safety fund, this government is addicted to rorting public money, and we need to shine a light on it now.","Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Amendment (Waiver of Debt and Act of Grace Payments) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat) ","(15:50):"

I mentioned then that I would also continue, in my contribution today, to speak specifically about higher education and universities.A couple of weeks ago—in fact, the Friday before the last parliamentary sitting—I attended the 30th anniversary of Edith Cowan University. I have three degrees from Edith Cowan University, and my brother gently reminded me that he also graduated from Edith Cowan University, so I must say that it is the Aly family university of choice. It is such a feat for the university to celebrate 30 years in the same year that we celebrate the 100th anniversary of Edith Cowan being elected to the parliament of Western Australia. As part of their celebrations, I attended a gala concert at the Perth Concert Hall that was put on by students of the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts at Edith Cowan University. It was such an amazing event. It was a fantastic event. The closing piece of that evening was a spectacular performance put together by a WA Academy of Performing Arts student. The title of the piece was Transformation. It reminded me of how my own life, as well as the lives of many of the young people I meet, has been transformed by education.I want to congratulate Edith Cowan University not just on that event but on reaching 30 years and really growing to the extent that they have. But juxtaposed against that wonderful celebration of 30 years was an announcement made just before that by the University of Western Australia that they were effectively cutting their social sciences offerings, meaning they would no longer be offering anthropology or sociology, among other social sciences, either as a degree or as a research area. The result of that will not just be felt in the 16 or so full-time jobs to be lost at that university. I was moved by the number of people who contacted me about this: academics, of course, especially those who come from the humanities; former graduates, of course, who understand the value of a humanities degree; students who were studying anthropology and sociology; and would-be students—young people who aspire to study a degree in the humanities and have a clear talent and passion for it.In response to that, I wrote an opinion piece that was published in the West Australian. In that opinion piece I drew attention to this governments eight-year-long undermining of universities and, in particular, the humanities. There has been absolute destruction of higher education—our universities as well as our TAFEs—and, specifically, ideological shadow boxing against the humanities. I was shocked when I found out that the former Minister for Education had taken it upon himself to veto ARC grants in the humanities, placing himself above a panel of discipline-specific experts—many of whom are professors, many of whom have done decades of research and earned international reputations in their own right—and placing himself above a college of experts, who deemed those grants worthy of funding, to veto those grants.Those opposite seem to think that anthropologists and sociologists engage in navel-gazing activities where they clamour to write dissertations and study frivolous things like the migratory patterns of Argentinian ants or the relevance of the apostrophe in modern-day Tajikistan. Thats not the case at all. Anthropologists and sociologists contribute so much. Their work is absolutely central, and has been central, to the management of pandemics. They played a vital role in the management of the Ebola virus outbreak. They understand human behaviour and human responses to pandemics, to government messaging and to policy.It would be remiss of me to not stand and speak on these bills that we support, because they make it easier, because they make education more accessible, specifically for our overseas students, and because they give some relief to those education providers. But we stand here and support these bills against a backdrop of a continuous eight-year attack on universities—one that has seen $3 billion in revenue lost. By the end of this year there will be $18 billion lost from our economy, from our education sector. Education has gone from being a $40 billion export to being a $22 billion export.Its true that we have always been faced with harsh competition from like nations such as the UK, Canada and the US in attracting overseas students to study in Australia. For as long as I can remember, from my days of teaching ELICOS and attracting students to come to Australia to study English as a pathway to a university degree in Australia, weve grappled with these questions about how we make Australia a competitive nation for overseas students, and we have proven our place in the world landscape as a destination of choice for international students. We currently have 200,000 students stuck overseas with little or no hope of getting here and completing their degrees because we dont have proper, fit-for-purpose quarantine facilities that would enable that.I notice that many speakers who have contributed here have talked about universities pivoting to online learning. When I was teaching I always taught online as well as face to face, and I know that you cannot completely replace face-to-face learning with online delivery, particularly for some courses where students need to be in a lab. You also cannot deliver quality teaching without quality research; you simply cannot. If we want to grow and develop the minds of the future that will go on and contribute to the industries of the future, we need to make sure that our teaching at universities is up to date with industry trends and world trends. You simply cannot expect our world-class education system to remain world class if you cut research, if you undermine ARC grants or if you take away ARC grants that were justly assessed by a college of experts because you dont like the title of the grant and you have no understanding of the content of that particular research program.I will end on a point that was made by previous speakers. This point really demonstrates the governments contempt for higher education, particularly for universities. Its demonstrated not just in their undermining of the humanities. Its demonstrated not just in their ideological battle against the social sciences and the humanities. Its demonstrated not just in their cuts to universities. Its demonstrated not just in their failure to ensure quarantine facilities are there so that overseas students can return to universities and it can be back to business as usual. If there is anything that demonstrates the governments contempt for higher education and for universities it is the fact that they changed the rules for JobKeeper three times so universities could not get it. It is the fact that, since the pandemic began, they have presided over 18,000 job losses in one sector alone—and not in just any sector but in one of our largest export sectors, a sector in which Australia has enjoyed a very proud and strong international reputation. So, while we support these bills, we will continue to hold the government to account for their absolutely disgraceful undermining of the university sector.","Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Cost Recovery and Other Measures) Bill 2021, Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (Charges) Amendment Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALY (Cowan) ","(16:10):"
232,0,0,0,1,1,"Coker, Elizabeth, MP",263547,"Corangamite","ALP","N/A",7786," [by video link] I rise to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021, because of the importance overseas students play not only in my electorate of Corangamite but also across our nation. Overseas students are so important to Deakin University and to my region as a whole. This bill does a number of things around cost-recovery, charges and the associated regulations for overseas students. Amongst other things, the bill updates the registration charges to recover costs for certain regulatory activities under the ESOS Act. The bill also establishes new registration charges consistent with the Australian Government Charging Framework. But there is a sad irony associated with this bill and its timing, because, on the one hand, the Morrison government wants to streamline the charging framework for overseas students attending Australian universities but, on the other hand, it makes it almost impossible for these overseas students to attend our universities. I will return to this point, but first I want to detail some context around overseas students in our region and the importance of Deakin University.Deakin University had over 13,000 overseas students. I said had because, of course, this number of overseas students has been slashed. Its been decimated to virtually zero by COVID and the actions—or should I say inactions—of the Morrison government. In large part this has been due to the hopeless failure of the Morrison government to establish a robust quarantine system that would facilitate an early re-entry of overseas students. Overseas students are vital to my regions economy and to many regional economies, to our diverse cultural life and to getting the worlds best and brightest people to stay in our region into the future. The education of overseas students is a major job creation engine in our region. This bill adds a whole lot of detail around the regulation and charging of overseas students, but what is the point of it if there are no overseas students? I ask all members to think about that question. The real tragedy is that all the job losses didnt have to happen. All these university job losses resulted from a deliberate decision by the Morrison government not to take responsibility for quarantine and not to support Australias university sector overall.The Morrison government, astoundingly, decided that the university sector would be excluded from JobKeeper but that the likes of Gerry Harvey, or Harvey Norman, would be included. How could any responsible government do that? How could they? I note recent figures from the independent Parliamentary Budget Office which show that 157,650 Australian employers who received JobKeeper support had turnover rise during that period compared to the same in 2019. In just three months these employers accrued $4.6 billion in taxpayer funded wage subsidies. If just half of that $4.6 billion had been supplied to the university sector, there would not have been job losses. This massive brain drain and the huge economic blow to Australia and our region would have been avoided.I would like to acknowledge Dr Alison Barnes from the NTEU, who said recently:For a small portion of the JobKeeper money that was wasted on corporate handouts to profitable companies, we could have saved the 21,000 jobs lost from higher education.Yes indeed. I want that figure on the parliamentary record: 21,000 jobs lost in the Australian university sector because of some weird agenda by the Morrison government to punish universities—21,000 Australian jobs lost. And that is not the end of it; it continues. Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, has said that the sector is estimated to lose a further 5.5 per cent, or $2 billion, in 2021 alone.And this is not where punishment of the Australia university sector by the Morrison government ends. Theres even more—a lot more. Everyone in this chamber would remember the tortuous path of the higher education support amendment bill. The bill cut another billion dollars in Australian government expenditure to Australian universities. And of course it hugely punished Australian students interested in pursuing careers in the arts and humanities, doubling already-high fees and saddling our youth with even higher levels of debt. Overall, that piece of legislation increased already-high costs to students by seven per cent. Forty per cent of students had to cop increased fees, some by as much as 113 per cent. Arts and business students will now leave university with debts averaging between $40,000 and $50,000 for a normal degree. What a disgraceful attack on students because they wish to pursue a career in humanities. The respected academic and university policy analyst Andrew Norton put it very simply:A future education minister is going to have to fix these problems.Too true.The Australian university sector is bleeding profusely, and Deakin University is no exception. This is largely due to the Liberal governments funding cutbacks, the absence of overseas students and the refusal of the Morrison government to provide support to the sector when they desperately need it. JobKeeper was the sad example of this. The Morrison government has been consistently rigid in its refusal to allow universities to access JobKeeper, and it makes no sense. We are proud of the quality education our universities provide; they are the engine room of regional employment and an important economic driver. Instead, under the Morrison government we see universities hurting and shedding jobs. For Deakin University, this has resulted in more than 300 jobs lost. At the time, I spoke out about these job losses in the local media. These job losses have devastated morale for many at Deakin University and have left many local families facing difficult times during this pandemic. Casualisation of the university workforce makes it even harder to keep your job, because those who arent tenured are the first to lose their jobs.It is sad that casualisation of the workforce under the Morrison government has escalated to alarming proportions—it is really staggering. I do want to give a shout-out to all the employees at Deakin University. You are doing an amazing job in these very challenging times. What you need is a federal government that cares about you and cares about our education system, our university sector. While this bill deals with a lot of the detail about the regulation of overseas students, there are virtually no overseas students to apply this bill to. To me, it feels exactly like fiddling while Rome is burning. I will leave you with that thought. We on the Labor side will support this bill, but we do not support the attack on the university sector. We are alarmed by it. We will fight it. When we come into government, we will fix it.Finally, the struggling university sector is just another pointer to the Morrison governments fundamental failures. A pointer to one of their fundamental failures is the two tasks they had during this COVID crisis. The first is the failure to effectively roll out vaccines. The second is the Morrison governments failure to establish a high-quality quarantine system. Thats what we need to get the university sector back on its feet, thats what we need to get overseas students back into our universities, and thats what we need to help our regional economies to get moving again. This is what the Prime Minister should be focused on. Instead, the Morrison government is totally failing Deakin University and the whole Australian university sector. This is not vision. Its not leadership. Universities need a government that believes in their vitality and the significant role they and our TAFE sector play in equipping us all for the future. Only a change of government will deliver such an outcome. It is certainly time for that change.","Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Cost Recovery and Other Measures) Bill 2021, Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (Charges) Amendment Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms COKER (Corangamite) ","(16:21):"
233,0,0,0,1,1,"Hill, Julian, MP",86256,"Bruce","ALP","N/A",7788," The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 is part of a set of cognate bills and other so-called reforms to impose a cost recovery model on the sector. As has been said in previous debates and again in this debate, this is the very worst possible time you could pick to shift a sector to cost recovery. In the previous debate, on the related TEQSA bill, even government speakers acknowledged that providers are paying about 15 per cent of the costs. At the very time that students are not able to come to Australia and university revenues are being smashed, the government wants to move the sector to 100 per cent cost recovery.This bill—no doubt the government will try to tell us this bill is a great thing—throws a tiny, tiny crumb to the international education sector by fiddling around with the charges, which should give them the princely saving of about $7 million a year. That sounds nice, doesnt it? But, firstly, the impact is largely irrelevant given the scale of damage to the sector; its lost literally billions of dollars of revenue. Secondly, the impact is actually unknown. Peak irony: the government, in this bill, is giving $7 million of fee relief through the CRICOS registration charges and yet, in the other bill, is increasing charges for full cost recovery by a much larger and indeed unknown amount. So I dont know how any provider or university, private or public, could bank this saving without having a clue whats coming down the pipeline in the TEQSA changes. Its truly ridiculous. The sector has unprecedented financial challenges. The government is giving on one hand and taking more with the other.International education was—I say was, sadly, in the past sense—Australias fourth biggest export sector, worth over $40 billion to our economy. More than that, international education has enriched our cities and regions; its made our campuses more vibrant and diverse. Its been an incredible national success story, something we as a country should be so proud of—that hundreds of thousands of young people, at that time in their life, have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars, in some cases, to come and study and live in our community. Its increased our soft power, over decades, incalculably.COVID has decimated this sector—our fourth-largest export sector, decimated by COVID. Some damage, of course, was unavoidable, with the borders shut. This is a sector—one of the service sectors—that relies on the movement of human beings and was always going to suffer damage. But the scale of the damage has been exacerbated and made far worse by deliberate actions and neglect by this government. As I said, the sector was worth $40.3 billion before COVID. The latest ABS stats saw that fall last year to $31.7 billion—a loss of 25 per cent of the value of this sector. The latest Mitchell Institute modelling projects another $10 billion loss in 2022; so well be down to half of where we were, and that will keep going. It will possibly actually start falling exponentially, for reasons Ill touch on. This is a devastating impact. This is billions of dollars of lost revenue for our universities and TAFEs and also an existential crisis for our independent providers.Remember—and I say this to bust an urban myth—that international students do not take our domestic student places, as too many Australians think and indeed some government members seem to imply or think. They create places and opportunity for Australian students. They fund our classrooms, our capital works programs at campuses and indeed a significant share of our research effort. To be really clear, the impacts of this devastation that has been wrought on this sector include research. As a member for Cowan so eloquently spoke about, billions of dollars cut from international education means billions of dollars lost for our research effort. In an environment of the first recession in 30 years, when we should be thinking about economic recovery, thats the very time we need to be investing more in research and innovation, not less, and yet research funding is falling. The governments cutting research funding this year. This will also, over time, impact our ranking, because our global rankings for universities, which in turn help drive our attractiveness as a student destination, are significantly driven by research. So were going to see a very nasty cycle emerge over the next two to three years.Weve also seen thousands of jobs lost at universities, with the government doing nothing. The latest estimate of jobs lost directly is between 18,000 and 21,000—and theyre just the jobs that show up in the org charts in the universities. Untold thousands more casual teachers, sessional teachers, casual researchers, administrative staff, cleaning staff and so on have been lost. The ABS estimates this year say that 30,000 fewer people are working in higher education than were working the year before. These are avoidable losses. The government changed the JobKeeper rules three times to stop universities being eligible for JobKeeper. They didnt just stand by passively; they actively made sure that these jobs would be lost by refusing to extend the support to the sector. The economic impact has been felt on jobs in the cities and in the regions. I think the ABS stats said, before the crash, over 240,000 jobs were supported by international education in Australia. Thats actually more jobs than are created in the entire mining sector. Its more jobs than are created and supported in the entire agricultural sector. The government has nothing to say on this. Theyre just happy to stand by while tens of thousands of jobs are lost.Its also impacting our reputation. This is where the government is culpable. The Prime Minister actually stood up last year publicly and told students, If you dont like it, go home. How do you think that resonated in a market where word of mouth is everything? Can anyone imagine the Prime Minister saying that about another one of our big export sectors? If you dont like our iron ore, dont buy it. If you dont like our agricultural produce, then nick off. Buy someone elses. Why on earth would the Prime Minister say that about this sector? Hes got a pattern of hostility. Remember, he blamed them the year before for congestion. It wasnt his failure to invest in infrastructure or rorting every infrastructure dollar he could find to push to marginal seats that was causing congestion; apparently, it was international students trying to get a bus to the university. Pathetic.I do call on the government to extend the 485 visas. One positive thing which they could do right now would be for those thousands of students who are stuck offshore with a valid 485 postgraduate study visa. They were made a promise by this country, they invested thousands of dollars and years of their life to study here, they happened to be home when the borders were shut, and theyre unable to come back and use that visa. That was a promise our country made them. We cant bring them back right now, because of the governments failures on quarantine, but we could at least do the decent thing—the smallest thing—and say, When the borders reopen, we will honour the promise as a country we made you and we will let you come back and have your one year or two years of post-study work rights. Thats in our national interest as well, because they form such a wonderful part of our pipeline of highly skilled migrants, in regional areas as well as in cities.The final thing Id note is the human impact on students is incalculable. As I said, theyve invested a lot. For some students its a case of, We enrolled, were studying online and well be able to come at some point. Thats not a positive thing, a positive experience. But for some of these students, the government has to talk to them and at least say, We will prioritise you as soon as we can bring back any students. Take a student whos invested hundreds of thousands of dollars doing a dental course. Theyve had five years in Australia, and theyre stuck offshore unable to do their sixth year. Theyve gone into debt, and they see their life dreams evaporate. The government has had nothing to say to those students whove invested so much in our community. Its not a matter of trading them off against stranded Australians, which the government tries to do every time you raise this, but just being decent and human and understanding that these are people. Theyre human beings, theyre young people whove invested in our country. We could at least have something to say to them: that we understand the sacrifice that theyre making, that we understand the difficulties that its causing. We understand that some have partners living in Australia. Ive tried to help some students whose partners are living in my electorate. They are not able to come back and have never met their own child. Their own child has been born, theyve only met their child on WhatsApp, and the government has nothing to say to these people. We can do better than this as a country and we can do better by our fourth-biggest export sector.The other point Id make about the impacts is that without action business failures are looming. The university situation is bad enough—the impact on research, capital works and so on—but the situation facing independent providers is existentially grim. This is a sector that works on pipelines, lets be clear. As current students leave, if there are no students coming through the borders to replace them, the student cohort shrinks. In the short term last year there was relatively little pain. Providers could adjust to some ups and downs and they still had a good stock of students who were in the country. But theres no JobKeeper eligibility for most of these providers because they couldnt show the drop in turnover at the critical time when JobKeeper was around, so they didnt get support at that point because they didnt need it. But for this sector, unlike most other sectors, the fiscal cliff is looming because their stock in the pipeline, if you like, the students coming in, has dried up. If you sit down and talk to them—the government doesnt talk to them—theyll tell you they can look down the pipeline and the next six months are going to be hard and they will hurt. A lot of providers that could with their balance sheets have stuck away a bit of money to try to get through to Christmas. Thats when the government suggests that students will start to come back. But by the time we get to January or July next year, well be at serious risk of significant business failure.Its no exaggeration to say that for independent providers—not dodgy providers; most of them will go out of business because they dont have reserves, and good riddance to the small number that are dodgy—reputable businesses that have run a quality product and have been in the market for decades are facing a valley of death that is looming over their business. The government wont say it, but it seems unlikely that students are going to return before mid-next year at least. Oh, what could have been: if the government had invested in purpose-built quarantine facilities, hadnt turned its back on the sector last year and rejected every plea for help and every creative idea, we could have had thousands more students at least onshore and we could have had 38,000 stranded Australians back onshore. But the government decided it was fun to play politics and blame the states for everything, instead of taking responsibility and putting in place a safe national quarantine system. We are where we are, but theyve wasted our island continent advantages and theyve set up this impossible conflict between students and stranded Australians.Of course people understand that citizens are going to get priority, but we should not be in this situation where weve seen the scale of devastation in our fourth-biggest export sector. So were going to need—and I call on the government to do this—to provide more business assistance and to sit down to talk with the sector. If the government know that theyre not going to be bringing students back for 12 months—if thats what the government are prepared to say and actually prepared to state as a view—then they have to give some comfort by working with the sector and businesses now. This is a sector that knows exactly whats going to happen. You tell them where the student pipelines going to be, they will tell you at what point their businesses will fail and well see more closures and more loss of jobs. The government says its put in $53 million. Its not nearly enough and its not targeted. A lot of that went to universities; thats a different problem. Some of it went to ELICOS, English language teaching, and quite rightly so, but the VET and higher-ed providers need help and they need engagement now.The other thing we need is a plan to rebuild the sector from the ground up. I hate to say this, but theres no choice but to hope that the minister for education will champion it. That was the minister who gave us robodebt, the minister for car park rorts, the minister who made a mess of immigration. And so, for that brilliance, they promoted him to education. But unfortunately its this man, the minister for education, on whose competence and ability to get something through cabinet the future of our fourth biggest export sector rests. God help them.You cant rely on the Prime Minister. He weirdly hates international education. As I said, he told the students to go home, blamed them for his own failures on infrastructure and congestion, gave no help or care—verging on sociopathic kind of lack of empathy, time after time. He wouldnt treat any other sector like that. The lobsters even got their own plane, but there is not a word of care or concern for international students.The minister for education has a strategy. I understand he got it a couple of weeks ago. Its a bit constipated in the department. The department of educations not going that well. Theyve had three or four people in charge of this strategy. Apparently the international education person is acting up in a job. But, anyway, the ministers finally got a strategy, with a road map to recovery. I urge him to get it out and give some hope to the sector. Hope is not a strategy, but its a good start. At least he can say what his plan for recovery is and then try as best he possibly can not to do a robodebt, not to do a car park rort, not to make the mess like he did in immigration. He can try to get something through cabinet to actually repair some of the damage in our fourth biggest export sector.Ive outlined a few positive ideas. The government are going to need to help the independent education providers. Theyre going to need to send some messages to the students and start to repair the market and reputational damage and show that we do care as a country. Theyre going to have to start putting some money into marketing and get a bit more focus across the bureaucracy. Time doesnt permit me to go through all the solutions.I look forward to seeing the strategy and I hope its a good one. I used to look after international ed in the Victorian public service and worked under Labor governments and Liberal governments. I travelled with Liberal premiers and Liberal ministers to China. This should be a bipartisan portfolio. It should be a bipartisan sector. Ive never before seen this lack of care for this sector from a Liberal government, ever. Its time it stopped. This sector has been a wonderful thing for our country and it deserves more attention from the government.","Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students (TPS Levies) Amendment Bill 2021, Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Cost Recovery and Other Measures) Bill 2021, Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (Charges) Amendment Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HILL (Bruce) ","(16:32):"

Like so many parts of Australian society, we are feeling the effect of last years negligence and last years inaction by the Morrison government. It is nowhere more stark than in our university sector, where, last year, not only did they exacerbate the problems that our university sector is facing by not building purpose-built quarantine facilities, but also theyve systematically attacked our educators and made university more expensive for Australians to go to.We in the Labor Party have always championed our university sector. From the Whitlam reforms, many of my parents generation went to university for free. Within a generation, the life and the living standards of Australians, including our family, were turned around. Because of the Labor Partys longstanding commitment to access to education, it is through university, it is through higher education, that Australians have had the social mobility to be able to do whatever they want within this country. But that dream is slowly being chopped away at and undermined by the efforts of this government.Unfortunately, due to this pandemic, we have seen our university sector on its knees. For too long, the university sector has been underfunded by this government and by successive Liberal governments. Instead of being funded properly, the university sector has been forced to rely on international students to make up a lot of the revenue that the government and successive Liberal governments have cut from courses. So the university sector has a financial model where it absolutely relies on international education. Because of this pandemic the sector has had a huge reduction in revenue to subsidise and support Australian students and quality Australian education through having a reduction in the number of international students coming here.You would think that, for Australias fourth-largest export industry—it is Victorias single largest service exporter—the federal government would be doing absolutely everything in its power to help ensure that our universities are supported throughout this pandemic. You would think that it would do everything in its power to ensure the key revenue of international education coming into this country. It not only supports our university sector but supports businesses and accommodation and is a huge benefit for our economy. You would think that the federal government would be doing everything in its power to help ensure that our university sector could survive. But its not.The federal government has consistently been attacking our university sector. It has been undermining our university sector. You need to look only as far as the JobKeeper reform to see how much the university sector in Australia was never a priority for the Morrison government. You couldnt have designed JobKeeper in a way that excluded universities more directly than the way in which this government designed JobKeeper. To create a JobKeeper program that specifically excluded the university sector was literally a design of the Morrison government. Despite the urging and the amendments put forward by Labor, it was the federal government that flat out refused to support the university sector through JobKeeper.What we saw were massive job losses across the sector. Monash University proudly has one of its campuses in my electorate of Macnamara. It also produces some of the finest people in this country. The great Monash University lost over 250 jobs. A total of 277 jobs were lost in 2020, mainly because the federal government flat out refused to support our university sector with JobKeeper. We saw comparable job losses at the major Victorian universities of Deakin and La Trobe. Universities have been left behind by the federal government. Its so frustrating. Universities have gone through the really traumatic experience of this pandemic. Not having the extra revenue from international students has been compounded by the fact that they were left behind in regard to the JobKeeper scheme. Then you add to that the fact of the legacy reforms of the Morrison government, which are to make university more expensive for a lot more Australian students, especially those in humanities courses.I was a humanities student. I proudly studied politics and history. Yet the consecutive attacks on our humanities courses, on creative thinking, on critical thinking, on independent thought, on history, on our society and on ethics have been pretty disappointing to say the least. It has been a reflection of the values of the Morrison government that they have constantly sought to undermine free and independent thinking if it doesnt comply with the governments thinking. Successively weve seen JobKeeper, the cuts and the lack of purpose-built quarantine put our university sector on its knees. Weve then seen the federal government make universities more expensive for more students.I want to take this moment to reflect on the fact that, throughout this pandemic, our young Australians have missed out on so many milestones. Each and every day away from school and away from your friends is really difficult. Our young Australians have been asked to do so much throughout this pandemic. Its important to note every single time a young Australian misses a formal, every single time a young Australian misses a sporting event, every single time a young Australian misses a chance to go and hang out at their friends house, every single time a young Australian doesnt get to leave school and hang out on campus and experience all of the joys of campus life after doing a tough year 12. Its important to recognise that young Australians have had to go through their best years, their formative years, the years when they could have grown and experienced independence and all of the joys of the world and of Australian society—travel, exploration and all the things that we all have fond memories of—having missed those milestones because of this pandemic. And what are they confronted with? Theyre confronted with a government that tells them that university is going to be more expensive for them, theyre confronted with a government that tries to prescribe which courses they engage in, theyre confronted with a government that clearly hasnt prioritised the university sector or prioritised the next generation.We should be investing in our young people, because our young people are missing out on so much. Of course theyve been left behind in the vaccine rollout. Our young people have been really forced to bear the brunt of this pandemic and have not had an opportunity to get vaccinated until very recently, and all the mixed messaging has been extremely confusing for young people. We should acknowledge it. But I also think that we really should acknowledge the fact that each milestone missed by a young Australian is important. Its something that we should be thankful of and thankful for, that younger Australians, with dignity, have managed to do that, making huge sacrifices for the betterment of Australian society. So the least that we could be doing, the least that the Australian government could be doing is saying to them, Thank you, and investing back in their future.I think that the way in which the federal government has treated our university sector does the exact opposite. It says that were going to make your university more expensive, were going to leave you with more debt, were not going to support the university sector in the way in which we could and were not going to try as hard as we can to ensure the future prosperity of, and investment into, our university sector. And its really disappointing, because that is exactly the opposite of what we should be doing at this time. Now is the time to be investing in young people, now is the time to be saying to young people that there is hope, you will get through this and were going to invest in the opportunities that youre going to need in the future.I would take this opportunity to say directly to the younger people of Australia: We appreciate all of the sacrifices youve made. Every milestone that youve missed is important. And whether it was a school formal, a sporting match, just a chance to hang out with your friends, a chance to hang out on campus life, a chance to just be a young Australian and to be yourself, the fact that youve missed out on that and made sacrifices is amazing, and its important. Its helped keep people safe. The end of this pandemic is going to come, and you will have a return to some form of normal life. It will happen. Have faith, it will happen. In the meantime, in order to reward younger Australians, we should be saying to you that our university sector should be the best funded in the world, that our university sector will not be the source of constant cuts and undermining, that if we work to create a wage subsidy program our university sector shouldnt be missing out on that—they should be at the top of our funding pile—and that we recognise all of your sacrifices and we want to help invest in the future so that you can give back to this wonderful country.On that note, I say that we have seen a really disappointing few years for our university sector by the Morrison government, but it is true to form. We would hope that with a change of government it will give us the opportunity to right the wrongs, reinvest back in our university sector, reinvest back in our young Australians and reinvest back into the future, as a Labor government has always done and will do long into the future.

This package of four bills will give effect to the governments decision in the 2021-22 budget to implement updated cost recovery arrangements for registration on the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students, CRICOS, from 1 January 2022.The changes to the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Charges) Amendment Bill 2021 will allow the Department of Education, Skills and Employment to recover the cost of the efficient regulatory services it provides to the international education sector, including in its role as the regulator of schools that enrol international students. The new arrangements will result in a reduction in the departments CRICOS charges. The amendments are necessary to ensure the charging approach meets the requirements for the Australian government Charging Framework and to maintain the quality and reputation of our Australias international education sector, positioning it for recovery and regrowth. Consequential amendments to the three other acts facilitate the changes set out in the registration charges bill.In response to the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, I table an addendum to the EM.

241,0,0,0,1,1,"Giles, Andrew, MP",243609,"Scullin","ALP","N/A",7797," I rise to speak on the Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2021. This is legislation that would amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to extend the free rate of customs duty to certain medical and hygiene products from 31 December 2022 until 30 June this year; provide for free rate of customs duties for goods for use in the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter Program; and for prescribed motor vehicles and motor vehicle components for research and development activities by automotive service providers previously registered under the Automotive Transformation Scheme between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2025.This is a bill that Labor supports, because the amendments will facilitate continued access to medical products and hygiene products for use in combatting COVID-19. There is, of course, an ongoing need to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within the Australian community, and the products that we are talking about here will include face masks, gloves, clothes or gowns, goggles, glasses, eye visors, face shields, soaps, COVID-19 test kits and reagents, viral transport media and disinfectants. Also, the amendments contained in this bill will support continued domestic research and development in the automotive sector, and ensure that previously registered automotive service providers can continue to access the tariff concession. This will help automotive service providers maintain an Australian presence, including through the engineering services design and product development.The bill contains three significant measures, as I touched on earlier. The first is to incorporate the Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2021, which was tabled in the parliament on 3 February. As has been made clear in the explanatory memorandum to the bill:The provision of a Free rate of customs duty for certain medical and hygiene products to 30 June 2021 is estimated to reduce customs duty receipts by $3.8 million.The second measure will also insert new items to provide a free rate of customs duty for goods that are for use in the program known as the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter Program. Under the memorandum of understanding for the development of the joint strike fighter, Australia has committed to achieving tax neutrality under the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter Program. This measure incorporates Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2021, which was tabled in the parliament on 17 March. The implementation for a free rate for goods associated with this will reduce receipts by $6.7 million across the forward estimates.Finally, the third measure would insert a new item, section 39A, into schedule 4 to provide a free rate of customs duty for prescribed motor vehicles and motor vehicle components for research and development activities by automotive service providers previously registered under the Automotive Transformation Scheme and where the time for working out duty is between 1 April 2021 and 30 June 2025. This measure incorporates Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 3) 2021, tabled in May this year. The implementation of this free rate of customs is estimated to reduce receipts by $1.7 million across the forward estimates.These measures commenced respectively on 1 January, 1 March and 1 April 2021 through notices of intention to propose customs tariff alterations and related customs tariff proposals, necessitating the amendment to the bill were dealing with now. We must ensure Australias domestic manufacturing capacity and capability through this prolonged COVID crisis and we must also support our long-term recovery. We must support industries that are of strategic importance. Therefore I move the following second reading amendment to this bill:That all words after That be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:(1) acknowledges the bill provides for reduced rates of customs duty for goods required to combat the COVID-19 pandemic;(2) notes that the Government has failed to outline a long-term plan to support local industries that are of strategic importance and in our national interest to safeguard; and(3) further notes that the Prime Ministers refusal to secure a variety of vaccines in accordance with worlds best practice has left Australians dangerously exposed against highly infectious COVID-19 variants.On this side of the House we will never forget, in the context of this legislation, that it was this coalition government that oversaw the destruction of our car industry. In 2013 the Liberals dared Australian automotive manufacturers to leave Australia and, sadly, they did. As a result of this action and others, the coalition has presided over the permanent loss of more than 55,000 manufacturing jobs in Australia.The Morrison government has had over a year to invest in new manufacturing—","Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[7]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GILES (Scullin) ","(17:16):"

The Morrison government has had more than a year to invest in new manufacturing capability and they havent, once again leaving Australia missing out on new jobs and manufacturing opportunities. Government experts have since confirmed that the Prime Minister has never had a plan to create manufacturing jobs, just plans to create headlines. The secretary of the department confirmed at the 2021-22 budget estimates that the $1.5 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy has not created a single job—not a single job!—saying that this fact is crystal clear and an inevitable outcome of the funding profile that no new jobs in manufacturing have been created under the strategy.The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that we need to be a country that makes things, but this government has squandered this opportunity and has left companies that have supported the national effort in the lurch. There is one example which is particularly telling: an Australian company that supported our domestic production of medical masks at a time of greatest need, Med-Con. When the pandemic hit at the start of last year, as borders were closing and the immediate imports of some critical medical equipment were frozen, Australian health services needed masks immediately and Med-Con was the only surgical mask manufacturer in the country. Its a small, family owned business based in Shepparton in Victoria and it was critical to supplying our frontline health services.The government begged Med-Con to boost its supply and they did their bit—as all Australians have done throughout the pandemic. But they have been let down by this Prime Minister and left in the lurch. In April 2020 the Prime Minister, on his Facebook page, spoke of supporting Med-Con. He spoke at great length about this. But if we fast forward to 21 July of this year, this is what the CEO of Med-Con, Steven Csiszar, said to the ABC:All the people weve supported throughout the pandemic seem to have left us.The cameras move on and so does this Prime Minister, which is just so revealing of his behaviour at every turn. He is all about the photo op and never there for the follow-through. Whether its bushfires or the pandemic, he cannot move himself beyond base politics and beyond engaging with daily political tactics. He has proven himself incapable of governing for all Australians or for the national interest.Australians know that the Prime Minister had two jobs this year: speedy, effective rollout of the vaccine and putting in place dedicated national quarantine arrangements. He has failed at both to the cost of all us. The economy is bleeding hundreds of millions of dollars every day and billions a week because he hasnt done these two jobs. Australians cant afford another three years of this kind of leadership.Labor supports the provisions that are contained in the bill, which are of themselves uncontentious, but we must be on guard with what is happening with our broader policy settings. We cant afford to be caught off guard like this again. The pandemic has underlined how exposed we are to disruptions in global supply chains. The pandemic has taught us we need to be a country that makes things, and a state-of-the-art sovereign vaccine capability must be top of this list. Under Labor, Australia and Australians wont be left behind as we have been under this government. Labour has a plan for reconstruction that will rebuild our manufacturing base, create good jobs and safeguard our health and prosperity. Its all about creating the advanced manufacturing industries that will power good jobs and a stronger economy and provide ongoing sovereign capability for decades to come.The Prime Minister is not on the side of Australian manufacturing and he does not believe in a future made in Australia—and, even if he did, he does not have the character, vision or competence to see it through.","Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[7]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[20]","N/A","N/A"

254,0,0,0,1,1,"Young, Terry, MP",201906,"Longman","LNP","N/A",7800," I rise today to speak about some important amendments to the Customs Tariff Act through the Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2021. The changes we are proposing incorporate three proposals that have been tabled in parliament this year which provide for a free rate of customs duty for a range of imported goods. The measures contained in these proposals will continue to support the availability of vital health and hygiene products in the community, contribute to our ability to fulfil international defence commitments and facilitate continued research and development in the automotive sector.Customs tariff proposal No.1 will extend the free rate of customs duty for imported prescribed medical and hygiene products that can be used to combat COVID-19. The coronavirus continues to spread around the world at an alarming rate. While our record on suppressing the virus here in Australia has been world leading, recent and ongoing lockdowns make it clear that we are not out of the woods yet. In fact, the delta variant of the virus has proved to be the most contagious and is responsible for our current state of lockdowns and community restrictions.The latest data on COVID-19, at the time this speech was written, reveal there have been 280 locally acquired cases in the past 24 hours. There are currently 4,727 active cases and 433 people are in hospital. But Australia is rising to the challenge. There have been 168,120 COVID tests done in the past 24 hours. In my home state of Queensland there are currently 144 active cases. We have just come out of a five-day lockdown and many restrictions remain in place. Meanwhile, Australias vaccine rollout is gaining pace. As of Saturday, there have been more than 13½ million doses delivered. The Australian government remains committed to protecting the health of all Australians and we are doing our part, along with the state governments, to suppress the virus as best we can.One of the tools we have is to make it easier to import medical and hygiene products that will help us fight this terrible pandemic. The first amendment to the Customs Tariff Act is an extension of a temporary free rate of customs duty for a selection of imported prescribed medical and hygiene products to combat COVID-19. Specific goods covered by the measure include facemasks, gloves, clothes or gowns; goggles, glasses, eye visors or face shields; disinfectant preparations classified to heading 3808 in schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act, excluding hand sanitisers; soaps; and COVID-19 test kits, reagents and viral transport media.This proposal contains a measure that extends the free rate of customs duty for these eligible goods from 31 December 2022 to 30 June 2021. This tariff concession initially started on 1 February 20. Through consultation with stakeholders, including Australian businesses, the measure has been extended twice to continue to meet the needs of the community during the COVID-19 pandemic. The end date was previously extended from 31 July 2020 to 31 December 2020. This latest extension of the measure to 30 June 2021 is expected to reduce receipts by $3.8 million across the forward estimates. This extension to the free rate will ensure individuals and businesses continue to have access to the essential supplies required to keep themselves and other members of the community safe. It will also help ensure that Australia remains a competitive market for these essential medical and hygiene goods and allow the community to source these goods for those people who need it most, such as healthcare professionals and other essential workers.The second amendment to the Customs Tariff Act that we are debating here today provides a free rate of customs duty from imported goods that were used in the F-35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter program. This program is a plan for affordable next-generation strike aircraft weapon systems for our armed forces and our allies. The Australian government has already acquired around 30 of the Lockheed Martin designed Lightning II aircraft. We will eventually acquire 72 Joint Strike Fighters in total, along with associated weapons, spares, support equipment and infrastructure.The F-35A brings cutting-edge technologies to the battle space of the future and is critical to achieving the objectives set out in the 2020 Defence strategic update to shape, deter and respond. Our fleet of F-35As will fulfil the functions of air dominance and strike capability currently provided by F/A-18A/B Hornets. The F-35A Lightning II, in concert with the Super Hornet and Growler aircraft, will be a potent air combat capability mix. This will provide the Royal Australian Air Force with crucial air combat power to meet Australias needs beyond 2030.Australia is acquiring F-35A as part of an international cooperative program led by the United States. Under the agreement, partners bid for and win work on the global program on a best-value basis. Australia has won over $2.7 billion worth of work, with more than 50 companies involved. In time, this will expand to include maintenance and repair for a range of system components in support of the global fleet. Australia will continue to work with the United States and our industry partners as more aircraft are delivered through to 2023.The amendment to the Customs Tariff Act supports Australias participation in the Joint Strike Fighter production, sustainment and follow-on development memorandum of understanding. This memorandum was signed in 2006 and commits to achieving tax neutrality. This measure is estimated to reduce customs duty receipts by $6.7 million over the forward estimates.Finally, the third amendment to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that we are debating here today incorporates a measure to provide a free rate of customs duty for certain imported motor vehicles and motor vehicle components. These vehicles and components must have been imported by an automotive service provider previously registered under the Automotive Transformation Scheme. While registrations under the scheme have closed, the time for working out duty runs to 30 June 2025. These goods included under the amendment measure must be imported for use in the testing, quality control and manufacturing evaluation or engineering development of motor vehicles designed or engineered in Australia. This measure extends to the treatment previously provided to these goods during the operation of the Automotive Transformation Scheme.This scheme supports the Australian automotive industry and aims to encourage competitive investment, innovation and economic sustainability through financial assistance. Under the scheme, motor vehicle producers were covered for up to 15 per cent of the cost of eligible plant and equipment and 50 per cent of eligible research and development investments. With the end of the second stage of this scheme, this concessional item ensures that companies previously registered under the scheme can continue to access a customs duty concession and are not subject to additional regulatory burden. This measure is about supporting the automotive manufacturing industry, facilitating continued research and development in the automotive sector and supporting local jobs. It responds to concerns from the automotive industry that the end of the concession would significantly disrupt research and development activities. The measure is estimated to reduce customs duty receipts by $1.7 million across the forward estimates.The amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that we are debating here today are vital to Australias continued health and economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as well as our national security. The world in which we live is always changing, and we as a government need to change with it and support those vital industries that keep us safe and support our economy. One of the ways in which we can do this is by amending our existing customs tariff legislation to reduce import duties on goods that are so important to our future.","Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[7]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr YOUNG (Longman) ","(17:26):"
255,0,0,0,1,1,"Connelly, Vince, MP",282984,"Stirling","LP","N/A",7802," The current times have really forced us to assess where our priorities lie, as we rightly should periodically, and make adjustments where we need to. One of those areas has been in personal protective equipment, or PPE. Were all rolling with face masks at the moment in many places around the country and, indeed, the world. Along with face masks, gloves, gowns and the like are significantly high-volume disposables. So we have had to make some legislative amendments in order to give favour to the flexibility with which we can import PPE. The second priority I will touch on today as I speak to this bill is that of defence industry. I see the shadow assistant minister for defence, the member for Paterson, is in the chamber, and I know that she is incredibly passionate about defence industry, particularly the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, as are we all. Supporting defence industry absolutely is another priority which as a nation we are absolutely getting behind. The third priority Id like to touch on is lower carbon transport. There is an awful lot of innovation going into lower-carbon transport options. These include dual-cell vehicles, which have a traditional hydrocarbon power source mixed with electric, and electric vehicles. Some of the emerging research is going into the use of hydrogen as a fuel for transport. I highlight these three priority areas because they are captured in the intent behind this bill. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2021, is set to amend the Customs Tariff Act by paying particular attention to three proposals around these three priorities, which have already been tabled in parliament.Importantly, the first proposal contains a measure that has the effect of extending the free rate of customs duty for eligible medical and hygiene products which are capable of use as we combat COVID-19. This extends that eligibility from 30 June 2021. This tariff concession commenced last February. The Morrison government, through consultation with a range of Aussie businesses, recognised the importance of this measure, and so has extended it twice already. With infections still current in at least three states at the moment, its more vital than ever that we continue to meet the needs of our community through the pandemic. We cannot step on or even contemplate applying the brakes any time soon. Indeed, we are powering ahead with the delivery of the vaccine so that we can suppress the virus. So far, and I congratulate Australians on their wonderful acceleration in the take-up of vaccines, 13.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered. This takes our rate of fully vaccinated people to over 22 per cent and rising. Our rate of vaccination is well over one million doses per week. This weekend we hit another significant milestone when we saw 140,225, to be precise, people roll up their sleeves, marking a record rate for a Saturday. This government is overcoming hurdles that are thrown at us.Much as all of us, Im sure, would like to possess a crystal ball, nobody does. There have been changes in our plan throughout the pandemic as the situation has changed, even as the virus itself has changed. German Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke commented, No operational plan survives first contact with enemy forces. A learning that all young military offices, at least in Australia, are reminded of is that once you confront the enemy things are absolutely, guaranteed, going to change. Thats what weve seen through this pandemic, and we will keep amending our plan as need be.In Australia we can celebrate a great deal of success. I look around OECD nations, for example, and if we were to experience the same rate of deaths from COVID on a per-head of population basis, we would have experienced 30,000 deaths. Whilst every single death that we have unfortunately experienced in Australia is an absolute tragedy, it is certainly a fortunate circumstance indeed that we have avoided tens of thousands more deaths.Over three million Australians have also been supported through JobKeeper, and one million Australians are now back at work. This absolutely fits within the governments consistent mantra of focusing on saving lives and livelihoods. It is particularly pleasing that Lieutenant General Frewen has been appointed to oversee the vaccine rollout. I can attest to General Frewens capabilities, having served as one of the officers under his command during my time as a military officer. He was a fantastic commanding officer and a wonderful commander of the joint task force in the complex environment of the Solomon Islands. He certainly has some great runs on the board. So its wonderful to see him as part of the team fighting COVID here on our shores.Were witnessing a significant ramp-up, as I said, in the vaccine program. Another measure of this is that we are now seeing the arrival every week of one million doses of Pfizer. Thanks also to the Prime Minister and national cabinets agreed four-phase national plan, were powering through this first phase by accelerating the vaccine rate. This does come at a price, though, and extending the tariff exemption for PPE over the forward estimates will cost in the order of $3.8 million, an investment I think we can all agree is absolutely well founded.The second part of this proposal relates to a free rate of customs duty on imported goods for use in the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, or JSF, program. This is the most advanced fighter jet in the world, and Australia should be very rightly proud to be a lead participant in this program. The use of the concessional item is limited to goods that are for use in the program and are not currently eligible for a free rate of customs duty. The F-35 has the capability to strengthen our national security, enhance global partnerships and power economic growth. This is a part of the Morrison governments commitment of $270 billion on defence capability over the next decade. This is of course in response to a complex and contested environment strategically, both in our region and right across the globe. Strong national security absolutely underpins also our economic prosperity and our ongoing social cohesion. Were living, as I said, in a contested region, and it is more important now than ever that we continue keeping Australians safe and sovereign, and investing in our military and our defence industry is how we are going to keep doing that. This measure is estimated to reduce customs duty receipts by $6.7 million over the forward estimates—again, a very appropriate expenditure.Finally, the third proposal is to provide a free rate of customs duty to certain motor vehicles and components imported for research and development activities by our automotive service providers. This tariff concession will be applicable till 30 June 2025. It enables automotive service providers who were previously registered under the Automotive Transformation Scheme to continue accessing concessional treatment for eligible goods. This measure responds to concerns from industry that the end of the concession would significantly disrupt their research and development activities. As Australia looks towards more environmentally friendly modes of transport which are lower carbon, such as hybrid electric cars—and I mentioned emerging research into hydrogen powered vehicles—its really important that we reduce the financial burden upon those who are undertaking this research and development and driving forward that leading edge of our lower-carbon future.Australia is on track to meet and beat our 2030 Paris target through a technology focused approach. That stems from our aversion to solving problems with taxes and preference for leveraging technology. Thats where this bill absolutely lends a helping hand. Australias Technology Investment Roadmap is expected to guide $20 billion worth of government investment over the next decade and drive around $80 billion in total new investment in low-emissions technologies in Australia by 2030. The 2021-22 budget includes $1.2 billion over 10 years for investments in low-emissions technology. This includes $565 million to establish international partnerships on practical low-emissions projects and $263 million to accelerate the development of carbon capture, use and storage.Research shows that a hybrid vehicle can use 40 to 60 per cent less fuel and emit around 30 per cent less carbon dioxide than a conventional vehicle. Meanwhile, electric vehicles produce zero tailpipe CO2 emissions. If a 100 per cent renewable energy such as solar power is used to recharge the batteries, then the power is free and greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated. Lower-carbon transport options are increasingly being selected by Australians. In fact, we saw the sale of EVs and plug-in hybrids increase by almost 300 per cent in 2019, to 6,718, compared to 2018, when it was 2,357. As I said, that is an incredible 300 per cent increase. That is why this government is investing in lower-carbon transport options, with the introduction of this proposal estimated to reduce customs duty receipts by $1.7 million across the forward estimates.In summary, we have shifted, and rightly so, in a range of priority areas, particularly those touching on PPE, defence industry and lower-carbon transport options. I commend this bill to the House, as it goes a long way to helping us achieve those objectives.","Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[7]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CONNELLY (Stirling) ","(17:34):"
256,0,0,0,1,1,"Ramsey, Rowan, MP","HWS","Grey","LP","N/A",7804," I dont agree with the amendment, although I do agree with the proposal put by the government in regard to the Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2021. There are very few set-and-forget policies in government, particularly when it comes to tax and customs law. It is a scenario of constant change and adjustment. If it was Winston Churchill who said, When the facts change, sir, I change my mind, he was completely on the money. Certainly, when it comes to issues of trade, weve seen many things change in recent years. The establishment of a number of free trade agreements—or freer trade agreements, as they probably should be referred to—moves by Australia in the field of antidumping, moves by other countries alleging dumping against Australia, those who take political positions and attack our trade status for, as the term would suggest, no better reason than pure politics are all things that we as a government have to face on virtually a daily or weekly basis. So, too, are the proposals that have been put up in these amendments.Australia built a huge wall of tariffs in the early and middle parts of the last century. The dismantling of that great tariff wall began, of course, in the 1970s under Gough Whitlam, who moved for an immediate reduction of 25 per cent in all tariffs across the board. It was the beginning of a very long, drawn-out process of general tariff reduction by both sides of politics, which came to a halt, I suppose we should say, in the early 2000s, when the remnant tariff—and many would say Australia doesnt have any tariffs—was at five per cent, where it remains, on around 50 per cent of those goods that are termed to have a rateable tariff assessment. Thats not to say thats on 50 per cent of the goods we import; its nothing like that. Its that 50 per cent of tariff items still retain tariffs.It probably begs the question of why those remain, but I think the removal of tariffs generally has been good for Australia. There would be others that would argue differently, but certainly right back in the 1960s Bert Kelly argued strongly that one mans tariff is another mans job. It was Gough Whitlam who said at the time of Bert Kellys passing that no one man from the backbench had ever done more towards a long-term Australian policy than Bert Kelly. Through those years, they have been reduced and Australia has flourished. People have said that there would be no jobs here, but in fact even today, in the midst of a COVID crisis, we have below five per cent unemployment, so it has been good for Australia and it will continue to be. While we might beg the question, as I said, why these five per cent tariffs remain, that is the status quo and has been the case for the best part of 20 years now.This bill deals with three different items under that tariff regime, and theyre different from each other. The first item concerns medical goods, which of course provide hygiene and safety for us in dealing with COVID-19. I think the member for Longman went through the details, but the list includes masks, gloves, clothes, gowns, goggles, visors, protective glasses, disinfectants—but, I point out, not hand sanitiser—soaps, test kits, reagents and things of that nature. A decision was made in the early days of the COVID-19 crisis, which was right back in February 2020, that, on a temporary basis, free status, which means no tariffs, should be applied to these goods to ensure that we do have supply in Australia. Theres been a great ramp-up of manufacturing capacity in that time not just in Australia but also right around the world, and those things that are the first form of defence at the moment, being masks and other things, are in plentiful supply at least in a place like Australia. Wed already extended this exemption once. One would have hoped that by now perhaps the COVID crisis would be in retreat, but its stubbornly refusing to go and is adapting itself and making itself more dangerous to society generally, so we need a further extension. I dont think theres any argument about any of the amendments in this bill for that matter, but I think thats a fully justifiable case.On the Joint Strike Fighter—the Lightning II, as its called—Australia worked very hard to become a part of the global supply line for the JSF. We are one of nine nations that have won the ability to bid for content in these Joint Strike Fighters. We have 30 of them already in Australia of the 72 that weve ordered. Already that ability to bid to get into that supply line has been to the net benefit of Australia of around about $2 billion. Thats quite a boost to our economy, but I think, even more than that, it integrates us into one of the very high-technology lines of the world.In my home state of South Australia theres been a lot of investment by US, largely, and European defence contractors establishing bases here in Australia because they can see that the Australian government is committed to a higher budget level in this uncertain world for the development of technology and the supply of equipment to our defence forces after a historic low. They are here on the ground, and of course being a participating partner in the production of the Joint Strike Fighter has been of great benefit. We will see similar things—in fact, even better things, I think—when it comes to the construction of our frigates at the moment and our submarines in the medium-term future. We are also designated to become an assigned product supply provider, so we will be like the parts shop for the JSF in the Pacific region. That will be important—by definition, that is a highly specialised supply line—because, as a part of our obligations under winning those contracts, is a guarantee to our partners of neutrality on tax, and this exemption does exactly that.On a personal note, I was on a delegation in the US in 2015. We didnt get to see a JSF up close, and I still havent, even though now theyre in Australia. The member for Franklin and I sat in a simulator of the cockpit in Washington. I can fly an aeroplane but maybe not a JSF, Id have to point out. The thing that got me was a pilot still relies on vision. You could sit in this cockpit and look through your lap. I thought, Gee, I forgot to bring my legs, the seat and the bottom of the aeroplane! Its a surreal thing that the cameras that sit around this hi-tech operation give you the ability to look straight through yourself as it were. I found that a bit of a surreal experience, but the technology looked pretty good to me. Im not an assessor of aeroplanes, it would be fair to say, but the fact we were involved in its production and are going to be the parts shop for the Pacific region is very important for Australia.The third set of items that were dealing with today under this free status for tariffs is around the automotive supply industries. As we all know, we dont make any cars in Australia anymore. I heard from the shadow minister earlier that it was all the Liberal Partys fault, but he neglected to mention who was in government when Ford and Toyota exited the scene—actually, I think that was Ford and Mitsubishi, so I should be careful about throwing stones. We dont make cars anymore but we make components. There have been a number of components suppliers that have been able to swing over to international supply. To do that, they need to stay current with modern technologies and develop a new technology for the supply of these vehicles. Its very important they are able to import the particular products they need for testing and development. This was an exemption that they enjoyed under the previous car transformation plan, so this new addition is really a continuation of the status quo. Once again, it just makes sense.These three items that were addressing in this amendment all make sense. Its all good policy. Its just another show of governments being able to, as I say, chew gum and speak or walk at the same time. I dont know about chewing gum and speaking at the same time; maybe thats not etiquette. But either way, it is just the mechanics of government in getting on with the job. I commend the amendments.Debate adjourned.","Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2021","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[7]/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RAMSEY (Grey—Government Whip) ","(17:46):"

I also acknowledge my own country, the Noongar people of Western Australia, and say in our language, kaya wanju—hello and welcome. I acknowledge my Aboriginal parliamentary colleagues, the Hon. Linda Burney, Senator Pat Dodson, Senator Malarndirri McCarthy, Senator Jackie Lambie and Senator Olivia Thorpe. I also want to acknowledge the Prime Minister, who last week renewed his commitment to walk together with Indigenous Australians; to continue to listen, to learn; and a commitment to work together.Two years ago, the Commonwealth signed a new partnership agreement with the states and territories, the coalition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peak organisations, and the Australian Local Government Association. That document said, From now on we will work together, no matter what, and we are. From that partnership, our new national agreement was born, setting out our new priority reforms and the 17 outcomes and targets agreed to by all and ushering in a new era of action, evidence and accountability. Governments can do a lot, and we will, but we cant do it all. I acknowledge the work of Pat Turner and the other leaders of the peak bodies and note how critical our partnership and their efforts will be in this new era. I acknowledge the work of the National Indigenous Australians Agency and the incredible staff in that organisation, particularly the former CEO, Ray Griggs, and all public servants who were involved in the agreements preparation.Each of the states and territories and the peaks and the Commonwealth presented their own implementation plans last Friday, when we met as the Joint Council on Closing the Gap. Each one of those plans directly responds to the new priority reform areas and the new outcomes and targets. All governments will report to their respective parliaments on their progress towards achieving the targets and, critically, all of our efforts will be scrutinised more closely than ever before—not by us, ourselves, as weve done in the past, but by the independent Productivity Commission and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander led reviews that will occur. Were not going to waste this opportunity. We will build on the past. Well be guided not by what we think works but what the data tells us. We will only continue to fund initiatives that we now know can deliver, ensuring the money spent goes as far as it can.When I was sworn in as Minister for Indigenous Australians, I promised that policy would not be made solely in my office; instead, I would only develop policy in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, and I meant that. From visiting communities and speaking with elders around the country, this has become clear and urgent. Last year I had traditional owners at Katherine ask me, Why do you insist on acknowledging traditional owners and elders but youre not involving us in everyday things to do with our country? They said, You as governments acknowledge us, but we dont see us sitting at the table talking about the importance of country and why we are the rightful owners and why we shouldnt have a say. So why do you acknowledge us but dont include us? Its a simple question, one that governments have struggled to answer for far too long.So, yes, Ive been challenged—challenged to think more deeply about how to honour my original promise, how to make our partnerships efforts more than just words in a report or ideas in a speech, how to make them real for our people. To make them mean something to every person in every community, what we need most in Indigenous affairs is pragmatism and real outcomes, practical actions that result in meaningful change for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and change through working in genuine partnership. That is our paradigm shift, which is now embedded in the Commonwealth Closing the Gap Implementation Plan. We are being rigorous with the evidence, we are listening, we are learning and we are pursuing what works.This is the latest step to do away with the old top-down approach without losing or downplaying the heart and intention of the commitments made by Prime Minister Rudd 13 years ago. But much has changed since then. What hasnt changed is the collective aspiration of our people to see Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children getting the best start in life and the same opportunities—schooling, health care and life outcomes—as their peers; to see more children in school and fewer children in custody; to see more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living healthier lives and fewer dying young. We want to see more opportunity and optimism, and more freedom to hope and to heal.I want to take a moment to reflect on the Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme the Prime Minister has just announced. I want to acknowledge Fiona Cornforth—who has done a brilliant job—Maisie Austin, Eileen Cummings and the Healing Foundation for their work to address trauma passed from generation to generation, in too many cases caused by the forced removal of children from their families. When I spoke with them, on several occasions I recalled my mother and her siblings who were members of the same experience. My mother spent her childhood years in Roelands mission out of Bunbury. Not only were all her siblings taken away from their parents, they were also separated from each other and spread hundreds of kilometres apart. As a child, and as a child of anybody who has been in an institution, I used to listen to their stories that they shared between themselves, and they expressed how they felt. Ive read my mothers native welfare files, which include letters from her parents which make it very clear that her mother and father had not given up on wanting them back. They had not relinquished their parental rights. Theyd never given her up. They continued loving and yearning for her all those years, and her for them. When I was talking with Maisie and Eileen, it brought back those memories of what they went through, and thats why weve done the right thing.The new redress scheme represents an important practical step forward to healing in this country and reflects our governments commitment to support a process of truth-telling as part of our nations journey to reconciliation. All of us in cabinet share responsibility to create a better future for Indigenous Australians. In a sense, we are all ministers for Indigenous Australians.It is my hope that over the 10 years of this new Agreement on Closing the Gap, as well as through our efforts to co-design the Indigenous voice, my colleagues and I can work even more closely together to acknowledge the past, to build a better future as one, but, more importantly, to implement all of the initiatives that are outlined in the $1 billion commitment in the Commonwealths implementation plan. I think the strength of this approach of a partnership with 51 peak organisations, with Indigenous communities, but where state and territory governments are now accountable in their own parliaments, makes our task as a Commonwealth to be facilitators for a better future, that it addresses all those elusive areas in which gaps have continued to exist. Out-of-home care, incarceration rates and the general ones that weve always focused on are all critically important. And, whilst the challenge in some of the circumstances that people live in remote and isolated communities will be tough, nevertheless I know that both sides of this chamber are committed to ensuring that we collectively close the gap that exists. It gives us an incredible opportunity to work in a bipartisan approach over the next 10 years to see a future in which a child born today at the age of 10 will have better opportunities, better pathways and enjoy the same privileges that an Australian child does in any other context.I also want to acknowledge the contribution of my long-term friend Linda Burney for the work that she has done over our years of being advocates in a number of areas, and the member for Barton knows full well how important these gap closures are if we are going to see a change in the quality of lives. Even in capital cities, those gaps exist. What we have to do is look for solutions that will ensure that the challenges are addressed and we see the outcomes that we seek through all of the implementation plans and the Closing the Gap implementation agreement. Thank you.Honourable members: Hear, hear!","Closing the Gap","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WYATT (Hasluck—Minister for Indigenous Australians) ","(17:59):"
262,0,0,0,1,1,"Burney, Linda, MP","8GH","Barton","ALP","N/A",7810," [by video link] I join with Minister Wyatt in recognising himself, of course, Senator Dodson, Senator McCarthy, Senator Thorp and Senator Lambie. I acknowledge the peak organisations, including Pat Turner, and I thank particularly the Labor Party for its incredible support for this process and my leader, Anthony Albanese, for his ongoing support in closing the gap. I also recognise and thank Minister Wyatt for his acknowledgement of me towards the end of his speech. Its very touching and very heartfelt, so thank you very much, Minister Wyatt.Last week, the Prime Minister delivered the latest Closing the Gap update. Sadly, and unsurprisingly, the data shows that disparity and disadvantage remain. It has been more than two years since the Prime Minister promised the new approach to closing the gap that Minister Wyatt spoke about. There were three targets—target 13, family violence; target 14, suicides; and target 17, Indigenous inclusion—that do not have any comparison data for non-Indigenous populations. Even if the adult incarceration goal were to be met, a reduction of 15 per cent by 2031—a goal that Labor has consistently argued needs to be more ambitious—the rate would still be more than 11 times higher than that for the non-Indigenous population. Even if the youth incarceration goal were to be met, a reduction of 30 per cent by 2031, the rate would still be more than 12 times higher than for the non-Indigenous population. And even if the out-of-home-care goal were to be met, a 45 per cent reduction by 2031, the rate would still be five times higher than for the non-Indigenous population. We cant allow ourselves to become desensitised to this deprivation. Hearing Minister Wyatts story of his own family brings that home. These are not just statistics; these are peoples lives.This week Labor has sought to break this cycle of policy stagnation. Our leader charted a practical and sensible way forward for closing the gap through empowering First Nations people. Listening to and empowering First Nations people is at the very heart of Labors approach to closing the gap. We remain committed to a constitutionally enshrined voice and we will put a referendum to the nation within the first term of an Albanese Labor government, but we will also make makarrata—treaty and truth telling—a priority. I say to all Australians: truth telling is not about shame or guilt. It is about moving forward. But we cant move forward by pretending that one part of the country has not been subjected to structural, industrial-scale disadvantage for centuries. If we want to understand the challenges, the disadvantage and the inequities of the present, it is crucial that we understand the roots of past trauma.The trauma of the past does not simply stay in the past. It has transcended generations, and we all see that. This is one of the fundamental and very practical functions of truth telling. A makarrata commission will be independent and have responsibility for truth telling and treaty making. It will work with the voice to parliament when it is established. It would oversee the establishment of an effective model of local truth-telling, including the support of local communities. It would inquire into matters of overarching national significance, including the causes of inequity from colonisation to the present day. It would recall and tell positive stories of survival and culture, as well as making an official record of colonisation, massacres, discrimination and resistance.With respect to treaty, it would recommend a framework for federal treaty making, taking into account the good work that has already been undertaken on this by the states and territories. It will consult with First Nations communities and will report within the first term of a Labor government. There can be no real progress on closing the gap and there can be no reconciliation without treaty and truth-telling. Labors commitment to making Makarrata a priority will realise these crucial elements of the Uluru statement.Last week we also saw the Prime Minister rule out a First Nations voice to the parliament before the next election. One of the desires expressed by First Nations people through the Uluru statement was a greater say in decisions, policies and laws that affect us—a generous and reasonable ask from a people who have survived centuries of dispossession, massacres and the destruction of families and communities—a new iteration of self-determination, not binding and certainly not a third chamber, but safe and secure from the whims of political interference from the government of the day through constitutional enshrinement. The Australian government asked First Peoples for their vision of constitutional recognition and reform, and this is it.In the few remaining minutes that I have, I want to quickly touch on the fact that Labor welcomes the establishment of a stolen generations compensation scheme. It was Labor that took stolen generations reparations to the last election: $75,000 in compensation plus $7,000 in auxiliary payments. We welcome the government coming onboard with this, never forgetting that there are members of this chamber today who walked out on the National Apology to the Stolen Generations 13½ years ago. We know that the Rudd Labor governments commencement of the national effort to close the gap as part of the National Apology to the Stolen Generations was in recognition of the issue of stolen generations. It recognises that the disparities and inequities we see today are inexplicably linked to the deprivation that arose from those paternalistic and misguided policies that the minister has outlined with his own family.We will charter a practical and sensible way on closing the gap. This is why in the past week Labor has committed to a national process of treaty making and truth-telling. A clear and accurate telling of Australias story is essential to helping us better understand and explain the causes of inequity and injustice. We have committed to strengthen economic and job opportunities for First Nations people, particularly through the Indigenous rangers program. Economic equality is absolutely fundamental. We cant have an addressing of structural disadvantage more broadly otherwise. Listening to and empowering First Nations people is clearly reflected in Labors approach to closing the gap. I recognise my party, I recognise the minister in the chair, and I also commit on behalf of Anthony Albanese to the many issues he raised in closing the gap last week.","Closing the Gap","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms BURNEY (Barton) ","(18:09):"
263,0,0,0,1,1,"Leeser, Julian, MP",109556,"Berowra","LP","N/A",7811," [by video link] Its an honour to follow both the minister and the shadow minister and to be followed by my good friend the Member for Lingiari in this debate, all three of whom have done much to educate me and share their knowledge of Australias Indigenous people and have committed their lives to the betterment of our First Nations people. Id like to start today in speaking about the important work of the Commonwealth Closing the Gap implementation plan by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land in my electorate where Im coming from today, the Dharug and Kuringgai people, and paying my respect to their elders past and present.This is a different Closing the Gap statement. It acknowledges weve entered into a new era of partnership between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples through the Coalition of Peaks and governments, and, in saying governments—plural—I mean Commonwealth, state and territory. There are two firsts in this process: the involvement of Aboriginal people in setting and delivering against the targets, and the involvement of all governments. One of the things I think is poorly understood is that, although in 1967 the people gave the Commonwealth power to make laws about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the truth is that most of the laws and policies which affect our First Nations people are made by the states and territories. So bringing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and all levels of government to the table is something of a watershed moment in our history.I want to acknowledge the leadership of the minister, the Prime Minister and Pat Turner in bringing this about. The way this Closing the Gap process has taken place is, in my view, a harbinger of what the voice can potentially achieve. It shows that real change can be achieved when you listen to and involve Indigenous people in the decisions that affect them. Speaking of watershed moments, I note that the Prime Minister in his remarks in the Closing the Gap statement added that 17 August marks 50 years since Neville Bonner delivered his maiden speech to the senate and became the first Indigenous person to serve in the parliament.I wanted to say something about Neville Bonner in these remarks as I had the privilege of getting to know Neville in February 1998 when we were both elected ACM—No Republic delegates at the constitutional convention. He was No. 2 on our Queensland senate ticket behind Sir James Killen. Like the other ACM delegates, we stayed at the Garden City Premier Inn at Narrabundah during that hot February fortnight. Neville wasnt well. He was suffering from the cancer that ultimately killed him. At night hed join other ACM delegates for a drink and dinner and he was often found outside having a smoko. He was warm, friendly and encouraging of this young bloke, and I remember the many distinctive rings he had on his fingers.Neville and I served on an important subcommittee of that convention: a cross-party grouping comprising both republicans and monarchists on the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It was the only truly bipartisan recommendation of that convention and was about having a referendum on Indigenous constitutional recognition regardless of your position on the republic. The committee was the genesis of my personal involvement in that issue, and I still regard constitutional recognition as important unfinished business.Neville Bonner made one of the two truly remarkable addresses to that convention, the other made by Sir James Killen. These two great parliamentarians—giants of our postwar politics—followed one another, and I was privileged to be in the chamber to hear these great orations. Bonner raised issues that day 23 years ago which are still with us and remain central to closing the gap. He said:From the bottom of my heart, I pray to you: stop this senseless division. Let us work together on the real issues. Let us solve those problems which haunt my people—the problems of land, of health, of unemployment, of the despair and hopelessness which leads even to suicide. Let us unite this country, not divide it ever—that toy of those who already have too much: mere symbolism.He then said:Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to end what I have already said by singing my Jagera sorry chant.Then he left us spellbound with that awe-inspiring chant. Even now I get goosebumps thinking about it. That chant provoked a long standing ovation—the only one of the convention. Reflecting on the day of his own maiden speech on 17 August 1971, Bonner on another occasion had this to say:As they were leading me up, I looked up and around the galleries and I could feel the whole Aboriginal race, of those who had gone before, were all up there, and I could visualise, I could hear voices and amongst those voices was the voice of my grandfather saying, Its alright now boy, you are finally in the council with the Australian Elders. Everything is now going to be alright.We cant make the promise that everything is going to be alright now, but we can promise to honour the memory of Neville Bonner by working to make this Closing the Gap Commonwealth parliamentary implementation plan successful in what it seeks to do. It seeks to address disadvantage, to build opportunities for Indigenous Australians and to build partnerships for working together.The government has committed a billion dollars to support new measures delivering on its commitments to co-design and work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and I think its worthwhile mentioning some of those measures. I want to say something about the Territories Stolen Generations Redress Scheme, and I think the shadow minister has already mentioned the financial compensation elements of it. I think there is actually a deeper and more important part of the redress scheme—that is, the opportunity for each survivor to confidentially tell their story about the impact of their removal to a senior official within government, and to have it acknowledged and receive a face-to-face written apology for the removal and resulting trauma. Too often in our country, people feel they are not being listened to by government and have nowhere to go to tell their story. So I think that this aspect is very important. One only needed to hear the voice of Pat Turner at the press conference, talking about her own mothers circumstances, to see how powerful such a measure will be.There are several measures in relation to closing the gap around child care and education which I think are important. There is $120 million to improve the lives of thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children through better access to early childhood education. As we know, one of the best ways to improve peoples lot in life is to ensure they have a good start with quality early childhood education, particularly for people who are disadvantaged—whether it is through the $81 million for an extra 27 new Connected Beginnings sites benefiting around 8½ thousand children, or money to fund up to 20 new childcare services in remote communities, or $9 million to create four new early years education programs in Queensland and Victoria. These will be significant measures. Importantly, there will be a $2 million trial of a new early learning teaching model to strengthen literacy and numeracy through explicit instruction. Evidence shows that play based learning alone may not be enough for some children and that explicit instruction can be more effective. The plan focuses not only on early education; it also focuses on greater investment in secondary schooling. There is $75 million to improve options for secondary schooling for Indigenous children in remote communities and a $25 million investment in Scaling Up Success, a program that ensures the best evidence based programs are used in our primary schools.I have the privilege of chairing the House Indigenous affairs committee and I want to say how important it is that we focus on Closing the Gap target 8, which is that by 2031 we will have increased to 62 per cent the proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 25 to 64 who are employed. That number currently sits at 51 per cent. The Indigenous affairs committee is currently undertaking an inquiry looking at pathways to economic opportunity for Indigenous Australians around employment and small business. Our committee has heard evidence from a number of businesses that are working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to build partnerships and identify opportunities for training and employment, and I want to revisit some of the evidence we have heard. Voyages is a company that, prior to COVID, employed 1,100 people in Central Australia, 400 of whom were Indigenous. They are the largest employer of Indigenous people in Central Australia. They run the National Indigenous Training Academy in partnership with the William Angliss Institute and Charles Darwin University. They are a training-to-employment organisation providing people with great opportunities in the hospitality and horticulture sectors.We heard from Woolworths, one of the largest employers of Indigenous Australians, employing 5,000 Indigenous people across the country, about their important cultural training and mentoring initiatives. We heard from the Accor hotels group, who have targets for the number of contracts of value procured from Indigenous businesses. Since the imposition of those targets, they have reported seeing an upward trend in their engagement with Indigenous business. We heard from the Minerals Council, who said they are working in partnership to provide pathways for skills training and business development. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up about 3.8 per cent of the mining workforce, and the number of Indigenous employees directly employed in mining has more than doubled in the decade to 2016. We also have heard much about the growth in Indigenous business, especially but not exclusively from the success of the governments Indigenous Procurement Policy, and the important links between Indigenous small business and Indigenous employment. An Indigenous businesses is 100 times more likely than a non-Indigenous business to employ other Indigenous Australians.In conclusion, the focus of this new Closing the Gap initiative is on partnerships. Partnerships are essential. They build connections between governments and our First Nations people and build opportunities across the country. We will continue to work to build those opportunities until we reach the day when children can grow up and, regardless of whether they are Indigenous or non-Indigenous, have the same expectations as any other Australian.","Closing the Gap","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LEESER (Berowra) ","(18:19):"
264,0,0,0,1,1,"Snowdon, Warren, MP","IJ4","Lingiari","ALP","N/A",7814," Firstly, let me say what an honour it is to be able to speak in this debate. I want to acknowledge the contribution just made by the member for Berowra, someone Ive come to call a friend, even though we have diverse—I would say, very different—views on a range of matters. Weve been working cooperatively together and in concert, along with my colleague the member for Newcastle, on the Aboriginal affairs committee. Its been a pleasure to work with him. I know Ive learned a bit, and I hope hes learned something along the way as well. Thank you very much for your contribution.I thank the member for Hasluck for the work hes been doing. We dont agree all the time, but his intentions are clear. I want to give him whatever support I can in his role. I would like to commend the member for Barton for her contribution, following on from the Leader of the Oppositions statement last week. They are significant statements in themselves and they bring to mind many of the things we need to properly comprehend.Having been in this place for some time, Ive been able to observe and be part of decisions and discussions which have caused hurt and heartache. I vividly remember 13 February 2008 and the apology by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. Im sad, though, because the previous Prime Minister refused to apologise and referred to the black armband view of history. When we contemplate the insult that that means, and where we are now in Australia when we discuss these issues, we must acknowledge how wrong he was. Those members of this chamber who either didnt appear at or walked out of the apology by Kevin Rudd are shamed.I want to thank the government for the reparation scheme they announced for the stolen generations last week. As the member for Barton said, it was a commitment made by Labor at the last election, and Im glad the government have picked it up. Following Kevin Rudds apology, there were many people who had tears of relief and hope. But so many of those people who applauded, acknowledged and were part of that decision and who saw the fulfilment of that apology have passed, so they will not be beneficiaries of this new scheme. Thats sad. I just hope we can get the current government, with great respect to the member for Hasluck, and the current Prime Minister to listen to people and to hear their advice.I acknowledge the role of the wonderful Pat Turner and the Coalition of Peaks. Pat is a friend and was a neighbour in Alice Springs. I know shes a formidable individual and someone with a great deal of experience but who is grounded in her family and in her community. I commend her for the role shes had in this Closing the Gap approach.I noted the Prime Ministers foreword in the report, in which he said, Too many opportunities have been missed to listen and to learn. Can I say, Prime Minister, there is no point just having selective hearing. We heard from Uluru, from the Uluru Statement from the Heart. We heard what people around this country want: a constitutionally entrenched voice. And now, as a result of the statement from last week, it is clear that we wont have a voice legislated during the course of this parliament, let alone any commitment to enshrine a voice in the Constitution. Thats why its important to contemplate and understand the merit in the three parts of the Uluru Statement from the Heart: the entrenched voice, the makarrata and truth-telling.Truth-telling goes to the heart of where were at. We as a nation have to appreciate and understand the extent of the institutionalised racism that has been the driver of our governments for over a century. That has to go. If that has to go, it means the Prime Minister not only has to say weve missed opportunities but now has to listen, learn and appreciate the intelligence and charity with which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders speak to us, the government, as a parliament. They speak with respect, but that respect needs to be returned by way of action. I note the priority reform targets within this new statement, the partnership and shared decision-making, the building of the community controlled sector, the sharing of access to data and information at a regional level and the transforming of government organisations. These are commendable objectives, but at their heart they mean listening to people and responding in a serious way to close the gap in health, education, employment, housing and so forth.I want to commend the Leader of the Opposition for the announcements that he made last week and the commitments that he made on behalf of the Labor Party not only to the voice but to the issues that were raised by the member for Barton about education and health. If I may, I want to make one observation about the member for Berowras contribution and the money that, as a result of last week, has been promised by this government for boarding facilities for remote communities. I ask the government to look at the reports of this parliament. The House of Representatives committee for which the member for Berowra is chairman brought down a report on education specifically around the issues to do with boarding schools. It has clearly not been read, appreciated or understood by this government, just as it has made observations about explicit instruction, particularly direct instruction. I ask the government to look seriously at these reports. The member for Berowra, the member for Newcastle and I are involved in the inquiry, as was the member for Durack. Look! Weve got them all here! They will understand what Im talking about. I say to you: please, please listen; read what has been researched and the advice that has been given by that committee.When I travel around the bush, which I do often, there are a number of driving requests that I have constantly, but there are two that are most important: housing and employment. We hear of housing because of the inadequacy of it and the failure of governments to properly respond in terms of making allocations that will address need. We think theres a shortfall of some billions of dollars, perhaps $5 billion, in housing alone in the Northern Territory. The other area is CDP. I know the member for Durack appreciates and understands what Im going to say here. Labor is committed to scrapping the current Community Development Program. We are committed to developing a new community based program, possibly designed on the principles of the old CDEP system. Thats what the community are asking for. I say to the Prime Minister and the member for Durack: if you think its time to listen and learn, well, listen, learn and act. Thats what we require you to do.","Closing the Gap","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SNOWDON (Lingiari) ","(18:30):"
265,0,0,0,1,1,"Conaghan, Patrick, MP",279991,"Cowper","Nats","N/A",7816," Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the traditional custodians, the Ngunawal and Ngambri people, and their elders past, present and emerging. I was very pleased last week to see the Prime Minister announce this governments latest Closing the Gap implementation plan, along with the redress scheme. It was extremely pleasing to see that language was specifically recognised as part of the rich inheritance of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples—its something I have been working with Indigenous people in my communities to expand—an inheritance that Closing the Gap, in that respect, specifically seeks to protect. There are 123 languages across our country, but only 14 of those are considered to be strong. This governments target, between now and 2031, is a steady increase in the number and strength of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community languages being spoken.I was also pleased to see, having spent 12 years enforcing the law and 18 years defending the law, a new focus on justice with new targets set so that, by 2031, we will reduce the rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults in custody by 15 per cent and juveniles by 30 per cent. There are far too many young Indigenous people in custody, and the low-hanging fruit here is to look at those offences that send people to jail that dont involve public safety, such as traffic offences that involve an administrative component. There are people in custody right now serving terms of imprisonment for driving whilst disqualified. That potentially could have started because that young Indigenous man or that young Indigenous woman didnt have a birth certificate, so therefore they couldnt get a licence and, therefore, they drove without a licence on multiple occasions. Its not so much a public safety offence as an administrative offence, which can see them in prison for up to two years.I was also very pleased to speak with former Aboriginal affairs minister Robert Tickner, who is now serving as the chair of the Justice Reform Initiative. I know that he has done a lot of work, both in his past life and since leaving this place, for the advancement of Indigenous people and their culture. If he requires any assistance, I look forward to offering him that assistance.I recognise the Commonwealth doesnt manage those justice systems, but where we can make a difference is in bringing people together and the provision of additional funding for support, such as the $9.3 million for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services to better manage complex cases and coronial inquiries. I have seen how stretched that they are in their funding, so it was pleasing to see that. A further $8.2 million in funding is for family dispute resolution programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families.Importantly, this Closing the Gap implementation plan is a commitment by the government to work in partnership with and to listen to Indigenous peoples. Quite clearly the key two words in my last sentence were partnership and listen, because that is exactly what this government—all governments at all levels—must do: that is, partner with our Indigenous people and listen, really listen, to our Indigenous people.In my own electorate of Cowper, we have a significant number of Indigenous people through Coffs Harbour, Kempsey, Bowraville and the wider Nambucca area. I acknowledge the Birrbay people and the Dhanggati-Thangatti and Gumbaynggirr nations.Earlier this month the government announced $126 million to help improve education for thousands of Indigenous students. Education is a key part of our governments plan to close the gap. I accept that there is still that massive chasm. NAPLAN data shows that Indigenous students are, on average, more than two years behind their non-Indigenous peers in year 3. And that gap continues to grow over time. So this significant financial boost will hopefully help focus on scaling up programs that we know lift outcomes for our Indigenous students. The primary focus will be on important areas such as reading, maths, attendance at school and school completion.In Coffs Harbour, in my own electorate, Gumbaynggirr Giingana Freedom School is looking to open in early 2022. I was very pleased to bring Minister Wyatt down and speak to him about that project. That project aims to establish the Gumbaynggirr Giingana school, an Aboriginal bilingual independent primary school, for Aboriginal students on the Coffs Coast. Clark Webb, the CEO, is a remarkable young man. He established the Bularri Muurlay Nyanggan Aboriginal Corporation, and he is the driving force behind this plan. Bularri muurlay nyanggan translates to two paths strong in the Gumbaynggirr language. Their footprint extends from the Nambucca Valley all the way up to Grafton, and theyre currently engaged with over 200 people in cultural and educational programs each year. The organisation was formed 10 years ago, and it now includes three Goori learning centres, a Nyanggan tutoring program, Gumbaynggirr language and cultural revitalisation programs, the Wajaarr Ngaarlu dance troupe, cultural camps, the Nyanggan Gapi Cafe and a cultural experience tourism venture. Clark is a very proud First Nations man who was raised to never allow anyone to make him believe the Goori people are any less than anyone else. That great strength in his heritage shows that, when Indigenous children are strong in their identity, they engage much better in learning. Once operational, the school will provide a culturally strong, safe and thriving learning environment where the Gumbaynggirr world view and language drive and enrich the entire learning experience.The Closing the Gap Implementation Plan sets out the actions this government is taking to drive and embed real and positive change. Each relevant stakeholder must be part of a collaborative effort to achieve this desired outcome during this process. Importantly, the programs and policies to achieve our goals will be the responsibility of all involved—everyone. This is being achieved through the partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, a true partnership. This relationship is central to the design and monitoring of specific actions under the implementation plan, evolving the way we work together to better deliver the desired outcomes for the Indigenous community and Australians as a whole. The implementation plan will require significant change in how all governments work on all levels. Like previous efforts in closing the gap, socioeconomic targets have been set to measure whether efforts are being made to make a difference.As the Minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said last week, this announcement reflects the governments commitment to recognising and acknowledging the wrongs of the past as part of a nations journey to reconciliation, and this scheme represents a major step forward towards healing. This is a journey for all Australians.","Closing the Gap","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CONAGHAN (Cowper) ","(18:39):"
266,0,0,0,1,1,"Payne, Alicia, MP",144732,"Canberra","ALP","N/A",7818," It is a great honour to be part of this debate on the statement on closing the gap this year. I want to make my own acknowledgement that we are meeting, as this parliament does every day, on the land of the Ngunawal and Ngambri people. I acknowledge their contribution to our community and region and acknowledge their elders past, present and emerging.It is a great honour to follow many of the speakers in this debate, who have devoted their lives to reconciliation and to closing that gap in the lives of Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. I want to acknowledge the Minister for Indigenous Australians and the shadow minister, the member for Barton, who spoke before me, and also the member for Lingiari, who, in his many years in this place, has worked very hard on this issue. It is an honour to be on our Labor First Nations caucus committee with the member for Barton and Senators McCarthy and Dodson, and to work with them on these issues. It was a particular honour on Reconciliation Day here in the ACT to host a panel discussion on reconciliation with Senator Dodson, Senator McCarthy and the member for Barton, and to hear their views on reconciliation and, very much so, the importance of the Uluru Statement from the Heart to this.As we look at closing the gap each year, the depth of the gap that is experienced between First Nations people and other Australians is a shame on this nation. This year is no different. Of 17 targets, only three are on track to be met. As the member for Grayndler, our leader, said in his statement:A gap is something that is easily crossed or closed. The unflinching litany of lopsided statistics before us makes it clear that this is a chasm.Young Indigenous Australians are 24 times more likely to be incarcerated than their non-Indigenous peers and they make up 100 per cent of children in detention in the Northern Territory. Indigenous Australians are the most incarcerated group of people on this earth, and that is a shame on this nation and this parliament. Indigenous children today are being placed in out-of-home care at 10 times the rate of non-Indigenous children and make up 36 per cent of children living away from their parents, even though they represent only six per cent of all children.As we look at the targets, even if the adult incarceration goal were to be met, which is a 15 per cent reduction by 2031, the rate would still be more than 11 times higher than for the non-Indigenous population. Even if the youth incarceration goal were to be met, a 30 per cent reduction by 2031, the rate would still be more than 12 times higher than for the non-Indigenous population. And even if the out-of-home-care goal for children were met, a 45 per cent reduction by 2031, the rate would still be five times higher than that for the non-Indigenous population. And there isnt even a defined suicide reduction goal—theres a range of trajectories, from a 20 per cent to a 75 per cent reduction.As the member for Barton has said, we must not become desensitised to this level of deprivation. As others have also talked about, what is central to solving these problems, which we see after years of looking at the Closing the Gap targets every year, is that we need to do this differently. We have listened to First Nations Australians through the process of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, and they have said what it is they want to change. They have respectfully asked this parliament for voice, treaty and truth, but that respect, at this point, is not being returned. We are not truly listening to First Nations Australians until we implement this in full, and that will help to address these problems. We, as non-Indigenous Australians, cannot begin to fully understand the intergenerational trauma that is experienced as a result of the settlement of this country. But what we cant ignore is that the dispossession of First Nations Australians is fundamental to the establishment of Australia as we know it today, and that trauma continues in these statistics that we look at each year.The Uluru statement has asked for truth-telling, for a process in order to come to terms with our very dark history in this country, and to move on from that. As the member for Barton also said, truth-telling is not about shame or guilt, but about moving forward, and that is something that we need to do together. The statement has asked for a voice to this parliament, a constitutionally enshrined voice to this parliament so that the answers to some of these problems can be found independent of the government of the day. This is incredibly important, and this is something that Im proud that Labor is committed to in full. I call on the government and the Greens party to follow us in this. It is incredibly important to address these issues and have a voice enshrined in the Constitution to give a meaningful voice to this parliament on how to address the trauma and the issues facing First Nations people today. The Uluru statement has asked for a treaty, a makarrata commission, and a Labor government would be committed to establishing this with urgency.Last week we saw the Prime Minister announce a $380 million redress scheme for survivors of the stolen generations in the ACT, the Northern Territory and the Jervis Bay Territory. Labor welcomes this, of course, and I particularly want to welcome it on behalf of my Canberra community, many of whom will be impacted by this. I want to acknowledge that, while there is a financial payment in recognition of the unthinkable treatment that people endured, an important part of this scheme is also the opportunity to tell their story, if they would like to, and to receive an apology. I acknowledge how important that is for the broader addressing of this. We welcome that, but we need to do so much more. We need to be listening to First Nations people about how to address some of these issues, and that is exactly what a voice to parliament that is enshrined in the Constitution, a makarrata commission, would enable us to do.There are proven ways to reduce the causes of incarceration and deaths in custody. It has been more than 30 years since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody handed down its findings and 339 recommendations. But, tragically, hundreds of First Nations Australians have died in custody or in police pursuits since then. I commend the Change the Record movement for what they have been doing on that. A key issue linked to the incarceration of Indigenous people in Australia is the age of criminal responsibility. Im proud that the ACT is the first jurisdiction to commit to lowering this, as the UN has recommended, because at the moment in this country children as young as 10 can be incarcerated. I think that is clearly wrong. Im proud that the ACT has made that commitment, but it is something that all states and territories will hopefully move towards, and it is something we should address with urgency. There are proven ways to reduce the causes of incarceration and deaths in custody, and Labor has announced a plan to turn the tide on incarceration and deaths in custody by building on the success of the existing justice reinvestment programs in Bourke to tackle the root causes of crime and reoffending. These include rehabilitation services, family or domestic violence support, homelessness support and school retention initiatives. Where we see programs that are working, we should try to replicate them. Labor will provide specific standalone funding for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services to ensure First Nations families can access culturally appropriate, timely and fair legal assistance before, during and after all coronial processes, and Labor would ensure that deaths in custody are nationally reported in real time. It is extraordinary that in 2021 this counts as innovation.In 1967 First Nations people asked to be counted, and in 2017 they asked to be heard. I call on the government to implement the Uluru statement in full.","Closing the Gap","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms PAYNE (Canberra) ","(18:50):"
267,0,0,0,1,1,"McCormack, Michael, MP",219646,"Riverina","Nats","N/A",7820," I acknowledge that I am speaking on the land of the Ngunawal and Ngambri peoples. I acknowledge too that my home town, Wagga Wagga, is in the land of the Wiradjuri. I acknowledge that the shadow Indigenous Australians minister, Linda Burney, the member for Barton, is a Wiradjuri woman, having been born at Whitton. I acknowledge the outstanding work that has been done by the Minister for Indigenous Australians, and I know that work continues. I also want to acknowledge the outstanding work that has been done by the former Minister for Regional Health. Amongst other things, the work that the member for Parkes did has been noted and recognised in the fact that Indigenous Australians have not suffered a death, as was acknowledged by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Grayndler, during this global pandemic. The fact that we as a nation have been able to keep this deadly virus out of those remote Aboriginal communities is something we can all be very proud of, something where we can all say weve done a good job.There is, of course, much more work to be done, as there is much more work to be done in this particular motion with closing the gap. Each and every year we stand here as members of parliament and acknowledge that the work continues. Certainly we can be pleased with some of the targets that we have reached, but we can also look at many of the others, including the incarceration rates, and say there is much more to be done.I was very pleased to be with the minister to attend the Barunga Festival in the Northern Territory in June and the following day go to Mornington Island. This followed a visit from the Mornington Island mayor, Councillor Kyle Yanner, and a group of his supporters and advocates for a better deal for his very remote shire, his very remote community, with a population just a tick over 1,000 in the Gulf of Carpentaria. They came to see me. I was Deputy Prime Minister at the time and I knew that I was going to be Acting Prime Minister in the not-too-distant future, so I thought what better opportunity to go to this island than in that capacity, in that role, and to hear and listen to those communities and their needs and wants. I think this strikes at the very heart of what we are addressing here with closing the gap. This is a community that has large gaps which indeed need to be closed.It was a pleasure to visit the island, to be shown around this small community and to hear the sorts of issues that they need dealt with, including overcrowding in their housing. This community was identified by the Courier Mail as a community that had been largely forgotten by the mainland, and I wanted to assure that community that it had not been forgotten, was not being forgotten and will not be forgotten in the future.As I left the role of Deputy Prime Minister, there werent many things that I did ask to follow up, because Id done a lot of them. But one of the things that I really wanted to see ticked off—and I will follow it up and I have also spoken to Councillor Yanner—was that I wanted the Mornington Island issue supported. To that end, they have applied for a Building Better Regions Fund for a water park or a swimming pool. It is extraordinary that in the 21st century a community of that size in that area, with the heat and the climate that they deal with not just every summer but indeed every day, dont have a water park for their children. I really would like to see that as part of the BBRF, and, if their application is not successful for whatever reason, then I think we as a government have an obligation to support that in the future.It was great to go to Barunga the day before, on 12 June in fact, as Acting Prime Minister. I was the highest ranked MP who had visited the festival since Bob Hawke in 1988. With more than 4,000 attendees, the cultural, musical and sporting festival they put on has to be seen to be believed. The Barunga Festival director, Mark Grose, said the pandemic has had an impact on remote Indigenous communities, many of whom have been unable to travel throughout the last year. He said, Nothing is more important than keeping people safe, and we are so glad that with the assistance of NT Health and NT Police a sense of togetherness could be reintroduced to start the mental healing of communities after lockdown. Barunga has once again shown the way. Indeed it did. It was a marvellous festival. I know that Minister Wyatt and many other MPs; senators, including Senator Sam McMahon; and Northern Territory MPs from both political persuasions were there. I know the member for Lingiari was there. We shared in some fellowship but we shared in the common goal of ensuring that this festival remains a feature of the Northern Territory calendar and that we need to do everything we can and will in the future for Closing the Gap measures and interventions and for Closing the Gap togetherness, as MPs, above the political partisanship that we often show. This needs to be done on a bipartisan level and there was certainly a lot of bipartisanship at the festival.I know that these communities require more infrastructure, and the road leading to this site and this particular camping ground also needs to be fixed up. I would like to see that done as part of the enormous amount of money that we are spending on Northern Territory infrastructure. I know that we as a government will work closely with the Gunner government in the Northern Territory to see if we can do that in the future, because it would be money well spent.For 35 years the Barunga Festival has been a special event not just for the Northern Territory but indeed for Australia. It brings Indigenous communities together to meet, to compete and to share. The invitation is always there for non-Indigenous Australians to experience a unique window into this remote community and its unique way of life. It is celebrated for the community rather than politics. Its simplicity, potency and focus on people has created a natural case study in reconciliation. Those words come from the Barunga Festival promoters. They are words very well spoken, because what that weekend again highlighted and showed to me is that Indigenous communities do want to take a lot of responsibility for and leadership of their own destiny and their own future. What is done by the Barunga Festival promoters and the Mornington Island community and its leaders, led so very well by Councillor Yanner—hes only a young bloke, but hes doing some mighty things and I know hes got the communitys heart and belief very much at the core of his being. They will do some great things, but they will need the assistance of this government and of this parliament. Ive given them the assurance that they will certainly have that from me.Closer to the home, I acknowledge the work that is being done around the Riverina and central west by Wiradjuri elders. I commend what Stan Grant Sr has done in ensuring that the Wiradjuri language has not been lost. The volumes of work that he has produced certainly feature in my home library. They are a good resource for the Wiradjuri language. It is important to acknowledge, and I know this fact was acknowledged by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition last week, that Aboriginal languages need preserving and protecting and to be taught in Australian schools for those students and by those schools who wish to do so. I know this is going to be an important fact going forward.But there is much more work that can, that will and that must be done to close the gap in terms of life span, in terms of health outcomes, in terms of incarceration rates and the like for Indigenous Australians. We need to make sure that we continue to do what we can. I know the 5 August declaration, the Commonwealth releasing its first Closing the Gap Implementation Plan, is a good start, but much more work needs to be done.","Closing the Gap","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr McCORMACK (Riverina) ","(19:00):"
268,0,0,0,1,1,"Dreyfus, Mark, MP","HWG","Isaacs","ALP","N/A",7822," Last week Australians learnt that, just a year after the Morrison government announced it was resetting the Closing the Gap targets, only three of those 17 targets are now on track. So I do welcome the governments announcement last week that it will now provide substantial resources to try to get these targets back on track, and all the more so if this is new money that is being allocated and not simply existing commitments being taken from one vital program and being redirected to others.Of course, I believe I join with the vast majority of Australians in welcoming the decision to at last fund a redress scheme for the surviving members of the stolen generations. Ive had a long personal connection to many members of that group, having acted for them in the test case we brought to the Federal Court and the High Court, and which the Howard government then threw all the legal resources of the Commonwealth at in defeating. I hope that this new redress scheme is rolled out quickly and smoothly to deliver a measure of justice for surviving members of the stolen generations and to help address some of the intergenerational trauma those terrible policies of the federal government caused over those years.For this redress program to be effective, it is important that the government does not repeat any of the multitude of mistakes it has made administering the redress scheme for victim-survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. With many members of the stolen generation already, sadly, having passed away and many others now approaching the end of their lives, I call on the government to recognise that, in this case, justice delayed is justice denied absolutely, and that the government must approach this redress scheme with a true sense of urgency. Labor made clear that, while we welcome justice targets, the justice targets set by this government are not ambitious enough. But to achieve even these unambitious targets will require significant action to be taken, because the relationship between First Nations people and the Australian justice system is an ongoing area of great difficulty. This government needs to start listening to Indigenous Australians about how to change that relationship.In this context, I note that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services have long played a vital role in mediating and, to the extent they can, ensuring just outcomes for First Nations people who encounter the justice system. Until last year, ATSILS operated with a significant degree of autonomy in carrying out their vital role. But last year the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services were, against the strident objections of their leadership and the communities that they serve, folded into a newly established national mechanism by the former Attorney-General.This decision directly contradicted not only the clearly expressed views of the Indigenous community but also the very first recommendation of the governments own review of the Indigenous legal assistance program that was commissioned and received by the government last year. That first recommendation stated:To facilitate a sustainable, community-controlled Indigenous legal assistance sector, Commonwealth Government funding should continue to be delivered through a standalone, specific purpose funding program with minimum five-year funding terms.Indigenous groups expressed outrage at this decision by the government. In an open letter, some 100 organisations stated that the Morrison governments decision to ignore the key recommendation of the ILAP review was disappointing, not least because the federal government has been committed to and responsible for the funding and administration of ATSILS since their inception almost 50 years ago. This began after the 1967 referendum in recognition of the Commonwealths special responsibility for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is important to retain this Commonwealth leadership. The organisations continued:All evidence and research show that working in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and ACCOs is the best way forward. The Federal Government should honour its long-standing commitment, keep ILAP and adequately fund ATSILS to close the justice gap.I trust that this misconceived approach to Indigenous justice shown by those actions last year is now behind us, and that the government will now seek to engage more respectfully and more constructively with First Nations communities on how to achieve the Closing the Gap justice targets.To that end, I welcome the specific commitment by the Attorney-General and the Minister for Indigenous Australians of additional funding of $9.3 million for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander legal services for expensive and complex cases and to support criminal justice reform through coronial inquiries, $8.3 million for culturally safe and appropriate dispute resolution for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and $7.6 million to establish and support the justice policy partnership between all Australian governments and Indigenous representatives. As always, we need to see this announcement matched with delivery and, if we are to even come close to reaching these new targets, for this money to be rolled out quickly.There is a great deal more I could say about justice targets and about the commitments that Labor has already made to improve justice outcomes if we win government, including through a commitment to expand and strengthen justice reinvestment programs. But justice is about far more than just court cases; justice is about far more than keeping people out of jail, so I want to say a little bit about what I feel is this federal governments betrayal of justice in its broader sense. In my view, in its undermining of meaningful action on all three of the requests in the Uluru Statement from the Heart, this government is betraying the hopes and aspirations of First Nations people and, in doing that, betraying justice in its broadest sense.Unlike this government, Labor is committed to honouring the Uluru Statement from the Heart and, through this, to working towards justice and a genuine reconciliation with First Nations people. Honouring the Uluru statement includes working with First Nations people to establish an Indigenous voice to the parliament enshrined in our nations Constitution. We in Labor are committed to making that happen. The Morrison government is opposed to it.The Uluru statement also calls for a national process of treaty and truth-telling overseen by a makarrata commission. Labor has committed to honouring that request by establishing in government as a matter of priority a makarrata commission. That commissions oversight of truth-telling would include inquiring into matters of national significance from colonisation to the present day as well as supporting local truth-telling projects with local government and community organisations. And the commissions oversight of treaty would include developing a framework for federal treaty-making, taking into account existing state and territory processes.The government has shown no interest in progressing either truth-telling or treaty. Honouring all three parts of the Uluru Statement from the Heart is vital to redressing deep generational injustices that still impact First Nations people and communities. If the government is serious about providing justice for First Nations people, if the Prime Minister is genuine in what he claims is his desire to work respectfully with Indigenous Australians to close the gap in justice outcomes, he should start by honouring rather than trashing the Uluru Statement from the Heart.","Closing the Gap","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DREYFUS (Isaacs) ","(19:10):"
269,0,0,0,1,1,"van Manen, Bert, MP",188315,"Forde","LNP","N/A",7824," Its a pleasure to rise in this House and speak on the Closing the Gap Commonwealth implementation plan. As Im sure many speakers, already, in their contributions tonight have acknowledged, much work has been done but much work still needs to be done. I want to take this opportunity tonight to not only speak about some of the terrific work thats being done locally in my electorate of Forde but, at the same time, acknowledge that in our regional and remote communities there are some very, very difficult problems being faced in those communities that are not necessarily reflected in my local community.But there are still many difficulties and many problems, whether it is in the youth justice system and engaging with the justice system; whether it is in the education system and being fully engaged in education; whether it is the opportunity to gain stable, secure long-term employment that provides the opportunity to build wealth, build families, build self-confidence or whether its the opportunity to get appropriate housing. All of these issues still exist in my community of Forde and thats why Im so pleased with the focus of the Closing the Gap, which is not only really starting to target these issues but, more importantly, is engaging with the Indigenous community in how we solve those problems.In that regard, at this point I would like to single out the work of the Beenleigh Housing and Development Company, led by CEO, Will Davis. Theyve been working for a number of years to develop a community-led housing project, and I fully support that project. Id also like to thank Minister Wyatt for his willingness to look at that proposal to build a housing project that is designed to meet the needs of our local Indigenous community. Sadly, it probably wont be located in my electorate of Forde, but it will be located in the electorate of my good friend the member for Wrights electorate, probably down around Jimboomba or somewhere in that area. Our communities that we represent, whether its the Yugambeh people in the south of my electorate, who also go into the electorate of the member for Wright, or the Yuggera to the north, are very much engaged in the discussion about how we resolve these issues for their communities. They include people like Uncle Ted Williams and Aunty Robyn Williams, both descendants of Bilin Bilin, who is frequently referred to as the King of the Logan and Albert rivers. I also reflect on the recent 50th anniversary of Senator Neville Bonner, who was a Yuggera man.We can see that these communities have a rich history on which to build. If you have a look at the stories that are told through the Spirits of the Red Sand production at the Beenleigh Historical Village, you start to get a better understanding of the history of the interaction between the Yugambeh people and the original German settlers, and later, more broadly, English and European settlers. Sadly, there are stories that you hear from many places around Australia of massacres and people being treated extremely poorly. Even the story of the Spirits of the Red Sand tells us some of the things that happened to that community over that time. But, equally, it tells a story of the successes and integration of those communities, and at the end celebrates the success of where all of our communities have come from as a result.One of the important things in the Closing the Gap Implementation Plan was a focus on language. I think language is particularly important because it helps you to understand where youve come from. It is a vital part of culture, because it allows you to keep the history of your culture alive by understanding and keeping the language alive. Rory OConnor, the son of Aunty Patricia OConnor, one of the Yugambeh elders, wrote a book: Walan ya Nimbulima—Back From Lost. Its about ensuring the survival of the Yugambeh language, and that it doesnt just survive but thrives.Id like to take the opportunity to acknowledge some of the work being done at our local schools to do exactly that. At Beenleigh State High School, they have an Indigenous support unit, called Mibunn Jinndi, where they provide support for Indigenous students throughout the Beenleigh community. Eagleby South State School have a proud, strong focus on outcomes for Indigenous students, but a key part of that is ensuring they understand the language to acknowledge and respect their identity and their culture. Waterford West State School, my old state school, has a Yugambeh language program that provides students with the opportunity to see language as a means of real communication rather than simply as an object of study.At Marsden State High School, the Indigenous support unit, Deadly @ Marsden, supports the Indigenous students at Marsden State High School through mentoring, tutoring and connecting with external organisations and activities such as education support; social, emotional and cultural wellbeing; health checks through the Deadly Choices program; Indigenous camps; Beyond the Broncos; and an extraordinarily good rugby league and football program. Part of a recent discussion that Ive had with Marsden State High School is to engage with Adam Sarota and Jade North, who have both played for the Brisbane Roar Football Club but who now have their own Indigenous business doing landscaping and construction, as a way to get kids at Marsden State High School engaged in the workforce.All of these practical measures that are being undertaken by our community in Forde are a practical demonstration of the fact that our community wants to help itself to be better and to resolve the problems that it faces—and they acknowledge those problems. But equally important was the funding that this government provided to Beenleigh Housing and Development Company—I think it was three years ago now—which has been very successful in allowing them to run mentoring and youth programs, and a range of other programs, to start to deal with some of these issues at the coalface.To everybody involved across the electorate of Forde I want to say thank you for your efforts. I commit to continuing to work with you through the implementation plan and other measures, to helping to continue to resolve the issues that you face in our community and to ensuring that the Indigenous youth of the community of Forde have the opportunity to realise their potential, just like everyone else.","Closing the Gap","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VAN MANEN (Forde—Chief Government Whip) ","(19:17):"
270,0,0,0,1,1,"Gosling, Luke, MP",245392,"Solomon","ALP","N/A",7826," More than a year after the new Closing the Gap agreement was signed, this delayed report brings us grim news. First Nations people are still far more likely to be jailed, to die by suicide and to have their children removed than non-Indigenous Australians. Out of the 17 targets that have been set, only three are on track to be reached. In the Northern Territory we live proudly side by side with more than 60,000 years of culture, heritage and connection to country. We celebrate our First Nations cultures and stories, but we also have a front-row seat to our nations failure to progress on closing the gap.I welcome the governments announcement of a new $378 million redress scheme for people forcibly removed from their families as children. This is good news for my electorate, where stolen generation members have been fighting for compensation for decades. Im thinking of those who were abused at the Retta Dixon Home in Darwin, and I thank all those who have fought for their compensation and for so many thousands of others across the NT who suffered in many different institutions and who have been fighting for so long to be recognised.I would like to pay tribute to survivors like Eileen Cummings from the Northern Territory Stolen Generations Aboriginal Corporation. Eileen does not claim to speak for all survivors, but her words do tell a story. In 1948, when she was just four, she was taken off the Arnhem Land cattle station that she lived on and where her mother was a domestic servant. She didnt see her mother again for almost a decade and, shamefully, her story is all too common. Nationally, its estimated that as many as one in three Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their families under government policies from 1910 to 1970. Eileen said she was overjoyed to learn of the compensation scheme for survivors who were under 18 years of age when they were taken. Eileen said today: Weve been fighting for such a long time. You keep asking us for reconciliation. How can we reconcile when the history of this country is denying these stolen children? If you want us to reconcile you have to take ownership of that injustice. Eileen said of the compensation amount: Some say the money is not enough. But I dont care if its not enough, its something. To me its taking responsibility and saying that something happened to us, and thats what I wanted all along.Eileen was planning to retire from the Northern Territory Stolen Generations Aboriginal Corporation committee in November, but says she will keep going until the money is paid out. Shes worried the payments wont begin until March next year and that more survivors, like countless before them, might die before they and their families are compensated. She said: Im fighting for the deceased and their children. Theyve waited so long, why do they have to wait even longer?I just want to echo what Eileen Cummings is saying. It is representative of so many members of the stolen generation who were forcibly taken from their families. Again, I welcome the governments move to announce this funding to provide compensation to those NT members of the stolen generation.Debate interrupted.","Closing the Gap","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GOSLING (Solomon) ","(19:26):"

272,0,0,0,1,1,"Mulino, Daniel, MP",132880,"Fraser","ALP","N/A",7827," [by video link] My electorate of Fraser has been hard hit by COVID. Victoria is now in its sixth lockdown. These lockdowns have been necessary, but they have hit small and medium-sized businesses across Fraser hard. They have reduced the income of many casual and insecure workers, adversely affecting both them and their families. They have disrupted the education of students—those just starting prep all the way through to those trying to complete year 12. And, of course, too many residents of my community have also had firsthand experience of a family member or a friend getting sick or dying of COVID. In Fraser and in Melbournes west more broadly, COVID isnt an abstract concept that only happens to people overseas. Fraser residents know the damage it causes and why vaccines are so important.After the ordeals endured in 2020, we ask ourselves: why has Victoria experienced six lockdowns? There are two reasons, and they are same two reasons that more than half of Australia is currently in lockdown. First, the Scott Morrison government has failed to put in place an effective quarantine system. Even after warnings, the Halton report in 2020 and many international reports pointing out that hotel quarantine is not fit for purpose, this government has not invested in quarantine facilities. It has relied upon state governments for proposals and has been completely reactive. Australia has experienced over 25 breaches of hotel quarantine. It is a system that is a not fit for purpose. These breaches have cause outbreaks and necessitated lockdowns. The other main reason, of course, is that Australia has one of the slowest vaccination rollouts in the OECD. Our lockdowns are more severe and more lengthy than they need to have been. These lockdowns are costing around $300 million per day across the country, as well as taking an incalculable human toll.But as much as its important to point out the dire state of this governments performance, its also important for me to point out that the people of Fraser have so much to be hopeful about when we do get through this pandemic. Labor has a plan to rebuild our country and our economy and to invest in our society. Firstly, I want to point to the Melbourne Airport Rail link. Fraser is located in the heart of the fastest growing region in Australia. It is close to the CBD, Melbourne Airport and regional Victoria. Improving our connectivity will be crucial to delivering the jobs and the growth that we need. Fraser will benefit from the massive investment in the Melbourne Airport Rail link. The Melbourne Airport Rail link is a-once-in-a-generation opportunity—an incredible infrastructure project that will provide transport opportunities for local residents to get to the CBD, the airport and other parts of Melbourne and regional Victoria. It will also be a catalyst for economic development, making precincts across my electorate a more attractive place to live in, work in and visit.Im keen to work with all three levels of government and with community stakeholders to ensure that the community gets the most out of the incredible opportunity of this major project. Ive spoken with many residents about this project, in regard to both what they are excited about and also some of their concerns. Now is the time for individuals and community groups to come forward and add their ideas and input to make sure that this project delivers in the right way for our community. This project is a golden chance for the Albion area. We need to ensure that the station and the area around it are improved and that the area provides as much amenity for the local community as possible. It is critical that the federal government listens to the concerns and suggestions of the local community. The investments of the MARL can also help to realise the potential of the Sunshine precinct as a hub for jobs, education, training and health.I also want to point out that, in relation to health, the Andrews government has delivered so much when it comes to health in my electorate and its surrounds over the last six years. This includes the brand-new Joan Kirner Womens and Childrens Hospital and substantial investment in Sunshine Hospital. Of course, it is also building brand-new general hospitals at Footscray and Melton. Three new hospitals for one health authority is a remarkable achievement, indeed—and a transformative set of projects for Melbournes west. This is a sign of what we as a federal government would do, working hand in glove with a pro-healthcare state government, when elected. With the Andrews government, we would build on these substantial existing achievements.The people of Fraser are doing it tough, but Im confident that we will defeat this delta outbreak. And, just as importantly, Im confident that an Albanese government will invest in Fraser and ensure that families, workers, students and those in the healthcare services will all get more opportunities.

273,0,0,0,1,1,"Coulton, Mark, MP","HWN","Parkes","Nats","N/A",7828," Id like to update the House on a significant business thats in my electorate of Parkes, at Narrabri. The business is called Australian Recycled Plastics, and it was started by Dale and Helen Smith back in 2013. Dale and Helen are very successful farmers in the Wee Waa area. They also have a significant trucking company that largely carts cotton to port on behalf of the growers of the Namoi Valley. Dale and Helen recognised that there was a need to establish a new industry, not only for the security of their own family and their own business but also to take advantage of the significant opportunities of recycling.I happened to be there last week to talk to them about a grant that they received through the Recycling Modernisation Fund, a bit over $2 million, to go towards an update of their plant that will enable them to simultaneously separate PET and HDPE, which will help that facility to actually reach its potential of 9,300 tonnes per annum. Dale Smith was telling me that the emphasis on recycling and return and earn in New South Wales in particular have improved the quality of the plastics coming through to their plant, but there is still an issue with having to compete with an overseas market. They are struggling at the moment with COVID and the fact that some of this material is making its way overseas. Now, legislation will change that, I think, following the decision that was made that Australia will recycle all its own product.Whats significant about where the Smiths are at Narrabri is that their factory is adjacent to the proposed Inland Rail, quite near where the Narrabri Shire Council intends to build their inland port. Also, probably more importantly, the proposed Santos gas field, which is right on the edge of Narrabri, would provide a source of energy into that plant. What they are doing now, after breaking down the recyclable material, is selling that shredded material or chip material to others to configure. With the advent of gas, they would be able to do a lot of that themselves.One of the expenses of recycling is freight. Its bulky but not particularly heavy. So the Inland Rail, which for the first time connects every capital in this country by rail, has the potential not only to help grow their business but also to make Narrabri probably the largest plastic-recycling area in the country. So it is a very, very exciting time. Ive got great admiration for people like the Smiths, who see an opportunity, take a risk, invest, work hard, employ local people and actually succeed. I was pleased that Minister Ley was able to support them, through that modernisation fund, so that they can reach their full potential. It wasnt long ago—people in this House would remember—that pretty well all our recyclable materials were sent overseas. Not only was that an expense; it was an opportunity lost for this country.I believe that we are becoming more conscious of reusing materials. The recycling industry is an important one. I believe that the drive and innovation shown by Dale and Helen Smith at Narrabri is leading the way in what can be achieved in a regional centre. You dont have to be in a capital city to run a nationally important business. Theyve shown that. Im pleased that this government is able to support them to grow their business for the future.","Australian Recycled Plastics","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr COULTON (Parkes) ","(19:35):"
274,0,0,0,1,1,"Mitchell, Rob, MP","M3E","McEwen","ALP","N/A",7829," [by video link] Right now Australians across this country and in our electorate of McEwen are fed up. Weve been plunged into uncertainty and disruption because of a non-existent federal quarantine system and a slow vaccine rollout. The economy is bleeding hundreds of millions of dollars a day and billions of dollars each week because this Prime Minister hasnt done his job. He didnt get the vaccines. He hasnt built the quarantine.Were the last in the developed world when it comes to having our population fully vaccinated. There are still people in the vulnerable priority category yet to be vaccinated. The delta variant is racing through this country, and everyday Australians are bearing the burden of a government that has left them behind.The strength and resilience of everyday Australians in our capacity to meet hardships head-on is what has defined us and is what will continue to define us as we navigate this long, hard road out of the pandemic. At a time when our federal government is shirking its responsibility to our nation, I look to our electorate of McEwen and the stories of everyday people and their contributions to community and country for leadership and strength. Id like to share a couple of those stories with the House today.Despite the absence of leadership and compassion that youve seen from the Morrison government in this chamber, we can still look to the great people in our communities to be reminded of the spirit and courage that we all possess. Firstly, on working together: it was a real privilege in 2019, along with our shadow minister Linda Burney, to meet with the Whittlesea Reconciliation Group to discuss plans for an Aboriginal gathering place within the community of Whittlesea, which would act as a means for education and the capacity to develop deeper cultural connections between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities. Im pleased to report to the House that, in the last few weeks, the plan for the meeting place has been approved by council. The Whittlesea Reconciliation Group is a source of great pride in our community as people come together with the goal of fostering a stronger and more respectful nation. Projects like these are part of what makes our community so great and so strong. Its the desire of every Australian to promote reconciliation which moves us forward as a nation. Im very proud to see this work being done in our community.Another story that gives me immense pride is in our community is the story of Kilmore local Brian Hardy. Its one of lifes greatest honours to be able to call Brian a friend. Over a long career in the Victorian police force, which saw him rise to the rank of superintendent and running the Police Association of Victoria, Brian challenged the status quo with his trademark courage and persistence. He sought to keep young offenders out of prison, and he strived throughout his career to find social and cultural solutions to conflict as opposed to legal ones. Brians emphasis on the positive role of policing within the communities and on the importance of welfare for police officers was well ahead of his time, and hes faced a lot of opposition in his attempts to reform institutions in desperate need of change. Despite the obstacles he faced, Brians legacy is how he worked to create safer and more secure communities and pave the way for many of the policing structures and services that we take for granted today. It was a privilege to join with Brians friends and former colleagues at a lunch at Hogans Hotel in Wallan to celebrate the writing of Brians much-awaited autobiography.Over in Romsey, there is another story of service and commitment. Veteran Romsey-Lancefield RSL member Tom Murphy was recently granted the RSLs highest individual award, the Victoria service medal, recognising 57 years of service to the community. Tom became an RSL member in 1964 after serving in the Australian Army. In the RSL, Tom has acted as welfare officer and sub-branch president and was recognised with life membership of the RSL in 2017. The Meritorious Service Medal is a testament to Toms enduring service to our community, as is his work with the RSL spanning more than half a century. He has helped countless Australian veterans and their families.In times as uncertain as these, when the problems that we face feel insurmountable, its stories like these that remind me of the strength and courage of everyday Australians and its our enduring spirit as a country. My hope is that these stories will serve as a reminder of the good things that we are capable of. In the absence of the compassionate and competent government in Australia that we deserve, we as individuals, as communities and as a nation still have the capacity to rise to the challenges that confront us and to overcome them by working together. Its so important that in these difficult times we look for positivity when people are feeling stressed and under pressure because of the lockdowns that are the direct result of the failure of this Prime Minister, this health minister and this government.","COVID-19, McEwen Electorate","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ROB MITCHELL (McEwen—Second Deputy Speaker) ","(19:40):"

Right now the agricultural industry is on a pathway towards its target of being a $100 billion industry by 2030. Everyone is very proud of the fact that we have this amazing agricultural sector right here in Australia. We are very proud that we can produce enough food to feed 75 million people, even though we have a population of just over 25 million.

The supermarket shelves remarkably keep getting topped up every night with fantastic Australian produce being delivered by Australian truckies in Australian packaging. The sovereignty we have built within our nation based around our agricultural sector is very reassuring for all of us.But there is one significant problem, and that is the agricultural sectors inability to get the workers they need across the various sectors and across the different commodities. This is highlighted in the inability of Australians to want to get off the couch and go to pick fruit. Weve understood that for many, many years, and that shortage still exists. Its gone much further than that now. We have a demand in dairy, we have a demand in broadacre farming and then we have a demand in the associated industries, the meat processors and the timber workers. When it comes to forestry, were having trouble recruiting timber workers for the sawmills. We have this inherent need that has to be addressed. Like most other First World countries around the world, we have to rely on developing countries to provide us with a lot of the labour we need. I know our opponents from the Labor Party dont like this, but its a harsh reality that, if were going to take our agricultural sector forward, we are going to have to develop an agricultural visa to give our agricultural sector the workers they need.We have state governments that acknowledge the need, but in their time of need—and this was seen at a time of action last year—simply refuse to move on the health orders and the quarantine that they want to put in place. Effectively Victoria was locked out of the overseas worker market last year, and the ensuing damage with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of produce simply falling on the ground was the result of Daniel Andrewss inability to move when it came to bringing people to this country to help with agriculture. They could bring people in to get the Australian Open played—they could bring in the tennis players and their entourages—but they couldnt bring in workers, even though there was a hard promise from all these workers that they would receive a vaccination in country before coming over. They were happy to quarantine, happy to get tested, work on farm, live on farm, but effectively that state government didnt get on board.Theres a chance that in a short while Australia will have its own agricultural visa, with workers coming in from a range of countries. Whats going to be critical then is that we offer some of these great workers an opportunity to have permanent residence in Australia. We need a pathway to permanency that will let our farmers identify these red-hot, fantastic workers and offer them a future on their farm. Then were going to need the opportunity to capitalise on some of these fantastic workers that have the ability to use incredibly expensive equipment, which is one thing that gets left out of looking at this whole agricultural visa debate.When you go onto a modern farm now, the technology that you see is just staggering. The machinery is getting towards being worth close to millions of dollars; it is in the high hundreds of thousands of dollars. There are headers, tractors, spreaders, harvesters. It is incredible. We need high-quality workers to be able to manage those farms. Thats what we are putting in place together. As Minister Littleproud continues to work through this, we will hopefully be able to avoid the disaster that we had last year, where, when the need was identified, it simply wasnt acted upon on. We had this horrible spat between the state government and the federal government about who was responsible for quarantine. Well, the state has to put in place its own health orders.

277,0,0,0,1,1,"Mitchell, Brian, MP",129164,"Lyons","ALP","N/A",7832," I rise tonight to share the trials of a constituent in my electorate. Louise Whelan is 65 years old. She lives alone in a lakeside shack in Interlaken, a town in the Central Highlands, about two hours from Hobart. Shes tough. Shes as tough as they come. Shes got a wicked sense of humour and shes whip smart. But, by and large, life has not gone her way. Shes had reconstructive facial surgery following a car accident, and, in more recent years, shes experienced debilitating hip and knee pain. She can barely walk, let alone drive, and every day is agony. Ive seen it firsthand. Thats been her life for the past five years—five years of excruciating pain, five years on a hospital waiting list.In May, it looked as though shed finally made it: surgery booked in, all good to go. But the hospital did not clearly stipulate that she also needed to attend a pre-admission booking. At short notice, they apparently reckon they told her, but she never got the message. And she can barely move, let alone drive herself to hospital at the drop of a hat. She says she wasnt contacted, and, frankly, even if she had been, because of her immobility and how far away she lives she couldnt have got there anyway at the short notice the hospital says they gave her. So her surgery was cancelled—not once, but twice. Not once did the Royal Hobart Hospital offer to bring Louise to and from her pre-admission or her surgery. Not once did the hospital reach out to say, How can we help you get this surgery that you need?One of my staff ended up driving a six-hour round trip just to make sure that Louise finally made it to and from her rescheduled pre-admission appointment. Id like to thank my staff member, Lachie, who spent the entire day driving Louise and spending the day with her in the hospital as she did her rounds of appointments. Its not something that my staff and my office would normally do. Its not the role of a member of parliament or their staff to do that, but we knew that, if we didnt do it on this occasion, Louise would face many more months of waiting. Thank you, Lachie, for that, going above and beyond.Louise is not a statistic. Shes a person—a living, breathing person. There are so many more like her. Thousands of Tasmanians are spending years on surgery waiting lists for life-changing procedures and suddenly finding themselves back another two years or, worse, off the list entirely. In the past decade alone, elective surgery waiting lists have grown from 8½ thousand people in 2011 to 11½ thousand in May this year. Over that time, weve seen four restructures of the health service and more than a dozen reports, including a 2014 report that highlights the unacceptable number of overdue elective surgery, with hundreds of recommendations made and not acted upon. There is something deeply wrong with Tasmanias health system.More broadly, we must also consider the implications of a federal government that is single-mindedly stripping our nations health care for parts. The AMA, the Grattan Institute, health funds, Consumers Health Forum and the Australian Orthopaedic Association have all warned that the Prime Ministers Medicare cuts and changes will impact on fees and lead to an increase in out-of-pocket costs to patients. To top it off, were seeing fewer medical practitioners in regional Australia. In the past month alone, my electorate has lost four GPs from across clinics in Brighton and Bridgewater—four!—and these are GPs with their books packed. Where are their patients going to go? More than 18,000 people live in the Brighton LGA, many with complex health requirements. Now theyre facing month-long waits just to see an unfamiliar locum doctor, if one can be found. Its not good enough, and the state and federal Liberal governments have gone missing.We on this side of the House know the importance of providing quality health care to regional Australians. Thats why weve established, in the Senate, an inquiry into GP shortages and the rural health crisis facing our country—not just in Lyons but across our nation. Those outside city centres are finding it harder and harder to get access to a local GP, and almost impossible to find bulk-billing. We can do better. We must do better. This system needs to work better for people like Louise.","Whelan, Ms Louise","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) ","(19:50):"
278,0,0,0,1,1,"Entsch, Warren, MP","7K6","Leichhardt","LNP","N/A",7833," I dont often find myself agreeing with the member for Kennedy on much of anything, but recently something strange has occurred. Ive found myself agreeing with him on an issue that he has recently shone light on. Since November last year, the Barron River Bridge at Kuranda has been reduced to one lane and has had significant load limits imposed. At the time, there was much speculation as to why this occurred overnight, without forewarning, given there werent any works planned in the area. As time wore on, questions rightfully started getting asked, but, as is usual with this Queensland Labor government, no answers were forthcoming.It turns out Main Roads engineers were franticly checking the structures safety and stability. As a result, a multimillion dollar investigation was launched, with the Queensland government promising to release the report once it was finalised. You dont need me to stand here and tell you what happened—or, in this case, what didnt happen. In fact, once the report was completed, the Queensland government had the hide to say it wouldnt release it because it would be too technical for people to understand. Meanwhile, engineers are hard at work checking more than a thousand individual welds and repairing them as they ensure the structures safety.It took a right-of-information request by local media organisations to finally reveal the gravity of the situation. The document revealed that six years ago the engineers recommended replacing nuts and bolts on fixed and rocker bearings, as well as jacking up the structure to replace entire expansion joint bearings. The documents also revealed a recommendation to repair or replace corroded parts in a time frame no later than two years. More shockingly, the documents revealed that the retrofitted Macalloy bars used on the structure had been compromised through both pitting corrosion and the wear of the stressing bars vibrating against the girders.Not only were the Queensland government aware of the gravity of the situation for more than five years; shockingly, they did absolutely nothing to address it. Instead, they put the safety of hundreds of thousands of motorists who used the bridge during this time at risk and placed the economic viability of the entire region in jeopardy. I absolutely shudder when I think about what would have happened if the bridge had been closed permanently, given it is along a major freight route connecting the tablelands, the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cape York with Cairns. Its now time to explore and invest in alternative routes to connect Cairns with the tablelands, such as the Bridle Track proposal. This time the Queensland government cant blame anyone else for their own incompetence and negligence. This is on them. The Queensland government need to cough up the cash to replace the bridge and reassure an already nervous community that the current bridge wont collapse into the Barron River.This brings me to the Kuranda Range, a major route in my electorate. I understand the newly formed Kuranda Range bypass committee has already held a few public forums on this important issue. Ive always been a big supporter of finding a solution to the issue regarding the Kuranda Range. I have, on numerous occasions, approached the Queensland government on this issue. Ive written on several occasions to the Queensland transport and main roads minister, Mark Bailey, urging him to consider solutions for the Kuranda Range. In fact, I have asked him to include the Kuranda Range as a road of strategic importance, given its vital role in connecting the tablelands with Cairns. To date, these approaches have fallen on deaf ears.I understand the Queensland government is currently working on delivering an updated Kuranda Range business case, as the last one was undertaken more than two decades ago. This is long overdue. Pressure needs to be put firmly on the Queensland government to complete and release the business case in its entirety sooner rather than later. It cant be allowed to sit on the ministers desk or on a shelf in Brisbane collecting dust. Once this business case is completed and made public, then together, as a community, we can have an informed discussion and work towards delivering a solution on the Kuranda Range once and for all.Its great to see that my good friend Scott Buchholz is here. He is the minister responsible for infrastructure in this area. Im glad that youre here to listen to my contribution. Its something that desperately needs to be addressed. Its well and truly overdue. Im confident the federal government will step up— (Time expired)House adjourned at 20 : 00","Queensland: Infrastructure","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ENTSCH (Leichhardt) ","(19:55):"
