It is only necessary at this moment to say that, consequent upon- the result of the referendum, the Government considered it Its duty to resign unconditionally, and to offer no advice to His .Excellency. The circumstances under which the  resignations were made and subsequent steps taken by His Excellency to form a Government -have already been made public, and it is not . my present intention to refer to them any further than to lay upon the .table a memorandum by His Excellency setting out the views of the Governor-General. <,His Excellency has been pleased to intrust me with a commission to form a new Government, and I have now to announce its personnel: -Prime Minister and Attorney-General - The Right Honorable William Morris Hughes, P.CMinister of State for the Navy - The Hight Honorable Joseph Cook, P.C.Treasurer - The Right Honorable Sir John Forrest, P.C, G.C.M.GMinister of State for Defence - Senator the Honorable George Foster Pearce.Minister ;of State for Repatriation - Senator the Honorable Edward .Davis Millen.Minister of. State for Works and Railways - The Honorable William .Alexander WattMinister of State for Home and Territories - The Honorable Patrick McMahon Glynn,- K.C.Minister of State for Trade and Customs - -The Honorable Jens August JensenPostmaster-General - The Honorable William WebsterVice-President of the Federal Executive Council - The Honorable Littleton Ernest Groom .Honorary Minister - Senator the Honorable Edward John Russell.Supply for public and war services is urgent, and you will be asked to authorize the necessary provision.My experience in the government of this country leads me to the conclusion that certain changes in the Government must be made in the near future with a view to strengthening it and making it more efficient to meet the increasing pressure of war duties and those economic and-ether conditions arising out -of the.war.The Governments one desire is to bend all its energies to enabling Australia to do its duty in this great war,, and to grapple with those infinitely complex and difficult domestic problems that now confront us, and it earnestly invites the co-operation and assistance of the Parliament -and the people.The Government intends to meet Parr liament. before the expiration of the proposed Supply, when the Government proposals, together with its immediate policy, will be submitted.His Excellency the Governor-General has placed in my hands, and requested me to present to the House, a memorandum, to .which I have already referred, and which I now desire to place before, the House. It reads -Commonwealth of AustraliaGovernor-General, 9th January, 1918On the 8th of January the Prime Minister waited on the Governor-General and tendered to him his resignation.. In doing so Mr. Hughes offered no ad.vice as to who should be asked to form an Administration.The Governor-General considered that . it was his paramount duty (a) to make provision for carrying >oh the business* of the country in accordance with> the principles of parliamentary government, (&) -to avoid a situation arising which must lead to a further appeal to the country within twelve months of an. election resulting in the return of tv.0Houses of .similar political complexion,  which are still working in unison. The Governor-General was also of the opinion that ki .granting a Commission for the formation of a new Administration; his .choice must be determined solely by the parliamentary situation. Any other course would be a departure from constitutional practice, and an infringement of the rights of Parliament. In the absence of such parliamentary indications as are given by a defeat of the Govern.ment in Parliament, the Governor-General endeavoured to ascertain what the situation was by seeking information from representatives of all sections of the House with a view to determining where the majority lay, and what prospects there were of forming an alternative Government.As a result of these interviews, in which the knowledge and views of all those he consulted were most freely and generously placed at his service, the Governor-General was of opinion that the majority of the National party was likely to retain its cohesion, and that therefore a Government having the promise of stability could only be formed from that section of the House. Investigations failed to elicit proof of sufficient strength in any other quarter. It also became clear to him that the leader in the National party, who had the best prospect of securing unity among his followers and of therefore being able to form a Government having, those elements of permanence so essential to the conduct of affairs during war, was the Right Honorable W. M. Hughes, whom the Governor-General therefore commissioned to form an Administration.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL WAR GOVERNMENT: GOVERNORGENERALS MEMORANDUM","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

57,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORREST, John","KFJ","Swan","NAT","Treasurer",2899,". - I move -That there be granted to His Majesty for or towards the defraying the services of. the year 1917-18 a sum not exceeding £3,449,972.am very sorry that, owing to a political situation having intervened, there is so little time to devote to this measure without inconveniencing the Public Service. Unfortunately, to-morrow is pay-day for both the wages men and the salaried staff, and unless we pass this Bill expeditiously we shall not be able to pay them, at any rate, till Monday.In submitting a Supply Bill for the services of the Government for three months, I would like to give honorable members some idea of our financial position. The - whole transactions for December are not yet available, so that the figures for that month are approximate only, but they may be taken as almost final : -N/AThe resources at the disposal of the Commonwealth to meet the expenditure for the half-year, ended 31st December may be set out as follow : - compare with those of the previous year as follow: -N/AThe decrease on the total receipts for the six months is £427,479.  This is made up of a decrease in Customs revenue of £1,468,631, and increases in Post .Office revenue of £109,152, and in other receipts of £932,000.A very doubtful element in the finance of the Commonwealth at present is the Customs and Excise revenue, it being subject to so many influences of an abnormal kind. The receipts from that source in the first half of the current financial yearIt will be noticed that whereas there was an increase of £262,783 in the month of July - due, no doubt, to the loading up in anticipation of Tariff changes - the decreases in August and September were £688,008 and £710,811, respectively. In the month of October the decrease was £225,893, while in November the falling off was only £2,082; in December the decrease was £104,620. Though the position of the Customs and Excise revenue thus appears to be unsatisfactory, an improvement is indicated in that the falling off latterly has been much less than before.In the Budget submitted on the 8th August, 1917, it was estimated that the Customs receipts for the current financial year would be £1,976,441 less than those of the preceding financial year. Already the decrease amounts to £1,468,631. The total estimated Customs and Excise revenue is £13,630,000, so that the amount received for the half year is a little less than half of the estimate. In view of the unsettled state of shipping, it is difficult to foresee exactly what our Customs and Excise revenue in the future will be. but it seems possible that the estimate for the year will not be quite realized.The total revenue estimated to be received in 1917-18 was £35,181,655; the revenue received for the half year ended 31st December is £5,344,000 less than one half of the estimate. This disparity is explained by the fact that almost the whole of the revenue from direct taxation is received in the latter half of the year.The expenditure payable but of revenue for the current financial year was estimated on the 8th August last as £37,283,832. One half of this estimate is £18,641,916. The expenditure for the first six months of the year was £15,788,600, which is £2,853,316 less than one half of the estimate. It must be remembered, however, that the expenditure in the latter half of the year is much  heavier than that in the earlier months, and the interest and sinking fund on war loans yet to be paid during the year will be much heavier than that paid in the previous half year. From present indications, it would appear that the expenditure for the full year will be within the estimate.The most notable increases in the expenditure are in connexion with pensions and interest and sinking fund on war loans. The increases in invalid and old-age pensions total £317,118. Apart from the additions to the number of pensioners, the increased expenditure is caused by the increase of the pension by 2s. 6d. per week, and the payment of 2s. to inmates of asylums, which operated only for three months in the half year ended 31st December, 1916. In addition, the provisions of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act in regard to the calculation of income were liberalized by providing that allotments of naval and military pay, war pensions, and separation allowances were not to be calculated as part of the income of the applicant.The increase in war pensions is £662,023. The reasons for this increase are, unfortunately, obvious.The interest falling due on war loans in Australia on 15th December, 1916, was not brought into the accounts in the Treasury until January of the following year. This amount was, approximately, £1,200,000, so that the expenditure for . interest and sinking fund on war loans for the half year ended 31st December, 1916, was £2,368,937, and the expenditure for the half year ended 31st December, 1917, was £3,482,200, or an increase of £1,113,263.The expenditure for additions, new works and buildings for the half year ended 31st December, 1917, was £299,900; but, in addition, expenditure out of Loan Fund was made, totalling £948,000, thus giving a total expenditure for the half year on these new works of £1,247,900. These figures show a decrease of £1,040,850 on the expenditure for the corresponding period of the previous year.The war loan expenditure for the half year ended 31st December, 1917, is £27,326,000, as compared , with £20,939,331 for the corresponding period of the previous year. The increase of £6,387,669 in the current year is partly accounted for by a payment of £3,500,000 to the Imperial Government for the upkeep of troops. No corresponding payment was made during the first half of the last financial year. In addition, £1,940,686 has been advanced for the purchase of foodstuffs for the Imperial Government and the Government of India. The amount of these advances will, of course, be recovered.Cash balance. The cash balance at 31st December, 1917, was as follows: -N/ALoans to the States. Under an agreement made on the 5th November, 1915, and modified at the Premiers Conference in January, 1917, the Commonwealth undertook to raise overseas for the States (except New South Wales) the following amounts: -N/AIn pursuance of this agreement the Commonwealth has raised the following loans : -N/AThe Commonwealth has still to raise £2,340,000 to meet the requirements for 1917, and has agreed to advance this amount to the States in anticipation of the issue of a further loan. Some of the States have already been paid their proportions of this £2,340,000, and the money is available for the other States on application.A portion of the amount of £18,000,000 loaned to the States (except Queensland) out of the Notes Fund in 1914-15 has already matured, and the balance will mature during 1918. The States desire that the loans, totalling £18,000,000, be renewed. The Commonwealth has proposed that the agreement of the 5th November, 1915, be further amended by reducing the £2,700,000, the amount to be raised by the Commonwealth for the States in 1918. In the event of this proposal being agreed to, the Commonwealth will be in a position to give renewals to the States of their several portions of the £18,000,000 until one year after the termination of the war.War Loans. On the 15th September last, subscriptions were invited to the fifth Commonwealth war loan - styled the Liberty Loan. The conditions of the issue were similar to those of the earlier war loans, except that the date of maturity was fixed as the 15th December, 1927, in lieu of the 15th December, 1925. The amount subscribed up to the closing date- 2nd November- was £20,432,590. In addition, £609,129 was invested in war savings certificates during the period for which the loan was open for subscription. The total amount subscribed for war purposes while the loan was open was thus £21,041,719.To meet the wishes of many people who will be receiving payment for their wool and desire to invest in the war loan, it has been decided to accept further sub- . scriptions to the Liberty Loan during the continuance of the wool appraisements.The subscriptions to war loans raised within the Commonwealth amount to £100,486,200, made up as follows : -N/AIn addition, up to 5th January, £3,373,637 has been raised by means of war savings certificates, making a grand total of £103,859,837.As I stated previously, the Supply now asked for is for three- months, and covers the ordinary services of the Government and war services payable out of revenue. The total amount . of the schedule is £3,449,972. Omitting refunds of revenue -£100,000- the total is £3,349,972. The amount thus asked for is considerably less than one-fourth of the total estimated expenditure under annual votes, viz., £3,926,880.Supply has already been granted up to. 31st December, 1917. The amount provided, omitting Treasurers advance and refunds of revenue, is £6,913,386.Excluding Treasurers advance and refunds of revenue, the total provision which will be available to meet expenditure to 31st March, 1918, is £10,263,358.The total provision in the Estimates of 1917-18 for the ordinary services of the Government and war services payable out of revenue isN/AThree-fourths 1 of this amount is £10,597,389, and as the total provision in Supply to 31st March, 1918, is £10,263,358, it will he seen that the proposed expenditure for the nine months is less than three-fourths of the estimated expenditure.No provision has been made in the Bill for any service which has not previously been approved by Parliament. In connexion with increases to salaries, provision has only been made for such increases as fall due under Arbitration Court awards or are. automatic under the Public Service Act. Provision has not been made for increases to salaries in the higher divisions of the Service. These increases will not be paid until the Estimates are passed by Parliament.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 4) 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When last the Government asked for. three months Supply, the honorable member for Flinders said that no doubt before another Supply Bill was submitted the Government would come down with a definite statement as to their financial policy. What is the statement we have had to-day ? The Prime Minister has told us that the Government intend to obtain three months Supply, and that we shall then adjourn over practically the whole of that period. That means that we shall re-assemble about the 1st April - a fitting date for the present Government to meet Parliament.The Government are fooling the people, and, what is worse, they are fooling themselves. They seem to think that by. shelving the notice of motion of want of confidence which I gave this afternoon they will be able to stifle criticism. I deliberately said that I was prepared to move that motion  at the earliest opportunity; and while I do not desire to delay the granting of Supply, I am prepared to proceed at -once with the notice of motion I have given. The Prime Minister, in his wisdom, however, has decided that that shall be placed at the bottom, I presume, of the notice-paper, so that we shall have no opportunity to discuss it. The right honorable member will recollect a similar action taken in this House. I refer to the occasion when the Cook Government were hanging on to office by one vote. They were clinging to office just as the present limpet-like Adminis>tration are holding on. They would rather anything happen than that they should be compelled to leave the Treasury bench. The Cook Government, on the occasion to which I refer, ignored, just as the present Government are doing, a notice of motion of want of confidence . They also set at the bottom of the business paper a notice of motion disagreeing with a ruling of the then Speaker. In the same way, the Prime Minister will not give this House an opportunity to discuss the policy of the Government, nor the country a chance to learn the views of honorable members concerning his Cabinet. Might I remind him of the fate of the Cook Government? Need I remind him that when they went to the polls  they were swept out of office? Although the Government are fooling themselves by thinking they are cunning and clever in thwarting discussion in this way, they will probably meet with a similar fate.I would describe the present Government as  the P.B. Administration. 1 do not suggest by the use of those initials that they are a pawn-broking Government, although it is quite possible that they have put their political consciences in pawn; indeed, their political consciences should be in excellent repair since they make no use of them.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 4) 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[2]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He would not allow adverse criticism of the Government. Apparently he has succeeded in bringing round to his way of thinking the whole of his colleagues, for the Government seem to be prepared to use the Standing Orders to prevent criticism of their actions in Parliament, and to avail themselves of the War Precautions Act to prevent criticism of them outside. The Postmaster-General, who says he has been sitting up writing letters morning after morning until 3 oclock, is reported to have said of the conscription proposals,  If these proposals are turned down this Government will not remain in office twenty-four hours.

As a matter of fact, a report of one of my speeches, which appeared in the Daily Telegraph, was not permitted to appear. in The Worker. The editor of the Sydney Worker was fined because he did not submit to the censor matter which he published, and which had already appeared in other newspapers. The Prime Minister went to Adelaide, where he was photographed with some of his supporters. The nearest man to him in the group was the censor for South Australia - Major Smeaton - a political partisan, who should have had the common decency to stand out of that picture. By being photographed with the Prime Minister he showed himself to be an absolute partisan. I have proof galleys from an Adelaide daily newspaper office showing that the censor deleted certain statements attributed by me to Senator Pearce - statements which had actually been made by Senator Pearce, and had already appeared in the press. But because I said during the referendum campaign that these statements had been made by Senator Pearce, that portion of the report of my speech was censored. As a matter of fact, Senator Pearce made the statements in question before the- conscription referendum was thought of - before the honorable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) compelled the Government to take the referendum. 1 do not intend to place myself in the position of thanking honorable members opposite for any courtesy. . Compelled as I am to have this discussion on Supply, I am confined to half an hour, but I shall avail myself of all the forms of the House in order to place my views before the country.

Had I been permitted to discuss these matters on the motion of which I have given notice, I should have been allowed either one hour and five minutes or one hour and thirty -five minutes; but as things are I find it utterly impossible to deal with my material in the time at my disposal. We find supporters of the Government quite prepared to quietly see their leader ignore the notice of motion I have given.

Throughout the whole of the recent campaign the censorship was used in the same way in regard to every member of the Government exactly as on the previous occasion. The Government, after having used the censorship and the War Precautions Act regulations in this way outside the House, are now prepared,  inside the House, to use the Standing Orders and their majority to prevent discussion on any motion that may be moved against them. When I gave notice of motion to-day, the Prime Minister said, in effect, No, I shall not accept it; you can debate the matter on Supply. Does the Prime Minister think that such a move as that will help him to get supply?The twenty-two honorable members on this side represent the people who sent them here, while opposite there are at least twenty-five honorable members who do not represent their constituents on the question submitted to the country on the 20th December. The Government and their supporters cannot complain that they did not have a  fair go  on the referendum. Practically the whole of the leading newspapers in Australia were howling at the opponents of conscription, and preventing their appeals from reaching the, country. The Government and the supporters of conscription had everything in their favour, and yet they were beaten. In the course of the campaign, there was issued in support of the affirmative vote some of the most scurrilous literature ever published. This literature has never been disowned by honorable members opposite; and certainly that particular document issued by Mr. Claude Mackay was one of the worst ever published.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 4) 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[2]/continue[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Had any such publication been issued by the other side, there would, undoubtedly, have been a prosecution; indeed, on the anti-conscriptionist side no man dare open his mouth, whereas those in favour of the affirmative vote could say what they liked. There was no regard for the truth at all in what the newspapers published throughout the Commonwealth in favour of conscription; and still the other side won. It is a great tribute to the Democracy of Australia that it should win this fight in spite of press, purse, and pulpit, or, at any rate, a great part of the pulpit. Amongst the Congregationalists, the Baptists, the Church ofChrist, and other denominations, were found men to stand out in opposition to the Government proposals; but, speaking generally, the affirmative side had the support, as I say, of press, purse, and pulpit. And still the people won.In spite of the defeat of the referendum, the Government hang on to office, and we find honorable members like the honorable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) supporting them like lambs. Amongst those honorable members we have the honorable member for Perth (Mr Fowler), who professed to be opposed to the Government, and used harsh and hard words concerning them. Yet that honorable member and others are prepared to keep the present Government in office, although the Prime Minister ignores my notice of motion and will not allow a discussion on that motion itself. Former members of the Labour party, who are now behind the Government, will remember the treatment meted out to the Opposition by the present. Minister for the Navy, when he was Prime Minister, and also by the present Treasurer (Sir John Forrest), and the Assistant Minister (Mr Groom). Amongst those who raised much howling about that treatment was the present Postmaster-General (Mr Webster), who protested against the iniquity of the present Speaker in placing a motion of want of confidence at the bottom of the business paper. Yet that gentleman is a member of the present Government, although he talked of resigning in twenty-four hours if there should be a majority against conscription. Of course, the Prime Minister will tell him that the Government have resigned. Does the right honorable gentleman think that such a contention will fool anybody outside? The Government may fool themselves, but they will not fool the people. We can all remember how Mr. Alfred Deakin, when member for Ballarat, and one of the Opposition, described the present Prime Minister, in 1904, as being pulled howling out of the tart shop; and it would appear that the right honorable gentleman retains his fondness for the pastrycook establishment.

Of course, it is entirely for the Government and the party supporting them to decide what treatment shall be meted out to the minority in the House; but it is well within the constitutional rights of Parliament for an Opposition to move a no-confidence motion, and that motion can be placed in whatever position on the notice-paper the Government choose. Usually it is taken as the first business. If the Opposition agree to grant Supply for one month in order that the services may be carried on they will be acting very fairly. If the Government will not accept that offer we as an Opposition cannot make any further concession. I offer the Government Supply for one month, and then the no-confidence motion can be dealt with. To ask for three months Supply whilst the no-confidence motion is hanging over the Governments head is a proposition which is not fair to honorable members on this side.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 4) 1917-18","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Such a decision is the right of the majority. Supply for two months would carry us only as far as Easter. Honorable members must recollect that Supply is already a fortnight in arrears, therefore a grant of supply for one month would only make provision for a fortnight ahead.

They are the outcome of the late strike. After that strike the Federal Government created a Coal Board, which allocated the work on the water frontage in this area. Old members of the Coal Lumpers Union, which is now nonexistent, have been debarred, under that arrangement, from obtaining employment. I understand that the Coal Board has issued instructions to the Contractors that they are not to employ any ex-members of the Coal Lumpers Union. In consequence of this instruction 800 men, women, and children at Millers Point are practically starving. They have been obliged to seek for bread at the benevolent asylums.

Many of the men who have received notice to quit have been living in the same area for thirty and forty years. They have worked all their lives on the water front, and are not in a position to leave it to seek employment in the country. During the late strike, volunteers were brought down from country districts to work on the wharfs. They have no fixed place of abode ; they are young men, and many of them are without dependants; but they are being kept in employment. In this way an effort is being made to starve out old residents on the water front - the coal-lumpers and others who have been forced to. seek relief. Now we have the threat that they are to be turned into the streets in order that the houses occupied by them may be handed over to the volunteer labourers. This action is being taken by the Government of New South Wales. Surely the Commonwealth Government should step in at this juncture and instruct the Coal Board to. give employment to those to whom the employment on the wharfs legitimately belongs, and to send the so-called volunteers either upcountry again, or where an attempt is being made to force the coal-lumpers to go? Over 300 sons of these very coal-lumpers have enlisted, and are at the Front. Over 600 sons of water-frontage workers living at Millers Point alone are at the Front. Is not this action of which I complain likely to prove of service to the Germans ? Would not this notice to quit prove excellent propaganda for the Germans to use in the trenches?

Another area affected is under the control of the Rocks Resumption Board, which is under the direction of the State Treasurer. At one time, it was supposed to be a slum area, but it has been rebuilt. It was the intention of the Harbor Trust that only those who worked on the water front should be allowed to occupy these houses, and that is the excuse offered for these threatened evictions. It is said that there is no work on the water front for the men now living in these houses. They cannot obtain work owing to the action of certain people, and they are to be turned out of their houses, so that the volunteer workers may occupy them.","Conscription : Policy of the Government - Sydney Harbor Trust Evictions - Payment of Rent by Soldiers Wives - Reinforcements Referendum : Soldiers Ballot-papers - Supply of Cornsacks","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

These are the people who are to be turned out. In one case, a woman with eight children, whose husband has gone upcountry to seek employment, has received notice to quit. A few days ago I saw a soldier assisting his married sister to shift her furniture from a house in the area. He told me he was going to the Front; that his sisters husband was up-country, and that he did not want to see her turned out of her home. He was, therefore, placing her in another house, and intended, while away at the Front, to pay for her keep. He will be going to the Front with a very sad heart, in view of the treatment meted out to his sister. This sort of thing should not be tolerated in Australia. Evictions on such a wholesale scale are a reflection on the Commonwealth. If they were attempted . by a private landlord, action would, no doubt, be taken ; and since a State Government is responsible for them, the Commonwealth should intervene. The War Precautions Act seems to be sufficiently elastic to enable the Commonwealth Government to do anything they please, and it is nearly time that they got into communication with the New South Wales Government and prevented these evictions. If work were found for these men, they would soon be able to pay off the arrears of rent which have been accumulating owing to their want of employment. I hope that the new Commonwealth Government will at once take up this matter, and deal with it as it should be dealt with.","Conscription : Policy of the Government - Sydney Harbor Trust Evictions - Payment of Rent by Soldiers Wives - Reinforcements Referendum : Soldiers Ballot-papers - Supply of Cornsacks","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I wish him to see whether steps cannot be taken by his Department, or, if necessary, whether they cannot be taken under the War Precautions Act, to compel every agent who makes such a statement to give the names and addresses of the. women who, he says, will not pay rent because they are soldiers wives. I do not believe those statements. There are good and bad among all classes, but it is an infamy that our law Courts should be used for the purpose of slandering the wives and relatives of men who are fighting at the Front, not only for us, but for the very landlords whose houses are occupied. It is only justice to our soldiers that these agents should be compelled to give names and addresses so that inquiries may be made by the Department into the truth or falsity of their statements. In one Court I instructed a gentleman to ask the question, but the agent would not give any names. Many returned soldiers have spoken to me on this matter, saying that the statements of these agents are a slur on their brothers at the Front.I wish to, put a question to the Prime Minister in all good temper. With the exception of the Canadian election, Australian soldiers have been the only soldiers empowered to vote in any election for their country. The soldiers of no other participant in the war have had that honour or that power. Now, as an Australian, I ask the Prime Minister whether he will have the ballot-papers that are Australian property, having been voted on by Australian soldiers, returned to Australia ? If they are sent out here and recounted, and the numbers tally with what were given out last year and this year, I will be content to accept them; but if the papers are destroyed in England, or wherever they are placed, the Prime Minister will agree with me that the outside public will have very serious differences of opinion on the matter. I merely ask, as an Australian, that the resting place for Australian ballot-papers should be in Australia.","Conscription : Policy of the Government - Sydney Harbor Trust Evictions - Payment of Rent by Soldiers Wives - Reinforcements Referendum : Soldiers Ballot-papers - Supply of Cornsacks","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
202,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BLAKELEY, Arthur","JPV","Darling","N/A","N/A",2916,".- I desire to speak on a matter which was referred to this afternoon in a question submitted by the honorable member for Wannon (Mr. Rodgers), namely, the supply of cornsacks. If the Government have shown incapacity, it is in regard to the question of arranging for the supply of cornsacks to the farmers of Australia. Long months have passed, and the Win-the-war Government have endeavoured vainly to get sufficient bags in order to supply Australian farmers, but evidently through the manipulation of those who deal in these articles the Government, wittingly or unwittingly, has become merely the creature of circumstances. As a result, serious loss has been occasioned, not only to our farmers, but also to the people of Australia, because every bushel of wheat which is wasted through incompetency or incapacity to deal with the wheat is a national loss. In answer to a question submitted on the 26th July of last year by the honorable member for Barker (Mr. Livingston), the Prime Minister said that he was making all arrangements for the supply of cornsacks for the Australian farmers. The matter was not allowed to drop, because questions were submitted subsequently by the honorable member for Wannon (Mr. Rodgers), by the honorable member for Barker, by myself, and by other honorable members; but, notwithstanding that the matter was continually kept under the notice of. the Prime Minister and the Win-the-war Government, to-day wheat is spread out on dunnage all through the Darling electorate and the wheat-growing areas of Australia, and a great deal of it will be wasted. It is a costly process to tip wheat out on to dunnage and the different receptacles where it is stored and rebag it. I have always approved of a Government dealing with these matters, but had the Win-the-war Government not decided to take action to supply cornsacks to the farmers, our wheat-growers would have got sufficient cornsacks themselves. However, the Government decided that in the interests of the primary producers of Australia they would get the cornsacks, and not less than six months ago they started to get them. They have not procured them.","Conscription : Policy of the Government - Sydney Harbor Trust Evictions - Payment of Rent by Soldiers Wives - Reinforcements Referendum : Soldiers Ballot-papers - Supply of Cornsacks","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
