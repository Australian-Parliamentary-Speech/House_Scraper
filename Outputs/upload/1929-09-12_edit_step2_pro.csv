It was as follows 11th September, 1929.Sir -I beg to inform you that the second reading of a measure constituting an important part of the policy of the Government, the Maritime Industries Bill, was carried on Saturday last in the House of Representatives by a majority of four votes. Yesterday the bill, on my motion,was declared an urgent measure, also by a majority of four votes.In committee an amendment was carried by a majority of one vote declaring that the bill should not be brought into operation until it had been submitted to the people at a referendum or at a general election.The Constitution makes no provision for a referendum of this description, and the Commonwealth Parliament has no power to pass effective legislation for the. holding of such a referendum.The Government is, however, prepared to accept the other alternative - namely, a general election.I, therefore, formally advise Your Excellency . to grant a dissolution of the House of Representatives, and I now inform you that propose to ask Parliament for the necessary financial provision to carry on the public services until after the election has been held.Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) S. M. Bruce,Prime Minister.His Excellency the Governor-General.To-day I received from His Excellency the following reply: - 12th September, 1929.Sir-I am in receipt of your letterof yesterday, and have carefully considered the question which it raises.I note that you propose to ask Parliament for supply to carry on the public services of the Commonwealth until after a general election has been held, and, in view of this assurance, I accept the advice tendered by you.Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) Stonehaven,Governor-General.The Right Honorable S. M. Bruce,C.H., M.C., M.P., Prime Minister.The Government proposes to ask the House to grant supply to provide for the public services of the Commonwealth during the period that will be necessary for the holding of a general election. In order to protect the revenue, Parliament must also pass a bill validating the customs schedules which were placed before the House during the present session. There must be made, too, a further appropriation to meet our obligations in regard to old-age, invalid, and soldiers pensions. The only other business which the Government will submit to the House will be a motion for the erection of certain buildings in accordance with the recommendation of the Public Works Committee, so that the work may be proceeded with im-","N/A","DISSOLUTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The right honorable gentleman has accepted a grave responsibility in advising the Governor-General to dissolve it, andHis Excellency a grave responsibility in accepting that advice. I do not criticize the action of His Excellency, nor am I perturbed by the acceptance of the advice tendered to him, but through this House I tell the country that the responsibility for the cost and turmoil of a general election will rest entirely upon the Government. It could have obeyed the mandate it received from the people ten months ago to proceed with the fed- eral arbitration system and make it effective. Had that pledge to the electors not been broken, Parliament would not have insisted upon the Government going again before its masters. Parliament has vindicated itself as the guardian of the peoples rights. It has told the Government that, notwithstanding its majority, it cannot flout the will of the people, and that irrespective of -the consequences to any party it must go back to. the electors and get a new mandate, or abandon the measure which was introduced in defiance of the will of the people. The grave responsibility of precipitating a general election so soon after the last one rests entirely upon the advisers of the Governor-General, and that will be made clear to the people. The Government disobeyed its mandate. This House, in definite terms, has told it to halt, and proceed no further without consulting the electors. I make no complaint for having to face a general election. The Labour party is prepared to meet the Government forces at the polls, and to abide by the judgment of the people.","N/A","DISSOLUTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have had brought under my notice numerous cases of persons who are unable to do any work; yet they are told by those whose duty it is to authorize pensions that they are capable of doing some work. Presumably, that decision is come to in the light of the medical reports. They may he able only to wash a. cup, or perform some slight service of that nature. The administration is too rigid. I know of a boy who is practically paralysed down one side. His chest has wasted away. He has almost to drag himself along the floor, and he has been told by the administration that he can do some light employment. That is one of the serious anomalies that should be rectified.

That duty would be supported, I believe, by most honorable members, and it would be a pity to jeopardize the protection of the industry by failure to validate the schedule that has been tabled. The schedule contains, too, some items which I oppose just as strongly as I support others, and, were it not for the fact that the Government has agreed to limit the operation of the measure to a period of three months, honorable members on this side of the House would oppose it. In view of that limitation of time, the Opposition is not prepared to vote against the bill, although it includes some items with which we disagree, and others with which we agree. The effect of the bill will really be the same as if the schedule were allowed to remain on the table for another three months. It is now clear that, unless this Parliament determines otherwise, this schedule will cease to have effect at the end of three months, and another Parliament will be asked to consider a new schedule, which I hope will contain the good features of the present schedule, but not the bad ones.","Second Reading","CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Supply has been granted for three months, and that, too, includes provision for expenditure with which the Opposition does not agree, and which this Parliament would be entitled to criticize if it had the Estimates before it. We have agreed to the operation of the schedule for the limited period of three months to enable the election to be held and a newly-constituted House to assemble here.

I do not think that it is essential that there should be increased taxation. Had due economy been exercised, these increased duties would not have been ncessary. When it is found imperative to impose increased taxes they should be placed on what may be termed luxuries. Unfortunately, the cost of living is increasing year by year. Nearly every other country has made a big effort to bring about a return to normal conditions. I hope that after the election the object of the Government - the present Government, I trust - will be to reduce the cost of living. That means that the cost of production must come down. It is no use living in a fools paradise. Under the present conditions we are on shifting sands. We are dependent to too great an extent upon borrowed money. We are taking huge sums from the people which should be used for development in order to provide employment. I have already asked the Minister by way of questions in the House, and I now ask the Government, to consider the remission of the duty on motor truck chassis which are being largely used in the development of rural areas. I hope that, until the matter can be fully investigated, the Government will approve of a small amendment that will enable these chassis to be admitted duty free. I do not wish to obstruct the passage of the bill ; but I ask the Government to realize that motor trucks are extensively employed in developmental work. Until we are satisfied that we can get these trucks on the free list from Great Britain equal to those from the United States, we should not further burden the country.","Second Reading","CUSTOMS TARIFF VALIDATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The governments of to-day are concerned chieflywith finance, and the concern of the public is whether or not a government is economically spending the public revenues and whether the heavy taxation imposed is justified.

The Governments proposal represents a breach of the trust which the people repose in Parliament, and I shall vote against it.","N/A","BOTANICAL LABORATORIES, CANBERRA","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
100,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WEST, John Edward","KZA","East Sydney","N/A","N/A",882,".- No other undertaking authorized by Parliament during the last ten years has had more to justify it than this has. This is a proposal for carrying out an important work to which we are pledged. In many ways we are still suffering from the folly of past mal-administration, and the present proposal of the Government represents a step towards recovering some of the lost ground. I heartily support this proposal, and if the cost were to be twice as much I would still support it. In the laboratories which are to be built, experts will investigate such matters as soil improvement, and the evolution of improved grasses and plants. It will be a work of great national importance, one which will helpAustralia to meet and overcome economic competition from other countries. Primary production will be stimulated and increased. The honorable member for Perth (Mr. Mann) would not oppose the motion if he understood the subject. I sympathize with him because his environment has prevented him from becoming acquainted with some of the problems concerning which I have endeavoured to educate the House. During the last Parliament I moved that the Government should set aside an area of 20 square miles in the Federal Capital Territory for the purposes of a research institute, station, and farm, and I suggested a means whereby the necessary money might be raised. The same motion appears on the Notice-paper for this session.","N/A","BOTANICAL LABORATORIES, CANBERRA","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

102,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WEST, John Edward","KZA","N/A","N/A","N/A",882,"- I am merely pointing out that the proposal submitted by the Minister is in consonance with the larger one to which I wish to get the assent of this House. This morning I received from Sir George Julius, Chairman of the Bureau of Science and Industry, three pages of foolscap in which he highly commended my proposal, and pointed out how essential it is that such an institute should be established as soon as possible. In Great Britain similar institutes have been in operation since 1843 and have aided to a marked degree the progress of primary production in the Old Country. In the United States of America research work is regarded as fundamental to progress. To every professional man in the Commonwealth, the leading professors at the universities, and 770 newspapers, I have distributed copies of a pamphlet setting out the details of my scheme, and by not one has it been adversely criticized. A few weeks ago Mr. McMasters, a prominent pastoralist, and successful experimenter in the improvement of our flocks, offered £20,000 towards a fund to promote research in the pastoral industry. The Graziers Association has proposed that a fund of £200,000 should be established, and if the Government supports the proposal on national grounds, I am sure the money will be raised. An institute such as is proposed will be the envy of the world. In seeking to lower the cost of production we should not interfere with wages until we can assure to the people cheaper food. No proposal ever submitted to the House was more justified than is the motion now before us. It is recommended by the Works Committee, which has shown a breadth of vision for which it cannot be too highly commended.","N/A","BOTANICAL LABORATORIES, CANBERRA","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The economic position of Canberra is a horror. What can be shown for the £12,000,000 that has been expended in the creation of this city? If the proposed expenditure of £52,000 would do anything towards insuring proper food for human beings and teach them how to avoid disease, I would support it. At the same time, I recognize that diseases of stock should be thoroughly studied so that the meat we eat may be wholesome and that which we export to Europe may be able to compete on favorable terms with that of the Argentine. The War Office has given to the Argentine, in preference to Australia, contracts for the supply of meat to the Army and Navy. Even the deadly poison formalin was used to preserve meat for export to the Homeland, and God alone knows how many men, women, and children have paid with their lives for that infamy. At the recent medical congress in Sydney, testimony was given that the dreadful disease, cancer, which menaces every old man, may be caused in time by the irritation of the intestines, due to certain substances. Amongst the contributors to such irritationare the preservatives and other impurities in foods. The finest white flour is now recognized to be almost deadly; it has little or no food value, because the best parts of the grain have been extracted during the gristing process and used as offal. Sugar, rice, and other foods also lose value through over-refinement. In connexion with the estimate of £52,000 for the proposed institute, I hope that we shall not have a repetition of previous occurrences under the administration of Sir John Butters.","N/A","BOTANICAL LABORATORIES, CANBERRA","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This Parliament House, which was originally estimated to cost. £230,000, has absorbed nearly £700,000 of the taxpayers money. I hope we shall not be told later that an institute estimated to cost £52,000 has actually cost £150,000. I make this protest as a reminder to whomever the officer concerned may be, that works must be completed within the estimated amounts, particularly in this time of economic stress, when the people are staggering under a load of debt, much of which has been unjustly placed on their shoulders.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","BOTANICAL LABORATORIES, CANBERRA","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[5]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I cordially support the remarks made by the Prime Minister, and endorsed by the Leader of the Labour party. While regretting that the exigencies of political life forbid me to express the hope that we shall all meet again in the next Parliament, I may be permitted to say that I trust that we shall, at least, have the privilege of meeting all of our friends now and again in the lobbies. I understand that one honorable member opposite has linked up with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, and proposes to make extensive and exhaustive research in the swamps of the middle-west of New South Wales into the origin and genesis of fangless snakes. In these circumstances, we could not think of breaking in upon his inquiries with the more active work of a member of Parliament. I understand that another honorable member opposite is already engaged in the manufacture for himself of a crown of martyrdom, which is to be hung in some convenient place in the electorate of Wakefield. None can tell what fortune may hold in store for him. We can only wait and pray - pray rather than wait - because there is ah active time ahead of us. Many of us have condemned Canberra in round terms, but most of us long to return to it. With all its faults, we love it still. I like change, and in the next Parliament I shall be quite content if we who sit on your left, sir, enjoy the changed view that is to be had from your right. Such a change will be eminently satisfactory. I wish no person any harm. The worst that can happen to any of us is to be given temporary rest, which surely all of us have earned and deserve. It is my cordial wish that that may be given to some honorable gentlemen who now sit on your right. I believe it will be given to them in rich measure - not, perhaps, the rest which comes from the consciousness of having done right and served ones country disinterestedly; but rest of another kind, which is better than none at all. I am grateful to you, sir, for having presided so impartially and ably over this chamber. It is not for me to express the hope that you may occupy your present position when the new Parliament meets. That Parliament will be the master of its own destiny, and who can tell who will then occupy the position that you now fill? Who can tell, also, who will be Chairman of Committees; and whether he will sit out the whole of the gloomy period allotted for debate, or be tempted by parliamentary circumstances to leave the chair ten minutes earlier than the fixed time? Political work is very exacting, and although we always hope to stay the distance we sometimes fail when we have almost reached the goal. Maybe that will be the fate of the Chairman of Committees; I cannot say. The answers to all these questions are wrapped in the mists of the future.I most cordially thank you, sir, and the officers of this House. I sincerely hope it may be the dispensation of the wise Providence that guards the interests of this country that we who now sit on this side shall return in sufficient numbers to justify our taking our places on the other side. We certainly deserve to do so; and in such an event we shall do justice to our country.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If that is not possible I ask that the privilege may be accorded to at least the right honorable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) because of the fact that the election is considered necessary in consequence of the vote that was taken on the amendment which he moved to the Maritime Industries Bill, and that that will be the principal issue in the campaign. I may mention that I have not discussed this matter with the right honorable gentleman, and that I make the request without his knowledge. The issues should be put to the people as clearly and effectively as possible.I understand that in the party room this morning the Prime Minister made a definite statement regarding the date of the election.

I am not looking for any such privilege, because I can do very well .without it.There is another matter which transcends in importance that of the broadcasting of election speeches. If we are spared by a kindly Providence to take part in the deliberations of the next Parliament, we should set our faces sternly against all-night sittings, which are. iniquitous.

Never has he been so bright, so cheery, so witty or so humorous ; never so little sleepy as he has been during the last few days. It is said that misfortune makes us bright and alert. The transformation that has come over the honorable member since he is no longer in the Ministry is wonderful. I congratulate him, and for the benefit of his electors, I hope that he will never again have to bear the worries of ministerial office.It is said that all-night sittings are harmful, but, Mr. Speaker, is it not true that, during these tests of endurance, we are entertained by harmonious notes that are never struck during the ordinary sitting hours? Who can have but pleasant memories of our recent all-night sittings - memories that will last as long as life endures ? You, Mr. Speaker, must have enjoyed the deep bass of the honorable member for Wannon (Mr. Rodgers) as he slept ! How deep ! How sonorous ! How like a church organ ! And then, now and again, could be heard the cornet-like notes of the honorable member for Warringah (Mr. Archdale Parkhill) as he intoned his thanksgivings. Of course, he was not listening to the discussion or hearing arguments which, had he been awake and listening to them, would have converted him and compelled him to vote against the Government.If you, Mr. Speaker, are returned at the forthcoming election, and we are returned to power, I can assure you on behalf of the Labour party that you shall continue to adorn the chair which you have so worthily filled for some time past. At- any rate, sir, you will do so as long as I have any influence in the party. I say this because I take a broad, national view. Do I not remember the consideration you have extended to me time after time when in this chamber I have wandered from the path of political rectitude? I have nothing but feelings of gratitude for a Speaker who can be so generous to old sinners like myself, and you shall be Speaker for ever if I have power to keep you in the position.We are now on the way to the graveside of some members of this House. Let us hope that it will be that of our opponents. We shall bury them with feelings of gratitude, mingled with feelings of sadness. The fortunes of war necessitate that in a political struggle some must die; hut on such an occasion we prefer to bury our political opponents - of course, with every honour, even though we may be put to the expense of floral tributes. In these contests we are apt to make all manner of assertions about each other, but I make a promise to those who support the Government. My general rule of conduct is to observe humility and kindness in dealing with my opponents unless I am assailed, and even then the attack must be warm. It is only now and then that I am aroused. The promise I make is that in this contest on the public platforms of Australia I shall try to uphold that dignity which I always seek to maintain in this chamber. I shall not say one word against my opponents that can be regarded as being other than in good taste or dignified. I may, of course, say, in company with the honorable member for Richmond (Mr. R. Green), that my opponents are  maggots, or I may paraphrase the words of the honorable member for Gwydir (Mr. Abbott), and describe them as  snakes whose fangs have been drawn. Or I may use the words of my old friend the Treasurer, and describe them as being  infected with tetanus germs. But I shall not mean what I say. Such language as that will only be for the sake of publicity. With the usual decency that adorns our public life, after assailing each others private characters on public platforms, we can still have our cups of tea together. We may talk of running sores, but in the corridors of this building we can still shake each others hands. I might go still higher in the matter of culture - I cannot help my superiority, since God has made me superior - and say of some of my opponents what the right honorable the Prime Minister said of Mr. Charlton, So ignorant; so degrading to public life; or as he said of anothers speech, It violates every decency of public life. We shall say all these things, and yet when we come hack again - triumphant on this side, I hope - we shall resume our friendships. Nevertheless, on this occasion I trust that on the public platform and elsewhere we shall observe decency of manners, and decency of address. In this respect our language will not lose by. comparison with that used by honorable members supporting the Government when they speak of us on the public platforms of this country.Dr. MALONEY (Melbourne) ]4.55[.We, like the gladiators of old, salute you, Mr. Speaker, as men about to die, but although we die as members of this Parliament, we, or at least the majority of us, hope soon to rise again as members of the next. This is my last opportunity to protest in this Parliament against the enormous expenditure on the roof of this building. Some time ago I drew the attention of the Government to the had condition of the roof, and I was told that a certain sum of money had been reserved until the contractors had made the roof perfect. Parliament went into recess, and before it met again the Commission, put 80 tons of gravel on the roof and repaired it at an expense of £2,500. How much were the contractors made to pay for those repairs? The Commission withheld £877 from them, but it expended £2,500. Did the roof stop leaking.? No, and I understand that it is still leaking. I protest against this waste of money. Why did not the Commission make John Howie and Sons complete their job? Were they not able to construct a roof properly? The Commissioner, who has been eulogized by the Prime Minister, passed the expense on to the country. The cost was £2,500, and only £877 was debited against J. Howie and Sons. Even that firm claims to have been unjustly treated by the Commission.Another matter to which I wish to refer is that of the building of the theatre at Canberra. The unfortunate man who built it, placed his plans before the commissioners, who passed and endorsed them. The plans provided for a roof which would enable a fireproof curtain to be installed in the theatre, but some one discovered that the roof was out of alignment with that of Parliament House. This unfortunate man was put to an additional expense of £900 without receiving one penny compensation. The present roof does not permit of the provision of a fireproof curtain, therefore a grave injustice has been done, because, without such a curtain, the manager is able to exhibit only moving pictures. He cannot have a theatrical performance without permission. There was no room in the roof to enable a fireproof curtain to bc raised, and the Commission suggested that a room 12 feet by 12 feet should be built at the corner of the fl ys. Any one who understands anything about an asbestos curtain knows that such an arrangement would soon destroy it. Later on, that great Shakespearean actor, Allan Wilkie, wished to give a performance in the capital of Australia. The manager of the theatre made application to the Chief Commissioner for permission to use it for that purpose, and the Commissioner waited twelve days before answering. Allan Wilkie could not wait, so at that time Canberra lost the opportunity of seeing the great Shakepearean actor. Later on, the position was remedied. The Commission unjustly wronged the builder of the theatre by putting him to additional expenditure without one penny compensation.I come now to Parliament House, this wonderful structure which was estimated to cost £220,000. Has the person who made that estimate been suspended or dismissed for his fault? The cost of this building, to June, 192S, was £617,516. That is how the peoples money is wasted, and I lay the charge of wasteful expenditure at the door of the Commission, principally. The most useful act that the Chief Commissioner does will be to leave Canberra. The words Thank God! will then echo in many homes in Canberra, and the people are even now offering prayers of thanksgiving because the dictators reign has about finished.I cannot wish the Government the good fortune to return to office. I candidly admit that I never allow friendship to interfere with politics. In a political fight my opponents are my enemies, and I hope that most honorable members supporting the Government will soon sink into the limbo of political oblivion. Whether this Government is returned, which I doubt, or another government takes its place, does not alter the fact that it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to abolish the present absurd system of estimating the cost of building at Canberra. This building, although of a temporary character, was estimated to cost £220,000, yet its actual cost was over £617,000. Is it any wonder that Canberra has earned the name of being an open malignant ulcer upon the finances of Australia? I am certain that the majority of honorable members in their hearts would like Canberra closed down altogether. Any business firm that had branches in the capital cities would close down any branch that was not paying. The Federal Capital should have been situated at a place like Albury or the North Shore of Sydney. Under act of Parliament we were permitted to take up land at its valuation, and 27 or 28 years ago the value of 100 or 150 acres on the North Shore of Sydney would not have been very considerable. Albury is a wonderful city, situated on the banks of Australias greatest river. It will shortly have adjacent to it a lake larger than Sydney Harbour. Had Albury been chosen as the Federal Capital City, it would have now had a population of 100,000. Its citizens would have been paying their dues to Australia, and no loss would have been made. What is the present position? We have the abominable system of building from a circumference instead of from a centre. This is the first time in the history of the world that such a system has been introduced. Canberra has a paltry population of 7,000, and yet the city is divided into 22 sections. When one goes out at night, the enormous number of lights reminds one of Sydney or some other large city. I have taken this opportunity of protesting against the action of the Federal Capital Commissioners, and I have no hesitation in saying that when the history of Canberra is written it will clearly show that the tremendous amount of unnecessary expenditure incurred has placed an exceptionally heavy burden upon the finances of the Commonwealth.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[8]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When the history of Canberra, to which the honorable member referred, comes to be written, it will not be condemnatory of the work of Sir John Butters, but will, I am sure, commend him for the success with which he carried out a difficult task during the early days of establishing the Federal Capital.The honorable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) said that he was informed by some one who attended a party meeting this morning that the date of the election had been announced.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Such a suggestion is quite impracticable. The only basis upon which arrangements can be made is that of according equal facilities to all parties.
