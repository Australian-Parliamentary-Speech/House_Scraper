Obviously, this is no occasion for us to endeavour to touch, in any adequate, or even in the lightest fashion, upon all the considerations attaching to the ceremony that the Prime Minister and other honorable members had the opportunity of witnessing. Still, it may be seemly to recall the fact that from the almost uncounted millions of their Majesties subjects, who had no opportunity of being placed in personal touch with . that very striking and memorable ceremony, there has also gone up the universal prayer that the life of the King and Queen, whom we now honour, and to whom we pledge our loyalty, may, be one of fruitfulness, happiness, and content - a reign of unbroken peace. We are fortunate in that our Sovereign and his gracious and illustrious consort - who has already exhibited so many queenly qualities - have ascended the Throne under some circumstances without parallel in our history in one regard, since they have already made themselves acquainted by personal travel with the vast dominions over which they rule. It has also been announced that, as a part of their acceptance of Royal duties, further visits to the dominions and the great suzerainty, the Empire of India, are in contemplation. In these circumstances, the recent ceremony may be termed in a new sense, by no means invidious, since it arises as a natural development, the most popular Coronation recorded. It has evoked a sympathetic chorus of commendation from all peoples throughout the Empire. May it be a brilliant reign, and at its conclusion - which we hope will be long postponed - may it extend over an Empire not only undiminished and undivided, but still more closely united under the Crown.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","CORONATION OF KING GEORGE V","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They should not undertake to do these things without intimating to the member for the district concerned that they are being done. I have no objection to any member doing anything if I cannot or will not do it ; but I venture to say that never, since I have occupied a seat in any Parliament, have I considered myself too big. to do the local business of my electorate, and I hope I never shall. It is an honorable members business to look after his constituents in every possible legitimate way. I have come across two cases lately in which honorable members on the other side have approached the Deputy Registrar of Old-age Pensions in Sydney with respect to pension rights of individuals within my electorate. One of them was the honorable member for Cook, and the other the honorable member for South Sydney. In both cases, I am happy to say that they did not do very much damage. Somehow or other, whether they tried or not, they did not succeed in getting conceded what I think were the very legitimate claims of the people who put these cases into their hands. I am glad also to inform the House that since then, owing to my intervention, things are looking very much more hopeful for those people. Apparently those gentlemen are prepared to take all the credit of anything of the kind that happens to go through without very much effort, but if it should require an effort, I suppose the persons concerned are referred to their own member. I simply call attention to the fact that this kind of thing is going on, and repeat that it is not playing the game. I think it would be got over if the Prime Minister would apply to that particular Department the rule which applies already to most other Departments, and which I believe is generally observed by them. I suggested that course of action to the Deputy Registrar, but he said that he knew nothing about it, and that there was no such rule in his Department.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2) 1911-12","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

On 2 1st June last, the Department addressed to me a letter relating to the establishment of Cadet Corps in country centres, and giving as a reason for its failure to carry out the provisions of the Defence Act the peculiar statement that  the great difficulties and expense entailed by the new scheme necessarily limit the application of it for a year or two. There is a general desire that lads in country centres, as well as in other parts of the Commonwealth, shall be brought under the operation of the Act. I have received from different districts in my electorate requests that I should endeavour to have the provisions relating to the establishment of Cadet Corps carried into effect there, and on making representations accordingly to the Department, I have been told, as the quotation I have just made shows, that, for the time being, the work is shelved, because of the great difficulty and expense entailed by the scheme. We are asked to-day to vote a large sum for defence purposes - it is a large item for one months Supply - and we should have from the Government an assurance that something will be done for these lads. I think it will be conceded by honorable members generally that the Defence Department has made a very grave mistake in disbanding the Cadets, as they were previously established, before they are prepared to bring into operation the new Act. Under the old system boys in Victoria were receiving a splendid training. That system, however, has been ruthlessly destroyed, and, according to the letter to which I have referred, the Department is not prepared, for some indefinite period, to proceed with the new scheme. In the meantime, in country centres, lads who, under the old system, might have been receiving a fairly effective military training, are deprived of an opportunity to secure it, and are compelled to sink their identity as cadets, and to become civilians again. This is a grave mistake, and now that the matter has been ventilated I hope that the Department will take cognisance of it. If the Department is not prepared to carry out the new scheme, I trust that it will at least revert to the old scheme and continue it until the new system is ready for operation.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2) 1911-12","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I refer to section 12, which provides that for the enforcement of all laws in force in the Territory, and .the administration of justice in the Territory, the several Courts of the State of South Australia shall, subject to any ordinance of the Governor-General, continue to have jurisdiction. I think we passed an ordinance - which has not yet been laid on the table of the House - providing for the administration of justice in the Territory, under which provision was made for an appeal from say, a Magistrates Court, and also a subordinate Court to the Supreme Court of the Territory. There is also power to appeal, or to take a case stated from: the Supreme Court of the Territory to the Supreme Court of South Australia. The Northern Territory Administration Act, however, seems to contemplate the Local Court at Adelaide, which had an appellate jurisdiction over Courts in the Territory, as well as a Court of appellate jurisdiction over cases arising in the Territory. There is a doubt about it, because every Act of Parliament is prima facie presumed to apply only to the Territory over which the Legislature passing it has jurisdiction.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2) 1911-12","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In the circumstances, the members of some half-dozen rifle clubs in my electorate are compelled to go to Randwick for practice.

I think I am perfectly in order in raising it now, when money for the purpose is being voted. I believe the same grievance exists throughout New South Wales. The rifle clubs feel that an effort is being made by certain authorities, whether it is intentional or not I do not know, to crush them out of existence. It would be a pity to interfere with the efficiency of the rifle clubs in any way. Provision ought to be made to give them sufficient accommodation, not only in the end of my electorate to which I have referred, but also at the other end, at Lithgow. There is a range near the small arms factory, but no provision is made for the men, who have only Saturday afternoons free, to practise. When they go to the range on a Saturday afternoon they have to stand on one side until the regulars have practised, and if the latter occupy the range till the light grows dim the men have to put their practice off for another week, when, perhaps, the same thing will be repeated. That is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs, and something ought to be done to improve things in this regard all over the Commonwealth. I shall be glad if the Minister representing the Minister of Defence can give the Committee some satisfactory assurances on the matter.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2) 1911-12","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[15]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

120,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"SALMON, Charles","L0K","N/A","N/A","N/A",41,"- I am alluding to that question now. I am afraid there is u want of sympathy with the rifle club movement on the part of those in authority. If there is one thing which the present Government ought to support and foster by every means in their power, it is the rifle club movement, because it is a military movement, purely for defence purposes, and altogether dissociated from what are called the trappings and embroideries of. the ordinary military service. In Victoria, in the year 1900, there were some 1,500 members of rifle clubs, but before the close of that year there were over 20,000 members. We all know the sacrifice that those men have made in order to render themselves efficient, and we know, also, the very scant courtesy they have received from the various Governments during the whole of the period for which they have been under the control of the Commonwealth. But the treatment which they received from previous Governments is as nothing compared with what has happened recently. I am a very strong supporter of the compulsory training principle, and have done all I possibly could inside and outside the House to make it popular and help it along, but I shall be very sorry indeed if the desire of those responsible for this alteration, to make the compulsory training principle the be-all and end-all of our military methods, is going to cause the wilful destruction of the rifle .club movement and the woeful waste that will inevitably result from the disbandment of such a large number of very valuable men. The latest war of which we had any personal experience proved conclusively that rifle shooting was one of the greatest factors in success on the part of a people whose country was being invaded. I refer to the South African war, which would not have been anything like the war it was had it not been for the precision with which our opponents on that occasion could use their arms. I hope that the words uttered by the honorable member for Nepean on this question will receive attention from the Honorary Minister arid from the Minister of Defence. No one realizes more than I do what the Minister of Defence has done for the defence service, what he is doing now, and what he hopes to accomplish, and no one is more anxious than I am to help him; but I want him to realize that, good as may be the advice which is being tendered to him - and we know that it is fairly expensive - several experiments are being tried in Australia which, I venture to say, would not have been tried had we had the sort of advice which many of ur believe is more in consonance with our deserts and with the conditions of the. country. We have sought advice from outside, and that advice is being tendered and being acted upon in a fashion which I was going to describe as ruthless. A very large number of valuable men are being driven out of the service for no other reason than that they have arrived at a certain age. Many of them are quite competent to do the work which they have most efficiently performed for years past, but they are in the way of those who are coming on, and are being moved out. That is a policy with which I do not altogether agree. I believe that experience and ability should always command a certain amount of respect, and that we should not throw away valuable assets which have cost enormous sums to create here, in the shape of the capacity of those responsible for the control of our military service. Perhaps, later on, one may speak at greater length upon that matter, but I urge that inquiry- should be made by the members of the Government themselves into the question of the wilful destruction of the rifle club system - a system which was entered upon with a full knowledge of its ultimate value, but which is apparently being thrown away as unfit for anything but the military scrap-heap. I hope that not many weeks will elapse before personal inquiry is made into the matter by Ministers.. If that is done, I am sure that we shall see a great deal more sympathy shown to> these men, who are deserving of the greatest consideration for what they have done to fit themselves for the defence of the country. They undertake the work without hope of fee or reward, imbued solely with the desire to make themselves more capable of carrying out the highest patriotic duty which any man can perform - the duty of defending the hearths and homes of those who depend upon them, and the country in which they live.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2) 1911-12","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[16]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
121,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FOWLER, James","JWG","Perth","N/A","N/A",42,". - I wish to direct the attention of the Minister of Home Affairs to the discrepancy between the recent census returns and the total of the population as computed by the local statistician. This matter is attracting some interest in Western Australia. There is st difference of about 12,000 between the populations as calculated by the State and Federal officials, and that means a considerable sum in connexion with the financial arrangement between the Commonwealth and the State. Can the Minister state whether the Census Bureau allows anything for what I may call misses in the collection of the census returns? In a State like Western Australia, with its immense area, with numbers of settlers living in remote and inaccessible parts, with its very scattered gold-fields population, with many prospectors out of reach of census enumerators altogether, and the same state of things occurring even in the agricultural localities, where many settlers are taking up land altogether remote from the little centres of population, it will be easily understood that a considerable number of people are missed in the count. That undoubtedly happens all over Australia, but particularly in Western Australia. Does the Census Bureau simply take the totals of the returns as collected by its various officers, or does it allow a percentage for possible omissions? They are not only possible in Western Australia, but we know positively that many have taken place in the collection of the census returns there. Reports have come in from many outlying districts as to people who have not been approached or have not filled up any census returns at all. It can be readily understood that these are only a percentage of those who have been missed altogether. I do not know whether there has been any communication between the State statistician and the Federal Census Bureau on the matter, but I hope that, at any rate, an attempt will be made at adjustment. It is felt very keenly in Western Australia that the discrepancy of 12,000 ought to be most carefully investigated, in view of the sum involved under the present financial agreement.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2) 1911-12","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I believe the rifle clubs could be extended in a way that would make them much more useful as a second line of defence throughout the Commonwealth. It might also be possible to maKe use of them to provide a system of continuity of training. Thus the training which young men receive under the compulsory system might be continued when they become members of rifle -clubs, but that could only be done by introducing a system of compulsion into the rifle club movement also. That is a question which the Minister could well consider in connexion with the extension and improvement of the rifle club system generally. I rose more particularly to draw attention to the vote of ^58,404 to carry on the administration of .the Northern Territory. I realize that the matter is too large to discuss on a Bill of this kind, but I am sorry to see that the measure in which it is proposed to deal with a question of such magnitude is relegated to about the seventeenth paragraph in the Governor-Generals Speech.

If a Commission or other responsible body, capable of dealing with a territory of this kind, has been appointed, the public ought to have known something more about the appointment: However, this is not the time to deal with the question extensively. I believe that if this Territory be properly handled - if a Land Bill is introduced on a proper basis - it will be possible to develop this northern portion of our country without any great cost to the Commonwealth. As I have already indicated, we have here one of the most important problems this Parliament has ever had to face; and I hope that a measure dealing with it will be one of the first passed in this Chamber. The Prime Minister, as has already/ been said, has returned from one of the most important functions in the history of the world, I desire to congratulate him on his safe arrival in Australia, with his colleagues, who represented us at the great Imperial Conference and at the Coronation, a ceremony of which the Empire is properly and justly proud.","Second Reading","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2) 1911-12","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[18]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This range will accommodate the rifle men referred to by the honorable member for Nepean. I find, however, that the other day, when, in view of the completion of this range, a telephone was applied for, it appeared that, owing to some military regulation, this convenience could not be granted. I am told that, before a telephone is granted, a range must be a certain distance outside the metropolitan area, and there must be a certain number of targets and other conditions observed. None of these regulations will fit every case ; but if ever there was a range which ought to have a telephone, it is the range to which I refer. I am sure that this range will not be of very much service unless there is a telephone; and I hope the Minister in charge will take a note of my observations. I was glad to hear the affairs at Lithgow referred to, though I should not have referred to them myself but for the fact that the other day the State member for the district made a speech at that place.

Since the prorogation, an event of supreme importance to the Empire - the Coronation of His Majesty the King - has taken place, and the Prime Minister, as representative of the Commonwealth, has worthily upheld the dignity of his position at the centre of the Empire. A number of other honorable members were also given the opportunity to become better acquainted with that important Territory, Papua. Far from objecting to such a visit of inspection as was made by them, I think that undertakings of that kind must benefit the Commonwealth, by adding to our comparatively small sum of knowledge of the Territory. During the recess there were submitted to the people by way of referendum a number of questions which it was hoped would be answered in the affirmative, and I share the regret expressed in the Speech of the Governor-General that the replies were in the negative. But the time is not far distant when, in some form or another, the proposals so submitted will be accepted by both sides of the House.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

178,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"BRENNAN, Frank","JSC","N/A","N/A","N/A",47,"-I am encouraged to think so, because there is not one of those proposals to which some honorable members opposite are not committed, while in regard to them all the Ministerial party is solid and united, and therefore in one form or another we may yet see them adopted in their entirety. I hope, at any rate, that the Opposition will assist the Government in getting the House out of the cul de sac created by the answer given by the people. There is nothing in the GovenorGenerals Speech of greater importance - at any rate, nothing that will excite more controversy - than the proposal relating to the establishment of a Commonwealth bank. Honorable members have before them no details regarding that proposition, but I think I am safe in saying that there is no part of the policy of the Government for which there has been, and is now, a more insistent demand. I am quite certain, from my own experience, that no other proposal has been received with more genuine applause at the hands of the electors themselves. It appears to be suggested that the Government may ignore the expert advice of those qualified to advise them in this very important matter. . I can well understand that we shall have no shortage of advisers, but I hope that while the Government will receive freely the advice of those qualified to give it, they will recognise their full responsibility as to the details of the measure, and that they will neither solicit, nor too readily accept, the advice of those who may justly be suspected of having an interest in the defeat of such a scheme. I hope, and believe, that, under the Bill, no injustice will be done to private banking corporations. We have to remember, however, that, after all, the private banking corporations have been, in the past, the spoilt children of fortune, and that if, in the future, they are to be something less than that, they have hardly any just cause of complaint against the Government. The Ministry, in dealing with this question, are doing as they did in the case of the Commonwealth progressive land tax - they are boldly facing one of those national problems which have been too long ignored, and are facing it, too, in a courageous way. It may well be that as in the case of the Commonwealth land tax, difficulties, and, perhaps, even temporary injustices, will occur, but that I take to be the necessary consequence of undertaking for the first time national measures of such great and far-reaching importance. I notice with pleasure that it is proposed to introduce a Bill to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and, presumably, that measure will embody a number of amendments. Unfortunately, the Act has failed to some extent in usefulness by reason of the constitutional limitations under which it is being used, but the amendments foreshadowed, as I understand them, relate to questions with which we can deal effectively under the constitutional instrument, which we now enjoy, as it stands. One of those amendments, I hope, and believe, will be designed to meet the recent case known as the engine-drivers case, in which it was decided by the High Court that it was not enough to have community of interest amongst the employes in order to entitle them to register under the Act, but that it was necessary also to have mutual interests amongst the employers. I think that, under the Act as originally passed, the intention was that where we had, engaged in the same class of work, a large body of men whose interests, rights, obligations, and duties, were in every sense identical, that body of men should be allowed to come in and register under it, and secure the benefits for which it provides. 1 know of no just principle upon which it is necessary for men to say that, although they have interests in common, their employers have not, and therefore, on technical grounds, they must be defeated in their endeavours to get under this Act. It cannot be too clearly remembered, too continuously borne in mind, that by this Act, brought forward in the first place by a Government not of the party to which I belong, a deliberate invitation was extended to men in practically all avocations to come in and register. That invitation having been given, not only every encouragement, but every convenience, should be extended to them to come in and register under the Act, which, after all, is a peaceful measure designed to prevent the necessity of recourse to that very inharmonious method of settling disputes - the method of the strike. We may link with this subject another matter referred to in the Speech, namely, the amendment of the Public Service Act. I do not know whether the measure referred to is to provide for the public servants having recourse to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

180,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"BRENNAN, Frank","JSC","N/A","N/A","N/A",48,"- It will be dealt with in a separate measure. I entirely agree with the proposal that public servants should have recourse to the Arbitration Court. I am unable to discover any principle under which men who happen to be the servants of the State should be prohibited from getting the benefits of the law of the land relating to arbitration, just as they have to obey the law in other matters. If there is any principle underlying the contention, I submit that it is the vicious one, namely, that the State being the paramount authority, from whom there is no appeal, has power to deprive its own employes of the right to take advantage of an Act which it insists upon other employes obeying and employers observing. I cannot imagine that such a contention could be based upon any just principle. Unfortunately, however, we have seen in other places too much of a tendency to treat public servants as persons who, by placing themselves as servants of the Crown, have abandoned some of their civic rights. I am far from saying that the public servants as a body are badly treated or underpaid. I think their treatment and payment, as a whole, compare very favorably with those of other countries, and that we are doing what is a fair thing; but the questions of payment, terms, or conditions of employment, do not enter into this matter. The question of whether they are well or ill paid is quite beside the vital question of whether they should have the right of appeal to the pure, clear atmosphere of the public tribunals of. the land. Very closely associated with this proposition on the part of the Government, is one to bring in a Bill to amend the Seamens Compensation Act. I presume that the Attorney-General hopes to be able to compass a satisfactory amendment of that Act under the Constitution as it stands, although I confess that at present I do not quite see how that is to be done.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

182,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"BRENNAN, Frank","JSC","N/A","N/A","N/A",48,"- I suppose that the honorable member realizes that it is one of the many grave difficulties pressing upon him by reason of the rejection of the referenda proposals. It has, however, to be faced. As honorable members will recollect, the intention of the Act was defeated in that it was held to constitute an interference with the rights of the States as to their domestic commerce. The result of the decision of the High Court has been to defeat seamen in what, presumably, were just claims, or, if not just claims, suits at least deserving to be tried and heard in respect of injuries sustained in connexion with our coastal shipping. The Act has gone by the . board, and I am glad that an effort will be made once more to place it upon the statute-book in a useful and effective form. Very closely allied to that proposition also is the Navigation Bill, which, I understand, is an old friend. I have just been introduced to it, but suppose I shall become more familiar with it in the course of my political career, whether it be short or long. Reference is made in His Excellencys Speech to a revision of the Tariff. I am very glad to know that the. Minister is making a sympathetic investigation in regard to anomalies in the Tariff ; and am perfectly certain, in view of the honorable gentlemans reputation, and his opinions on the subject, that fair play will be given those manufacturers who can prove that they are inequitably treated under the Tariff, as it stands. I am equally certain, however, that no amount of beating the wind, and no amount of stirring up dust, will draw him, or honorable members generally, on this side of the House, away from the position which he and they have taken up, namely, that any benefits which are conferred on the manufacturers by the Tariff wall, as we now have it erected, shall be shared in a reasonable manner by the employes working under them. It seems to me a very just position to take up, and I cannot understand why there should be any demur on the part of those manufacturers who are , invited cordially and courteously to set out the basis of their claims for increased Tariff protection. I cannot understand why they should make any demur in acceding to that very reasonable request which is designed, if not wholly, at any rate in a very large measure, in their own interests. There are referred to in the Speech a large number of matters to which I do not propose to make any reference in this my maiden utterance in this Chamber. I take pleasure in the fact that the surplus revenue,, which I suppose is in itself a matter upon which we may congratulate ourselves, is being devoted to the payment of old-age pensions and the construction of the Australian Fleet unit. Perhaps it is a weakness, but I confess to perhaps greater pleasure in the money that is being well spent on old-age and invalid pensions than even in that which is being directed to the liquidation of the amount owing in respect of the fleet. Whether the one is of greater importance than the other, or whether the two are capable of comparison or not, it is a matter for congratulation that the surplus is there, and that it is proposed to be so wisely expended.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[1]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
183,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"JOHNSON, William","K9R","Robertson","ALP","N/A",49,". - I second the motion. I desire to join my expressions of sympathy with those of the honorable member for Batman in regard to the decease of our late members and comrades, Mr. Beard and Mr. G. B. Edwards. I wish to extend my congratulations to the Prime Minister and his colleagues for the way in which they represented the Commonwealth at the important functions connected with the Coronation, and at the Imperial Conference. I feel sure that the result of the deliberations of that body must meet with the approval of the majority of the people of Australia and of the members of this House. The decision arrived at with regard to the control of the Australian naval unit was distinctly favorable to the views of the present Government and their supporters. We are glad to know that the Australian Government is to retain absolute control of the unit. That was a feature of naval policy put forward by the first Fisher Government in this House. Then, as we know, in time of war, with the consent of the Australian Government, the Australian naval unit will pass under the control of the Imperial authorities. I notice with pleasure that a full measure of attention is being given to the construction of the Australian Navy both at home and abroad. Some- time ago I read with pleasure in the Sydney Daily Telegraph a statement showing the amount of work on order at the Fitzroy dockyards in Sydney. The total amount, so far as my memory serves me, which that socialistic concern, conducted by the Government of New South Wales, had in front of it was £808,000 worth. On taking the trouble to separate from the other work that which was being done to the order of the Commonwealth Government, I discovered that over ^650, 000 worth had been placed with the New South Wales Government by the present Government of the Commonwealth. In that regard, therefore, the people of New South Wales have nothing to complain of.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

185,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"JOHNSON, William","K9R","N/A","ALP","N/A",49,"- Possibly the best terms offering were those of the New South Wales Government, and it was considered desirable in the interests of the people to accept them. We come now to the question of the Australian note issue. During the recess we have had time to note the operation and the success, or non-success, in the community, of the Australian paper currency. I am bound to say that, despite the gloomy forebodings of our honorable friends on the other side, all is still going well. I believe that a profit of at least ,£200,000 per year is being made for the benefit of the people of the Commonwealth through the Government undertaking the control of the paper currency. If that is so, then indeed the people of Australia have something to thank this Government for. The House wisely determined in passing the Act that all profits arising from the note issue should go into a trust fund, and I suppose that at least £200,000 per annum is now forming the nucleus of a fund wherewith to liquidate the national debt of Australia. I am reminded also that money from the fund has been lent to the various State Governments, and is in that way earning interest which is of material benefit to the people generally. As a representative of the State of New South Wales, and one who is desirous of seeing the construction of the Federal Capital pushed forward, and our ideas in this direction realized. I view with satisfaction the inclusion of the paragraph referring to that matter. We are told that  other works necessary for the establishment of the city will be proceeded with without delay. During the recess I had the pleasure of visiting the Federal Capital area on more than one occasion, and was pleased to see the number of men employed, and the amount of work proceeding there. The Minister of Home Affairs and his officers are to be congratulated upon the energy they are displaying in carrying out their task as far as they can with the amount that has been placed at. their disposal. I trust that in the near future, when the Estimates of the year proper are laid before us, we shall find a very substantial sum provided in order that the Department may continue to carry on this highly important work. I shall be no party to any attempt to interfere with the Tariff, except on such lines as will secure absolutely fair conditions for all persons employed in any industry upon which the Tariff is supposed to operate. The time has gone by for the building of Tariff walls to protect manufacturers who sweat their employes, and who have no regard for fair conditions of living or decent rates of pay. I trust that, whatever the Government propose to do in this direction, they will, before they present their Bill to the House, make sure that the interests of the workers, young or qld, male or female, are amply safeguarded. The announcement that we shall be asked to amend the Arbitration Act also meets with my approval. As the honorable member for Batman pointed out, the country owes to another Government the fact that there is on the statute-book of the Commonwealth an Arbitration Act at all, and I am sure that we ought to look forward with confidence to the hearty cooperation of both sides of the House in the effort to make that Act attain the end that honorable members had in view when they placed it upon the statute-book.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Reference is made in the Speech to the transcontinental railway, and here again a pledge given by the Government is about to be redeemed. That is an undertaking which, of course, will require a considerable amount of money, and is not a new question in this Chamber. The proposal of the Government is to construct a transcontinental railway on the standard gauge of 4 ft. 8£ in. This has been approved of bv successive Governments previous to the present one, and has the indorsement of leading commercial men and of those interested in our defence affairs. I therefore view with satisfaction the announcement that the Government intend to ask the sanction of the House to proceed with that work with as little delay as possible. The following paragraph dealing with universal military training appears in the speech : -During the recess the system of universal training under the Defence Act has been successfully inaugurated, and the patriotic response by the youth of Australia to the call to prepare themselves for the defence of their country U very gratifying.It is indeed gratifying to learn that the response of the youth of Australia can be described as patriotic, but in New South Wales, while I have not as yet heard of any private employer putting obstacles in the way of the boys or youths attending to their compulsory training, I do know on very good authority that the; Railways Commissioners are deducting from the weekly wages of the boys and youths in their employ something for the time which is lost in attending drills. That is a crying shame, and representations should be made to the New South Wales Government by the Defence Department in order that an end may be put at once to this little pin-pricking.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

191,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"JOHNSON, William","K9R","N/A","ALP","N/A",50,"- A very substantial loss is incurred each year by the break of gauge ; and I trust that, before the session closes, some steps will be taken in conjunction with the State Governments to solve this important problem. We shall then know that our railways are more effective for defence than they can possibly be under present circumstances. We are told in paragraph 17 that we shall be invited to consider measures for the government and development of the Northern Territory. That, I take it, means that we shall provide a Constitution and lay down how the lands are to be held, and how that development for which we hope is to be brought about. I trust that any measure introduced will permit of a vigorous policy under a liberal Constitution. We are told, further, that steps are to be taken to pay for the properties transferred from the States to the Commonwealth. This is a question that has been in abeyance for a considerable time, and has, I might say, been rather dallied with than tackled seriously. However, the termination of the Braddon section and the constitutional alteration providing for the payment of 25s. per head to the States, necessitates a consideration of the question; and, in my opinion, the States are quite justified in asking that their claims should be dealt with. The proposal put forward by the Government, through the Acting Treasurer, during the recess, is one which I think ought to meet with the approval of the House, and be considered satisfactory to all concerned. So far as I can gather, that proposal is to pay interest on the State debts at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum, and to set aside a sum equal to½ per cent. per annum in order to establish a sinking fund to ultimately wipe out the principal debt. I trust that this proposal will be laid before us, and found acceptable. The Seamens Compensation Bill is one of great importance to all who  go down to the sea in ships. As the honorable member for Batman has pointed out, this Bill is the result of litigation, which has showed our previous legislation to be invalid. That legislation purported to secure compensation to seamen or the dependents of seamen who were injured or lost their lives in the InterState trade. Whether that object has been attained or not, no provision was made for the protection of those engaged in the Intra state trade; and I hope that the proposed Bill will meet all requirements in this direction. The proposal to allow public servants to take advantage of the Arbitration and Conciliation Court should meet with the approval of no one more than the Postmaster-General. The storms of indignation which have been poured on his head by the daily press, in the name of the postal employes, but generally without their concurrence, must have worried the honorable gentleman at times; but in the near future persons with grievances against their employers, whether Federal, State, or private, should be able in the interests of the general community, to place their case before a Court and have those grievances settled satisfactorily. Before concluding I should like to say a word or two about the proposed amendment in the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act and the Electoral Act. At present an invalid who earns more than 5s. per week cannot obtain a pension, whereas an old-age pensioner may earn 10s. per week without disqualification ; and I desire to see the amount in each case raised to 10s., so as to place all on the same footing. In the case of the electoral laws the Minister in charge is no doubt confronted with much difficulty. In the immediate past there have been gross exhibitions of partisanship on the part of persons associated with the conduct of electoral campaigns ; and on no occasion have those exhibitions been more flagrant than during the recent referenda contest. It is within my own experience that immediately preceding the taking of the referenda ballot, men, who were employed by the Department of Home Affairs collecting information for the census, were engaged by some other persons to distribute - or voluntarily distributed - literature and advice to the electors as to how they should vote.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[2]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is gratifying to know that, while there is a loss on penny postage there are compensating advantages. I do not know whether the Postmaster-General is too modest in his demands on the Treasury, or whether his Deputy Postmasters-General are too modest in their demands on him, in providing for the necessary services of the country. 1 do know, however, that much work in connexion with the Post and Telegraph Department is being delayed. Only yesterday one of my constituents was told by the Deputy Postmaster-General in New South Wales that there was no possible hope of constructing a short line of telephone in a remote country district, under guarantee conditions, for at least eighteen months, for the reason, amongst others, that there is no money available. I should commend the Postmaster-General to follow the example of those associated with the Defence Department. On their estimates, very large sums are voted, and the alacrity with which these are spent shows that those in charge are quite up-to-date in both getting and spending.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[2]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I very much doubt, however, whether we are spending more in the Post and Telegraph Department than on defence ; because I know that, in all parts of Australia, and particularly in the Robertson electorate, deserving communities are denied mail and telephonic communication on the ground that money is not available, or that men cannot be found to do the work. If, however, the Defence Department needs £1,000,000, it can have it, and somehow it finds the men to do all the work required. We have imported officers at £1,000 a year on the pay-sheet; and the activity the Department displays in getting them here before there are forces to drill or quarters for them to live in, sets an example which might be followed in some respects by the Postmaster-Generals Department. If more activity were shown in the direction I have indicated, the honorable gentleman would deserve the gratitude of long-suffering people in the more remote parts of the Robertson, Nepean, and other electorates over which I have had occasion to travel. My predecessor in the representation of the electorate asked, ten years ago, for telephonic communication between Cassilis-Merriwa and Muswellbrook, and yet, to-day, I get a letter from the Department saying that the line is one which must be constructed under a guarantee, and that it is in a list with hundreds of others which cannot be undertaken because there is no money or the necessary staff of men available. If this state of affairs continues, the people must suffer. Many of my constituents pay large sums by way of taxation on unimproved land values, and I ask the Postmaster-General to give them consideration. If in the past his requests to the Treasurer have been too modest, I ask him to make them bigger. Let us provide what is necessary for the welfare of our people rather than spend money lavishly on this rotten, foolish business of defence. I trust that every measure referred to in the Governor- Generals Speech will be enacted before the. session closes, and will result in benefit to the electors.Debate (on motion by Mr. Deakin) adjourned.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[2]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
