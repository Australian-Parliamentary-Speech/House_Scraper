His service in the Commonwealth Parliament extended over a period of sixteen years, first as member for North Sydney from 1911 to 1919, and later as member for Warringah from 1919 to 1927. As a young man he served in the South African War, in which he waa severely wounded. In recognition of his service, he was awarded the Queens medal with four clasps.Shortly after the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, he proceeded overseas with the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, and was subsequently appointed to the command of the Australian Imperial Force in Egypt with the rank of Major-General.He was honoured by His Majesty the King on three occasions by the award of the decorations of C.M.G., C.B., and K.C.M.G.Shortly after the termination of the warhe attained ministerial office in the Hughes Ministry as Assistant Minister for Defence, and in 1927 he was appointed to succeed the Right Honorable Sir Joseph Cook as High Commissioner for the Commonwealth in London.Sir Granville Ryries record of public service, which I have briefly reviewed, is an inspiring one. He was a very sincere man, possessing an intense love for his native country. His interests were many, but he was specially devoted to the pastoral industry with which he had been closely associated from boyhood.His comrades in the Australian Imperial Force pay tribute to his capacity for leadership, and to his forceful, but genial and likeable personality. Those associated with him in the ministerial and parliamentary spheres testify to his very capable service. He is remembered by them as a loyal and trustworthy colleague.Sir Granville Ryrie rendered useful service to the Commonwealth in his capacity as High Commissioner in London, and in all his work he served Australia with distinction. He well merited the prominent position which is retained of him in the memories of the Australian people. To his widow and family we desire to offer our sincere sympathy in their loss. I move - by leave -That this House expresses its deep regret at the death of Major-General the Honorable Sir Granville de Laune Ryrie, K.C.M.G., CB., V.D., a former member of the New South Wales and Commonwealth Parliaments, Assistant Commonwealth Minister, and High Commissioner for Australia in London, places on record its appreciation of his distinguished public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE SIR GRANVILLE RYRIE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

His very distinguished career was crowned by his appointment as  the representative of Australia in the important office of High Commissioner in London. His very notable record indicated the possession of a great variety of gifts and qualifications. I pay tribute to the work he has done, and express very deep sympathy with his widow and family.Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places,Motion (by Mr. Lyons) agreed to -That Mr. Speaker be requested to transmit to LadyRyrie the foregoing resolution, together with a copy of the speeches delivered thereon.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE SIR GRANVILLE RYRIE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
