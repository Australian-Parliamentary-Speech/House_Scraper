My inquiries satisfy me that these men are not so essential to industry as their employers contend that they are. On the other hand, some members of the forceswho have had active service extending over a period of three or four years cannot obtain their discharge from the Army, even though they may be B class or married men with domestic obligations. Will the Prime Minister have an independent survey made of the position, in order to ascertain whether or not it may be practicable to release from industry men who wish to join the fighting services, and thus enable them to replace others with long service who, because of their obligations, wish to return to civilian life?","MAN-POWER","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Such merchants have also been permitted to introduce their wives and minor children, as well as assistants whose entry was warranted by the extent of the business transacted.Chinese students from the age of ten years have been admitted to attend, not only universities, but also approved primary and secondary schools, and the general practice has been to allow them to continue their studies up to the age of 24 years, or in special cases even beyond that age if they have qualified for higher education.

I was most interested to hear from the Prime Minister his account of the important discussions in which he took part, and I was glad to hear his assurance that the ties of Empire were never stronger than they are now. Once more, we have had demonstrated the value of the Empire, whose efforts during the early stages of the war made possible the victory which is now in sight. When I was in England, I had an opportunity to witness at first hand the trials which the British people were enduring, and to note the courage with which they met them. My colleagues and 1 were impressed with the endurance of the people, and we left with the conviction firmly rooted in our minds that the Empire, headed by Great Britain, must at all costs be preserved as a guarantee of future liberty. We should never forget that, during the early part of this war, Britain faced the enemy alone. At one time, there was not more than a fortnights supply of food in the country, and it was threatened at the same time from the air and from the sea. The submarine campaign was at its height, but the danger was eventually overcome. At this very time, too, other countries in all parts of the world, including our own, were screaming to Britain for help. I do not know whether we realize the value of the effort which Britain made in the Middle East, or the importance of success in that campaign. Had the Germans got through to Irak and Iran, joined with the Japanese, and perhaps thrust north through Russia, nothing would have been left for Australia, and eventually the United States of America, perhaps, but to go down before the enemy. But for the efforts which Britain made then, the Allies would never have been in a position to win the war. I am glad that Australia was represented by the Australian Imperial Force in those vital battles in the Middle East. While I was in Great Britain, I was left in no doubt of the gratitude of the people to Australia and the other Dominions.After the war, there will be many problems to solve, and Britain will have its full share of them. Britain, unlike ourselves, will have to rebuild its cities, and will also have to re-establish its finances. Before the war, Britain was a creditor nation, but it was compelled to dispose of its overseas assets in order to finance its war effort. Moreover, during the course of the war, such countries as Canada and India had become important, manufacturing centres. Therefore, Great Britain will be confronted with serious difficulties after the war, having regard particularly to the fact that its trade credits are depleted, whilst the Unitell States of America has now emerged as the leading ship-building country.If the anxious times ahead of the Mother Country, all members of the British Commonwealth of Nations should display great generosity in their future demands upon the United Kingdom, particularly when such demands involve monetary benefit to themselves. Canada has set us an admirable example in this respect. During the war it has developed its industries to a remarkable degree. It has been able to obtain sufficient man-power for its agricultural and secondary industries: and so great has been its production thai it has been able to wipe out its debt to Great Britain since the outbreak of war. In addition, it has made a gift to the Mother Country of foodstuffs and war material to the value of £800,000,000, and these goods have been shipped in vessels constructed in Canada itself. Canada made that grant as a gesture of goodwill, realizing the grave economic difficulties confronting Great Britain, and the great sacrifices made by its people. Australia and the other dominions should try to emulate the spirit thus displayed by Canada towards the Mother Country. Only in that way can be ensured the preservation of the Empire to which we are proud to belong. I again express my pleasure at the sentiments towards the Old Country which were voiced by the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) in moving the Address-in-Reply Whilst Australia itself has contributed not a little to the war effort of the Allied Nations, we must realize that, in the not far distant future, Great Britain will be obliged to call upon us for further assistance. All of ais applaud the help given to the Allied cause by the United States of America. We must never forget, however, that the United States of America was enabled to render that help largely because of the orders placed by Great Britain for war material long before the United States of America entered the conflict on the side of the Allies, and before we heard anything at all about lend-lease. Up to that stage, the value of British expenditure and orders placed in the United States of America amounted to approximately £1,000.000,000. The United States of America was thus enabled to strike so effectively when it entered the war. I remind honorable members oppo- site that these great achievements were accomplished under a system of private enterprise. I emphasize that point, because Government supporters seem to believe that the war provides an opportunity to wipe out private enterprise in favour of government control in industry. When they remember the splendid record of the United States of America in providing the bulk of the requirements of the United Nations, let them also bear in mind that private enterprise was largely responsible for that success. Today unemployment is unknown in the United States of America. When I visited that country as a member of the Australian parliamentary delegation, I asked the general manager of one of the shipbuilding yards controlled by the great Kaiser organization what was going to happen to their employees after the war, and was informed that Mr. Kaiser had plans in hand for works which would provide employment for many more employees than were now engaged by that organization. I was told that he has prepared plans for the production of a car which will sell at from £80 to £100, and also a small aeroplane. I was also informed that the Kaiser organization employs a staff of scientists who are concentrating on the expansion of the work of the organization after the war. The lowest paid employee in the organization, an outside sweeper, receives £2 10s. a day. The Allied Nations owe it to themselves to do all they can to rehabilitate the countries devastated by war. With this end in view conferences of economists have been held at Bretton Woods, and plans now in hand provide for the creation of a fund for this purpose amounting to from £2,500,000,000 to £3,000,000,000. By such planning, the United Nations will avoid the chaos which otherwise will inevitably follow the war.The Minister for Information (Mr. Calwell), who was recently described by the press as the Minister for the suppression of Information, endeavoured to frighten the people by painting a picture of a depression far more severe than the last which he said would occur in this country should the Governments referendum proposals be not agreed to. By indulging in such propaganda, the Minister does not do justice to himself or to his party. The last depression occurred when i\ Labour government was in office in this Parliament. It would be as illogical to say that, because of that fact, the Labour Government was responsible for the depression, as it would be to say that this Government could prevent a depression in this country should conditions throughout the world which existed during the .last depression be repeated after this conflict. We must remember that the last depression was world-wide. To-day, however, the United Nations are prepared to pool their resources in order to prevent another world-wide depression; and we can best help to prevent another depression from occurring in this country by playing our part in the plans now being devised with that end in view by the United Nations.Many factors operate to retard the development of Australia. Unlike Canada, we have not wiped out our national debt by production. Unfortunately, grave blunders have been made on our food front, resulting in severe handicaps being placed upon our primary producers. Owing to the shortage of man-power, many farms ha.ve gone out of production. Many old settlers, because of their patriotism, have done their best to carry on in the absence of sons and daughters who have joined the fighting services. However, the task has proved to be too much for many . of these people. Some of them have endeavoured to sell out, but have been prevented from doing so. Surely, in such circumstances, it would be wiser to allow these old people to make way for younger settlers. Our production of foodstuffs has fallen also because of the difficulty being experienced by primary producers in obtaining new machinery and spare parts for old machines. On one farm, to which I accompanied the members of the British and Canadian delegations, which recently visited this country, the farmer had been obliged to purchase a new junior rotary harvester at a cost of £182 because he had been unable to obtain spare parts for his old machine at a cost of £5. One can readily imagine the loss of production resulting under such conditions. The members of the British delegation expressed astonishment that this farmer was unable to obtain the spare parts he required. They pointed out that in GreatBritain a primary producer,, who required spare parts for an old machine, had only to communicate with his business house which immediately made the parts if they did not have them on hand. The British Governments primary consideration was to keep machines running. Blacksmith shops which are absolutely essential to the maintenance of primary production arc being forced, by lack of labour, either to curtail their services or to close down. In my own electorate there is a smithy which will close within two or three weeks unless I am successful in obtaining the release from the Army of the son of the smith, whose arm is crippled; the son, a skilled blacksmith, ];as been a batman in the Army for two or three years. Almost any one can be a batman, but there are few blacksmiths. If this smithy is . dismantled, as is threatened, the producers of butter, maize and other essential commodities in the district will not be able to keep their horses shod and will be seriously hampered in their efforts to assist this countrys battle on the food front. Food production is also seriously impaired by two factors operating to the detriment of garages in rural districts. Those garages have not sufficient labour to keep essential farming vehicles and plant in running order, and many of them suffer a second disadvantage in that their quotas of oxywelding gas are too low or, in many instances, almost non-existent. It is strange that many old-established firms are on very low quotas, whereas some newly established ones are on high quotas. 1 support what was said by the honorable member for Robertson (Mr. Williams) about the excessive use of motor vehicles by the Army while the farming community cannot get tyres and is provided with insufficient petrol. Many Army vehicles ought to be stripped of their tyres to enable primary producers to put them to much better use than would appear to be the case with the Army. Primary producers are forced to allow their motor vehicles to remain idle because they have no tyres and are trying to take their produce to the railway on vehicles drawn by horses, for which they cannot even now get shoes that will fit. Even if that be impracticable, it seems that no reason exists why the farmers should be deprived et lyres. For one thing, stores are bulging w.ib. huge stocks of tyres. Moreover, the tyres on tens of thousands of idle vehicles which were commandeered by the Army when invasion threatened could be distributed to the farmers. Another illustration of the almost countless difficulties under which primary producers are labouring is contained in the following letter which I received yesterday from the secretary of the South Burnett District of the Queensland Dairymens Organization, an association which spreads over all the dairying districts of Queensland : - 1 have very definite evidence that mainten ance of primary production in this district is being menaced by the inability of farmers to maintain supplies of trace chains essential for all cultivation work by horse-drawn implements; in fact they cannot even obtain split links  to join together the chains which break because of ordinary wear. I can assure you that this i9 a very real difficulty, and my organization would appreciate the making of strong representations by you to the proper authorities.I have made representations to the Minister. Trace chains are as essential to horsedrawn vehicles as are engines to motor vehicles. Fishing boats and nets are rotting while their former owners are making fruitless efforts to obtain their release from the Army, where they are doing nothing of value, so that they may return to their former occupation in order to aid in the production of a commodity which, if provided in sufficient quantities, will not only increase the range of food available to the Australian population, but also, by reducing the local demand, will enable the despatch of increased quantities of meat to Great Britain. Fish is a food, the growing of which costs nothing. The only requirements are men, boats and nets. The boats and nets are available - indeed they are rotting through neglect - but the men are not. I commend to the attention of the Ministry the suggestion that the food situation would be materially aided if fishermen doing little or nothing in the Army were allowed to return to their avocation.If a serviceman is in any one of five categories laid down by Government order, neither the man-power authorities nor the Army may release him, regardless of how urgent the need for his release may be. That order would .be all right, but for the fact that on several occasions the Minis-Mr. Bernard Corser. ter for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Scully) caused to be placed in the newspapers throughout Australia advertisements of this character -Man-power foe Dairy FARMSRelease of persons from the Army or elsewhere to help increase production can now be arranged.Those advertisements, inserted by the Commonwealth Food Control, appeared early this year. Later, the Army had to counteract their effect. Later still, those whose applications for release had been rejected were told to apply again. I made unavailing efforts to discover from the Army whether that advice came from it. Last week, we had an official statement that the whole matter of man-power is to be reviewed. This week, I directed the following question to the Minister for the Army: -In view of the recent further announcements that more liberal assistance is to be extended to the dairying industry by releases from the Army, can the Minister for the Army say if, to make this possible, the Government is moderating existing sets of directions which to-day render impossible such releases and necessary assistance?The Minister was good enough to tell me that the matter was under review. We must be told whether the categories of men whose release was forbidden earlier are to be altered. It is of no use to say that 50,000 men will be released, thereby raising the hopes of the farmers, without action also being taken to make their release possible. It is necessary not only to say that the prohibition orders are being altered, but also to alter them. Needless anxiety and suffering have been caused to primary producers, particularly dairymen, by the vexatious announcements made from time to time that men will he released, when men are not released. I do not mind spending time over and over again on behalf of the farmers, but I do resent the loss of time caused to those whose applications for the release of their sons or other relatives to help them to carry on are either interminably delayed or refused. I know of many primary producers at the end of their resources of health whose applications for release of labour to assist in their efforts to produce essential foods have been turned down, notwithstanding that those applications have been supported by medical certificates, often in respect of not only the husband, but also the wife. No one can say that it is just that they should he deprived of the labour necessary for them to carry on merely because their sons happen to be what the Army describes as  specialists. Many of those specialists are motor drivers and mechanics whose retention was necessary when invasion threatened, but is not necessary now (because thu Army has trained thousands of them. All these matters require full investigation. A specialist in his own trade would be of greater value in carrying on that trade than as a batman in the Army. The Government should not be influenced by the fear that a return of men from unessential occupations in the Army to essential occupations in civil life would rouse further criticism by enemies like McCormick who run certain newspapers in the United States of America. Such men as McCormick have been enemies of the British Empire for twenty yearsThey have fed on German funds expended by Germany in an endeavour to keep the United States of America and Great Britain apart. Why worry about what McCormick says when we know that the great majority of people in the United States of America are influenced not by what he thinks or says, but by what their renowned President, who stands with us and the rest of the freedom-loving world, says and does?When we think about post-war problems, let us not selfishly confine our attention to our own problems. They will be far less than those of Great Britain, France and the rest of Europe. The important thing for us to remember is that the solution of this countrys difficulties lies in a greater population and increased settlement. On that point it is interesting to read what the American Minister to Australia, Mr. Nelson T. Johnson, had to say after a recent visit to the Northern Territory. It is reported in the following newspaper paragraph : -There is the solution of Australias population problem. Let the young people go there and make a fortune in building the city.There, too, would be a market for the produce of secondary industries, rails for the lines, engines to pump water, carts to make feeder communications, refrigeration for all homes.We must devote our attention to the problem of settlement in the spirit ofMr. Johnsons remarks. Further settlement of Australia must be undertaken in the proper way. Hydro-electric schemes must be undertaken so that cheap power shall be available. Production must be scientifically controlled and settlements must be provided with amenities approaching those of the cities.- Order!

90,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SMITH, Albert","KRT","Wakefield","N/A","N/A",373,".- I consider that it is my bounden duty, and I am sure that my constituents so regard it, to express to the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) their appreciation of the statement that he delivered to the House and for the able manner in which he represented the Commonwealth during hh trip abroad. The Prime Minister has been under an exceptional strain for several years. When the Labour Government took office this country was in dire peril. It is true that we had begun to mobilize our man-power and resources, but that effort was accelerated under his powerful direction. He has done a magnificent job.Consequently, I was surprised to hear some honorable members opposite speak of his mission as if he had been on a pleasant holiday or picnic. The majority of honorable members realize the dangers that were associated with his mission. 1 have said on many occasions that if the Prime Minister went abroad to negotiate on behalf of Australia he would be a credit to himself and to the Commonwealth. I have learned on good authority that he created an impression more lasting and more favorable than had any previous representative of Australia. When he was given the Freedom of the City of London he delivered an address which created a profound impression throughout Great Britain and Allied countries - an address which will live long in the annals of history. Unfortunately, some honorable members who have spoken in this debate have not given to the Prime Minister credit for what he has done on behalf of Australia. They criticized his speech on the ground that it was confined to generalities. What else could they expect? We did not expect the Prime Minister to tell us details of the secret conversations which he had with Mr. Churchill and the Prime Ministers of other dominions. If the right honorable gentleman had done so he would have betrayed the Allied Nations, because he would have conveyed to the enemy information which they desire. I am satisfied that while John Curtin is leading Australia we need not fear the future.Some honorable members complained that the Government had not revealed its plans for the post-war development of Australia. Personally, I am satisfied that the Government is planning wisely for the future. Of course, the moneyed interests in Australia are anxious that our slogan shall be  Business as usual , because they are concerned only with filling their own pockets. Perhaps the greatest problem awaiting solution is that of monetary policy. I sought election to the House of Representatives because I wanted to support the Labour Government and the policy of the Australian Labour party, which is the only worthwhile policy for Australia. I am confident that the Government will do its job satisfactorily in the interests of the whole of the people.Some honorable members criticized the action of the Government in holding a referendum at this juncture. The Labour party made it perfectly plain on the hustings that if it were returned to office one of its first acts would be to submit to Parliament a bill for the alteration of the Constitution. The Government has honoured that promise. I, for one, would have been disappointed if it had not done so. I am confident that when the referendum is held on the 19th August, the people, by an overwhelming majority, will grant to the Commonwealth the proposed additional powers.Several speakers, in the course of this debate, have emphasized the necessity for an interchange of diplomats and public servants between Australia and other countries. That is a fine objective. If that policy be carried out, we shall be able to get a better appreciation of one anothers problems. Before we can understand the views of other people, we must live with them. The adoption of this proposal will be one of the most effective means of bringing about friendly relations between various countries.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
91,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ADERMANN, Charles","JLR","Maranoa","N/A","N/A",374,". - I approve of the mission of the PrimeMinister (Mr. Curtin) abroad, and agree that he should make other visits overseas in future. I do not believe for a moment that the right honorable gentleman would let Australia down. Obviously, the report of his mission, which he delivered to the House last Monday, is inconclusive in many ways. I realize that he was not able to convey to the House decisions on all matters that were discussed, but I propose to mention two notable omissions from his speech affecting rural Australia. Although the primary producing industries are the foundation of Australias economic set-up, the right honorable gentleman omitted to refer to our future markets and to make a definite statement about manpower. I was interested in a. reply which the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Scully) made to a question relating to the dairying industry. He attributed the record low production to drought conditions. That statement was not correct. The Minister included Queensland in his remarks, but that State has enjoyed the best dairying year since 1917. Prom August until the end of February, it had rain and heat, just when they were required. Admittedly, conditions were inclined to be dry towards the fall of the season, but that would not have had such a serious effect on production if man-power had been available to the industry. The Minister for Agriculture in Queensland, where a Labour Government is in office, complained very vigorously a. few days ago about the shortage of man-power in the industry, and gave the following information about the releases of army personnel : -N/AMr. Williams also pointed out that although fewer releases had been recommended for the dairying industry in Queensland than in any other State, the population engaged in dairy production in Queensland exceeded that in any other State, and also that of all States, Queenslands percentage of volunteers from the rural districts for the armed forces was greatest. That, perhaps, explains why so few releases have been granted in Queensland. There is no better soldier than, the country volunteer. Men who have enlisted from rural communities have proved their worth over and over again on the field of battle. Because they are volunteers, naturally most of them are in operational units, and of course, the Army authorities are reluctant to release them. I think that explains in a few words why the dairying industry in Queensland is at such a low ebb. No less than 100 farms have gone out of milk production in one district alone, whereas one man released from the Army to work on each of those places would have enabled them to continue. I cannot see any immediate solution of this serious problem, because even if man-power were made available now, it would be impossible to get those farms back into production immediately, as dairy stock has been either sold or mated with beef cattle sires.The production of butter in Australia has reached a record low level. Whilst E agree with the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr. Scully), that to some considerable degree that has been caused by the drought conditions in the southern States, there is no doubt that lack of man-power has been an important factor. The production of butter and cheese must be increased. I commend the Governments decision to give to the dairying industry first priority for Army releases, but I am afraid that if those releases are to continue on their present basis, the benefit to the dairying industry will not be very great. Of the 20,000 soldiers already released, only approximately 4,000 have gone into that very essential industry. The trouble seems to be that the recommendations of local committees composed of practicalmen who know just what labour is required on the various properties in their district, are ignored or overridden by meddlesome intervening bodies which give contrary advice to the man-power authorities. The result is that men whose services are not really essential are released, whereas others who could be of some real assistance are retained in the Army. Had the 20,000 men already released been selected carefully and distributed in the proper manner, food production would be in a much better position to-day.I shall deal now with the serious threat to the wool industry created by the increasing competition of imported synthetic fibres. There is a question on the notice paper regarding this matter, and I trust that it will elicit some fuller information. However, the Government should make a full statement on this all important matter. The value to Australia of the wool industry under the Empire wool purchase scheme is estimated at £338,000,000 or approximately £70,000,000 a year ; but what will be the effect upon this industry of the increasing importation of synthetic fibres ? I remind honorable members of an exhibit recently shown in the Kings Hall of this building. The exhibit included a chart which showed that whereas sales of clothing made from wool were more or less stable, sales of clothing manufactured from imported synthetic materials were soaring, and that, in the past twelve months, sales of garments made from synthetic clothes exceeded sales of woollen goods. A second chart showed that whereas the price of woollen clothing was more or less stable - that is to be expected because the selling price of wool under the imperial wool purchase scheme is constant - the selling price of clothing made from synthetic fibres had decreased considerably. So much so, in fact, that if the public were to purchase solely on the basis of price, the imported synthetic article would be selected every time, despite its inferior quality. I should like to know why the Government is subsidizing the importation of synthetic clothes at rates of from 2s. 5d. to 2s. ll£d. a square yard? Surely the Government must realize that the expansion of trade in artificial fabrics will have a detrimental effect upon our greatest industry. A deterioration in the position of the wool industry would effect not only wool-growers themselves, but also all other employees engaged in the industry, including drovers and shearers. Why pay manufacturers a subsidy on the production of artificial fibre while we are storing up large quantities of wool from which articles of a far better quality could be made? I am seeking an answer to that question, and at the same time protesting at the continuation of this policy which is so detrimental, not only to the wool industry itself, but also to our whole economic set-up.I was informed by a man-power official in Brisbane that first priority in manpower releases for rural work was held by the dairying industry, second priority by the cattle industry, and third priority, by vegetable growing. I asked him what place the pastoral industry held, and he said that that industry was not in the picture at all. That, exactly, is the position - the pastoral industry is not in the picture either for Army releases or for prisoner of war labour. It has been denied prisoner of war control centres. Apart from some temporary releases for drought-stricken areas, this industry has not received any assistance, regardless apparently of how desperate the need for labour may be. A person running a pastoral property may become ill and unfit for work, but consideration will not be given to the release of Army personnel to take over his duties. Is this treatment to continue? I am offering this criticism in the hope that the Government will remedy this position.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

93,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ADERMANN, Charles","JLR","N/A","N/A","N/A",376,"- Man-power authorities in Brisbane informed me that the sheep pastoral industry was not in the picture at all for Army releases. Apparently that is the policy of the department. I trust that in the review of Australias man-power allocation - I regret that the Government has not given honorable members an opportunity to discuss the matter more fully - the factors which I have mentioned will be taken into consideration, and that servicemen available for release will be more carefully allocated to essential industries. My complaint is that, in the past, released service personnel have not been distributed according to the recommendations of practical men.I have already received a protest from the Gayndah butter factory against any move to re-introduce daylight saving, because of its adverse effect in rural dis tricts. Ordinarily, the farming community works from daylight to dark. That is especially true under war-time conditions, but with daylight saving, these people have to rise before daylight and start their work by lamplight. The difficulty has been aggravated by tb<refusal of the Queensland State Government to alter the commencing time of schools. Women, who have to assist in the dairy-yards, are obliged to get their children out of bed at an hour earlier than is good for their health and away to school. I know that this protest is justified, because I am familiar with the conditions under which these people work. It is because another section of the community is not doing its job that the farming people have to suffer in this way. Again I urge that in the interests of country people, daylight, saving should not be re-introduced.I appreciate the opportunity I have had to make these remarks. Whatever I have said has been actuated by a desire to improve the position. I hope that when the House next meets, we shall haw a statement of policy in relation to the two important matters, the omission of which from the Prime Ministers speech I have criticized, and that we shall have an opportunity to discuss them.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[3]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
94,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CURTIN, John","009FQ","Fremantle","ALP","Prime Minister and Minister for Defence",376,". - in reply - I do not intend to do other than what it is in my heart to do; that is, to express to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies), the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. Fadden), and other honorable members, appreciation of the thoughtful and helpful speeches that have been made on the matters that were set out in my statement to the House. It is perfectly true that that statement left unsaid much of what honorable members would doubtless like to have been told. I make no apology for that; because it has not been practicable, in connexion with the problems that have been dealt with in the debate on the Address-in-Reply, or, indeed, in connexion with the matters with which I dealt while I was away, to d© more than give a general indication of the trend of thought and activity. But I wish it to be particularly known that, while I was away, I did not enter into any secret commitment. I say that becauseL am not alone involved. I would have allowed the remark to pass, but for the fact that there might be an implication against the Prime Minister of Great Britain and the Prime Ministers of the other Dominions. We had consultations in order that we might inform the mind of each other in regard to our respective points of view. We considered that we were interpreting the views of the countries which we represented, rather than out personal views, so that, in the f formulation of policy, each government would be better equipped to act in concert with the other Dominions and, in particular, with the United Kingdom.There are three observations which I should like to make. The first is, that a world organization will be an invaluable contribution to the removal of the causes which lead to war. The next is, that the British Commonwealth must present towards that world organization the spectacle of a unified entity in matters of the highest import. That does not mean that we have to integrate our governments, nor does it mean that we have to present the spectacle of an absolute Empire bloc against the rest of the world. The Dominions, rather than the Motherland, have the largest interest in authoritative declarations whereby the British Prime Minister may speak for the Empire n? a whole.Time and time again, it has been pointed out that this country has so mall a population that we have to take steps to increase it rapidly. I am quite in favour of the steps to that end that are being taken. But it would be false optimism to consider that there is likely to be a rapid increase. The shipping to bring people here, and the places whence they are to come, are considerations which have to bc taken into account. The problem of our security would not be fundamentally changed by an increase of population from 7,000,000 to 10,000,000, or even 12,000,000, in a reasonably short space of time; we should still rest on the postulate that without friends, allies and associates, we could be attacked by a superior force, and, perhaps, overrun. Therefore, whilst a world organization can do a great deal to remove the causes which lead to war, we have had the experience that nations have gone to war without what those governed by goodwill and reasonable intelligence would regard as adequate justification; that is to say, the causes which lead to war were not present. When the known causes which led to war have been removed, it can be said that a contribution has been made to the peace of the world; but that in itself would not constitute a guarantee of peace. Therefore, a concert of nations of like minds must be maintained. In that connexion, the observations of the Leader of the Opposition were most pertinent. The very case that he put - that is to say, the indispensability, in any conception of world organization, of a real membership with entire goodwill, not a mere formal membership of certain great powers - appears to me to be beyond argument. We generally address our minds to that problem in these days by saying that the sort of association which war has evoked must be maintained in the period after the war. But we would, I consider, humbug ourselves if Ave did not realize that the problem is one which requires careful management. All the time, it needs the most sober statement, and most certainly makes it necessary that the smaller parts of the British Commonwealth, however much they can offer their own views, must offer them with discretion and in the light of such other discussions as are proceeding. There is nothing easier than for a Prime Minister to make a speech on foreign affairs which is bound to cause difficulty and misapprehension somewhere. Therefore, when heads of governments discuss the problem of the concert of nations, they cannot always put forward with emphasis the particular views of their own countries, not because those views may not be justified, but because the bald statement of them in another part of the world, speaking a different language and probably facing different problems, may be entirely misunderstood. Therefore, our view has to be developed. We would first impart it to the British Commonwealth, the members of which would impart it to their ambassadors, and these would endeavour to develop a friendly acceptability of this view. We cannot by a crude and blatant declaration solve the problem of getting other countries to understand our point of view. All of these considerations properly impose a certain degree of restraint upon the heads of governments.A similar difficulty has no doubt been experienced by my predecessors. I make no apology for my inability to be as candid in public places in regard to certain problems of government, as one can be about certain other problems of government. I shall do my best to promote the splendid suggestion of the honorable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender), in regard to the youth of Europe. They, at least, are guiltless of any contribution to the frightful catattrophe of world war. Animated by the impulse of humanity as well as by knowledge of the value which that impulse will be to ourselves, we can promote as far as possible the plan which the honorable gentleman has suggested. That is true also of the orphan children of the United Kingdom, except that our impulse is stronger in respect of them. Recently, a realization of their tribulations has been borne in on us even more poignantly than it was formerly. If one could add to the admiration which lovers of freedom everywhere in the world have for the people of Britain, it would appear that now is the appropriate time, in what looks like the stage leading to the successful termination of the struggle, when they are being called upon to bear an especially heavy punishment. For that, we feel regret, and extend our sympathy ; but our sympathy must be practical. That is why, in my statement, I indicated the nature of what will be a very great burden upon the people of Australia in the years to come.
