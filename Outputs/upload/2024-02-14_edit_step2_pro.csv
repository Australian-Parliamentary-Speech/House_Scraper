7,0,0,0,1,1,"Spender, Allegra MP",286042,"Wentworth","IND","N/A",814," Were here to talk about tax. A lot of people are intimidated by the mention of tax, so lets start with why tax matters. It matters because tax shapes the country we want to be. When I think about why its great to be an Australian, I often think of my mums life, because she was a kid who arrived from Italy at the age of 11 with no money, no English and no connections. She finished school at 14 and, because of her own talent, energy and luck, she was able to create a great life for herself and her family.  When I think about the country we want Australia to be, I think we want it to be a country that encourages innovation, creativity and entrepreneurialism, a place where every individual can boldly bring their best talents to the community and to the world. But we also want it to be a country where every Australian can create a good life for themselves and their families, whatever their background, whatever job they do. We want it to be a country where youre not on your own when things go wrong. Our tax system needs to support these goals: entrepreneurialism, fairness, a good life and compassion. But right now it isnt, and that is why we need to talk about tax. The topic today is the stage 3 reforms that the government has made changes to and the bills for which, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024, are now before the House. I acknowledge that right now many people across the country, including in my community, are experiencing enormous financial strain. These are some of the hardest times theyve ever faced, and I see that it is appropriate that government does whatever it can to ease their burden right now. I acknowledge that the stage 3 changes that the government is going to put through will help a lot of families who need help right now, so lets understand not only what the government is putting through but also what the choices and costs are of what they have decided to reject. Firstly, as I acknowledged, this is going to help a lot of people, a lot of working families experiencing financial strain. Secondly, I acknowledge that the changes to stage 3 will improve labour participation, and that is really important. I think they expect that there are going to be about 930,000 more hours per week that people will be more working in the economy. That is actually a really positive difference, particularly in the lives of women. I think that this is a package that has support from a broad range of the community, but we are also giving things up by making these changes to stage 3, and I do not think these have been acknowledged appropriately. Firstly, we are giving up a lot of benefits in terms of simplifying the tax system—in particular, instead of having four different brackets, having one bracket from $45,000 to $200,000, which was the original stage 3. That would ensure that, for a lot of people, the desire to plan taxes and to use many company structures or other things to try to minimise their taxes was no longer attractive. That would actually add to the integrity of our tax system. It would make it simpler, make it easier to administer and make it less likely that people are going to use other complicated structures to avoid taxes. Secondly, the original stage 3 addressed bracket creep and incentives that the revised government proposal doesnt. While I support the opportunity that the governments proposal has made to increase labour participation, particularly at the lower income scales of the country, this also misses out on the opportunity to do it at the higher income scales and address bracket creep at the higher income scales, which I think is absolutely appropriate as well. I supported the original stage 3, and when I came to considering whether Id support the governments changes, the thing I thought was most important was going back to the community, because I knew that the community was going to be significantly affected by these changes and I wanted to know what they thought. In Wentworth, what we found through extensive consultation with people on the street, through emails and also through a survey, which ended up with over 1,700 responses, was that 70 per cent of the community supported the changes and that there was strong support, particularly among older parts of the community. There were many people who said they would benefit enormously from these changes. There were also people who said, You know what? I wouldve been better off under the original package, but I am supportive of the changes because I believe that these are the right ones. As one person said to me, I will pay more tax, but I do not have a problem with that. I think we need to maintain a fairer progressive tax system. That was something that came across from many members of the Wentworth community. However, there are some people in Wentworth and across the country who are significantly negatively affected by these changes and have real concerns about them. One person wrote to me and said: Its going to have a big impact on my family. We are both in our 30s, two kids full time in day care, huge mortgage, cost of living increasing. We were relying on this cut, and now half of it has been stripped away. I think it is really important to raise that and to talk about these people, because I do not think weve been having the conversation about the people who are affected in this case. I started my speech talking about the idea of fairness and everybody being able to build a good life. One group I really think about a lot is younger people who dont have family backing to buy a house or get themselves set up. All theyve got is the sweat of their brow, what they can build themselves. I admire those people who can really build up and create a different life to the one they were brought up with. This is what I think a lot of the Australian dream is really based on. But, in a country where we rely so heavily on income taxes and on taxing working people, as we do currently, it means that those people, if they dont have financial backing, cant get ahead in the way that previous Australian generations could. I think of this group of young people in their 30s. Maybe they dont have family who can help them with a mortgage. Maybe they dont have family who can help them with a deposit. Theyve started out and built something up. They were relying on the government to do what they said they were going to do and deliver a tax package, and thats what they expected in terms of their family budgeting. As we think through this, we need to reflect on what else needs to change on tax. Based on the feedback from Wentworth and on broader considerations, I am going to support this package, but what Im going to say to the House—which Ive said publicly before—is that this mustnt be the end. We have a flawed tax system, and this must be the parliament that starts to address it. At the next election, we need to see ambitious tax reform going onto the agenda. I think what we have with the original stage 3 and right now is a missed opportunity. When I look at the tax system, the question I ask is not the academic one of, How do we optimise this from an economists point of view? What I really care about is, What is this going to do for Australian people? There are three massive challenges we are facing as a country that our current tax system does not address: intergenerational equity and housing; growth and productivity; and how we address climate action. Our tax system currently does not address these. While the changes to stage 3 and the other changes that the government has made will make some impact on the economy, they do not fundamentally affect or address the major issues facing our economy, and that is why we need broader tax reform. I will give you a couple of perspectives on intergenerational equity. If you look at what is happening to younger generations, there is a sense—as there was from a young man who came to see me—that you can do everything right, you can study hard, you can get a big HECS debt, you can get a good job, but you still dont know if youll ever be able to afford a home. Thats the feeling on the street, but thats also represented in the numbers, where you see that a household that is headed by somebody over the age of 65 has had an increase in wealth by around 50 per cent in the last 10 or so years, but a household headed by someone under the age of 35 has had pretty much no increase in wealth. So weve seen a disparity emerging between the wealth and prospects of different generations in our society. I do not support that, and I think its why we need to look at tax, because tax influences that. Our capital gains tax system, our negative gearing tax system and our stamp duty all influence the housing market in different forms, and the housing market has been one of the biggest ways that younger people have been kept out of building the wealth and the security that previous generations have. For example, regarding stamp duty, the New South Wales Treasurys own estimates said that 350,000 more people would be owning their own home if we could move from stamp duty into land tax. This is where reform is urgently needed across our system. The second major issue facing our economy is growth. Australia has low productivity growth, and so do many other economies. Why do we care about productivity growth? Because it drives our ability to pay for the services we want. If we had the longterm productivity growth that we had in the past we would have an estimated $50 billion more in our budget right now to supply and support things that are important or to give back to the people who earn that money, the taxpayers. But we dont have that strong productivity growth, and my concern is that we also dont have the policy settings to drive that. One of the big policy settings we need to be aware of is the tax system. We have a corporate tax system where companies with revenue of over $50 million are now paying 30 per cent tax. This is way out of step with the OECD, where the average is 24.5 per cent. We cannot pretend in this country, one of the most open and trading countries of the world, that our tax system and the fact that we have an uncompetitive tax system for mediumsize businesses does not affect the attractiveness of Australia as a destination for investment. Right now we are seeing Australia being a capital exporter rather than a capital importer .Were also seeing Australia with lower R&D investment and dropping foreign direct investment. These are all indicators that not only do we have sluggish productivity but also were not making the changes we need to in order to grow our productivity in the future, and that is problematic for our system. Finally, on climate, I think were in a situation where we know we need to make changes and were starting to make those changes to address the climate catastrophe that we have in front of us. But the ways that were doing this, because we will not deal with the tax system, are some of the most expensive ways that we could possibly do it. We are wasting money because we wont face up to the fact that our tax system is not equipped to deal with the climate emergency were facing. It means the investments we make cost us more money than they otherwise would. That is why we need to also reform our tax system in relation to climate. So, when I look at the stage 3 change and I look at the other changes the government has put through—which include changes to superannuation, PRRT, changes to FBT on electric vehicles and other pieces—there are some parts I agree with, some parts I disagree with and some bits on the margin. I know tax change is difficult, and I accept that many a career has been won or lost on the basis of tax changes. But my point is that we need to be more ambitious, and we across the parliament have responsibility both to not wedge each other on these issues—and Im afraid I havent seen that yet—and to make sure we face up to the extreme issues the country is facing and have the guts to deal with them. A major question I need to address in this speech is around integrity and broken promises, because this is clearly a broken promise. My electorate, probably more than any other, feels that because of the incomes of people in my electorate. I have three issues with what the government has done in this regard. I recognise that governments will need to change when circumstances change. I think that is appropriate. However, from a timing point of view, if the government had been contemplating a change like this they should have done as much as possible to do it as early as possible so that the people who are affected—the people who were budgeting, the people who got into rentals and maybe made decisions about houses based on what they expected their income to be—knew what they were getting into. So, I think that is unacceptable. The second piece Im really concerned about is the lack of acknowledgement by the government that some people really lost out and some people took the government at their word. The government has spoken a lot about the difference its making to other people in the country, and I support that, and that is why Im voting for this. But they should also acknowledge the people who have been affected negatively by this change in taxes who took the government at its word and were told that they were able to trust the government on this. Finally, my question to the government is whether they should have made the commitment to stage 3 in the first place, given that they have now said theyre not interested in further changes that would support the original stage 3 package. If theyre not willing to support further changes that would address what stage 3 was trying to do, that gives us a real sense that they werent really backing it in the first place, and I have real concern about that. This is the moment to deal with tax reform. We must do it coming into the next election, and this is a challenge across the parliament.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SPENDER (Wentworth) ","(09:04):"
8,0,0,0,1,1,"Rowland, Michelle MP",159771,"Greenway","ALP","N/A",816," Im pleased to rise today in support of Labors costofliving tax cuts for middle Australia, because every single taxpayer in my electorate of Greenway—and, indeed, the 902,000 taxpayers who call Western Sydney home—deserve to keep more of what they earn. From 1 July this year they will, thanks to the Albanese Labor government. Nearly nine in 10 taxpayers in Western Sydney will receive a larger tax cut under our plan than under the Morrison governments proposal from five years ago.  We are delivering tax cuts for the workers in disability, retail and transport, for the health and agedcare workers, and for the accountants, teachers and tradies—every taxpayer. While our plan is responsibly targeted to boost support for hardworking families, it delivers for every taxpayer right up and down the income ladder. A worker on $80,000, for example, will receive a tax cut worth more than $1,670 a year, while a cleaner earning $50,000 will receive a tax cut worth over $900 a year. Under the coalitions alternative, many of these workers, often working part time with families, would have got nothing—not a dollar. All our wonderful nurses and postal workers will get a tax cut, with over 95 per cent of those taxpayers getting a larger tax cut as a result of Labors plan. Those earning over $150,000 a year will also receive a tax cut of at least $3,700. Families in Greenway understand that the Albanese government is on their side. Greenway constituent Maura wrote to me recently to give her heartfelt thanks, as did Santino, who said that Labors tax cuts were so fantastic. Those are just a few examples of Greenway locals who are relieved by the meaningful difference Labor is making to help ease costofliving pressures. I know there are many people in my electorate who are doing it tough right now, including households experiencing high levels of mortgage stress. Local residents, many of whom are migrants who moved to Australia for opportunities for themselves and their children, are asking us to do more to help. To say to those families that theres nothing their government can do would be a furphy. The federal government is in a position to help without making the economic situation worse by adding to inflation, and our better tax cut plan does just that. It complements our work to deliver electricity bill relief and cheaper child care, medicines and GP visits. We have increased rent assistance, delivered feefree TAFE places and extended free broadband for school students with no connectivity at home. Labor recently launched an ACCC inquiry into supermarket prices and allegations of price gouging—the first of its kind since 2008. And we are getting wages moving because we want workers to earn more and keep more of what they earn. Helping our communities with the cost of living is our No. 1 priority. If the cost of essentials rises too fast, people cant plan or save for the future. One of the great privileges I have in representing Greenway is meeting the people for whom our Labor policies are making a real difference. Were helping people just like Maura and Santino to strive for more to make a good life for themselves and their families. Unlike the coalition, which just says no, the Albanese government is saying yes to supporting Western Sydney families keeping more of what they earn. These new tax cuts are the right decision at the right time for the right reasons.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms ROWLAND (Greenway—Minister for Communications) ","(09:19):"
9,0,0,0,1,1,"Fletcher, Paul MP","L6B","Bradfield","LP","N/A",817," I rise to speak about the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024. I want to put three propositions to the House this morning. The first is that what the Albanese government has done here is a terrible failure of tax reform. My second proposition is that this is a cynical breach of a promise made by the Prime Minister and other senior Labor figures over 100 times. My third proposition is that this is a second best to what the coalition has legislated, and the coalition has reached a decision because we are in a world, to use the economic jargon, of second bests. Lets start with the terrible failure of tax reform which this backflip by the Albanese Labor government represents. The rationale for these stage 3 tax cuts was to deliver structural reform to the tax system, to encourage aspirational Australians who want to work hard and get ahead. The whole design of the stage 3 tax cuts was that, between $45,000 and $200,000 of income, anywhere you are in that range, you know that you would only be paying 30c cents in the dollar.  The stage 3 tax cuts were part of a longterm plan that was designed and legislated several years ago. It was done with the view of giving Australians adequate notice of the change that was coming to allow them to make their decisions about how they wish to respond, should they choose to do so. If you were thinking about doing some extra shifts or getting an extra qualification so your earnings increase or if you were thinking about starting a business, you would do these things with the knowledge that, for an income right up to $200,000, the most that you would be paying would be 30c in the dollar in tax. This was a design intended to address the known and corrosive impact of bracket creep, which results in more of your income being taken in tax every year through the effect of inflation. I make the point that a very deliberate intention of this reform was to remove the 37c tax bracket. The result would be a simpler, clearer, fairer tax system. There would be a 30c bracket and a 45c bracket. The effect of the 30c bracket under the plan, legislated by the coalition and promised to be upheld more than 100 times by the Prime Minister and his party, would have been to cast onto the ash heap of history the 37c per cent tax bracket and, in turn, unleash greater activity, greater energy, greater aspiration by Australians in the knowledge that throughout that range, from $45,000 to $200,000, they would pay no more than 30 cents in tax. Unfortunately, all of that has now been trashed by the Albanese Labor government. The government have said a lot of deeply misleading and inaccurate things in the course of justifying this egregious broken promise. One of the things we never hear from those opposite is the historical fact that this is stage 3 and that suggests, doesnt it, that there was a stage 1 and a stage 2. Indeed, there was a stage 1 and stage 2, each of which were very much focused on reducing the burden on low and middleincome earners. That was a very important component of the coalitions plan. The third component of the coalitions plan was to change the tax system through this longterm reform that would increase the incentive for people as they thought about how much work they wanted to do. It has to be said that one of the deeply regrettable consequences of this cynical political decision, this political backflip, taken just months before this longterm change was due to take effect, having been legislated several years ago, is that it will make it so much harder in the future for any government that wants to engage in serious reform of our tax system. You need only talk to any economist and they will tell you that our tax system is a drag on Australias productivity, on Australias competitiveness, on Australias prosperity. Tax policy experts consistently argue for a simpler system and one that imposes, in the economic jargon, the smallest possible deadweight loss. According to John Humphreys of the Australian Taxpayers Alliance, Stage three income tax cuts represent Australias most important piece of microeconomic reform in 20 years. He adds the cuts would have created a simpler, more efficient tax system that will help boost productivity and promote longterm wage growth. Economists talk about a dynamic as compared to a comparative static perspective. What we hear from Labor and what we hear from the Left is a comparative static perspective. You assume that the income that every Australian has now is cast in stone and the only thing that could change is the tax rate, and that leads to these long tables of winners and losers. But the whole point is the economy is not static; it is dynamic. People change their behaviour in response to incentives. If you face a lower tax rate, you have a stronger incentive to work harder. That is good for individuals and good for the entire economy because the economy grows. Creating that stronger incentive is what the stage 3 tax cuts are all about. Now, all of that has been torn up and thrown in the bin. Let me turn secondly to this cynical breach of a promise that we have seen. This is a triumph of crass, shortterm political opportunism over the longterm tax reform process. For over three years, Labor consistently said they would honour the stage 3 tax cuts. In July 2021, the then opposition leader, the member for Grayndler, and his Treasury spokesman, the member for Rankin, said: An Albanese Labor Government will deliver the same legislated tax relief to more than 9 million Australians as the Morrison Government. Their explanation for why they were going to do this was straightforward: Labor is providing certainty and clarity to Australian working families after a difficult two years … Well, they promised certainty and clarity; they delivered the opposite. On more than 100 occasions, the Prime Minister and other senior Labor politicians committed to maintaining the stage 3 tax cuts. They committed to maintaining the tax cuts which are in the legislation now and have been for several years. This was a promise made repeatedly before the 2022 election, during the 2022 election and after the 2022 election, including numerous times in December 2023 and January 2024. We know from what has now been revealed, including through Senate estimates, that at the same time that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were repeatedly saying to Australians, We have not changed our position; we remain committed to the stage 3 tax cuts, they had in fact changed their position. They had directed Treasury to proceed to come up with a changed plan. They assert this ludicrous proposition that it was all Treasurys work. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer were just sitting at their desks, twiddling their thumbs, whistling, looking into the middle distance, and all of a sudden, bang! On their desks dropped a new plan that Treasury had worked up all of its own volition. That is one of the many ludicrous and completely noncredible claims that have been made by the government as they have twisted and turned and danced about trying to justify one of the most egregious breaches of trust ever committed by a prime minister against the Australian people. To say more than 100 times, We will take this course of action, knowing that across the country people are listening to him, listening to the government, taking them in good faith and arranging their affairs in reliance on that promise, and then to cynically reverse that position is one of the worst breaches of trust Australians have ever seen from a prime minister. What it means is that Australians cannot believe a word that comes out of the mouth of this Prime Minister, this Treasurer, any Labor minister or any Labor member of parliament. How can you believe a word they say when they told the Australian people 100 times and more—before the election, during the election, after the election—We will maintain the stage 3 tax cuts, and then cynically, deliberately, dumped that promise? They broke their promise. They looked the Australian people in the eye and said: Oh, that thing we said 100 times we were going to do? Were not going to do it. It is hard to think of an example of more disgraceful conduct by a prime minister and by a political party than the conduct which has been engaged in by the Prime Minister and by the Treasurer over the last month. After all of that, despite their claims that this is now justified because it will offer relief to Australians from costofliving pressures, the sorry truth is it will deliver very little relief at all. The fact is that in Labors first 18 months of government the amount of personal income tax collected has risen by a record 27 per cent. Headline inflation is more than 1.6 per cent above the midpoint of the RBAs target band. Food, housing, insurance, health and education costs are all growing faster than the headline inflation rate. What then will be the impact of the measure contained in this bill were debating today? What we know is that for somebody on the average wage, their net aftertax real disposable income has fallen by $8,000 since Labor came to power just 18 months ago. Thats $150 a week that somebody on the average income is worse off compared to 18 months ago. And yet that same person will receive a benefit of just $15 a week from these tax cuts that are now being trumpeted. So youve gone backwards $150 every week thanks to the rank economic incompetence of this government. And now the Prime Minister says: Great news! Im going to deliver you an extra $15 a week. It is a mere drop in the ocean. The reality is that people are hugely worse off under this government, and the tax cut that the Prime Minister is talking about barely touches the sides. Let me turn, then, to the rationale for the position the opposition is taking on this bill. The Prime Minister seems frustrated. In question time hes been saying, Oh, well, if the opposition were fair dinkum, they would oppose this bill because they campaigned against my rejigged tax scales. Im sorry to break it to the Prime Minister: he can decide what his policy his; the opposition will decide what our position is. To use another piece of economic jargon, once the Prime Minister took his decision, we were in a world of second best not first best. The decision for the coalition became, What course of action should we now take given the government is going to take roughly $106 billion, the cost of the stage 3 tax cuts, and spend it all on a modified tax scale, different to the one legislated, different to the one they promised to maintain on over 100 occasions? They wont just spend the $106 billion; indeed, theyll spend an extra $28 billion. We are now in a world of second best, and this government is using its numbers in the House to ram through this outcome. But if the government of the day is using its numbers to offer a different set of tax cuts, then, if the first best has been removed, the choice for us is: do we support the second best? It is the second best, but weve made it plain we will support it. Weve also said well be responsible, because were not going to then commit to additional spending unless and until we can be satisfied it can be funded. Weve been very clear were committed to go into the next election with a tax reform package thats in keeping with the stage 3 tax reforms. Our package will deliver lower, simpler and fairer taxes, fight bracket creep and enshrine aspiration in our tax system. This has been one of the most unedifying breaches of trust by an Australian government for many years. The Prime Ministers standing has been permanently damaged. A valuable longterm reform has been junked. And for years to come we, as a nation, will lament this missed opportunity for reform.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FLETCHER (Bradfield—Manager of Opposition Business) ","(09:23):"
10,0,0,0,1,1,"Rae, Sam MP",300122,"Hawke","ALP","N/A",819," Its always a great pleasure to follow a characteristically flaccid contribution by the member for Bradfield, the previous speaker, and perhaps seek to reintroduce a little intellectual honesty to the debate. We on the Labor side know that Australians are doing it tough. Global inflation and supply chain pressures have squeezed household budgets as the cost of living increases—and people are feeling the pinch. While inflation is moderating and our targeted assistance packages are providing important relief, we know that Australians still need support. Thats why the Albanese Labor government has introduced these tax cuts—to provide costofliving support to Australian households doing it tough. Its about providing relief through reforming and reshaping our income tax system to ensure Australians keep more of what they earn.  The Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024 will deliver a fairer tax system, return bracket creep to taxpayers and drive labour supply in our economy. Its not only an important measure to address the costofliving challenge; its an enduring reform that rewards the hardworking Australians at the heart of our economy. Nurses, teachers, truckies and retail workers will all get a bigger tax cut. In fact, 84 per cent of all Australian taxpayers will receive a larger tax cut under Labors plan. Thats because were improving our income tax system right up and down the income scale. From 1 July this year were cutting the 19 per cent tax rate to 16 per cent, were cutting the 32.5 per cent tax rate to 30 per cent, were increasing the 37 per cent tax threshold from $120,000 a year to $135,000 a year, and were increasing the top tax threshold from $180,000 a year to $190,000 a year—the first time this has been increased since Labor was last in office. This holistic reform will deliver more support to the working Australians who need it most. In my electorate of Hawke, the average taxpayer will receive a tax cut of $1,428—thats $800 more than under the former Morrison plan. Every single one of the 73,000 taxpayers in my electorate of Hawke will receive a tax cut, and 89 per cent of people in my community will be better off under Labors plan. These are local tradies, nurses, police officers and early childhood educators who will be taking home more pay every week, providing valuable relief to their household budgets. For example, a household in Melton in my electorate with a teacher on 85 grand and a parttime factory worker on 40 grand will save a total of $2,458—almost $1,500 more than under the Liberals old Morrison plan. There are tens of thousands of households like this across my electorate and millions right across the country that will see similar savings. Given that these changes will see every Australian taxpayer keep more of the money they earn, it should come as no surprise that Labors tax cuts are also better for the economy. When we invest in our workforce, reward working people and properly incentivise participation, we grow the economic pie for all. Good economic management is all about building an economy that works for the people, not the other way round. Thats why since Labor came to office weve increased funding to aged care and rolled out cheaper child care. Thats why weve improved the pay and conditions of workers with our secure jobs, better pay bill and our closing loopholes reforms. Thats why weve seen record increases to minimum and award wages, two consecutive quarters of real wage growth and the strongest wage growth for 15 years. And its why were delivering these tax cuts. This is what the Albanese Labor government is all about. Were delivering higher wages and lower taxes so that Australians can earn more, keep more of what they earn and make the economy stronger for all. Treasury estimates that Labors tax cuts will increase labour supply by nearly a million hours a week—more than double the impact of the Liberals original plan. This is because Australians will be better incentivised to work more under Labors tax cut plan, particularly in some of our most in demand professions, such as those in the care economy. Thanks to Labors tax cuts, 97 per cent of registered nurses will be better off, 97 per cent of carers will be better off and 97 per cent of childcare workers will be better off. By incentivising taxpayers to work, Labors tax cuts will boost labour supply across these professions right across our country and our economy. Clearly, Labors tax cuts arent just about making our income tax system fairer; theyre about responding to the current economic conditions that we face. It is important to remember that, since the former Liberal government legislated their plan five years ago, weve had a oncein100year pandemic, persistent global inflation and multiple foreign conflicts that have all contributed significantly to the rising cost of living for Australian households. Unfortunately, while these rising costs have been felt by all Australians, they have disproportionately impacted low and middleincome earners. The Treasury advice on Labors tax cuts showed that people in the lowest income quintile were spending more than their disposable income as quarterly inflation peaked under the Liberals opposite. The advice also showed that working Australians were experiencing the highest increase in the cost of living, with those in the bottom three income quintiles far more likely to be experiencing financial stress. Thats why Labors tax cuts are necessary: to put more money in the pockets of every Australian taxpayer, especially those who need it most. Importantly, the Treasury also confirms that we can do this without adding to inflation, because Labors tax cuts plan is a broadly revenueneutral approach. We know that those opposite will vote in favour of this bill despite the way they carry on. The Leader of the Opposition has publicly declared this. They might stand up at the dispatch box and flail around, but ultimately they will walk into this House and vote in favour of this tax plan. They refuse to admit that this government has made the right call by delivering larger tax cuts to more Australians. They just cant bring themselves to say it. Perhaps its because they spent nearly a decade failing to live up to their own false sense of economic superiority. They failed to deliver a single surplus, they suppressed wages, they oversaw the worst decade for productivity in our country in 50 years and they racked up $1 trillion of Liberal debt. Meanwhile, in under two years, the Albanese Labor government has delivered the first surplus in 15 years. Weve delivered tens of billions of dollars in costofliving relief through child care, energy bills, rents medicine and more; were getting wages moving again, with wages growing at four per cent, the highest rate in 15 years; and weve had two consecutive quarters of real wage growth. And now were delivering meaningful income tax reform, leaving more money in the pockets of every Australian taxpayer. Given the Liberals decade of failure, it is hardly surprising that they cant quite wrap their heads around another example of responsible economic management from the Albanese Labor government. It is almost as if they cant believe its possible. They dont know what to do. When asked if the opposition would roll back Labors tax cuts, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition jumped up and said: This is our position. This is absolutely our position. While the Leader of the Opposition has since said that the Liberals will support Labors tax cuts, it is clear from the Deputy Leader of the Oppositions statement and the blithering contributions from those opposite in this debate that they are being dragged kicking and screaming to it. Its clear that theyre more interested in the politics than they are in the policy of cutting taxes for working people. The case for Labors tax cuts is absolutely crystal clear. Its good social policy, its good fiscal policy and its good economic policy. It will boost labour supply, return bracket creep to those it hits hardest and, most importantly, ensure that 13.6 million Australian taxpayers will get a tax cut on 1 July. I am very proud to be part of a Labor government that is delivering the support that the households in my community desperately need. Thanks to Labors tax cuts, families right across Hawke, from Sunbury to Melton and from Bacchus Marsh to Ballan, will be able to earn more and keep of what they earn, and well keep looking out for them as they face the costofliving pressures that they are currently facing.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RAE (Hawke) ","(09:39):"
11,0,0,0,1,1,"Steggall, Zali MP",175696,"Warringah","IND","N/A",820," I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024. Whilst I support the assistance that this amending legislation will provide to many in our communities, I do have great reservations as to how we have arrived at this point and the way in which the government has handled this issue over several years now. I was in this place when the original tax package was first legislated in 2019 and raised concerns then in relation to the stage 3 tax package because it was not due to take effect for some five years and that good policy would require keeping an open mind and considering the economic circumstances of the time. So it was with mixed feelings that I watched the PM and the new government repeatedly dig in, denying that there would need to be a consideration of that tax package, after having supported it in the last government, and resisting time and time again. I think this ultimately created an unnecessary hole, which is unfortunate.  I also really dislike, and many in my community have raised, the tone of class warfare coming from the government, which is disappointing. Its a populist pitch. The pitch that those on higher incomes can afford to receive less of a tax cut than the coalitions legislated package shows the core of the issue. We rely far too much on personal income tax to fulfil government coffers, which is overwhelmingly contributed to, ultimately, by tax on higher incomes. We need a wholesale review of the tax system. That means everything should be on the table: the GST, company tax, capital gains tax, taxing resources and, certainly, taxing multinationals. The Treasurys Intergenerational report 2023 highlighted that Australias population and productivity are projected to grow more slowly over the next 40 years, leading to slower economic growth compared to the past 40 years. An ageing population will also be a challenge. The participation rate is projected to decline, as will average hours per worker. Thats going to pose a challenge to how we fund the government services we all rely on. The same Intergenerational report noted that, over the next four decades, the five main spending pressures of health, aged care, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, defence and debt interest payments will rise from around onethird to around onehalf of all government spending. Speaking to the report last year, former Treasury secretary Dr Ken Henry was scathing: People who are weighted down with HECS debt, who are going to have to repay a mountain of public debt, who are dealing with the consequences of climate change and who are facing diminishing prospects of ever being able to afford a home of their own, these poor buggers are also going to be the ones who are facing everincreasing average rates of income tax. Dr Henrys sentiment gets right to the nub of it. We need urgent reform. The current model is simply not sustainable. Australia currently has one of the lowest income thresholds in OECD countries for the higher tax brackets. We rely far too heavily on personal income tax to fund our essential services, yet we do nothing to make resource conglomerates pay their fair share. The petroleum resource rent tax, the PRRT, that is currently being proposed by the government is a joke; lets get real about that. It is one of the most lax resource rent tax systems proposed in the world, even including recent reforms—in particular, the reforms the government is proposing. Its failures have been highlighted in recent years as gas companies have reaped windfall profits, yet many projects have not paid any resources tax. Add to this the fact that many of these companies are also not paying any company tax and youre really adding insult to injury. As Ive noted before, foreign owned Arrow Energy, Australia Pacific LNG, Chevron and ExxonMobil didnt pay income tax for seven years, resulting in all profits heading straight offshore. Australians are horrified that these companies can make $138 billion from our natural resources and pay nothing in tax. Australia has one of the weakest resource tax regimes in the world, and one of the most generous to oil and gas companies. In contrast, Norway taxes 78 per cent of export resources profits, delivering a $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund. This supports health care, child care and other social measures, all without discouraging investment. The government is shirking its responsibilities to undertake comprehensive tax reform. I want to raise a concern about how we got here and the way the government has approached its decisionmaking and then communicated the changes to the stage 3 tax cut package. In the leadup to the last election the Prime Minister gave a guarantee that the stage 3 tax cuts would stay locked in, as had been legislated. On numerous occasions since the last federal election he repeatedly said there would be no changes. In one interview he is quoted as saying, My word is my bond. I watched all this with misgiving, because all this does is erode trust. You dug the hole yourself, Prime Minister. The government should never have gotten itself into a corner by constantly assuring people that they would not touch the original stage 3 tax cut package. Im not opposed to good policy changes being implemented as circumstances require. These tax cuts were legislated as a package of reform. It was always problematic that stage 3 would come into effect five years after being legislated. Honest government would have been upfront with the public. Government policies must adapt to changing circumstances, and circumstances have changed over the last 12 months. This is not something that just happened in December and January of this year. Instead, we saw an abrupt policy change out of the blue and a tax change without an exposure draft and certainly without public consultation. The question that is out there is, what else is up for sudden change without proper, sober consultation or due policy process? Will the climate change targets be up for renegotiation because theres pressure in some electorates, maybe? Or the commitment to a net zero economy? Thats the issue the Prime Minister and the government must now contend with: trust. In the 2023 Edelman Trust Barometer, trust in government leaders has declined to 41 per cent, marking a decline for numerous consecutive years. I feel that the loss of trust cant be overlooked. Theres no doubt that costofliving pressures are hurting many in the community: prices, power bills, inflation, interest rates and insurance premiums have gone up and are squeezing household budgets. There is no doubt that economic circumstances have been tight for more than 12 months. So I absolutely welcome the support that this provides for many in our community. I want to thank all the people in Warringah who have reached out to me to let me know how they feel about the governments proposal and who have provided me with their feedback. Many of them are impacted by the change in terms of receiving less, in particular receiving less of a tax cut than they had been planning to receive. Its heartening to see the generosity of so many who want to see those on lower incomes receive more benefit. In fact, more than 80 per cent of those who have corresponded with me are in favour of those tax cuts, with many indicating that they were due to receive more but favour the amendments. And I note that according to Treasury data Warringah has some 82,000 taxpayers who will receive an average tax cut of $2,226 under the new package. It will leave about 56,000 taxpayers better off, which is approximately 68 per cent of taxpayers in the electorate. Treasury analysis also indicates that this will support more women and greater participation in the workforce—all good things. But I have asked for, and I would welcome, further information or modelling explaining why the settings by the government have been put where they are and how theyve been decided on. I appreciate that the income thresholds that are indicated in the bill are significantly above average Australian wages, with incomes of between $137,000 and about $200,000. I would say, though, that often they are not in a class of uberwealth as would be described by many on the government benches, particularly when one considers exploding house prices in electorates like Warringah. So I have written to the Treasurer to request clarification of what the modelling was and why they put the 37 per cent tax rate at the threshold of $135,001 and the 45 per cent tax rate at the threshold of $190,001. In the Treasury advice released by the government theres no clear reason that these thresholds have been chosen and what alternative thresholds and rates were considered, if any. Are there clear benefits or drawbacks compared with other thresholds? There are no clear answers from the government on this. There is also no provision in the government legislation to index tax brackets to really address bracket creep, which will impact millions of Australian taxpayers in the coming decade. Ive written to the Treasurer with those questions but have not received any response. Changes to the tax system should be done openly. They should be done with consultation, and I would argue that they should be done with exposure drafts so there is a broad consensus and ability to really assess the benefits and the merits of what is being proposed and where its being proposed. We also have to be cognisant of the timing of this. We are seeing sittings of parliament till 10 pm on endless nights because of the timing. We know what was already legislated has been done for several years. Accountants and financial professionals have set up their advice and planning based on the original time line and measures. The ATO has set up its calculators. Everything was in place for the system as legislated, and the government repeatedly assured everyone that they would not amend or repeal. Now all the systems and practices put in place to address what was legislated must be overhauled in time for 1 July 2024, assuming this legislation passes. I would argue that it is bad policy to be changing at so late in the piece without the right kind of consultation. We should be approaching a serious issue of tax reform that impacts every Australian taxpayer with due process and care. I absolutely support simplifying the personal tax brackets and incentivising Australians to work hard, earn more and keep more of their income. We need to move away from so much reliance on personal income tax revenue and make resource giants and multinationals pay their fair share. Focus needs to also be on those suffering the most right now. Whilst this is addressing many in our communities, the most needy are actually not really benefiting much. The reality is that those suffering the most are the poorest in our community. Theyre those on JobSeeker, student allowance and age pensions. They wont be benefiting much from this package. So, if the government is really committed to helping those who are doing it tough and theyre not just out for votes because of the popular appeal of this policy, then they would be committed to increasing payments such as JobSeeker to ensure that it is above the poverty line, alongside increasing other support payments. The detail of the bill—for many, theres been a lot of discussion, and I encourage residents of Warringah to go to the website. We will be putting up the detail in relation to the stage 3 tax cuts. The most important aspect is that essentially what was passed in 2019 has been repealed and has been replaced completely with new personal tax rates, which will bring the following brackets into effect. The bill will change the 19 per cent tax rate to 16 per cent for those earning between $18,200 and $45,000. This is welcome for young people in particular. It will change the 32.5 per cent tax rate to 30 per cent for those earning between $45,001 to $135,000. It will increase the threshold above which the 37 per cent tax rate applies from $120,001 to $135,001. It will increase the threshold above which the 45 per cent tax rate applies from $180,001 to $190,001, noting though that it was legislated to be at $200,001, so its really an increase in tax for that bracket. That means that all taxpayers essentially earning around less than $150,000 a year will receive a larger tax cut than they would have done under the original stage 3 package, while those earning more will receive a lower tax cut. The concern, again, is that there is no provision for indexation, and so with bracket creep what we will see is more and more people getting less of that benefit. Despite my concerns, Im absolutely in support, and I thank again all the people from Warringah who have written to me to let me know their thoughts. But I urge the government to think about trust and integrity and to bring the Australian people along with them when they are considering major policy changes. At the end of the day, whilst this may have gone down well, it raises the spectre of the question of what will be next. Trust in government once lost is lost, I think, forever. So, for me, there is that question. I must say that the Prime Minister, I think, on a number of occasions has identified his word as his bond, but that ultimately cannot be believed. When I look at other significant policy areas, such as climate change, energy, commitments in relation to net zero and commitments to a local issue like PEP11, which have still not been implemented—the Prime Minister promised that it would be dead, yet it is not—the question of trust and integrity will forever be there.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STEGGALL (Warringah) ","(09:49):"
12,0,0,0,1,1,"Burney, Linda Jean MP","8GH","Barton","ALP","N/A",823," There is no doubt that Australians have weathered a turbulent time over the last five years. A onceinacentury pandemic, persistent inflation, high interest rates, two conflicts and global uncertainty have put Australians under more sustained costofliving pressures. When tax cuts were legislated under the previous government five years ago, our economy looked quite different. Such a big change in our economy needs a different response, a better response. Good governments do the right thing for the right reasons. Good governments prioritise people ahead of politics. Australians have told us that they are under pressure. They have told us that they need their government to act. Action is what this bill will deliver, and it delivers to every single taxpayer. Young Australians are better off. Older Australians are better off. Women are better off. Nurses, teachers and agedcare workers are some of those most likely to benefit. More than 95 per cent of those workers across Australia are getting a bigger tax cut.  Its communities like those in my electorate of Barton that need and deserve Labors tax cuts. Constituents in my electorate have told me that cuts as they were legislated five years ago are not going to work for them. Organisations caring for our local communities have told me more people are coming to them for help. Theyve told me that the government needs to respond to the pressure Middle Australia is under. The government has heard these messages from Barton and communities across Australia loud and clear. Thats why Labors tax cuts mean that every Australian taxpayer—every single taxpayer—will receive a tax cut this year. In the electorate of Barton, 85 per cent of taxpayers will receive a bigger tax cut than under the previous government. I want to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, what tax cuts will really mean in communities like Bartons. Ninety per cent of women taxpayers will receive a bigger tax cut with Labors tax cuts. For a schoolteacher at one of our wonderful local schools, it will be an average of $2,429. For a registered nurse at the beginning of her career at St George Hospital, it will be a tax cut of $1,554. Childcare, agedcare, and disabilitycare workers will benefit too. For some here in this place, the first instinct was to go straight to politics. They made it clear their hearts werent really in tax cuts for Middle Australia. They have said these numbers dont seem like much of a difference. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition even said that they would roll these changes back, making 11.5 million Australians pay more in tax. But Australians tell us what kind of difference this will make. Its meaningful costofliving relief delivered in a responsible way that doesnt add to inflationary pressures and that lays the foundation for a stronger and more resilient economy. Cutting taxes for Middle Australia is a central part of our economic plan, but Labors tax cuts proposed in this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, are just one way in which we are providing important costofliving relief to families across Australia. Labor is focused on making the essentials more affordable for everyone. An additional 360,000 GP visits nationally were bulkbilled in the last two months, saving Australians $15 million. In my community of Barton, residents have already saved nearly $2 million on cheaper medicines because of our government. Weve also delivered cheaper child care. Affordable highquality child care is essential to boosting the participation of women in the workforce. It also prepares our children for success at school right through to year 12 and further education. The ACCC has found that, since their introduction in July 2023, boosts to subsidies and funding have meant that prices of early childhood education have dropped on average by 11 per cent across the country. The government is also supporting parents and children before they even go to preschool. From 2026 paid parental leave will increase to six months. This is the biggest expansion of paid parental leave since Labor introduced it when we were last in government. Weve also taken action on the cost of living through electricity bill relief. From 31 July last year, our electricity bill relief has taken $125 off the power bills of New South Wales residents each quarter. Thats vital support for millions of families, pensioners and concession card holders. Energy bill relief, paid parental leave, more affordable child care, cheaper medicines, boosting bulkbilling and tax cuts to every taxpayer—that is how Labor is acting on the cost of living. The most recent inflation figures show a welcome moderation, but its still too high. Treasury advice is clear that Labors tax cuts will not add to inflationary pressures, because they are broadly revenue neutral. Stakeholders from the community sector, unions, economic experts and academics agree that Labors tax cuts are a sensible response to a rapidly changing economic situation. This package of tax cuts is also a response to what Australians have been telling their government and their representatives to do about their concerns about cost of living and fairness and what aspiration actually means. Every Australian aspires for more for themselves and their children—not just to get by but to thrive. Ensuring that every taxpayer takes home more each week recognises that aspiration should not only be for those who are already doing well. Australia faces so many challenges. When good governments see problems, they listen and they act, and we have. Putting people above politics is about taking the best advice from experts. Its about listening to Australians, hearing about the problems they face. Those Australians rely on us to work for them, to respond to changing circumstances. I am proud to be part of a government that is doing exactly that—doing the right thing at the right time. I am pleased to support the government bill and I look forward to 1 July, when every taxpayer in the electorate of Barton will get a tax cut.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms BURNEY (Barton—Minister for Indigenous Australians) ","(10:04):"
13,0,0,0,1,1,"van Manen, Bert MP",188315,"Forde","LNP","N/A",824," Its a pleasure to rise and speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024. It has taken 18 months of coalition warnings and Australians crying out for help, but the message seems to have finally sunk in for the Treasurer and the Prime Minister: Australians are in a costofliving crisis. It may have occurred to them once they saw the national figures which show that, over the past 18 months, groceries are up by over nine per cent, housing is up by over 12 per cent, electricity has gone through the roof for many and is now up by at least 18 per cent, insurance costs have risen by 22 per cent and gas is up an incredible 27 per cent. Inflation remains stubbornly higher than in other developed nations. These are incredibly difficult conditions for ordinary Australians, and the pressures that we see in the households across the country are reflecting this. More and more Australians are being forced to use what money they have saved just to stay afloat, and this was confirmed by the Reserve Bank governor in hearings last Friday.  You would have thought these figures would have caused concern for the Treasurer and the Prime Minister long before now and that they would actually take the time and effort to produce a serious longterm economic plan to address these issues. But what have we seen? Another broken promise. They could have provided the full tax reform package that was legislated as stage 3 and was intended to address the creeping problem of bracket creep and the exact economic conditions which exacerbate the issue in a high inflation environment, but they chose to do something else. They chose instead to remove the low and middleincome tax offset rather than extend it, a $1,500 loss for many families across my electorate of Forde. They could have taken action last year rather than waiting until now. Instead, they held back from outlining any meaningful costofliving relief through last years budget and failed to outline an economic agenda that works for the Australian people. As Ive said before in this place, my electorate of Forde has many hardworking Australians from a wide range of occupations. They have been screaming out for this government, the Labor government, to act on this costofliving crisis. When the government had the opportunity to do something to alleviate this burden in the last budget, they did nothing. They spent all of 2023 ignoring these problems and being distracted by a $450 million failed referendum, but in the morning leading up to a byelection they have gone: Oh dear! Now we need to do something. In their haste to right their political fortunes, the Labor government have taken the easy option of breaking another promise instead of implementing a clear and coherent economic agenda. Weve seen over the past couple of weeks a multitude of those opposite willing to get in front of a television camera and tell Australians how great these changes are and how much theyll help reduce these costofliving pressures. I say to those opposite that it only tells part of the story and fails to take into account a much broader range of issues that are facing Australians. I might reflect on some of those issues. Real net disposable income per person has fallen by 8.6 per cent across this 18month period. For an average income earner, this is a decline in takehome pay of around $8,000 over the course of the year. We see that with these changes to the stage 3 tax cut package an average worker will be better off by some $15 a week, yet $8,000 a year equates to about $150 a week. So, in net terms Australians on average incomes are still $135 a week worse off under this government, and yet weve got those opposite crowing about their economic success and how theyre relieving the costofliving pressures for everyday Australians. Well, they come from a different world to the one from which I do. This $15aweek saving is less than one per cent of the average annual wage and returns just 10c in every dollar people have lost through the costofliving pressures through this Labor governments first 18 months in office. Over the course of this second reading debate I have heard multiple members on the other side ringing off these dollar savings amounts. But lets look at some of the other things that have been missed in this discussion. If we go back to the broken promises of this government, of which this one is just the latest: a $275 reduction in energy prices—well, thats not materialised; no changes to superannuation taxes—well, that has gone by the wayside; an increase in real wages—no, we havent seen that; no changes to franking credits—well, thats gone by the wayside as well; cheaper mortgages—no. On average, in my electorate, people are paying an extra $24,000 a year just in extra interest on their mortgage, let alone the capital component on top of that, all from aftertax income. And no changes to the stage 3 tax cuts. As the Prime Minister said, his word is his bond. Well, thats obviously not worth particularly much. If I look directly at an example of some of the employees and occupations in my electorate, a truck driver in Forde on the average wage will receive an $804 tax cut. However, when combined with their real income drop, they will be roughly $7,200 a year worse off. I know those opposite, in various answers to questions in question time, are waxing lyrical about the various occupations across the country and the tax savings they will achieve. But they never address the full picture. This is what the Australian people should be very, very careful about. It is not what Labor says; it is what Labor does that they need to watch out for, because nine times out of 10 they are two very, very different things, and Australians are paying the price for that right now. An electrician in Forde can thank this government for being $7,200 a year worse off as well, even with these changes. A concreter in Forde will find their $15 a week tax cut will still see them $138 a year worse off under this governments economic plan. A receptionist working in one of the many small professional services businesses in my electorate will be some $238 worse off this year because they will lose the low and middleincome tax offset, even taking into account these changes. I have yet to touch on the impact of the governments failed economic policies on small to medium businesses in my electorate. If we think that household electricity costs have gone up by some 18 to 20 per cent, for many small to medium businesses their electricity and gas costs have gone up significantly more than that—significantly more. Many of those small to medium businesses rent their premises and many of those lease increases are tied to CPI, to inflation. So their rents havent gone up by three per cent, unlike some of the big retailers in major shopping centres; they have gone up six, seven, eight per cent. Now the interest costs for their overdrafts have also gone up significantly more than household borrowing costs. Who pays for all of those cost increases? Households and consumers. So once again the government has failed to have a detailed economic plan which takes into account all of those issues that flow right through our economy. I know the member for Wright is here in the chamber. He has a very significant agricultural base in his electorate. How many of those producers of agricultural products are struggling to make ends meet because of their rising input costs, including the cost of water, electricity and fertiliser? That is feeding directly into the costofliving pressures that our Australian households are feeling. What has the government done to address any of those issues? Zero—nothing.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VAN MANEN (Forde—Chief Opposition Whip) ","(10:13):"

Sadly, that is very, very far from the case. It is not easier. It is getting tougher each and every day. The government has no answers and is completely out of credibility in this space.  We welcome the reduction in taxes for people on lower to middle incomes because were a party of lower taxes. Weve always prided ourselves on having a lower tax environment, and that was exactly the purpose of the three stages of tax cuts. This government has presided over a 27 per cent increase in personal income tax receipts in its time in government. The coalition, should it be returned to government, will focus on delivering lower, simpler, fairer taxes. We will look at fighting bracket creep to enshrine aspiration in our tax system, not just for households but for business. Ive spoken to a number of businesses of late, including manufacturing businesses—and its interesting to see the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources in the chamber—who are talking about shutting their manufacturing processes here in Australia and moving them offshore. Theyll keep their R&D here, but theyve said to me it is just too hard and just too difficult. One of the key drivers of costs for them is electricity, but the increase in our electricity costs is, in part, a direct result of government policy. On the one hand you have the Treasurer saying, We need to reduce taxes to deal with the costofliving issues, yet on the other hand we have the Minister for Climate Change and Energy driving up living costs by virtue of government policies in the space of energy. Energy goes into every single part of our economy. Until the government is prepared to deal with those issues, we will not see a reduction in the overall cost of living for people. As a businessperson said to me recently: If I think costs are going to continue to go up, Im going to put my prices up in preparation for those costs going up. Im going to insulate my business. That is the mindset business is in today. I dont see that any of the government policies currently proposed are going to do anything to address those issues. On this side, we want to reward hard work and support a strong economy where every Australian can get ahead and to unite Australians rather than pit people against each other. Whilst the coalition is supporting this bill, it is clear that these changes do nothing in the long term to provide relief—or they only provide relief for a fraction of the costofliving burden that Australians have incurred. The Prime Minister, who campaigned on integrity and transparency and even uttered the phrase, My word is my bond, can no longer be trusted by the Australian people.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[11]","N/A","N/A"

17,0,0,0,1,1,"MillerFrost, Louise MP",296272,"Boothby","ALP","N/A",826," The Albanese government started this year with great news for every single taxpayer in Australia: every taxpayer gets a tax cut. All 13.6 million taxpayers will be getting a tax cut as of 1 July. Labors tax cuts under the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 deliver more relief to more people in a way that is fiscally responsible and doesnt add to inflationary pressures. These new tax cuts are designed to provide bigger tax cuts for middle Australia to help with the cost of living, while also making our tax system fairer—because its not only tax relief; its also tax reform. Our tax cuts are good for Middle Australia, good for Australian families, good for women, good for young people and good for lowincome workers. Our tax cuts are good for helping with costofliving pressures for every single taxpayer, our tax cuts are good for labour supply, our tax cuts are good for tackling bracket creep and our tax cuts are good for the economy.  It is the job of an Australian government to do the right thing for Australians and for the economy, according to the economic realities of the time, and that is exactly what were doing. The Albanese Labor government is introducing these changes because it recognises the economic realities of 2024. Australians are under pressure right now, and Australians deserve a tax plan that responds to the challenges they are facing. When the coalitions stage 3 tax plan was legislated five years ago, the world was a very different place. It was before a oncein100year pandemic, worldwide persistent inflation, higher interest rates, two overseas conflicts impacting supply chains and prices, and global uncertainty. These things have put Australians under more sustained costofliving pressure. When the circumstances change, changing policy is the responsible thing to do. Our overarching responsibility is to consider what is the best thing for Australians now, and cutting taxes for Middle Australia is a central part of our economic plan, but only one part. It sits alongside getting wages moving again, bringing inflation under control, driving fairer prices for Australian consumers and providing important costofliving relief such as energy bill relief, cheaper medicines, higher income support payments and the biggest boost in rental assistance for 30 years. Labors tax cuts will make a real difference for the 13.6 million Australian taxpayers who will receive a tax cut. Thats every Australian taxpayer, with no taxpayer left behind and no taxpayer ignored. This is 2.9 million more taxpayers than would have benefited from the stage 3 tax plan from five years ago. It means that 11.5 million taxpayers will receive a bigger tax cut. Thats 84 per cent of all Australian taxpayers better off under this plan. In my electorate of Boothby, the number is 85 per cent of taxpayers better off under this plan. Ninety per cent of women are better off under the tax plan. Ninetysix per cent of young people under the age of 29 will be better off under this plan. Gen Z are among the biggest beneficiaries of this tax change, because they were ignored under the previous plan of the Liberal and National parties. Under Labors tax plan, taxpayers earning less than $45,000 will now receive a tax cut. Previously, they got nothing. This will significantly boost the takehome pay of Australians on modest incomes and people working part time. Under the coalitions plan, taxpayers earning under $45,000 got nothing. An Australian taxpayer earning the average wage, around $73,000, will now get a tax cut of more than $1,500 a year, which is around $29 a week. Thats more than double what they would have got under the coalitions plan. Thats nurses, teachers, truckies, and so many more Australian workers who are the absolute backbone of our economy and are earning around the average wage. For an Australian family on an average household income of $130,000, with, say, one partner earning $80,000 and the other around $50,000, their combined tax cut will be over $2,600, which is about $50 a week and $1,600 more than they would have got under the Liberal and National parties plan. But these are not just shortterm gains. Labors tax plan also meaningfully addresses bracket creep in a way that, as Treasury has modelled, better addresses bracket creep than the oppositions stage 3 tax cuts ever would have. The governments changes deliver a better and more progressive tax system and address bracket creep more evenly. Our plan returns bracket creep for all taxpayers and does more to reduce the impact on those most burdened by it. By dropping two tax rates and lifting two thresholds, we are giving everyone a tax cut, providing $359 billion in help with the cost of living and returning the most bracket creep where we can do the most good for Middle Australia. As a result, the average taxpayer will pay $21,635 less income tax over the next decade. And of course its also good for the economy. Labour shortage is one of the issues I heard about from businesses large and small during the last election, and its something this government is taking seriously. Treasury estimates that our changes will increase labour supply by around 930,000 hours per week. That is more than double the labour supply impact of the former coalition governments plan. This is driven by increases in hours worked and participation of women with taxable income between $20,000 and $75,000. Parents, particularly women with young children, will be meaningfully supported to return to work under the governments changes through increases to their takehome pay. The really critical consideration in making this change and in all the costofliving relief weve provided over the past year is to ensure that what we do is not inflationary. The advice from Treasury is clear that our tax cuts will not add to inflationary pressures, because they are broadly revenue neutral. The most recent inflation figures show a welcome moderation. Its still too high, but it is moderating, and Treasury is clear that our tax plan will not impact their forecasts and timing for inflation to return to the target band. The Albanese government is providing meaningful costofliving relief in a responsible way that doesnt add inflationary pressures while laying the foundations for a stronger and more resilient economy. So, what it is actually going to change? From 1 July this year the government will reduce the 19 per cent tax rate to 16 per cent, reduce the 32.5 per cent tax rate to 30 per cent, increase the threshold above which the 37 per cent tax rate applies from $120,000 to $135,000, and increase the threshold above with the 45 per cent tax rate applies from $180,000 to $119,000. The 45 per cent tax threshold will be lifted on 1 July for the first time since Labor was last in office. All 13.6 million Australian taxpayers will receive a tax cut from 1 July onwards. The governments tax cuts will return bracket creep and lower average tax rates for all Australian taxpayers, and this is a greatnews story. What is the LiberalNational oppositions position on this? Well, the hint is in the name: they oppose it. The deputy opposition leader, prior to even having the detail of the bill, said they would roll the changes back. When asked if the opposition would roll back Labors tax cuts, she said, Well, this is our position; this is absolutely our opposition—absolutely. This means they will make 11.5 million Australians pay more tax—an interesting position to take, considering that the oppositions seats are some of the biggest winners from this change. But the Liberals and the Nationals have made it clear that they do not want these tax cuts for Middle Australia. I know they voted against every other form of costofliving relief as well. But here they are directly against the tax changes that will put more money in the pockets of their own constituents. Our tax cuts come on top of billions of dollars in targeted and responsible costofliving relief thats been rolled out, including electricity bill relief, cheaper child care which resulted in an average 11 per cent drop in childcare fees across Australia, increased rent assistance, tripling of the Medicare bulkbilling incentive which resulted in more bulkbilling GPs, cheaper medicines through the drop in prescription payments and 60 day dispensing, a boost in income support payments, expansion of eligibility criteria for the singleparent payment and the JobSeeker supplement for older workers, feefree TAFE training, more social and affordable homes, and expanded paid parental leave. We are creating jobs and getting wages moving again. The Labor governments tax cuts have been very welcome across my electorate. Its a greatnews story: 100 per cent of taxpayers will get a tax cut, 85 per cent of Boothby taxpayers will get a bigger tax cut, 90 per cent of women taxpayers will get a bigger tax cut and 96 per cent of young taxpayers will get a bigger tax cut. Labor is the government of higher wages and lower taxes. We want you to earn more, we want you to be paid fairly for the hours you work and we want you to keep more of what you earn in your own pocket. I commend the bill to the House.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MILLERFROST (Boothby) ","(10:28):"

That means that, when people go to an election, they look for honesty and authenticity in what is described to them as to whats going to happen if a certain government is elected. If you then subsequently decide to change, for whatever reason it is, youve broken your promise. One would suggest that what you should do, if youre so moved by wanting to make a change, is honour your promise and then, in addition, take a further legislative change. You cant just go up to any person on the street and say, I owed you $1,000, but I met another person and now Im deciding only to pay you $450 because Ive been moved to decide to pay you less. What you should say is, Heres your $1,000 and now I have to address the person down the street who is also in need. That is generally how promises work.  But it is such a great trick; its such a great parlour game. Once youve taken the money away and spent it somewhere else, you cant go back and take it off people. That is logical. Yes, its a great parlour game and, yes, its so clever, but, ultimately, thats all that people remember—they never thank you for the tax cut, but they remember that you broke your promise. Thats precisely whats happened here. Of course you can say to people: Youve got more money than you had before. What do you think about that? Theyll say, Thats a great idea! Find any one person whos cognisant of whats happening in their wallet and say to them, How do you feel about having more money in your wallet? and itll be a nobrainer, but that does not give you an excuse to break your promise. In National Party seats, we have other issues that are at the forefront. We have a lot of people who are poor. The breakdown of where people are is that the teal seats are the wealthiest, then the Greens seats, then the Liberal seats and then the Labor seats. We look after the poorest. We look after the people who are really doing it tough in the weatherboard and iron. Thats who we look after. Yes, there are people who are very comfortable, and good luck and God bless them, but the highest proportion of poor people are in our seats. If theyre earning less than $40,000, what is proposed here will make no difference at all because they hardly pay any tax. We increased, in stage 1, the lowincome offset so that basically theyre taxfree. How do you help those people? And, by gosh, theyre really doing it tough. How do you help them? They have secondhand cars. In some villages out in these areas there are no police, there are no doctors, the houses are falling to pieces and theres no public sewerage. This is the life they live in. And theyre living that life around me. There are people who are 100 per cent—100 per cent!—zero emission. Do you know why? They have no power. That is why they have zero emissions. There is no power. Why? Because they cant afford it. I remember taking people into the back streets of some of the villages around me. Theyd say, Noone could possibly live in that house, and Id say, Well, explain to me why theres smoke coming out of the chimney in the middle of winter. Its why we have a strong view on certain issues, on policy. One of the biggest issues for them is power prices. If you take away their power, you drive them into absolute hard poverty. The other day, in a reconfiguration which is so wellmeaning but so physically, by reason of physics, crazy, we had Loy Yang go offline. Yes, they had a storm, but storms happen all the time. We havent had storms by reason of the differentiation in whats happening in the actual power grid that knocked out a major power station, or a large part of a major power station. The price of power per megawatt went up to more than $16,000. It used to be around $35 or $40. It doesnt matter what we think, that then flows through all the way back to the weatherboard and iron. What happens to them is they cannot pay their power bill. Now we have record numbers of people who are no longer on the grid, and this has to be addressed. If you really want to look after people who are doing it tough, you go to one of the core issues in their lives—their power bill, their grocery bill, their capacity to pay for a dentist and the fact that theyve got a secondhand car. If you start changing fuel standards and saying, This and that will happen, thats all well and good where people have money. But, where they dont have money, they cant afford the car theyve got. Every time they go to get groceries, they cant go to a corner store, because there is no corner store. If there is, its incredibly expensive. Their trip to the major supermarket takes fuel, and everything they do is more expensive. Youve got to go to the fundamentals of their lives and address those. Thats the role of the Nationals and the members around here who live it—and I know that includes the member for Cowper, because his electorate is right up against mine. We had a road between us. It just disappeared. It just went. Imagine that in an urban environment. Imagine that one of your major connecting roads just goes after a flood. Its years later, and it hasnt been put back. This is the sort of life that weve got. What happens to the people on that road? There are people who live there. How does it work for them? Just to give you an example, we had a bridge in our area, and it went out for three years. Thats three years without a bridge on the major connecting road. These are the realities that we deal with. Each one of these is a decision youve got to really focus on. How do you help people who earn below $40,000 a year? I might just note that, if you are earning over $135,000 a year—or about $139,000 with increments, but I wont go into the nuances of it—you are actually getting less money after these tax changes. On the other side, therell be a lot of people on $139,000 who would say, Im going alright, but Im not super rich. For my part, Im looking after people under $40,000. This became accentuated yesterday at two oclock, when Loy Yang went out. Hazelwood is gone, and they said it wouldnt have an effect. It had a massive effect. Liddell is gone, and they said it wouldnt have an effect. It had a massive effect. Now Loy Yang is under threat, and theyre talking about closing down other baseload power generators. Weve seen that intermittent power in the form that is rolling out now does not do the job. Its alright if power is a little bit of your life and expense, but its absolutely devastating if its major. On the other side are groceries. For politicians in regional areas, its said that a lot of your politics is done in the pub. Thats romanticising it a bit. But Ill tell you that talking to people is done in the supermarket. Sidle up beside someone whos trying to pay for their grocery bills, and just have a look. Do you know what the humiliation is like when the card says, Declined; see issuer for details? Do you know how humiliating that is for people? Do you know all the statements that are made? There must be a mistake or A payment must have come out. These are true stories. In my area, I was talking to one of my constituents, and she said she was vegetarian. I thought, Well, thats good. Then she put the addendum on it: Its not because I want to be. Its because I cant afford meat. People think this is not happening in Australia. It is happening in Australia. Im glad weve got an ACCC inquiry. Thats important, but Ill tell you something that weve sort of been aware of for years. Big supermarkets are supported by big unions so they can make big profits. Because of big unions that work with big supermarkets, the supermarkets have big political power. They come close to us on our side too. Make no mistake about that. Im not saying that we are without fault on this one. It absolutely exists on our side as well. These people are mercenary. They dont care how they do it, as long as, at the end of the day, theyre looked after. They will feign virtue so that you keep your eye off them, and they will do what theyve got to do. Weve got to ask a serious question: how many years have we been dealing with this, and how far have we progressed? How far have we managed to get a sword of Damocles so that these people act fairly? What have we actually done? Is it time we think about it, look at other countries, such as the United States, Canada and England, and ask: What do those countries do? How do they go about it? What are we missing here? I pose that question because, to the people in the big supermarkets: I know youre watching, and I know you know exactly what I am talking about. This is another issue that has to be looked at. So weve got power prices and grocery prices, and then weve got fuel. Fuel is another one. Without fuel, youre going nowhere. In a regional area, if someone in your house has a stroke or a heart attack and you havent got fuel in the car, theyre dead. You just cant get to the hospital. Remember, we dont have hospitals. In fact, we do have some hospitals but—I kid you not—theyve got no doctors into them. If the nurse falls over, you have to find another hospital, because the hospital hasnt got a doctor. The problem weve got in Australia is that were not building new refineries; were closing them down. And the jobs for people in bluecollar work, like jobs at aluminium smelters—not in my area—are closing down. The bluecollar manufacturing jobs that these people do, because they havent been to university, are just being taken away. What we have now in our area is contractors on farms—fencing contractors, mustering contractors, people trying to make sure that they can make a buck. But, in terms of substantive jobs, because power prices have gone up we have become uncompetitive with overseas countries. The best way to deal with the cost of living is to have more cash. That really helps with the cost of living. But we cant propose a strategic advantage by saying were going to have the wages of India or Bangladesh. That would be outrageous. Commodities are at a global price, so there is no strategic advantage there. So youve got to look for other areas where you have a strategic advantage. The one we had in the past was power prices. Now thats gone. Of course, because that has gone your manufacturing capacity is lost. The government have to be able to address—its especially pertinent today because of Loy Yang—exactly what they intend to do, not their mythical desires and what they believe, in a sort of Peter Pan economics, will happen in the future. They have to actually address what theyre going to do about fixing the power crisis—and we now have a power crisis. If you cant fix the power crisis, youve got no hope of fixing the cost of living. What you do to tax rates—whether you turn the dial backwards or forwards—will make absolutely no difference to whats happening in the lives of people who are in the $0 to $40,000ayear bracket.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JOYCE (New England) ","(10:40):"

31,0,0,0,1,1,"Albanese, Anthony MP","R36","Grayndler","ALP","N/A",829," Im pleased to speak in favour of Labors costofliving tax cuts. We just heard from a fellow who was Deputy Prime Minister of Australia not once but twice—the sequel noone wanted! He stood at the dispatch box having been part of a government for the best part of a decade, including twice being Deputy Prime Minister, and spoke about how the electorate that he represents and the electorates that the National Party represents dont have services, dont have infrastructure and dont have support. At the same time, those opposite have gone out there and supported tax cuts which overwhelmingly benefited people in the inner cities, not in regional Australia.  Our tax cuts are aimed squarely at regional Australia and the outer suburbs. Our tax cuts are aimed squarely at Middle Australia. Our tax cuts are aimed squarely at ensuring that people are not left behind. Our tax cuts, unlike the ones that those opposite propose, deliver for all 13.6 million taxpayers, not just some. The former Deputy Prime Minister is right that electorates like his have a lower average wage compared with an electorate like mine. Do you know what people who are on high incomes in my electorate are telling me? They are telling me that our tax cuts are fairer. They understand that a good society means not leaving people behind. They understand that people on average wages—Middle Australia—will get double the tax cut that they were going to get under the previous system. A shop assistant on $32,000 will get a tax cut of $414. They were going to get nothing. A nurse on $76,000 will get a tax cut of over $1,500. A teacher on $80,000 will get a tax cut of $1,679. A police officer on $110,000 will get a tax cut of $2,429. An IT manager on $160,000 will get a tax cut of $3,729. Every politician will get a tax cut of 4½ thousand dollars. We have made sure that no matter what income you are on, right through the income scale, you will get a significant tax cut compared with your existing income. We understand that people who are on lower than $45,000 do deserve a tax cut, and lowering the rate from 19 per cent to 16 per cent will flow right through the income scales. But we also understand that people right through those income scales are deserving of support, which is why we are lifting the threshold at which 37 per cent comes in from $120,000 to $135,000 and we are lifting the top marginal tax rate from $180,000 to $190,000. That is the first increase in that threshold since 2008, since the Labor Party last occupied the front benches here. Those opposite sat here for 10 years and did nothing about it. It took a Labor government last time, and its taken a Labor government this time, to address this issue. In fact, what they did the last time they were in office, after the 2013 election, was that, having said absolutely nothing beforehand, they introduced a socalled deficit levy on highincome earners, an additional tax which lifted up that top rate to the highest it has been in recent times. At the same time, they made cuts to health, cuts to education, cuts to the ABC and cuts to services. At the same time, the bloke who now wants to be Prime Minister came in as health minister and introduced a GP tax, or tried to—a tax on every visit to the doctor. He also tried to introduce a tax for every time people ended up at an emergency department, at the same time he was ripping $50 billion out of the healthcare system. There was no mention of that before the election. What we have done here is to respond to the needs of our changing economy. Since five years ago, when the Morrison tax plan was put in place, theres been a global pandemic that had a long tail to it, there have been two conflicts—in Russia, with its invasion of Ukraine, and in the Middle East—and there has been global inflation, which has had an impact. Treasury and the Reserve Bank have indicated that those things have had a disproportionate impact on low and middleincome Australians, and thats why we made not an easy decision but the right decision, done for the right reasons at the right time, to go to the National Press Club, having gone through all of our processes—the ERC, the cabinet, the ministry and our full caucus—and say: We are changing our position, and this is why. Its because people are doing it tough, and we want to do everything we can to provide support for the cost of living. This comes after the other measures that weve put in place: our energy price relief plan, our cheaper medicines, our feefree TAFE, our cheaper child care. It comes on top of the measures that weve put in place to increase real wages—which have had an impact, with real wages increasing for two quarters in a row—including our support for an increase in the minimum wage in the last two national wage cases, which has had a significant impact on lowincome earners. It comes on top of the 15 per cent increase in wages for the agedcare sector, in accordance with the recommendations of the agedcare royal commission. If youre an agedcare worker youve benefited from the increase in your wage to make sure that you earn more, and now youll benefit from paying less tax on that increased amount. Our approach has been to make sure that we deliver for working Australians, and indeed our package means that 84 per cent of taxpayers will be better off than they would have been had this legislation not been given support: 90 per cent of women, 98 per cent of young people, and overwhelmingly people in regional Australia. That is why the National Party member—the bloke elected leader not once but twice—has just come in here and gone on about how tough people do it in regional Australia. How about if they had a political party that stood up for them? The National Party wont, but we on this side of the House, the Labor Party, will stand up for people in regional Australia, which is what we are doing. It is crystal clear that every taxpayer needs and deserves a meaningful tax cut, and thats what this legislation, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, will do. We want Australians to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. The coalition want people to work longer for less. A modest position that was carried just last week in this parliament, to allow for workers not to be punished for being on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, is going to be overturned by those opposite. The truth is that, as technology has changed the nature of work, legislation must change with it. The government must respond to these changes in work practices. They wont interfere with any commonsense approach to these issues, which is why the right to disconnect is part of enterprise bargaining and a range of arrangements put in place between employers and employees. Thats why the Fair Work Commission, under the legislation, will have a commonsense approach, essentially, to these issues. We know there are times when its entirely appropriate for a worker to be contacted out of hours. What those opposite want, though, once again, is to just fail to move with the times. They just want the world to stop so they can get off. Well, they have got off—theyve got off any responsibility from acting in a way that looks after working people and looks after their constituents. Our position is also made possible by the fact that we have been fiscally responsible. It is what has given us the capacity to put in place those changes in child care and in health care, including the tripling of the bulkbilling incentive in Medicare, and our energy price relief plan that, all the indications are, put a significant downward pressure on inflation. Weve put in place those measures whilst delivering the first surplus in 15 years and weve turned a $78 billion deficit into a $22 billion surplus, something that those opposite were never capable of doing. They committed to having a position going forward in this parliament that would have left people behind and they have voted against all those costofliving measures, and now what we see is that they dont talk about it anymore. I may as well take a page out of the Bob Carr book of parliamentary leadership and bring a novel into question time, because we dont get any questions about the cost of living anymore. They never ask. They are completely distracted from any issue. They havent put any other proposals.

Where do you find an extra $22,000 a year when you are on an average income in my electorate of $65,000 a year before tax? The reality is you have to find a second job to cover your mortgage, and that is exactly what people are doing. That is exactly what people are facing.  Then you look at the groceries. Im sure everyone in the chamber will be interested to know I do the shopping in my household. I enjoy it. I love it. I love comparing prices. I love to see what is on the shelf. I enjoy cooking. So every fortnight I prepare the list for the fortnight, do the meal plan for the budget, just like many people across Australia. Over the past 18 months to two years, my bill has gone up by at least 30 per cent. So if my bill has gone up 30 per cent—and we are not extravagant; we still have tuna bake Thursdays—it means everybody elses bill has gone up 30 per cent, but have we heard that from across the floor? No. Everything is rosy. There is not that costofliving crisis in the supermarkets. And what are the government going to do now? They are going to impose a biosecurity tax on our farmers. If you dont know what that is, it is a biosecurity tax on our farmers for what we are importing from other countries. We are punishing our farmers for what people overseas are sending here. Well, guess whats going to happen: youre going to pay more, because the farmers have no option but to pass that tax on to the consumer. If you thought it was bad now, with 30 per cent more on your grocery bill, wait until this tax is introduced and passed on to you—passed on to the mums and dads in regional and rural Australia. It is tough enough. Then I move on to the cost of electricity. Theres complete silence from the other side. Not one member did I hear. What I have heard is that your bills are lower, apparently—","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

44,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation",279991,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr CONAGHAN: Ill take the interjection. It was the Minister for Indigenous Australians who made that submission, only this morning. You can go to Hansard and have a look at it. We have seen power prices increase by over 20 per cent.  Ill give you an example of a person in my electorate, in fact in my office, who went out and put solar on her roof because she was worried about the cost of electricity. Well, its made no difference—absolutely no difference—because of the power prices. She hasnt got a battery—couldnt afford the battery. Its going back into the grid, but the cost of power is so high that it makes no difference to her. There are people out there struggling to pay their power bills, while people across the aisle are telling us, Your power bills are lower. Its just not true. You know its not true, but you wont admit it. Then theres gas. The price of gas is up by 27 per cent. Plenty of people in rural and regional Australia dont have power to their place. They live remotely, so they rely on gas, with a 27 per cent increase in the price of gas. And now weve got state and territory leaders saying: Were actually going to force you to have gas in your house so we dont rely on coalfired power stations. Were going to make you have gas elements in your house. Its happening in Victoria. Its being floated in New South Wales. Theyre trying to put more pressure on people in regional and rural Australia by interfering, by entering your house and telling you what to do and how to live. The costofliving pressure keeps piling up, and what do we hear from the other side? Nothing—not one word about gas prices increasing by 27 per cent. Then theres insurance. Insurance premiums are tripling, particularly in regional and remote areas. What is the government doing about this? Nothing. Theres no intervention—Thats your problem; thats not our problem. Were going to give you $67 a month to deal with this. This is our big gift to you: $67 to cover the extra $22,000 a year on your mortgage, the increase in your electricity prices, the increase in your gas prices and the increase in your insurance prices, and that $67 will go a long way. Then theres petrol. When we were in government, the excise on petrol was 44c. Its now above 49c. On top of that, you have 18c in GST, so its about 67c. Petrol was cheaper when we were in government and we cut the excise in half during COVID to give punters a break, because we knew they were doing it tough during COVID. And now what is this government doing? Nothing. Theyre not going to cut the excise in half. Theyve said so. When youre travelling around the city on the metro or on the trams, with short distances to work and short distances home, youre not concerned about the price of petrol. But in the regions, where youre driving 100 or 150 kilometres to work or youre on the road for work, it makes a huge difference—a massive difference—to whats in your back pocket, to the point where some people say, I simply cant do that job anymore, because I cant afford to travel that far. Yet this government will not cut the excise. Six months, 12 months—give the people a break. Have a look at it. Be genuine. Dont stand up here and say, Were giving you $67 a month. Sixtyseven dollars wouldnt even fill half your tank, and most people in regional areas go through two tanks a week. Its tough. Lets get real. Lets do something that really helps our people. And then theres wages. According to those on the other side: Youve never been better than under us. Your wages are going up. The reality is that people are worse off by $8,000 a year. Theyre worse off and they know it, and theyre telling the members opposite and theyre telling the members on our side. But do we hear it from the other side? No. Youve never been better off than under Labor, according to them. It is tough out there for these people. Ive heard over the past two days: Were giving you cheaper child care. Well, you cant get into child care in the regions. There are waiting lists of 200 to 300 people. There are police officers and nurses swapping shifts and organising their diaries so they can look after each others children. That is a fact. And people arent able to go to work and make more money, because they cant get into child care. As for aged care, apparently in the city, if someone needs to go into aged care, you can just walk up and book them in. See you, Nan. Well be back next week. Good luck finding a position in aged care in the regions! The delusion thats coming from the other side that people are better off is just unbelievable. That may be the case in your seats, but its not in the regions, because you dont think about those people in the regions. Let me talk about telecommunications. What about 28 out of 28 telecommunication towers in the last round? Where did they go? They went to Labor seats.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[11]","N/A","N/A"

53,0,0,0,1,1,"ONeil, Clare Ellen MP",140590,"Hotham","ALP","N/A",833," Im really genuinely so pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and to talk about how our Labor government is going to deliver Albos tax cuts and what this will mean for my Hotham community.  I have been a member of parliament now for 10 years, and, in that time, I have of course engaged frequently with my community, talking to them about issues that matter to them. Over those 10 years, whenever you do a street stall or youre doing your shopping in the supermarket, people come up and talk to you about whats going on for them. Usually, the things that they talk to you about are really varied. Itll be an experience theyre having with a kid whos trying to get into the NDIS. Itll be something theyre dealing with in the healthcare system. Itll be an issue that theyre dealing with in early education. But I can tell you one thing for every member of parliament in this chamber: when we engage with our constituents today, we hear about the cost of living. That is the first, second and third order of priority, and there is daylight until the next issue gets raised with you. We hear about it in a variety of ways. I talk to parents who just cannot afford to buy the groceries they need for their families. I talk to parents who are struggling terribly with rents and people who cant afford to fill their car up with petrol to go to work every day. These are real things that are really happening in my community in Hotham, and today our government is doing something serious and real to help those families, and Im proud of that. I talk to my constituents, and they raise the cost of living, and they do it again and again. My message to my constituents today is: We hear you. Our Prime Minister hears you. Thats why we have reengineered these tax cuts, and we are focussing those benefits on low and middleincome households right across my electorate and our country. I want my constituents to understand a few simple things about the tax cuts. The first thing is that every single taxpayer in Hotham will get a tax cut on 1 July, and 90 per cent of the people that I represent in parliament are going to be better off because of the changes that our Prime Minister has made. I hear derisory words around the parliament about what this will mean for families in my electorate, and I think it is snobbish and pathetic, because the truth is that a hundred bucks will make a huge amount of difference to some of the families in my community. When you put it together, we are talking about a lot of families in my community that will be thousands of dollars better off a year. Liberals born with a silver spoon in their mouths might find that thats not a lot of money, and for their constituents and some people in their communities maybe thats accurate. Its not for my community. Thousands of dollars extra in their pockets a month means a hell of a lot to families in my community that cant afford to buy groceries anymore. For a cleaner in Clayton, a nurse in Noble Park or a mechanic in Mulgrave, this is going to help them get back on track and pay the bills at the end of the month. Ive been a member of parliament for 10 years. It is not that often, honestly, that I can stand in this chamber and say that I am doing something good that will benefit every single person in my electorate. But today I can say that, and I can say that because of a decision made by our Prime Minister, and Im really proud of that. A nurse who works at Monash hospital in Clayton will be able to keep more than $1,500 a year in that pay packet of theirs. A teacher living in East Bentleigh and working in one of our incredible local schools is going to be $1,400 a year better off. A truck driver living in Springvale South, whos getting up at the crack of dawn, getting behind the wheel and delivering food and logistics that we need all over our great state, will keep an extra $1,300 to make ends meet. An average family in my electorate will be twice as better off than they would have been under the coalitions tax cuts. Thats the power of having a government that actually listens, cares and gets on with the job of making a change that will help the people we represent in this parliament. Weve had a pretty interesting sitting fortnight, and I think you are starting to see emerge two really clear pictures of the approaches that the two main parties of government have towards whats going on in our country right now. For the people who sit on the other side of the chamber, the Liberals and the Nationals, its all about opposing things that might help the families we represent. Its all about trying to make people work longer for less. What weve seen is the ultimate contortionist operation over there with something thats going to benefit 84 per cent of people. A hundred per cent of taxpayers are going to get a tax cut, and the people who sit opposite me, who pretend to represent their constituents, contorted themselves into knots for weeks before they said that they would come forward and support the legislation. In fact, their instinctive response to this was to say: Were going to wind it back. Were going to increase taxes for people in the middle of a costofliving crisis. Its absolutely ridiculous. Dont forget what were seeing on industrial relations, where we are making real strides and seeing real wages growth for the first time in a long time for families around this country. Again, the coalition comes in and says that they want to roll back the changes that were making. One of the first things theyre going to do is to roll back those changes. The Liberals want you to work longer for less; we want you to earn more and keep more of what you earn. As we go through the rest of this term in parliament, Mr Speaker, I think youll see that increasingly played out in the public policy conversation. Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope you wont mind if, on indulgence, I very briefly address another matter. We have had very serious natural disasters affect Victoria in the last couple of days. In particular, incredibly severe storms have ravaged the southeast of Melbourne overnight. Ive been speaking with constituents in my community. There are trees down everywhere. Some of the houses are flattened, cars have been destroyed and, of course, the vast majority of my community is without power right now. My own household has lost power, and I only share that to say were living that with you. My husband has been sending me pictures of the family eating dinner by candlelight. Their local school is seriously damaged. I want to say something quickly to kids who lived through this yesterday in their classrooms. I talked to my son, whos in grade 2, and he described what was an absolutely terrifying experience of living through that storm in a classroom environment where the children were really upset and really scared. I just want to say to those children that Im sorry that you had to go through that experience. Please know that the federal government will be working closely with the state government to do everything we can to help support and protect our community and to help with what is going to be an absolutely massive cleanup for our southeastern suburbs. Finally, I say to our emergency workers, our police, our SES, our firies and our sparkies, who are trying to bring the power back online: we are so grateful for the work that you do. These incidents are really hard, but they bring out the best in Australians. I want to thank my beautiful community and just let you know that Im here using the voice that youve given me in federal parliament. Thanks, Mr Deputy Speaker.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[12]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms ONEIL (Hotham—Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security) ","(11:24):"

56,0,0,0,1,1,"Tink, Kylea MP",300124,"North Sydney","IND","N/A",834," As I rise to speak to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, I wonder how this moment will be seen in the future. As the member of North Sydney, I stand here in a unique position, representing the electorate that would have seen the largest amount of money delivered to people in a community under the original stage 3 tax cuts legislation. Indeed, its not an understatement to say that when I was running for this seat many people were eager to understand where I stood on this issue. Did I believe the tax reform proposed under the prior legislation was the right reform? Would I fight to ensure the reform was delivered, and, ultimately, would I hold the government to account, ensuring that they delivered on what they had promised?  At that time, my answers were pretty straightforward. Yes, I believed the tax reform proposed was the right reform. We had already seen two of three phases executed, with each phase designed to address a specific perceived issue within the then tax frame. Id spoken with Ken Henry, one of the brightest minds of our time in terms of good tax policy, and I was satisfied the removal of the 37c bracket would be good for a huge portion of the community. Yes, I would fight for tax reform. I believe a broad based review of our tax environment is long overdue and we cannot, as a federal governing entity, continue to rely on taxes generated by those who work. To do so is to risk disincentivising people to strive for greater. And, yes, I would hold the government to account should they not maintain their end of the deal. Yet here I am looking at a significant change that I honestly did not think would happen. Why would I? After all, this government and this Prime Minister had given me absolutely no reason to doubt that they would not follow through on what they had repeatedly identified as an unbreakable promise. To be clear: under the current governments new plan, overall my electorate of North Sydney will see the largest reduction in personal income tax cuts from the modified stage 3 tax cuts compared to the previous proposal. At the same time, however, while the total amount of money flowing into my own community will be significantly reduced, the actual number of people receiving a tax cut will increase. The fact that both of these things can be true—that seven out of 10 individual taxpayers in the North Sydney electorate will now receive a bigger tax cut than they otherwise would have and that the economy of North Sydney will ultimately receive $77 million less than it otherwise would have—is where the quandary of this situation lies for me as North Sydneys federal member of parliament. Every time I stand to speak in this place and every time I vote, I am conscious of the responsibility of bringing my communitys true voice to this place, and this issue has been particularly vexatious for me. I cannot help but feel that it is absolutely imperative that the message I deliver here today is reflective of my communitys desires, not just my personal thoughts. That quandary has driven me to actively seek to gather a full and accurate picture of North Sydneys views towards these changes. In this context, the picture I speak of today has been built up in a number of ways. In the first instance, it has involved me actively listening to hundreds of people. I did this at street meetings, through online surveys and through calls for input via the local media columns and via advertising in local papers. Ive read hundreds of emails and digested every morsel of information I could gather from community forums, both in person and online. Whilst I was getting a feeling that I had a clear picture of where the people of North Sydney stood, I was mindful there may be some whom I simply wasnt reaching. So, following the release of the governments proposed new legislation just over a week ago, I commissioned an independent research agency to conduct a representative survey of the North Sydney electorate. The research shows a strong majority of my community—indeed, over twothirds, or 68 per cent—support the changes to the stage 3 tax cuts, with just 18 per cent opposing them. But, rather than me paraphrasing them, Id like you to hear from them directly. From a person living in Hunters Hill I heard this: Im one of the very high income earners in Hunters Hill and I am so supportive of these tax cuts to help struggling families and support such people who work so hard to put bread on their families tables. Another, from a different part of my electorate, told me: The proposed changes give bigger cuts to those who need them most. It is not about breaking election promises. Its about sensible financial policy. Yet another said to me: Im concerned that Australias inequality of income and wealth is getting worse. The proposed changes will go some way to redressing this matter. But much of the feedback from those who support these changes can be best typified in the following comment, which I received from someone who lives in North Sydney. This person said to me: I am a professional businessperson and earn more than $200,000 a year. The stage 3 tax cuts were never sound tax reform. They favoured highearning professionals and others, to the detriment of those who most need it—teachers and nurses et cetera. With all that said, while most of my community support the changes, some do not, and I do not wish to minimise them or allow them to be pushed aside as the greedy few. Rather, many people have very legitimate reasons for being disappointed with this change in government policy, and some feel theyve been blindsided, for, while they may be on what is considered a high income in this discussion, they are also frequently the primary or sole income earners in their families, and many are experiencing significant financial stress, either via increasing mortgage rates or through increased costofliving pressures. As an example, one person shared the following with me. They said: I earn just over $180,000 a year, and that means my husband, who cannot work for health reasons, is not eligible for government support. We have downsized our rental home twice in the last four years to help adjust our outgoings. The bottom line is, despite my perceived high income, as a singleincome household, we do have to live to a tight budget, because $90,000 of my gross income goes on super, Medicare and tax. In terms of the anticipated 9K benefits from stage 3 tax cuts, they are simply no more. Yet another offered to me: While I do support these changes, I just want to say I feel let down. I know that, according to the wider world, Im considered rich. I earn over $200,000 a year, but Im a single mum with three older children and Im trying to help them finish their schooling. I rent a house where all four of us live and Im trying to cover all of our living expenses, from insurance to groceries. Right now, once all of those costs are covered, I live on $16 a day. I understand that there are others in greater need and I want to be a bigger person, but I also do not want to feel bad about the fact that Im disappointed. We cannot pretend that these tax cut changes will have no negative impact, because they will. There are people in my community who were counting on the promised tax cuts to keep up with mortgage repayments, school fees and rising grocery prices. Understandably, theyre frustrated that they were told by this Prime Minister for so long that these changes would go ahead unchanged. Ultimately, though, I think that its not the broken promise that my community lament but rather the fact that they feel that they were misled along the way, because, to be clear, the majority of my community believe a strong government is one that does change policies to suit the times. In fact, three in five said that they believe it is acceptable for the government to make changes to the stage 3 tax cuts given the changing economic conditions and pressure on the cost of living, compared to less than a third who believe the changes amount to a broken election promise and undermine trust in government. Ultimately, my community believes this change makes sense for the time. Looking at it through a local lens, the truth is that more people in my community will be better off under the proposed changes. Through an equity lens, nearly 90 per cent of all taxpayers will get either the same or a larger tax cut under the new plan. The changes proposed will promote greater equity and direct more support to those Australians who are doing it toughest. The Medicare levy adjustment will also go some way to providing relief to lowerearning Australians, but my community would encourage the government to consider providing more costofliving relief for those who do not necessarily benefit from these tax cuts—those on JobSeeker, age pensions and disability pensions—for the people of North Sydney believe we must take care of the most vulnerable in our community. Through a gender lens, 90 per cent of female taxpayers will receive a bigger tax cut under these changes. In this way, the government argues these tax cuts will directly benefit taxpayers in highdemand but lowerpaid jobs with a high percentage of women, including teachers, nurses, aged and disability carers and childcare workers, all of whom will receive some tax refund under this scenario. And, through a fiscal lens, more than 100 economists and tax experts have called for changes to the stage 3 tax cuts, labelling the original tax cuts economically unaffordable and unfair. This included former ACCC chair Allan Fels AO, who said: The tax cuts— in their previous form— would add to our inflationary woes, are fiscally inappropriate in light of major demands on the public purse, and unfair unless linked with wider tax reforms. Finally, according to Treasury estimates, these changes will increase labour supply by around 930,000 hours, more than double the labour supply benefit from the previous stage 3 tax cuts. Looking at it in this way, then, it would appear this changed legislation is better for the times we find ourselves in, and I believe that is why the majority of North Sydney people support the changes. They are fairer, more equitable and more fiscally responsible than what was previously proposed, and these are the principles that my community values. But I also take this moment to put the government on notice. If you want my community to trust you, you need to be more forthcoming with your thinking. You need to treat my community with respect. We do not expect that all the conversations will be easy, but we do expect to be given an opportunity to contribute to them. We do not want to find ourselves stereotyped as those who have more and therefore can afford to pay more. From the outside, its always easy to imagine that someone has it easier than someone else, but please do not lose sight of the fact that we are people just like all others, working hard to build a better world for our children and their children. We do not want you to lose sight of the fact that we are also fighting hard to maintain a diverse and cohesive community where essential workers can afford to live near where they work and young people can aspire to raise their own families in the communities in which they grew up. Ultimately, we will welcome this change to deliver bigger tax cuts to more Australians, but please know that the lack of transparency from the government in making these changes has impacted people in a very real way. The debate around stage 3 tax cuts has highlighted just how overdue this country is for a total and holistic review of our entire tax system. It is clear we need to find other revenue streams and opportunities aside from income tax, like taxing multinational companies, windfall profits and carbon emissions. A much bigger conversation about tax needs to happen in this place, and it is imperative that this change stop being positioned as reform. It is not. It is a change from what was previously promised; it is not significant reform. A conversation about tax reform that is based on clear principles, incentivises the things that we want and disincentivises or taxes the things we do not must take place. We must also, though, always be mindful of encouraging and rewarding ambition and hard work, and we ask you to be mindful that, as the only other Independent to hold this seat, Ted Mack, was renowned for saying: … the very basis of democracy is that a decision taken by the public as a whole will be right more often than decisions taken by an elite group … We expect to be part of the conversation, and we welcome the opportunity in the future.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[13]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TINK (North Sydney) ","(11:32):"
57,0,0,0,1,1,"Hill, Julian MP",86256,"Bruce","ALP","N/A",837," The Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 will deliver a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer. Thats all 13.6 million taxpayers, not just the select few as under the proposal of those opposite. The 19 per cent rate will be cut to 16 per cent and the 32½ per cent rate cut to 30 per cent. For the 37 per cent rate, the threshold will be raised from $120,000 to $135,000, and for the 45 per cent rate the threshold will be raised from $180,000 to $190,000. It is actually the first increase in the threshold since Labor was last in office. A tax cut for every Australian taxpayer is something every member of parliament should vote for. But well wait to see what happens when we get to the vote, given the conflicting, confused, chaotic response of those opposite.  In my electorate 89 per cent of taxpayers will be better off under Labors tax cuts than under the Liberals proposals. People in Dandenong, Doveton, Dandenong North, Noble Park North, Noble Park, Eumemmerring, Hallam, Narre Warren, Narre Warren North, Narre Warren South and Endeavour Hills will be better off under Labors proposals. Every taxpayer will get a tax cut. Eightyfour per cent of Australians nationally—11½ million taxpayers—will be better off under Labors tax cuts than under the Liberals proposals. All taxpayers earning up to around $150,000 will be better off under Labors tax cuts than under the Morrison governments proposals. Nurses, teachers, truckies and care workers get a bigger tax cut under Labor than under those opposite. It is important, given the significant fiscal impacts of this bill to reflect on why Labors tax cuts are needed and why this is the package, why this is the right plan, right now. Its part of the governments economic plan to allow Australians to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. Now, theres no magic bullet, of course, to the costofliving crisis and the pressures people are under.

59,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation",86256,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr HILL: The coalition—indeed! Thank you, Member for Moreton. The biggest frauds opposite are actually the National Party MPs who represent some of the poorest, most disadvantaged electorates in the country. Their voters—their electors—will overwhelmingly be better off under Labors tax plan than the one theyve been advocating. But there is no magic bullet to the costofliving pressures people across the country are under. Labors tax cuts come alongside our costofliving relief—cheaper child care, cheaper medicines, energy price relief, the biggest increase to rent assistance in decades, more Medicare bulkbilling, expansion of paid parental leave and a boost in income support payments for the most vulnerable in the community. The tax cuts complement those measures by allowing people to keep more of what they earn.  Cost of living is about money in, money out. Unlike those opposite, the government has an explicit agenda to get wages moving. Weve finally had some good data on that. Wages are growing at their fastest rate for 15 years. Weve had two consecutive quarters of real wage growth. Of course, the decade of decay and dysfunction and division of those opposite—the AbbottTurnbullMorrison horror show—saw real wages in this country go backwards. And they cant blame COVID. Real wages were going backwards even before COVID on their watch. It was part of their deliberate design feature of economic management, as Mathias Cormann, the former finance minister, admitted in a rare moment of honesty on a television interview, where he said, Well, of course, low wages are part of our deliberate design feature of what we try and do. We have the opposite philosophy. The Labor Party wants to see people earn more and keep more of what they earn, and thats what these tax cuts are about. Importantly, though, theyre not inflationary. Without a doubt, inflation is the central economic challenge the country has faced last year and this year. Inflation—when prices rise faster than wages—hurts low and middleincome earners the most. Anyone with a sense of economic history who is old enough to remember what has happened to other countries around the world, who is old enough to remember the crises in decades past, knows that tackling inflation and getting inflation under control has to be the central focus of any government. If it isnt then we see more interest rate rises. The government has to carefully design tax cuts, carefully design costof livingrelief, so as not to make the problem worse. But the right thing to do when your country faces economic circumstances is to change your economic policy settings and that is what we on this side are doing with these redesigned tax cuts. The right thing to do is not to sit around and wring your hands and say, People are doing it really tough. Thats bad, isnt it? I wonder what will happen? or I dont know; we will give ourselves a $9,000 tax cut—which is what the Liberals wanted; that was their proposal—while everyone else gets nothing. That is not on. These tax cuts are good for workers, they are good for families and they are good for the economy. But it is important to reflect. We have put our case. Overwhelmingly, the feedback from my community and across the country is Australians support Labors tax cuts. Why all the screeching and shouting from those opposite over the last few weeks? It has been truly bizarre. It has revealed what a confused rabble they really are, if you didnt see it on television over the last couple of weeks on Nemesis. It is absolutely clear from everything they have said that the Liberal and National parties want to vote against tax cuts for low and middleincome earners. I will read the quotes. The shadow Treasurer said: Of course, we are going to try and stop it. A move away from the stage 3 tax cuts will not be something we can support. Their Churchillian deputy leader said: When this legislation hits the parliament, we will fight it. We will fight it all the way. I am digging in along with my colleagues and our leader, Peter Dutton, to fight this really hard. We will fight this legislation through both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Were not prepared to give up on this. Well, that lasted a day. Her position was her commitment to rolling back tax cuts. That was absolutely her position. The opposition finally had a policy. It was to raise taxes on 84 per cent of Australians. That was their brilliant genius policy they were going to take to the next election. That lasted a couple of days. Senator Canavan said, I dont support the governments change and broken promises on tax. Then their leader, Mr Dutton, intervened to try and referee the family fight. He said they wouldnt oppose Labors tax cuts. It is clear as mud because over last week the shadow Treasurer was interviewed by Natalie Barr. She asked him, Do you want more support for the lower end? The shadow Treasurer said No. David Speers asked him, You promised to keep these stage 3 tax cuts, of course, and now you are supporting their changes? The shadow Treasurer said, No, were not. The oppositions position is incoherent, inconsistent and a shambles. This debate has revealed them as frauds. They love to say, Tax cuts are in our DNA. It is part of their brand schtick and propaganda. The only problem with that is these inconvenient things called facts and economic data. The two highesttaxing governments, certainly while I have been alive—50 years—in decades have been: No. 1, John Howard and, No. 2, the AbbottTurnbullMorrison governments as a percentage of tax to GDP ratio. That is the accepted measure. On any measure, when you look at it, Labor is a lower taxing party of government, and these tax cuts under Labor are fairer and better for the economy. The last time the top tax threshold was actually raised was under prime ministers Rudd and Gillard. The first instinct of those opposite is always to oppose tax cuts and costofliving relief for low and middleincome earners whilst trying to give themselves a $9,000 tax cut. It is the fundamental core point of the Liberal Party, isnt it, when you go right back through Australian political history, to protect people who have the most in society, whether that is wealth or income. If anyone is confused by this, watch what they shriek the loudest on. They shriek the loudest when you try and look after low and middleincome earners and they shriek the loudest when you change laws to try and give workers a better deal; thats what really triggers them. Another reason why they should support Labors tax cuts is because they will overwhelmingly benefit women. This is a really important point. Labors tax cuts will put more money back in the pockets of Australian women. In particular, theyre good for the economy because, as the Treasury analysis shows, in cutting the 19 per cent tax rate to 16 per cent they provide a greater incentive for people, particularly parttime workers, who are overwhelmingly women, to pick up an extra few hours or an extra shift. The estimate is that there will be hundreds of thousands more hours worked in the economy because of the tax cuts. Theyre good for the economy, good for labour force participation, allowing people to keep more of what they earn. Under Labors plan, women taxpayers will, on average, receive a tax cut of $1,649 from 1 July. For 90 per cent of Australian women, thats bigger than under the Morrison governments plan. Childcare workers, disability carers and agedcare workers are some of those most likely to benefit, with more than 95 per cent of those taxpayers to receive a bigger tax cut than under the Liberals plan. The government has done the gender analysis. As I said, its overwhelmingly women who are in parttime and lower paid professions. A childcare worker in Dandenong, a receptionist in Noble Park North, registered nurses in Doveton, an office clerk in Eumemmerring, an office manager living in Narre Warren, a primary school teacher from Narre Warren North, an aged and disability carer from Berwick, an accounting clerk from Endeavour Hills, a nurse or personal care worker living in Hallam, a checkout operator living in Dandenong North, a general administrator living in Lysterfield South—all of these workers, overwhelmingly women, will be better off under Labors plan. Its better for the economy and the labour market than the Liberals plan. My best advice to those opposite—free advice, take it or leave it, and as I say this I reflect that there are no women on the other side of the chamber; we have at the table the Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth, the member for Cowan—is to stop the equivocating and back Labors tax cuts. Theyre good for the economy, good for every taxpayer and especially good for women. This is so important, because we know those opposite have a problem with women. Their Senate leader—not some baked, hasbeen leftover but the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, one of their big four—went on the television this week and said, Looking back, I can see that the absence of women, other than Julie Bishop, in the cabinet at the time, and the commentary around that, was a symptom of problems that were to come to dog us more fundamentally in an electoral sense in years to come, and to this very day. In an electoral sense—its actually always about the politics, not about diversity in decisionmaking or having all views represented at the cabinet table. Senator Reynolds, whos still there, though shes announced shell be retiring at the next election—to spend more time with family or spend more time with the lawyers, who knows?—said: I think it said to all of us that women werent really valued enough to be selected into the ministry, and in particular into cabinet. It certainly didnt send the right message. But perhaps the most astounding thing was that Australias former top public servant, Martin Parkinson AC, who was the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet—","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[14]/talk.text/body/p[5]","N/A","N/A"

66,0,0,0,1,1,"OBrien, Llew MP",265991,"Wide Bay","LNP","N/A",839," I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024. Obviously, in this place we make a lot of big decisions that affect people. Some are smaller than others, but one thing about tax law and taxation is that it strikes at the heart of most peoples family budget, and its something that we need to take extremely seriously. I just dont think that is happening on the other side. I really dont. I think, when it comes to this plan that the Labor Party has effectively cooked up on short notice, it isnt well considered. If you believe the Prime Minister, whos been telling us up until five minutes ago that there was no plan to change the stage 3 tax cuts, its very hasty in its being brought forward, and its ill considered. Ill go on to explain what I mean by that.  Of course Im in favour of income tax cuts. They effectively give people their own money back. When you go for a job, and they tell you what your wage is, they dont tell you the amount after tax; they tell you the amount before tax, because thats your money. Youre earning it. When you pay tax, the government takes that off you. Any legislation that comes before this House that looks to give people more of their own money back Im naturally going to be in favour of. But its the basis upon which these changes are happening. I certainly wont stand in the way of people getting more of their own money back, but I do think, under the circumstances and in the current economic climate, there is a better way of doing it. I dont think anyone likes paying tax, straight up. A lot of people give their altruistic views on taxation and it being a wonderful thing. I think its a necessary evil, and I dont think people actually really do like handing over money to the government. Certainly, taking more income tax off of people is one of this governments key achievements. Indeed, 27 per cent more income tax has been going into the economy under the Albanese government in the last 18 months. A 27 per cent increase in personal income tax under this government is quite extraordinary, really. Thats before you start looking at the 10 per cent GST on the goods and services that are absolutely going through the roof with this current costofliving and inflation crisis that has been 100 per cent brought about by the policies of the Albanese government. People are paying a 49 per cent excise every time they fuel their car up. Thats only going to become worse, with transport costs that will go through the roof under the new policies that have been brought forward by the Labor Party, which will see electric vehicles and hybrids forced into the market and onto people who cant afford what will be a major increase in cost to purchase a vehicle. People are already paying excise on beer and wine, and tobacco is going through the roof. There are the policies around tobacco, which theyre gouging more and more out of. Theyre not only failing on a health basis, because all were seeing is illicit tobacco shops popping up all over the place. Its an absolute disgrace what this government is doing in terms of their economic management. Labor talks a big game on middleincome and lowincome relief. But weve got to remember its the coalition who have already delivered $40 billion worth of tax relief to low and middleincome earners in their threestage plan, of which the Labor government are certainly changing the third stage, which they initially agreed to and promised the Australian people that they wouldnt change. But $40 billion has already been returned to taxpayers. Stage 1 provided tax relief to low and middleincome earners earning up to $90,000 by raising the 32.5 per cent tax rate threshold and introduced a low and middleincome offset. That was a key piece of policy that was designed to help people in a costofliving crisis. It was something that could be implemented at short notice, something that wasnt permanent but could be directed at those who needed it most at the right time, unlike this structural change that is certainly not going to be in the longterm interests of Australian taxpayers and the economy. Stage 2 increased the 19 per cent rate threshold from $37,000 to $45,000. The 32.5 per cent rate threshold was raised from $90,000 to $120,000, and the lowincome tax offset increased from $445 to $700, with lowincome earners eligible to receive both tax offsets. Stage 3 would have simplified and flattened the system by removing the 37 per cent tax bracket completely. That was a very important piece of legislation that would have addressed bracket creep. Those people in the middleincome range, hardworking Australians who are not rich by any stretch of the imagination, are being pushed into that next tax bracket and paying more tax through bracket creep, and that has certainly contributed to that massive increase of 29 per cent income tax that has been taken from hardworking Australians by the Albanese government. That was the plan—in stage 3, we were getting rid of the 37 per cent tax bracket completely. That 37 per cent tax bracket really needs to be known as Prime Minister Albaneses tax bracket, because he owns that from here on in. That is his tax bracket. When hardworking Middle Australia are paying 37c on the dollar instead of 30c on the dollar, they can say, Thank you, Prime Minister Albanese, for making me pay more tax. It shouldnt come as any surprise, but it is the case. The low and middleincome tax offset gave people back $1,500. That was the offset that we put in place in the coalition. The offset was removed by the Albanese Labor government in 2023, and the government now says that it will give these low and middleincome earners about $800 back instead. We were giving them $1,500 as targeted relief in a costofliving crisis, and the Albanese Labor government, which is spruiking that its making these wonderful changes, is giving back $800 as opposed to our $1,500. Thats $15 a week, which wont go very far at all when you think about it. We are living through a costofliving crisis. This government is failing badly when it comes to that. They will tell you that they are implementing all of these policies that are helping with the cost of living, but I ask you simply: Do you feel like you are paying too much for your goods? Under this government, have you felt like you are paying less? I think I know the answer to that, and the answer is a big no. People are paying more under Labor, and that is a fact. The other aspect to this is the politics around this. Yes, there are some people, as I said before, who will receive more of their money back, and we wont stand in the way of that. But there is a big cohort of people who wont who are not rich. Weve heard all of these television gibes throughout the week from the other side, but this is like an old repeat. This class warfare of envy is attacking Middle Australia. I know frontline emergency service workers who are going to have money taken off them by the Albanese government. I was talking to one the other day. This person is somebody the Albanese government has decided is not worthy of the tax cut that they were going to get. This person goes to the most horrendous domestic violence incidents and puts their life on the line to help others in their community. This person is in a particular tax bracket not necessarily because of aspiration but because of a sense of duty. Particularly in Queensland, where the Labor government has mismanaged things so poorly, there are people working in public services that are very understaffed. Theyre not taking on overtime because they want extra money. Theyre doing it because noone else will. Thats what finds them going into these tax brackets that the Albanese government has decided its okay to take money off. These are people that are serving their community on the front line and theyre being labelled as rich and as not feeling costofliving pressures. Thats absolutely absurd. The government should hang their heads in shame for engaging in that sort of thing. To add insult to injury, this government is taking money off hardworking Australians and its blowing it, with government waste like you would not believe. The greatest example, so far, of many is the referendum we had that cost $450 million. The government said, Were going to take this money out of your pay packet, hardworking Middle Australia, and were going to spend money on things like a referendum. It was an illconsidered referendum which should have been a moment of unity for our nation but did nothing but cause division. The government said, Were going to waste that $450 million, but were going to take it out of your pay packet, hardworking Middle Australia. Were going to bury a billion dollars worth of Taipan choppers instead of using those assets more prudently. Were going to have a Prime Minister that decides hes going to fly around the world in the VIP jet but wants to talk about hardworking Middle Australia, who hes taking money off with these tax changes. Hes blowing money, left, right and centre. Its an absolute disgrace—it really is. The good news is that after the next election we will, hopefully, have a different government that makes decisions in the interests of both the economy and the taxpayers who add to that economy. We will have a government that makes longterm decisions that will look further into the future to help Australian taxpayers and that will bring about changes that address bracket creep. We will have a government that will stop waste. We will have a government that looks after hardworking middle Australians, who are characterised by this government as rich snobs who dont deserve a tax cut. That government will, hopefully, be a Dutton government, and I will certainly be proud to serve as part of that government.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[15]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LLEW OBRIEN (Wide Bay) ","(11:59):"
67,0,0,0,1,1,"Rishworth, Amanda Louise MP","HWA","Kingston","ALP","N/A",841," Im very pleased to speak in this debate. I was listening to those opposite, and they were very forthright in their objections to these tax changes, which are bigger, better tax cuts for more Australians. So I was a little confused about why they are voting for these tax changes. They had the opportunity to get up, put a stake in the ground and show their opposition to these tax cuts, but, of course, they havent done that, because, despite their rhetoric and what I think is a lot of hot air, they actually know deep down that these tax cuts are tax cuts for Middle Australia, they are tax cuts that support aspiration and they are tax cuts that give every single Australian a tax cut. If they didnt know or believe that, surely they would vote against these tax cuts, but they are choosing not to. They are putting a stake in the ground and saying, We support the governments tax cuts. It would be nice if these quite contradictory positions were explained a little bit more in this debate, but Im not going to hold my breath.  I am very pleased to speak in favour of the tax changes put before the parliament, because the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 will provide a tax cut to every Australian taxpayer. Our No. 1 priority as a government is helping Australians with the costofliving pressures. From 1 July, the government is delivering a tax cut, as I said, for all taxpayers, which will provide meaningful and immediate costofliving relief up and down the income scale without adding to inflation. All 13.6 million taxpayers will receive a tax cut, and 2.9 million more taxpayers will receive a tax cut compared to the previous governments plan. Eleven point five million taxpayers—thats 84 per cent of taxpayers—will now receive a bigger tax cut compared to the previous governments plan. Our tax plan includes increasing the Medicare levy lowincome thresholds, meaning that 1.2 million lowincome earners will get additional tax relief on top of the tax cuts that the government is legislating. Of course, the Albanese Labor governments tax cuts are better for workers and families and better for Middle Australia and communities right around Australia. This includes social and community services workers, who deliver a range of programs in my portfolio of Social Services, including services for people with disability, carer support services, initiatives to reduce violence against women and children, and other family and community supports. Our tax cuts mean that a fulltime social and community service worker earning $75,000 will receive a tax cut of $1,554. This is double the tax cut that they would have got under the previous government. The rhetoric coming from those opposite would suggest that they disagree with this person getting double the tax cut that was otherwise planned. The rhetoric that we are attacking Middle Australia suggests that this worker on $75,000 should not get double the size of tax cut. Well, we think that this worker, along with all other Australian workers, should be able to keep more of what they earn. A parttime disability support worker earning $40,000 will receive a tax cut of $654, once again keeping more money in their pocket. Under the previous governments plan, this worker would have got no costofliving relief. So I am really pleased that, as a result of this governments tax plan, community service workers will be able to take home more of what they earn to help with cost of living. My portfolio and, indeed, many other social services would not be able to deliver these programs without the dedication of workers who touch lives every single day, particularly the lives of vulnerable Australians doing it tough. Not only are our tax cuts particularly good for Middle Australia but they are also particularly good for women. All 6.5 million women taxpayers will receive a tax cut, benefiting by an average amount of around $1,650. Of course, 90 per cent of female taxpayers will receive a bigger tax benefit than otherwise was planned by the previous government. More than 90 per cent of taxpayers in essential and highdemand occupations, many of which have a high percentage of women, will receive a bigger tax cut. This includes teachers, nurses, agedcare workers, disability carers and childcare workers. Our tax plan will ensure more women keep more of what they earn and will help parents who are returning to work. Increases in takehome pay will also create opportunities for women to take on more hours, and weve seen in the modelling that this will boost labour force participation. The governments tax cuts complement continuing reforms to address womens economic inequality by closing the gender pay gap, supporting workplace flexibility and security and rebalancing unpaid care work. Of course, Im here particularly as the member for Kingston, and I am really pleased that the workers in the southern suburbs of Adelaide will get to keep more of what they earn under Labors tax plan. There are 75,000 taxpayers in my electorate, many in the health area. There are care workers, tradies, technicians and office workers. They will all receive a tax cut, and 90 per cent of these taxpayers will receive a bigger tax cut than they would have received under the previous governments plan. Once again, what the opposition is saying is that those people dont deserve a bigger tax cut. Workers in my electorate, in all those different professions, deserve this tax cut to support them with the cost of living. Our tax cuts complement the significant other costofliving relief measures that the Albanese Labor government has provided, particularly for those Australians on low incomes. In the last budget, the government announced an increase to the working age and student payments, which commenced from 20 September last year. This additional support has been flowing, along with indexation increases of the relevant payments. Since Labor took government just over 18 months ago, the base rate for JobSeeker has increased by 17 per cent in less than two years. The government has also delivered the largest boost to Commonwealth rent assistance in over 30 years to help people on income support, pensioners and lowincome families cover the cost of rent. Around one million households are better off up to $36 per fortnight, including indexation and depending on their household type. Importantly, this has not only provided costofliving relief but has helped to moderate rent increases. This is an example of smart government policy that is delivering direct costofliving assistance but is not adding to the inflation challenge, and that has been keenly felt. In fact, the opposite is happening, and this measure has moderated rent rises. Whether it is strengthening the safety net, providing electricity bill relief, providing cheaper child care, tripling bulkbilling or providing cheaper medicines, the Albanese Labor government is doing a whole lot to help people with the cost of living. As weve heard from those opposite, its pretty clear that those opposite do not want these tax cuts for Middle Australia, just like they didnt want to see an increase to JobSeeker or provide electricity bill relief. What has been pretty stark is that those opposite clearly have no alternative plan. They oppose our bigger, better tax cuts to Middle Australia but are voting for them. It is clear that they absolutely have no plan. It is hard to understand their position on this, because their position has been changing quite a lot. On the first day, they were going to roll them back. On the second day they werent going to make a decision until theyd seen the legislation. Then I think the shadow Treasurer equated the cuts to Marxism and said they would fight us every step of the way. Now theyre voting for them. You could not contort yourself in as many different positions as those opposite have done when it comes to these tax cuts. But that is because this opposition are full of negativity. Theyre full of negativity. Theyre full of saying no. They have no plans for the future. Theres so much negativity that theyve spent how many days arguing against tax cuts that they are actually going to vote for. The Australian people can see this posturing for what it is: the cynical politics that we are seeing from those opposite. Our government has taken the responsible action. Economic circumstances have changed and, as a result, weve adjusted our policies to meet those economic circumstances. We have been very, very clear that we want to support Australians with the cost of living, and ensuring we have a bigger, better tax cut has been important in that and in ensuring that our policy on tax does not add to inflationary pressures. This is supported by Treasury advice, which stated the tax system is an effective way of providing costofliving relief without putting extra pressure on inflation. That is what the Treasury has said about our tax cut plan. Importantly, our tax plan puts Australians first. It will provide meaningful costofliving relief for everyday Australians in a responsible way that doesnt add to inflation. While we see those opposite contorting themselves—will they, wont they, will they roll it back, wont they?—I look forward to seeing their tax plan, which we hear is going to come one day—one day its going to come! I look forward to seeing the merits of that, but, based on the quality of this debate, Im not going to hold my breath. Im not sure were going to see something from those opposite that is well thought through and is right for our economy. This government will get on with doing whats right for the economy, but, most importantly, whats right for the Australian people, whats right for Middle Australia, because they deserve costofliving relief, and thats what were delivering. I commend the bill to the House.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[16]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston—Minister for Social Services) ","(12:14):"
68,0,0,0,1,1,"Pearce, Gavin MP",282306,"Braddon","LP","N/A",843," There has been a lot of focus recently on the Albanese government and their broken promises. This government promised to leave noone behind—no Australian behind they said. Their promise was to hold noone back. Their promise was to use the great privilege of government in order to make positive differences to the lives of Australians. These were promises that they made to Australians over and over and over again. Now, 18 to 20 months later, there is no doubt at all, absolutely none, that Labor have failed to deliver on their promises. Households and families in my region in the northwest, the west coast and King Island in Tasmania, families from across Tasmania, families from across the nation have never done it tougher.  The coalition successfully guided this nation through the biggest health and economic crisis in living memory. We handed the reins over to the Albanese government in 2022 and the wheels have invariably fallen off the cart. The latest food hunger report from Tasmania is alarming. In the past 12 months—and these are facts—84,000 Tasmanian households have experienced food insecurity. Lets just think about that for a moment. Lets just think about what its like not having the means, the confidence to provide a simple meal for your family. In the 12month period just gone, 84,000 households in Tasmania experienced food insecurity. This is 18,000 more households, more families, than in 2022. Imagine what thats like for a moment. The No. 1 reason Tasmanians are struggling to meet their food needs is because of Labors costofliving crisis. Eightyseven per cent of Tasmanians say that the No. 1 reason for their food insecurity is the cost of living. We need to be clear about the reason for this bill from the outset. What is the purpose of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024? Its certainly not a longterm economic plan. It came about just a few weeks ago. Thats when a desperate prime minister called every member of his government to Canberra for a special crisis meeting—at great expense to the Australian taxpayer, might I add. This side has been telling this government and the Prime Minister that Australians are going to the wall. Theyre not doing it well; theyre doing it tough. Australians are being left behind. Australians are being held back. Weve been telling this government for 18 months, but theyve refused to listen. So what was the purpose of the dash to Canberra and the crisis meeting? It wasnt about the costofliving crisis. The meeting was about what Labor believed to be a political crisis—the looming byelection in Dunkley, no doubt. They hatched a cunning plan. It was a plan so cunning you could put a tail on it and call it a fox. It involved most vulnerable Australians, giving them a pat on the head and 15 bucks in their pockets. But well kick that down the road in about five months time. They wont see anything in their pocket for approximately five months. Theyre hoping that in that time theyll win that byelection in the seat of Victoria. This government is not about people. Its just about politics, and thats what this bill is all about. So how much has Labors costofliving crisis cost us? Around 45,000 taxpayers across my electorate of Braddon in the northwest, West Coast and King Island will get a tax cut from 1 July. They will. If you earn around $50,000 youll get around $15 a week under Labors plan. If you earn around $73,000 youll get $14 extra. Labor MPs have been rising in this place, telling us how generous they are and patting Australians on the head and giving every Australian an extra $15. Tell those families who cant feed their families at home and are lining up at welfare outlets in order to get a meal. Tell them what $15 does for them. What they should be doing is standing up and apologising for not meeting their promises to their electorates. This is a government thats giving $15 in order to compensate for the thousands of dollars, and in many cases tens of thousands of dollars, that Australians are worse off because of their economic mismanagement. Its shameful. As Im out and about in the electorate, on the ground listening to people, theyve been telling me that the No. 1 issue thats holding them back is Labors costofliving crisis. Noone is immune from it. Regardless of your tax bracket and irrespective of whether you are an employee or a business owner, Labors costofliving crisis does not discriminate. Its hitting everybody, and its hitting harder and harder and getting worse and worse. Parents are now making really tough choices about getting their kids what they need to return to school, because Labors rising cost of living is biting into everything that they touch. Under the Albanese government, Australians have seen the largest fall in living standards of any advanced country in the world. There have been 12 interest rate increases under this Labor government. Housing costs have risen. Mortgage payments have risen. Rental costs have gone up. Real wages have gone backwards. In fact, theyve gone backwards by six per cent. Labour productivity is in absolute freefall, with a 6.7 per cent reduction in labour productivity since Labor came to government. When Labor talk about how theyre growing the economy, the economy is growing only because of a rapid population growth. Almost half a million people have immigrated to this country in the past 12 months. For the past two quarters, the GDP per person has gone backwards, and yet those opposite believe that they should be congratulated. We should blow whistles and throw streamers for giving the most vulnerable $15 a week. Its an absolute joke. The average household with a $750,000 mortgage is paying an additional $24,000 a year in mortgage repayments. This is a government that promised a $275 reduction in electricity prices, but weve seen electricity prices increase by 18 per cent, the complete antithesis of what they promised. Gas prices have gone up by 28 per cent. Food has gone up by 8.2 per cent. Rent has gone up by 10.4 per cent. The cost of insurance has increased by 17.3 per cent. The price of everything that we touch is going up for hardworking Australians. But Labor thinks its okay if we give them $15 a week, pat them on the head and tell them how great they are. Well, its not going to cut it—taking Australians for mugs. Its important, when discussing Labors alteration to the stage 3 tax cuts, that we tell the full story. In order to tell that full story, we must consider what the coalition introduced, the full suite of tax cuts, specifically aimed at helping low and middleincome families. We are the government of lower taxes. Under a coalition government, stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 tax cuts were legislated. Stages 1 and 2 were specifically targeted at people on low and middle incomes, and stages 1 and 2 were delivered as promised, because we stick to our word. The coalitions economic plan delivered $200 billion worth of targeted tax cuts to low and middleincome earners. This bill will reinstate the 37 per cent marginal tax rate, which was eliminated by the coalition in our original stage 3 plan. This means that if youre on an income above $135,000 you will pay more tax sooner in the years ahead, due to wage inflation. This is called bracket creep, and 2.3 million extra taxpayers, or 14 per cent of taxpayers, will face the 37 per cent rate in 202425. This will rise to five million, or 26 per cent, in a decade. Labors decision to reinstate the 37 per cent tax rate is a war on aspirational Australians trying to get ahead. It reaffirms what we all know, that Labor taxes more. If people work harder, if they take risks, if they invest, if they employ, they should not be unfairly punished or penalised for doing so. In fact, they need to be rewarded and encouraged. They need to be thanked. I believe 100 per cent that we need to be incentivising aspiration, incentivising people to get ahead, to work harder, to earn more and to pay less tax. Labor dont like that. They believe in big, bureaucratic, hightaxing governments, not small, nimble, profitable businesses. In Labors first 18 months in government, personal income tax has risen by a record 27 per cent. Bracket creep, driven by rampant inflation, is the thief in the night. The reinstatement of the 37 per cent tax bracket is the tax increase that Australians never voted for. Finally, we wont stand in front of any tax cut for Australians. Its not our way. But I believe that this government should have done something about the costofliving crisis, about the real cause, rather than simply giving a pat on the head. I call on this government to be honest and tell Australians why this bill is being introduced right at this present time. Families across the electorate of Braddon—in the northwest, the west coast and King Island—in Tasmania are telling me, about their costofliving pressures, that theyve never seen anything like it in their lives. This side have been telling Labor, over and over, that our communities are doing it tough. Their response, for 18 months, has been to ignore our pleas and to do nothing. Theyve kept the money in the bank while our families have gone hungry. For the past 18 months, with money in the bank, the government have turned their back on struggling families. So why now? Politics—thats why. Theres a revolt in Labor ranks across the backbenches. Theyre nervous that they might lose their seats because people in their seats are also feeling the costofliving crisis. This government might have promised to leave noone behind. They might have promised to hold noone back. But the truth is their promises have gone unfulfilled. Hardworking Australians always go backwards under Labor, and youll always pay more tax under Labor. To put politics aside for one moment, I urge all Australians out there to forget about politics for a moment and sit down quietly and consider this. Ask yourself the question: have you felt better in the last two years under Labor, or is your family—like mine, in my electorate—doing it tough?","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[17]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PEARCE (Braddon) ","(12:27):"
69,0,0,0,1,1,"Roberts, Tracey MP",157125,"Pearce","ALP","N/A",844," Im going to enjoy reading this carefully considered, detailed, factual speech. Listening to the previous speech, full of innuendo, scaremongering and real concern about these tax cuts, was just beyond belief. I rise to support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024.  I can tell you that when our Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, announced the proposed tax cuts there were many happy faces around my community of Pearce. Our constituency is diverse and is one of the fastest growing and largest areas in Australia, with an average of seven babies born a day. We have many young families looking to establish themselves in Pearce, people moving in from other states and territories and from overseas, plus seniors who want to enjoy their retirement years close to their grandchildren and extended families. One of the reasons the electorate of Pearce is such a large and fastgrowing area is that its a beautiful location, with 32 kilometres of coastline, national parks and regional open spaces and thriving market gardens that have earnt us a reputation as the food bowl of the north. However, we have all been challenged by the rise in the cost of living. Everyone is more cautious about what they are buying and how much they are spending. It is a conversation we are having within our families and friendship groups, and I have found people are happy to stop and chat about it openly. Families are becoming more careful in budgeting and financial planning, tracking income and expenditures and trying to identify areas where they can cut costs or make savings so that their essential needs can be met first. Many have sought social and community support to help them cope, and I would like to thank the many services in Pearce who have stepped in to support those in need. The Australian Council of Social Service—ACOSS—released a paper titled People with the least need more support. They reported that people on the lowest incomes are bearing the brunt of spiralling prices. ACOSS stated that frontline community services, which were already overstretched, are struggling to keep up with demand. ACOSS recommended a number of actions, including removing the stage 3 tax cuts altogether, as they really benefited only people on the highest incomes, not those under the greatest financial pressure. They were not alone in their criticism of the coalitions stage 3 tax cuts. So how did we get here? Where do we go forward? Since the tax cuts were legislated five years ago, we have experienced a oncein100years pandemic, wars and global conflicts, global inflation spikes and higher interest rates. These events have put people under greater costofliving pressure. The Morrison government was piling debt on Australia. In 2022 the Albanese Labor government inherited almost a trillion dollars of debt, which was eye watering to say the least. Thankfully, I am part of a government that listens to the community and acts. We know the family budget is under pressure and has been for some time. We have introduced measures to help our communities, including cheaper child care, cheaper medicines, electricity bill relief, increased rent assistance, more Medicare bulk billing, feefree TAFE training, building more affordable homes, expanding paid parental leave and getting wages moving again. The question is: what more could be done to ease the pressure? Something has to change, and it is clear that every taxpayer needs and deserves a meaningful tax cut. Put people before politics—without a doubt, it works for me. The Albanese Labor governments tax cuts deliver more relief to more people in a way that is fiscally responsible and does not add to inflationary pressures. They are designed to provide bigger tax cuts for Middle Australia to help with cost of living while making our tax system fairer. In my electorate of Pearce, every single taxpayer—I say that again: every single taxpayer—will receive a tax cut under Labors tax plan, with 85 per cent receiving a bigger tax cut from 1 July. As I have already stated, my communitys diverse, as are others across the nation. Lets look at some figures. All 6.5 million women taxpayers will receive a tax cut, the average being $1,649; 1.5 million young Australian taxpayers aged between 18 and 24 will receive an average tax cut of $1,007; and, for those aged between 25 and 29, the average tax cut will be $1,573. Older Australian taxpayers will receive tax cuts ranging from $1,685 to $1,726. If you look at the tax cuts by occupation, a nurse earning $76,000 will get a tax cut of $1,579, a primary school teacher earning $80,000 will get a tax cut of $1,679, a truckie earning $77,000 will get a tax cut of $1,604, and a police officer earning $110,000 will get a tax cut of $2,429. Our tax cuts are good for Middle Australia, good for women, good for helping with the costofliving pressures, good for labour supply and good for the economy. Labors tax cuts will make a real difference for 13.6 million taxpayers who will receive a tax cut, 2.9 million more than would have benefited from Scott Morrisons plan from five years ago. They mean that 84 per cent of taxpayers, including 90 per cent of female taxpayers, will now receive a bigger tax cut. Parents, particularly women with young children, will be supported to return to work under the governments changes to their takehome pay. This, on top of the changes we have made to paid parental leave, will further assist women, who for too long have faced longterm consequences for their economic security. Treasury estimates that our changes will increase labour supply, driven by increases in hours worked and participation of women with taxable income between $20,000 and $75,000. Associate Professor Ben Phillips from the Australian National University stated: Support now is across the board rather than just at the very top. So thats good in terms of workforce participation, and its also good in terms of cost of living relief. I think overall its a fairer package. At the time of the 2021 census, there were 177,513 people living in my electorate of Pearce alone. There were nearly 50,000 families and 66,000 dwellings. These figures have changed since that time, with many more people moving in. I stumbled upon that because I was just questioning the numbers, but they are factual. The new tax cuts will make a difference for families in Pearce. For example, for a family on an average household income of around $130,000, with one partner earning $80,000 and the other $50,000, their combined tax cut would be over $2,600, which equates to almost $50 a week and is $1,600 more than they would have received under the old plan. That makes a difference. It makes a difference to families budgets and to what they can spend their money on. It gives them hope that things are going to be alright within the family. The additional $50 per week will make a difference. It could literally mean more food on the table. It could help with the mortgage or rent, with paying an unpaid bill or with buying a pair of muchneeded school shoes. These are things that people hold dear to their hearts. They are meaningful on a daytoday basis for people working, living and trying to make ends meet. The governments changes will deliver a better, more progressive tax system, addressing bracket creep by dropping two tax rates, lifting two thresholds and giving everyone a tax cut. This will provide $359 billion in help with the cost of living and will return bracket creep where we can do the most good: in Middle Australia. From 1 July this year, the government will reduce the 19 per cent tax rate to 16 per cent, reduce the 32.5 per cent tax rate to 30 per cent, increase the threshold for both—with a 37 per cent tax rate applied from $120,000 to $135,000—and increase the threshold above which the 45 per cent tax rate applies from $180,000 to $190,000. As stated previously, all 13.6 million Australian taxpayers will receive a tax cut from 202425 onwards. The governments tax cuts will lower average tax rates for all taxpayers. That cannot be emphasised enough. That is a really important statement of fact. As a result of the changes, the average taxpayer will pay $21,635 less of their income in tax over the next decade. Under our proposed changes, taxpayers earning less than $45,000 will now receive a tax cut of more than $1,500 a year, which is around $29 a week—more than double what they would have gotten under the coalitions plan. This will help people in jobs that pay less, and it is important to us and the economy. Whether you are working in retail or as a checkout operator, as a pharmacy sales assistant or as a childcare worker, you are deserving of additional help. It will also help to support many of the estimated 22,000 grandparents in Australia that are raising grandchildren, mostly due to some family crisis, conflict, mental illness, substance abuse, homelessness, child abuse, neglect or family violence. These grandparents have stepped in, and our tax cuts will help those grandparents who are trying to juggle that important task, with some using their superannuation to do so. Some are still working part time to supplement their income. For the single mum on a lower income doing the best she can to support her children, every tax dollar saved will count. Cassandra Goldie, the Australian Council of Social Services CEO, said of the stage 3 tax cuts: These tax cuts were always bad policy and so we congratulate the Albanese government for listening to the deep concerns expressed by organisations including ACOSS from the beginning. They have now moved to make these tax cuts fairer to be targeting more of the dollars to people who do need help … That is Cassandra Goldie, and we thank her for that comment. While Australia offers a high quality of life, the costofliving challenges underscore the need for comprehensive and sustainable solutions to ensure economic stability and prosperity for all residents. The Albanese Labor government is providing meaningful costofliving relief in a responsible manner. We are delivering more help for working families and Australians who are under financial pressure by putting cash back into their pockets where they need it most, when they need it most. My community, like many others across the nation, are resourceful, resilient and absolutely deserving of our help. Every taxpayer in Pearce will get a tax cut. In closing, it is also important to note that Treasury has advised that our tax cuts will not add to inflationary pressures, because they are broadly revenue neutral. The most recent inflation figures show welcome moderation. It is still too high, but it is moderating, and Treasury is clear that our tax plan will not impact their forecast for inflation to return to the target band next year. Our tax cuts are about ensuring more workers in Pearce and around the country can keep more of what they earn, because we know that itll help take the pressure off people who are, without doubt, doing it tough. I reiterate the importance of listening and putting people before politics. I commend this bill to the House.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[18]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms ROBERTS (Pearce) ","(12:40):"
70,0,0,0,1,1,"Caldwell, Cameron MP",306489,"Fadden","LNP","N/A",846," I rise today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, and I do this because I want to make a balanced contribution to the debate in this place that so far has been dominated by Labors smoke and spin. Quite frankly, the introduction of this bill embodies the deception thats been on display from this Labor government. The bill before the House signifies the disdain that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have for hardworking Australians. The Labor leadership campaigned on integrity and transparency in 2022, and yet here we are.  The Prime Minister has broken his promise again. The Prime Minister has looked Australians in the eye and knowingly and repeatedly misled them. He promised Australians that they could trust him to keep his promise because, as he said, My word is my bond. If the Prime Minister can mislead Australians so blatantly, how can anyone believe anything he says ever again? This broken promise is about the Prime Ministers political future and not the longterm benefit of Australians. The government asked Treasury to look at options, including revising stage 3, on 11 December. But, following that, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer stated on at least a dozen occasions that they hadnt changed their position on stage 3, including when the Prime Minister said, Were not reconsidering that position. This is a political response from the government, not a costofliving response. Its obvious that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer arent serious about Australias longterm economic prosperity. All they care about is politics, not genuine tax reform and not longterm prosperity. We can see this clearly in the governments words in the last few days. In a trainwreck interview on Monday night the Treasurer confirmed that the government didnt want to wait until after the Dunkley byelection to announce the changes to the stage 3 package. Lets just get this timing straight. The government finished 2023 having lost the Voice referendum that they were so earnestly depending on. Theres a byelection coming up, so what do they do? Lets quickly come up with a sugar hit. Now, I know a thing or two about byelections, and do you know what the difference is between the Fadden byelection and the Dunkley byelection? The Prime Minister made one visit to Fadden and offered no new announcements in July last year. But for Dunkley the polling must be so bad that theyve had to throw out a fiveyear tax plan in order to save the seat. So, again, this morning the Prime Minister is calling on the coalition to vote against his own bill. He really only cares about the political wedge, the shortterm political gain and the tactics. This Albanese Labor government spent all of last year distracted and completely obsessed by its failed $450 million Voice referendum. Meanwhile, Australians are now thousands of dollars worse off as a result of this governments economic mismanagement. Living standards have absolutely collapsed under this government. Net disposable income is down by almost $8,000 annually. The average Australian has seen the money in their pocket simply disappear. And its really bad for mortgage holders. While Australians have spent the past 18 months crying out for help, its apparently only occurred to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer over summer that Australians are in a costofliving crisis. The coalitions position, as it always will be, is that we are committed to lower, simpler and fairer taxes. Thats why ultimately were not going to oppose the reduction of the 19c rate down to 16c. But we remain committed to fighting bracket creep and to supporting aspiration, because strong leaders keep their promises, even when its hard. A future coalition government will deliver lower, simpler and fairer taxes. We will fight bracket creep and enshrine aspiration in our tax system. Well reward hard work and support a strong economy where every Australian can get ahead. Importantly, we will unite rather than divide Australians over how much money they earn, either side of a tax bracket. Our tax reforms will always be fully costed and ready to implement. Most importantly, we will keep our promises. So lets just reexamine whats actually in this bill. Labors bill makes several changes to the already legislated stage 3 tax cuts, with the $18,200 to $45,000 threshold reduced from 19c to 16c. The flat $45,000 to $200,000 threshold that was going to be taxed at 30c is now going to be split in two: $45,000 to $135,000 at 30c and $135,000 to $190,000 at 37c. And now were going to have the top tax threshold kicking in at $190,000. Additionally, there are increases in the Medicare levy lowincome thresholds, in accordance with CPI. While we know that already 1.8 million Australians will be directly worse off as a result of these measures, including almost 10,000 residents in the electorate of Fadden, these numbers will actually swell in coming years. Labors abject failure to address bracket creep will soon see the numbers affected rise to over four million. In addition, there will be budget blows. All of this is happening when Australians are already doing it tough under an incompetent Labor government. Since coming to office, this Prime Minister has made wrong decisions, has been completely distracted and now continues to break promises. The Albanese government has failed to make any real headway in tackling inflation or getting interest rates anywhere near heading back down. Meanwhile, in Labors first 18 months, personal tax receipts have risen by a record 27 per cent. Headline inflation remains more than 1.6 per cent above the midpoint of the RBAs target band. Most concerningly, food, housing, insurance, health and education costs are all growing much faster than the headline inflation rate. Core inflation measures remain higher than the headline rate, and the domestic inflation is a remarkable 5.4 per cent. Out of these tax cuts, an earner on the average $80,000 wage would receive just another $804 more under Labors new policy, or $15.46 a week. Thats less than one per cent of their annual wage and returns just 10c in every dollar of what theyve lost due to costofliving pressures in Labors first 18 months in office. Labors broken promise entrenches bracket creep in our tax system and increases taxes by $28 billion on more than four million Australians. What we actually have is a growing list of broken promises. Before the election the Prime Minister promised a $275 reduction in energy prices, no changes to super taxes, an increase in real wages, no changes to franking credits, cheaper mortgages and no changes to the stage 3 tax cuts. The Prime Minister has broken every single one of these promises. So whats next? The Prime Minister misled Australians and hes broken his promise. The consequence is that Australians quite simply cannot trust a single word that the Prime Minister now says. Australians cannot have confidence that the Prime Minister wont break more promises, and theyre wondering, Whats next? At the same time the Prime Minister promised he wouldnt touch the stage 3 tax cuts, he promised not to change negative gearing and taxes on the family home. But are these just going to be the next broken promises? If the Prime Minister and Treasurer are happy to promise on more than a hundred occasions to keep stage 3 and then just do what theyve done here, what is it that they wont touch? The Prime Minister has been asked a number of times and we never get a straight answer. Is negative gearing next? The Prime Minister has failed to give a straight answer when asked very simply to rule out breaking his promise on negative gearing. The Treasurer was asked on 29 January about plans to make changes to negative gearing, and he said Labor wasnt considering it. Funnily enough, thats what they said that about stage 3 tax cuts. The finance minister, on the Today Show, was asked that same question and said, We have no plans to do that. Thats what they said about stage 3 tax cuts. Does this government seriously expect Australians are going to believe a single word they say? I want to come back to the bracket creep issue. The phone calls Ive been receiving to my office and the people I know that I bump into in the street tell me that they are actually sick and tired of the way that their salaries are being characterised by this government. Is it really the case that someone earning $110,000, $130,000 or $150,000 is somehow rich and should be the target of this class warfare game that this Labor government continues to play? Last year, if you earned $150,000, you paid more than $40,000 in tax. If you earned $50,000, you paid $6,000. The people that have been calling me are the ones that are earning that $110,000, $120,000, $130,000 or $150,000. Its a pretty common bracket of income at the moment for lots of families on the Gold Coast. When youre earning that sort of money, you probably try to buy a home, and so over the last few years youve been absolutely belted by the interest rate rises. You get less childcare subsidy, so it costs more for parents to get back to work. You probably try to get the kids into private school education, so youre forking out each term for that. Youve probably got private health insurance, so out comes another $500 a month on that. And of course you dont have concession cards, and you miss out on every handout thats ever given. Its these people in Australia that dont feel like theyre getting a fair go, and under this tax plan they cant see the fair go coming anywhere in the near future. Im always happy for lower taxes in lower brackets, but what better way to drive aspiration than to say, You know what, it doesnt matter where you land between $45 grand and $200 grand; youll only have to pay 30c on the dollar? That gives a pretty broad range that the Treasurer himself has said was a good way to deal with bracket creep. It was one of the options, but he hasnt taken that option. This government is intent on just the sugar hit, the quick political fix, and is losing the opportunity for longterm reform that would lead to Australians being aspirational. What a wasted opportunity to reform the tax system! Again, this will deliver $15 in 137 days time. The problem for this government is that the bitterness of the broken promise will last long after the sugar hit is forgotten. People around Fadden—in fact, all over Australia—are asking themselves, Is life actually better under this Labor government? Eighteen months ago, things changed. They were supposed to change for the better, but they didnt. Costofliving pressures are biting Australian families, and they dont see a way out. What they really need to be cautious about is this: this Labor government has thrown them in a hole and then waited 18 months to try and give them a hand out of that hole. Australians are rightly suspicious of this Prime Minister and of this Labor government.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[19]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CALDWELL (Fadden) ","(12:40):"
71,0,0,0,1,1,"Vamvakinou, Maria MP","00AMT","Calwell","ALP","N/A",848," Life for people in my electorate has certainly changed for the better since Labor won the election. Therefore, it is with great pleasure that I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, because this is a bill that reflects the Albanese Labor governments commitment to not only making life better and fairer for Australians but also addressing the cost of living and providing costofliving relief for Australians. Australians across the board are experiencing a costofliving crisis, one which is very strongly felt in my own community. My constituents more often are the ones who are doing it the toughest. Theyre also almost always the first to shoulder the brunt of any challenging economic times, and they often endure those challenges for much longer. Thats why I strongly welcome the governments costofliving tax cuts.  These tax cuts provide tangible, real costofliving relief and support to Australians—again, especially to my constituents—while also providing reward right up and down the income scale so that aspiration is indeed rewarded and not thwarted. Every Australian taxpayer—13.6 million people—will receive a tax cut on 1 July under this governments plan, and 84 per cent of taxpayers will receive a bigger tax cut under our plan than under the previous governments plan. In Calwell, where costofliving relief is, as I said, much welcomed in the electorate, every single one of the 72,000 taxpayers will now get a tax cut—a permanent reduction in tax—of an average of $1,300 per annum. Of the 72,000 taxpayers, 64,000 people in my electorate, close to 90 per cent, will receive a bigger tax cut under these measures than they otherwise would have under the previous governments stage 3 tax cut package. This is among the highest proportion of Australians to benefit right across Australia. This legislation means our government will be delivering a bigger tax cut for more people—welcome news for workers and families benefiting from these changes. It will help take some of the pressure off people who are at this very moment struggling and doing it very tough. It will do so while ensuring that, while more people in our community get a bigger tax cut to help with the costofliving pressures, these measures are delivered without adding to inflation and without burdening the budget. The measures will benefit people who, as I said, would have received absolutely no tax cut under the oppositions plans—people in my community who would have been left behind if the opposition had their way. These are culturally and socioeconomically diverse working families already under the pump from the rise in the cost of living, for whom meeting the cost of daytoday living is an ongoing challenge. This Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 puts cash back into their pockets when and where they need it most. Cutting taxes, boosting wages, bringing inflation under control and driving fairer prices for Australian consumers is what this governments economic plan is all about, because tackling costofliving pressures, done fairly and delivered responsibly, is Labors No. 1 priority. In addition, and more importantly, Labors sensible economic management offers our community greater protection against bracket creep, particularly for low and middleincome taxpayers, and supports the progressivity of our tax system. Our relief and reform package means more relief for workers and better reform in our economy, and thats what the changes in this legislation are all about. Calwell reflects modern Australia in all its diversity, and just as Middle Australia is aspirational Australia, so too migrant Australia is aspirational Australia. Focused on building homes, building families and building our economy into the future, my migrant communities carry on the tradition of the great nationbuilding enterprise of the post Second World War migration program, which has seen this country and this countrys economy develop. One of the central things that allows this social and economic reality to play out, which has benefited modern Australia, is the enabling of what we describe as the fair go—a fair go for those who want to live in a society that affords them opportunities and rewards aspiration, a fair go for every worker. The nurses, the teachers and the tradies, who are some of the most likely to benefit, are also professions and trades that were experiencing a high shortage of in this country. These are important skills and professions where this needs to be addressed and the skills need to be encouraged and developed domestically in order for us to fulfil the existing and looming work shortages going forward. A nurse earning $76,000 will get a tax cut of $1,579, and 96 per cent will be better off under Labors plan. And what better way to assist and incentivise to grow our domestic capacity in areas where we have skill shortages? Many young people in my electorate, perhaps inspired by the focus and dedication, importance and value of frontline medical staff during the pandemic, are now considering and taking up careers in nursing. This is an aspiration which we should enable and assist. Making our tax system fairer for these professions will certainly bolster interest and their financial viability and attract young people or even those who may wish to retrain midcareer for another profession. Our tax package also brings a similar attraction to other professions that will now benefit directly from our tax cuts. In that context, I refer to primary school teachers who will benefit. Teachers who are earning $80,000 a year will get a tax cut of $1,679. Truckies who are earning $77,000 a year will get a tax cut of $1,604 per annum. Police officers earning $110,000 will get a tax cut of $2,429 per annum. A shop assistant can expect a tax cut of up to $414 per annum. There are many people—a very large number of people—in my electorate who work in the IT sector. An IT manager on $160,000 per year, for example, can expect a tax cut of $3,729. Many of my emerging communities have come here under the Skilled Migration Program and have chosen to make Australia their permanent home. Many international students who have settled permanently in Australia are also trained in the IT sector. They have chosen to build lives—lives for themselves and their families—here in this country, and they are certainly living in my electorate. They, too, make up the face of Middle Australia, which will benefit from this package. Australian women, on average, will get a tax cut of $1,649 per year. There will be a bigger tax cut under Labors plan, and this puts more money in womens pockets and, just as important, makes it easier for them to pick up extra hours of work, if they want to, as they will keep more of what they earn. This, alongside Labors reforms to close the gender pay gap, support workplace flexibility and security, and rebalance unpaid care work, will help to address workforce participation for women. Women from my emerging refugee communities and my emerging migrant communities deserve the dignity of being paid fairly, of being able to keep more of their takehome pay and of having choices so that they can participate in the workforce and contribute to their families and to their own selfdevelopment. Our modern economy must reflect the reality of our modern society, and our series of action packages, together, responds with this reality in mind and in practice. Whether youre on a low income and working part time or on a medium income, whether youre a couple with a single income earner, a dualincome couple who are both working full time or, indeed, a dualincome couple with one full time and one part time, every Australian will be better off under the tax cuts outlined in this important piece of legislation. Importantly, ours is a government that understands that there is no one silver bullet to tackle the myriad of factors that add to the costofliving pressure ordinary Australians are facing. That is why all the measures in the proposed legislation will build on our $23 billion costofliving relief package, which includes significant support for lowerincome earners, including energy bill relief and increases to income support payments. Its part of our broader plan and economic strategy to provide relief by boosting incomes, reducing costs and putting the budget on a stronger footing. Those opposite consistently show a disconnect from the challenges faced by Australian workers. This disconnect is reflected in their standing against our measures and the actions that we have taken, whether it be on electricity bill relief, making medicines cheaper, cheaper child care, building more social and affordable homes, feefree TAFE or getting wages moving again, including for minimumwage and agedcare workers. They have stood against these measures. That those opposite are standing against these costofliving measures should come as no surprise to anyone. They are simply building on the previous governments record of inaction, which did absolutely nothing to arrest the escalating cost of essential goods and utilities. People in my electorate know and understand the importance of a functioning government. They know that it is critical for government to intervene and put forward policies that reverse negative trends—policies such as increasing the Medicare levy lowincome thresholds to ensure that people on lower incomes continue to pay less or are exempt from the Medicare levy. These have tangible, real takehome pay benefits. These are particularly important for the people of my electorate, because, as I said earlier, the cost of living is a huge concern to my constituents. These measures, along with the range of actions this government is taking to help ease costofliving pressures, is the core business of the Albanese Labor government, and I am very pleased to commend this bill to the House.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[20]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) ","(13:08):"
72,0,0,0,1,1,"Ware, Jenny MP",300123,"Hughes","LP","N/A",850," My word is my bond. So said Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. He looked Australians in the eye and knowingly and repeatedly misled them—about 100 times, in fact. This Prime Minister has committed a breach of trust on a scale not seen since Julia Gillards infamous There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead. And Australians will not forget this.  There are three things I want to say about the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024. No. 1 is that it is a gross breach of trust with the Australian people. Secondly, it leaves out to dry a great majority of Australians, and they are Australians who are earning an income of between $130,000 and $190,000 a year. While these are income levels that are significantly above the national average Australian income level, many of these people reside in my electorate. Indeed, in order to purchase a home in my electorate they need to be on an income of that level. These are the Australians the Prime Minister and the Labor government, those on the other side, have completely let down with this process. Thirdly, the Prime Minister and Treasurer Chalmers have missed an opportunity to deliver and to continue to deliver real tax reform that was started under the former coalition government. Turning to broken promises, if the Prime Minister can mislead Australia so blatantly, how can anyone ever believe anything he says ever again? How can we trust that when he says he will make no changes to negative gearing therell be no changes to the tax treatment of the family home and that he wont jump into bed again with the Greens and look at pursuing some of their tax reform ideas, such as a wealth tax, an inheritance tax? How can Australians ever believe a word the Prime Minister says? This broken promise about the stage 3 tax cuts is about the Prime Ministers political future. Its not about longterm benefits for Australians. Its not about the longterm benefits of reforming our taxation system and bringing about secure and firm economic management. Were now aware that the government asked Treasury to look at options, including revising stage 3, as early as 11 December last year. But, following that, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer continued to state at least a dozen times that they hadnt changed their position on stage 3. And this was legislation that both Anthony Albanese and Treasurer Jim Chalmers both voted for in the previous parliament. If they are so committed to changing their position, why wouldnt they have simply come to Australians and said, Weve changed our mind, and this is why. Instead, My word is my bond continued to be the mantra. So this is nothing but a political response from the government. Its not a proper costofliving response. Its obvious from these changes that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer arent serious about Australias longterm economic prosperity. All they care about is politics, not genuine tax reform and longterm prosperity. We can clearly see that when we also know that the Dunkley byelection is coming up, and the Treasurer of course gave that trainwreck interview on Monday night where he confirmed that the government didnt want to wait until after the Dunkley byelection to announce changes. So these changes have been brought in simply to shore up a byelection and not in the longterm interest of the Australian economy. Remarkably, the Prime Minister this morning was calling on the coalition to vote against his own bill—absolutely remarkable: shortterm political tactics aimed at wedging those of us on this side rather than looking at genuine economic reform. But Australians are smart. Australians can see right through this sort of politicking. Meanwhile, there are thousands of Australians who will now be worse off without the 37c tax rate disappearing from our taxation system. That will be not just in the short term and not just after 1 July but into the future, as we see more and more Australians impacted by bracket creep. Again, this is reflective of this governments economic mismanagement, and weve seen this in the cut to Australians living standards by at least 8.6 per cent. Thats $8,000 a year that Australians used to have that they now dont have—$160 a week. If you have a mortgage, its even worse. Average mortgage holders in Australia are now paying $24,000 to $30,000 more a year than they were under the coalition government. Thats at least $500 per week in takehome pay. This is not sustainable for these people. The average renter is now paying $100 more per week than they were paying under the coalition government. These increases in housing costs are all attributable to economic mismanagement. Its a failure by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to rein in inflation which has led to 12 consecutive interest rate rises. This is what is really impacting Australians with their housing costs. On this side, we have heard Australians in our electorates crying out for help with cost of living for 18 months, yet it only seemed to occur to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer over summer that Australians are in a costofliving crisis. Weve now got the Dunkley byelection coming up so, suddenly, they are masquerading that they are delivering real tax reform. The coalition will be supporting these laws, and thats on the basis that we are committed to lower, simpler and fairer taxes. Thats why we wont oppose the reduction in the 19c tax rate to 16c, for example. Its why in the first place we brought in a suite of tax reforms. We brought in stage 1 and stage 2, which showed our commitment to reducing income tax for Australians on low and middle incomes. Stage 3 was intended then to address those Australians on higher incomes. Many of these Australians are earning between $130,000 and $190,000. While that is an income that is significantly above the average Australian wage of $85,000 per year, these people have been forgotten by this government. Many of these people, in my electorate, for example, need an income of that amount to be able to pay their rent or their mortgage in that electorate. That is the same for many who live in our cities throughout Australia, whether that be in Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane. As we move into the election, the coalition will demonstrate that it is still committed to real tax reform and to real, proper economic management. Well be going to the election with a tax reform package in keeping with these stage 3 tax reforms and more. Thats because they were good reforms. They removed the 37c tax bracket, demonstrating our commitment to fighting bracket creep and enshrining aspiration for Australians. As a matter of fact, these reforms were so good that those on that side voted for them when they came in. Our package, therefore, will deliver lower, simpler and fairer taxes. We will fight bracket creep and enshrine aspiration into our tax system. We will reward hard work and support a strong economy where every Australian can get ahead. We will unite Australians through a tax policy, rather than pitting Australians against each other and trying to bring in the cultural wars and the income wars of the class wars of the past. Our package will be delivered while providing for Australias future security and guaranteeing the essential services that Australians rely upon. Before we go to the election, the package will be fully costed and ready to implement when we are elected. Most importantly, we will keep our promises. Our word will be our bond. When we turn to the provisions of the bill, we see that it makes several changes to the already legislated stage 3 tax cuts, but, in particular, it has not removed the 37c tax rate, which was vital for us to look at addressing longterm bracket creep and to ensure—","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[21]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WARE (Hughes) ","(13:19):"

With the rapid increase in mobile device use over the past two decades, the boundaries between work and the rest of our lives have blurred. Its a problem thats been particularly exacerbated since the pandemic. Noone should feel they need to be available to their boss 24/7. When workers arent able to find time for themselves and those they care for outside of work, it impacts their physical and mental health and relationships with others.  The debate that has engulfed the media in the past week has been inflamed by absurd and untruthful statements from employer groups and conservative politicians trying to paint vital workplace reforms as disastrous for business. The right to disconnect has not come out of the blue as the opposition leader claims. The Greens introduced a private members bill in March last year to make changes to the Fair Work Act. It is grounded in research and based on agreements that are already in place in many Australian workplaces. Its been law in France since 2016 and has been taken up by many countries since then. It is a simple and straightforward right. The right to disconnect will make sure people have access to time with their family and friends. It is not going to destroy the economy as these flops claim.

Its not lost on me that, for some families, our tax cuts mean the difference in whether or not they are able to enrol their children in music or dance lessons or pay registration fees for local sporting clubs. Labors tax cuts support aspiration. Weve always been the party of aspiration, and this is just the latest example of us doing what we can to ensure every family and household in this country is able to pursue opportunities for themselves. Weve always been focused on helping people build a better future for themselves and their families, and Im really proud that on this side of the House were committed to making sure that more people keep the money that they work so hard to earn.","Taxation","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr GARLAND (Chisholm) ","(13:37):"

Recently the Wangaratta and District Mens Shed in my electorate of Indi fell afoul of an online scam, robbing them of $25,000. This was money raised from donations and community events and included grant funding. It was money for muchneeded upgrades and to ensure the mens shed could continue to play its important role in our local community. This was a devastating blow, and I was shocked to learn of it, but unfortunately this story is not uncommon. Scams are a growing and pervasive risk to individuals, businesses and community groups alike. More must be done to address this risk, and I was pleased to meet with the Consumer Action Law Centre last week on exactly this issue.  But Im not going to speak about the scam today. I want to talk about what happened next. Shed members and the local community of Wangaratta have organised a GoFundMe page and will host a community market fundraiser this Sunday, 18 February. This is an opportunity for our dedicated and caring community to show how much they appreciate the mens shed. It will be held from 9 am to 1 pm at Shanley Street, Wangaratta. There will be more than 100 stalls, with delicious food and drinks, and all proceeds will go to the mens shed. I encourage everyone in northeast Victoria to head along to the market in Wangaratta this Sunday. Its for a great cause. Get behind our mens shed, and lets make good of this terrible situation.","Indi Electorate: Wangaratta and District Mens Shed","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[7]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr HAINES (Indi) ","(13:39):"

The cost of living has challenged us all, and our government is delivering more relief, with bigger tax cuts, for Middle Australia, while making our tax system fairer. In my electorate of Pearce, every single taxpayer will receive a tax cut under Labors tax plan. Since the coalitions tax cuts were legislated five years ago, we have experienced a oncein100years pandemic, wars, global conflicts and spikes in high interest rates worldwide. I have not forgotten that the Morrison government was piling Australia in debt, which resulted in our government inheriting nearly a trillion dollars worth of debt. In contrast, we have introduced measures to help our communities, including cheaper child care, cheaper medicines, electricity bill relief, increased rent assistance, more Medicare bulkbilling, feefree TAFE training, building more affordable homes, expanding paid parental leave and getting wages moving again. Labors tax cuts will make a real difference for the 13.6 million taxpayers who will receive a tax cut, 2.9 million more than would have benefited from Scott Morrisons plan from five years ago. So, no matter how hard those members opposite huff and puff, it is clear to all that the Albanese Labor government cares, is listening and is willing to put people before politics to deliver fairer and welldeserved tax cuts to Australian taxpayers when they need it the most.

Deep down, this is probably still the case with those opposite.

I make no apologies for giving our tax plan my fullthroated support at every chance I can get. Those opposite shouldnt be one bit surprised that my electorate of Spence loves Labors tax plans. I know those opposite love it too, because they have already announced that they are going to be voting for it. Low and middleincome Australians are hoping the Liberal and National parties dont give in to their intrusive thoughts as this place gets closer to the finish line on this debate.

As a former business owner who has employed hundreds of people, I can categorically say that these reforms will improve and modernise our labour market. Unfortunately, as part of a scare campaign, the opposition have called these reforms extreme. Looking around the world at how different jurisdictions have responded to the gig economy, its clear that claim is just wrong.  Australias reforms are balanced. Many countries have introduced gig economy laws that are much more interventionist than Australias new laws. Spain introduced the 2021 Rider Law, recategorising all platform workers as employees and completely eliminating that form of work. Canada, the UK and others struck down independent contracts and forced many gig economy workers to be reclassified as dependent contractors. Many countries have gone even further. Countries like Switzerland, Italy and Turkiye have banned platforms like Uber. Looking around the world, its clear that Australias workplace reforms arent extreme by international standards. Theyre sensible. In fact, they are world leading. Australia now has a framework which retains the best of the gig economy, including its flexibility, but also builds in basic protections.

Thats why weve lifted the rate from $120,000 up to $135,000, where the 37 rate kicks in. Thats why weve lifted the top rate from $180,000 to $190,000 as well. I note: its the first increase in the top rate since 2008, when we occupied the Treasury benches as well. It stands in stark contrast to what occurred when those opposite actually put in an increase in the top rate by introducing, without any notice, prior to an election, a socalled deficit levy on higher income earners at the same time as the Leader of the Opposition personally tried to put in a GP tax on every visit to the GP, a tax on everyone who visited a hospital and an increase in the cost of medicines while, at the same time, ripping $50 billion out of the health system. But what we will do is: a shop assistant on $32,000 will get a $414 tax cut, instead of nothing. A nurse on $76,000 will get $1,579. A teacher on $80,000 will get $1,679. A police officer on $110,000 will get $2,429. And an IT manager on $160,000 will get $3,729. These tax cuts will make an enormous difference. And importantly, as well, they wont put pressure on inflation. We want people to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. What they want is for people to work longer for less. Thats the great divide in Australian politics today. This side of the House understands that aspiration is what every Australian family has for themselves and for their kids.","Taxation","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[2]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Prime Minister) ","(14:06):"

What a humiliating capitulation! When the time comes, this side of the House will vote for our tax changes enthusiastically. Those opposite will vote for them reluctantly. We know what they really think about these tax cuts, and thats because the deputy leader was asked if theyd roll them back if they win the election, and she said that was absolutely their position. They have abandoned Middle Australia in opposition, just as they abandoned them in government. The opposition leader wanted to boycott 200,000 Woolies workers. We all remember that. Then they tried to abandon 11½ million workers who will get a bigger tax cut. They dont even pretend to care about the cost of living anymore. If they cared, theyd ask questions about it and theyd vote for it enthusiastically. For the best part of a decade, Middle Australia didnt get a look in.

This government supports strong animal welfare standards. We believe that animals must and should be treated humanely.

But we also know that we are implementing our commitment to phase out live sheep export in a considered and orderly way. That work is important. Its why the phaseout of live sheep export by sea will not occur during this term of parliament. An independent panel was appointed to consult with farming communities to inform when and how to implement this policy and to ensure that that industry continues to derive income from farming in their communities.

142,0,1,0,0,1,"Marles, Richard Donald MP","HWQ","Corio","ALP","N/A",860," I thank the member for her question and acknowledge her service. There are real challenges around recruitment and retention in the Defence Force, which is why this government has been particularly focused on improving the defence offering. We have introduced $50,000 retention bonuses. We have overseen the biggest wage increase for the Defence Force in more than a decade. All of this is now being coordinated at a threestar level by Lieutenant General Natasha Fox, the new chief of personnel. But one of the most important steps that we can take is to deliver a tax cut of every member of the Australian Defence Force, which is what we are doing. The average tax cut across the ADF is more than $2,300, and, when you add that to the wage increase for the average member of the ADF, they are more than $5,000 better off. This is real and practical action which is making a difference. The separation rate is starting to fall and, while its early days, we are beginning to see recruitment numbers turn around.  This action stands in stark contrast to the vaudeville show which was put on display by those opposite over more than a decade. In their final years, the ADF was losing members, when the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Defence. His solution was hoopla. It was to put on a show—a big announcement about increasing the Defence Force by 18½ thousand people, a commitment which was hopelessly underfunded. It was total fantasy, makebelieve money, because they were always about the politics; they were never about the policy. They talked a big game about being the party of defence but their real interest in defence was raising political funds for their party. Recently, weve seen them wandering around saying that, if they were ever asked, they would send ships to the Red Sea, but what has now been revealed is that when they were asked they said no. And the defence of the Leader of the Opposition, when he was the minister, is that he didnt even know a request had been made, which is absolutely astonishing. But, then again, he was always the Minister for Defence Politics, so we probably shouldnt be surprised that defence policy never made it onto his radar. The government which is delivering real tax benefits, which has delivered a budget surplus and which is keeping our nation safe is the Albanese Labor government.","Defence Personnel","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[6]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr MARLES (Corio—Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence) ","(14:19):"

This is helping hardworking health and hospital workers not only earn more but keep more of what they earn.  These bigger, better tax cuts for middle Australia build on a range of other measures weve been putting in place to help with the cost of living, like more support for bulkbilling. When we came to government, bulkbilling—in particular, for GP visits—was in freefall, and that slide can be traced directly back to the Leader of the Oppositions time as the health minister. His first budget glossy as health minister a decade ago said: From 1 July 2015, previously bulkbilled patients can expect to contribute … towards the cost of standard GP consultations and outofhospital pathology and imaging services. That was his plan to abolish bulkbilling altogether, and, when he couldnt get it through the Senate, he instead kicked off a yearslong freeze to the Medicare rebate that literally ripped billions and billions of dollars out of general practice. That is not our plan. For Labor, bulkbilling is the beating heart of Medicare, and thats why in the budget last year we tripled the incentive for bulkbilling, something the GPs college described as a game changer. In the first two months of operation of those new arrangements, Australians have seen more than 360,000 additional free visits to the GP, and no member of this House has promoted those investments more strongly than the member for Bendigo. She has been advertising it widely and talking to every single general practice in her electorate, and her community has reaped the benefits of her hard work, with an eight per cent increase in bulkbilling in just two months. That is 9,000 additional free visits to the general practitioner in just two months, saving hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars in gap fees. John Howard called bulkbilling an absolute rort. The Leader of the Opposition tried to abolish it altogether. But, for Labor, bulkbilling is the beating heart of a strong Medicare.

The Albanese government is, indeed, delivering tax cuts to Australians living in our regions, which is putting more money back into the pockets of regional Australians. In the members own electorate of Hunter that means all 73,000 taxpayers in Hunter will receive, on average, a tax cut of $1,560 on 1 July.  As of 1 July, it will be a good day for taxpayers in the members electorate, but it will also be a good day for taxpayers across all of our regions. In Whitlam, weve got 73,000 taxpayers getting a tax cut, and 87 percent will be getting a bigger tax cut. In Lingiari, weve got 43,000 taxpayers getting a tax cut, and 86 per cent are getting a bigger tax cut under the Albanese Labor governments tax cuts. In the great electorate of EdenMonaro, weve got 75,000 taxpayers getting a tax cut, and 85 per cent are getting a bigger tax cut. And, in Flynn, 66,000 taxpayers are all getting a tax cut, with 82 per cent getting a bigger tax cut. All across regional Australia and indeed across the nation, theres more money going back into the pockets of workers under this government. Were delivering these tax cuts for every Australian to help with the cost of living. That relief is exactly what our tax cuts for Middle Australia are designed to do, without putting pressure on inflation. You might have thought that better tax cuts for Middle Australia and better tax cuts for those who live in the regions would be something where there would be a unity ticket across the parliament. Unfortunately, not everyone shares our view. On this side of the House, we want to make sure that people earn more and get to keep more of what they earn. Those opposite, we know, want people to work longer for less. The Liberal Party, the Leader of the Opposition and the Nationals have made clear that they really do not want these tax cuts for middle Australia. Ive been watching the debate in the parliament, and Ive been listening closely to speaker after speaker on the oppositions side, and they really, really dont want to support this. You can hear that from their speeches and their contributions. The Liberals and Nationals are so addicted to voting against costofliving relief in their own communities they voted against energy relief for working Australians, voted against cheaper child care, voted against cheaper medicines and voted against cheaper health care. They voted against any costofliving measure that this government has put in place, and those in regional Australia deserve much better than that.","Taxation","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[10]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat—Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) ","(14:29):"

The release of these detainees was made as a result of the High Court decision. Thats not reflected in the question.   We have dealt with this matter before. Its not my role to give judgement on whether statements are accurate or not. The minister will be able to refer to whether the question he believes was accurate, or whether he has a view, or any minister has a view, on the accuracy of the statement made. While I appreciate the member for Warringahs point, these sorts of questions have been asked for some time, and it was dealt with last year as well. On the point of order, the member for Warringah? Ms Steggall: I appreciate that. I just want to clarify that, in the standing orders, 100(d)(iii) and 100(d)(iv) specifically refer to the fact that questions must not contain inferences or imputations. Is it the chairs ruling that there are no inferences or imputations in that question?  Its a statement by the member asking the question about their interpretation and view. The minister in his or her response may be able to deal with that inference in the question. The minister for each question has been dealing with that, and Im allowing him to address the question. But Im simply not in a state to adjudicate on every single statement by every single member on whether I believe its accurate or not. The person answering the question shall deal with that. On the point of order? Ms Steggall: In that case there is no point in having that section in the standing orders. It is there for a reason. In that section, if I could just point out, Rules for questions, 100(d)(iii) and 100(d)(iv)—Id invite members to read the standing orders—it is clear that it is intended that inferences and imputations should not be included in questions. Its not a question of ruling whether or not one accepts that theyre there; the standing orders make clear that they must not contain. Its not a question of saying whether the chair feels that there is a negative imputation. The standing orders are clear. So, Im just raising the question of the standing orders.  I appreciate the members interest and I appreciate her raising the point of order. The difficulty for me as chair is that I would start ruling out nearly every question if that was the case. We did have a similar issue raised by a question yesterday on the crossbench. As someone who tries to allow as many questions as possible on behalf of the constituents they represent, I agree that it does place me in a difficult position.

The reaction is there straightaway.  But those opposite, in contrast to the member for Moreton, try as hard as they can to never commit to anything. It took Andrew Clennell on Sky News to finally get the Leader of the Opposition to make a commitment on workplace relations, where he committed straightaway in saying he wanted to make sure people would be able to work longer for less. Thats the one principle he was willing to defend straightaway. Within about an hour, the shadow Treasurer said that they would have a targeted package of appeals. Well, looking at the measures that have been passed since we came to government, which ones do they intend to target? Will they target minimum standards for gig workers? Will they target minimum standards in road transport? Will they target job security for casuals? Will they target wage theft being a crime? Will they target the banning of pay secrecy clauses? Or will they target the sunsetting of zombie agreements? On those zombie agreements weve recently had a window into exactly how bad they have been for workers, if you look at some of the franchises in Queensland, such as Hogs Breath cafe. Until this year, until laws were passed which those opposite opposed, people working for those Hogs Breath cafe franchises in parts of Queensland were on agreements that dated back to 2005. For context, that means that an 18yearold waiter at Hogs Breath had wages and conditions that were set in an agreement registered before they were born. Under these agreements there were no penalty rates, no overtime, no leave loading and a lower casual loading. And it was calculated that they were, on average, $59 a week worse off. Because of the change of government, because of the governments policies, which those opposite opposed, those workers now are paid that $59 again. They are also covered by an award where they now earn $100 a week more under this government. And, thanks to this government, those same workers will now also be eligible for a tax cut of more than $1,050. Fiftynine dollars through the IR changes, $100 through our approach to the annual wage review and more than $1,000 a year in tax cuts—all policies supported by us over here that just make those opposite angry.

Of course, we knew that before we came to government. Thats why the Prime Minister pledged to take action to relieve costofliving pressures for families in Australia. Thats why, in government, were not just talking about costofliving pressures; were taking action to deliver costofliving relief. Thats why we delivered cheaper child care for more than a million families across Australia, including, I might say, 6,800 families in the member for Hawkes electorate.  Im pleased to report that the ACCC review confirmed that our Cheaper Child Care reforms reduce outofpocket costs for families for centre based care by an average of 11 per cent. According to the ACCC report, a family earning $80,000 with a child in care for three days a week will have saved $1,351.80 in early childhood learning fees. And were building on that. Were delivering more costofliving relief through our better tax cuts for every Australian, including families. Under our plan, someone earning $80,000 will get a tax cut of $1,679. Thats over $3,000 a year —real money going back into the pockets of middle Australians in the suburbs, in the bush, in the city and in the regions. Its for all Australians, and thats on top of other measures: cheaper medicines, feefree TAFE, energy bill relief—all part of our comprehensive plan to tackle costofliving pressures whilst balancing downward pressure on inflation.

I agree that Professors Sims and Garnaut are very distinguished economists and very distinguished thinkers. They are wellmotivated and wellinformed contributors to this debate—as well, I might say, as is the member for Mackellar herself. We share the objective of a future increasingly powered by cleaner, cheaper and more renewable energy into the future because this side of the House believes in the vast industrial and economic opportunities of the net zero economy.  Where we differ from the distinguished thinkers at the Press Club today is that we are not up for the levy that Professor Sims and Professor Garnaut proposed at the Press Club today. Part of the reason for that is that weve found a better way—or at least an alternative way, but we feel its a better way—to implement what is already a comprehensive and ambitious agenda when it comes to clean energy, when it comes to climate change and when it comes to those industrial opportunities from becoming a renewable energy superpower. Here I want to pay tribute to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy for his work in his portfolio. I also want to say, as the environment minister implied a moment ago, he works closely with the Prime Minister, with the Minister for the Environment and Water, with the Minister for Industry and Science, with the Minister for Resources and with others to make sure that we grasp the opportunities of the net zero economy. Our plan includes lifting our countrys emission reduction targets from 26 per cent to 43 per cent. Weve enshrined those targets and our net zero objective in law, which sends a message to renewable energy investors around the world that Australia has changed and is open to welcoming more investment in clean energy on our shores. On top of those targets, weve got the safeguard mechanism. Weve given it teeth. Weve got the Capacity Investment Scheme. Weve got $20 billion for transmission via Rewiring the Nation. Weve got the $2 billion in Hydrogen Headstart. Weve got a whole range and a whole raft of policies when it comes to climate change and energy. These policies are already accounted for in the budget. Our policy suite is already helping to drive down emissions and support jobs across the economy, including in the industrial and energy sector.

We know how vital our tradies are going to be to building the homes that the country needs. Indeed, theyre essential for our governments ambitious housing agenda. Thats why Labor is ensuring that all of our tradies are going to get a tax cut. Labors tax cuts will let our hardworking tradies keep more of what they earn. Those opposite want people to work for longer, for less, but we want tax cuts for our tradies—for our sparkies, for our chippies. For most tradies, theyll be getting a bigger tax cut under Labor than under the plan of those opposite. Its important, particularly, for apprentices in the housing sector. We all know we need more tradies to get our houses up. For an apprentice on the average taxable income of $40,000, theyll be getting a tax cut of $654. Under the coalitions plan, of course, theyd be getting absolutely zero, nothing. Our tradies, particularly the apprentice tradies, need this tax cut for their cost of living. We want to support our tradies. Thats why were making sure our tradies are all getting a tax cut. As I said earlier in the week, a sparky on an average taxable income of $101,000 will be getting a tax cut of $2,262. A plumber on an average taxable income of $79,000 will be getting a tax cut of $1,730. A carpenter on an average taxable income of $72,000 will be getting a tax cut of $1,563. Our tradies are getting larger tax cuts under Labors plan because we want to make sure our tradies are there to deliver on our housing agenda. We need our tradies to clean up the mess that weve been left in the housing sector by those opposite. We have serious housing challenges in our country, and those opposite have done nothing about supporting what were trying to do to address them. Weve already supported 4,937 homes through Housing Australia since we came to office, and well have thousands more, with applications currently open for the first round of the Housing Australia Future Fund and the National Housing Accord. And, of course, weve got 4,000 new social homes coming from the Social Housing Accelerator. Since we came to office, we have committed $25 billion in new housing funding over the next decade because we want to turn around this housing challenge. We know those opposite have been all over the place. They know theyre not supporting our tradies who need a tax cut.

There are also cooks, kitchen hands and cleaners that keep the great wealthcreating industry of this country running. I know none of you opposite have ever run into any of them, but we do. On any given mine in this country, cooks on an average income of $89,000 will get a tax cut of over $1,900. Kitchen hands on an average income of $80,000 will get a tax cut of over $1,600. And cleaners, the cleaners that keep these mines going and keep workers happy, on an average income of $75,000, will get a tax cut of over $1,500. Under Labor, resources workers earn more and resources workers will keep more of what they earn.","Taxation","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[5]/answer/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

249,0,1,0,0,1,"Jones, Stephen MP","A9B","Whitlam","ALP","N/A",869," I thank the amazing member for Swan for this question. I remember fondly the meeting that we had in her electorate. I think it was in Forrestfield. There were hundreds of people there very engaged in the issue. Ive got to say, Member for Swan, the interest youve shown in this issue is in complete contrast to those opposite. Its been over nine months since theyve had a shadow spokesperson for consumer affairs or financial services. We can only draw the conclusion that the Leader of the Opposition thinks theres nobody on that side whos good enough to do the job.  If you want to be a party that represents and aspires to represent the interests of Middle Australia, you want to ensure that Middle Australian are earning more, keeping more of what they earn and keeping their money safe. Our scams agenda is about ensuring that we keep Australians money safe, particularly in the area of investment scams. Its a big job to do. Because of the complete indifference and indolence of the member for Deakin when he had my job, scams were growing at $3 billion a year. They doubled, then they doubled again, and they were on course to double by another $3 billion. Im pleased to inform members of the House that we have arrested that growth because of the comprehensive policy weve put in place. Its a team job between myself, the Minister for Communications and the Minister for Home Affairs working comprehensively across the economy. It is important that we ensure that scammers know were taking them on. Phase 1 is already in place. The National AntiScam Centre is already up and running; ASIC has been funded to pull down fake investment websites; and the work that the Minister for Communications is doing is blocking over a million SMS scams going through each month. Its sensational work. Theres more work to come. Phase 2 is already underway, and this is about ensuring that new codes of practice are in place to ensure tougher obligations on banks, on telecommunications companies and on social media platforms as well. We also want to ensure that Australians get access to affordable, qualified and helpful advice. Thats why were putting in place reforms in the area of financial advice—to ensure that Australians can get access to qualified advice instead of having to go to Instagram, TikTok or Facebook, which is what they were doing under those opposite.","Banking and Financial Services","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[7]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JONES (Whitlam—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services) ","(15:09):"

Australians are poorer after 20 months of a Labor government, and what weve just seen here—with a very selfsatisfied Treasurer coming in here with his grin and a Prime Minister looking very happy with himself—is that clearly they are disconnected from the pain being felt by households throughout this country. Its not often that, after nearly two years of a new government, anyone has been able to stand up and say that people in Australia are now poorer than they were when the Labor Party came to government.  The average household in this country has seen a loss of $8,000. That is the average household. It doesnt include households with a mortgage, and we know that if youve got a mortgage its well above $20,000—$24,000, in fact, for an Australian family with an average mortgage. Thats how much they are worse off after two years of a Labor government. Food is up by nearly 10 per cent. Housing, with this hapless housing minister with no idea, is up by 12 per cent. Electricity is up by 20 per cent. Insurance is up by 22 per cent. Itll be very interesting to see the next quarters ABS data as Australians start seeing their insurance notices coming through. And, of course, gas is up by 27 per cent. Lets touch on a couple of those. Electricity is up by 20 per cent and gas is up by 27 per cent, but this Prime Minister, whom the truth is not known to, said on 97 occasions before the election that energy prices for the average house would be down by $275 a year. He said it on 97 occasions. How many times has he said it since the election?","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SUKKAR (Deakin) ","(15:14):"

269,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation",242515,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr SUKKAR: Not 95, no. He has not said it at all. Hes not dared repeat his promise that he made to the Australian people of a $275 reduction in power prices. We know that the truth is not something that the Prime Minister is particularly familiar with, particularly as we see his recent breaking of faith with the Australian people, but he did say before the election—and we saw the headlines—Life will be easier under me. Life will be easier under me, was the catchcry from the Prime Minister. Does any Australian, other than perhaps a union official, believe that life is better for them after 20 months of a Labor government? The statistics prove that that is not the case.  We now have a huge admission—a massive admission—from the government of the disaster that has befallen the Australian community. Today we see a very belated—and only once they were forced into it—announcement of $14.4 million of additional funding for food relief agencies. We welcome that very belated commitment. But, if things are going so well in this country, as the Treasurer sits there with his supercilious smile and the Prime Minister laughs all through question time, why on earth are our food banks around the country busting at the seams? Every single person in this place knows that, in their own communities, our food banks are seeing families and individuals whom they have never seen before. Theyre seeing people with fulltime jobs. Theyre seeing twoparent working families who are only able to make ends meet if they come to their food bank. So, on one hand, if you look at the scoreboard and the results of 20 months of a Labor government, weve got food banks bursting at the seams—and we say thank you for this very belated and latecoming $14.4 million commitment. But, interestingly, on the same day that we see a $14.4 million commitment to food relief—which, lets be frank, wont even touch the sides for our food banks around the country—we see another commitment from this government, which highlights where its priorities are at. Last night in Senate estimates the finance minister confirmed that the government are going to spend $40 million advertising their broken promise on stage 3 tax cuts. That is $40 million for an advertising campaign and $14 million for our food banks busting at the seams around this country; $40 million for highend political consultants and advertising agency types to put an advertising campaign and $14 million for food banks. That says everything you need to know about the modern Labor Party, everything you need to know about how disconnected they are from the communities in which we all serve. On this side of the House we are the true representative of working and Middle Australia. We are the people who truly stand up for the people who those opposite have crushed over 20 months. It goes further. The people who are being crushed by this government, sadly, are anybody renting, anybody trying to save for a home, anybody, frankly, who is trying to put a roof over their head, and what do we have? We have a socalled housing minister who has no idea what she is doing and clearly does not have any sway within that caucus, because we have record low vacancy rates, we have housing approvals at lows we have not seen for 20 years, we have first home buyers at their lowest levels since the Gillard government and we have fewer homes being built than we can remember. At that time, with that suite of statistics, we saw the Labor government bring in 520,000 migrants in the last calendar year, with absolutely no idea where those people are going to live. So what do the government do? The government come out and says, Well, were going to commit to a housing target of 1.2 million homes over the next five years, starting from 1 July this year—so two years after we have been in government we will make a commitment. What did we see this week? We saw the HIA, the MBA blow the lid on this 1.2 million homes. What did we hear? We heard the Labor government will only miss it by 400,000—only 400,000! That is 400,000 homes short, based on approval data that we have seen today. So that is not missing it by this much. A 1.2 million home commitment is going to be missed by 400,000 and guess what happens during that same period? We ramp up migration—1.5 million migrants over five years. How on earth can you, in good conscience, bring in 1.5 million migrants with no idea of where they are going to live, which will drive up housing costs for Australian throughout this country? We believe, on this side of the House, that Australia should never get to a point where young hardworking Australians do not have a realistic prospect of owning their own home. We know the government has waved the white flag. The government wants foreign corporates, foreign multinationals, owning our housing stock and how do we know that? Because they have just given a big tax cut through their buildtorent tax cuts to foreign funds to own homes in Australia. It will be very ironic if we have given a tax cut to foreign corporates to build homes in Australia but seek to smash mumanddad investors by abolishing negative gearing. Lets be frank, we know that is what they are going to do. Just as those opposite said on hundreds of occasions we have no plans to change stage 3, we have not considered it, we have no plans, we have not modelled it, we will hear the same denials in coming months. We will hear the same denials from the Prime Minister. We will hear, We have no plan to change negative gearing, from the Prime Minister. The irony will be that on the one hand we smash mum and dads who want to get a leg up, who want to build for their retirement and on the other hand we will give a tax cut to foreign corporates to own thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of homes in this country. The government have failed on every measure, and shame on them for walking into this chamber looking so satisfied with themselves while the people of this country, including the people in the gallery, are doing it so tough.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[7]","N/A","N/A"

We know that many Australians are doing it tough right now and families are under the pump. Thats why weve introduced a suite of costofliving measures, from feefree TAFE to tripling the bulkbilling incentive and, most recently, our historic tax reform, which will deliver a tax cut to every Australian taxpayer.

277,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation",248353,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Ms McBRIDE: They dont mean it.  Those opposite dont even pretend to care about the cost of living anymore. All 13.6 million Australian taxpayers will be receiving a tax cut come 1 July under Labors tax reforms, which deliver a bigger tax cut to Middle Australia to help with the cost of living. Under our plan, 11.5 million people will get a bigger tax cut than they would have under Scott Morrisons legislated stage 3 tax cuts. Thats 84 per cent of taxpayers. Looking locally, in my electorate on the Central Coast of New South Wales its even higher. Eightyeight per cent of taxpayers in Dobell will be better off under Labors plan than under that of those opposite. Who are the biggest beneficiaries of these tax reforms? They are the nurses I worked with at Wyong Hospital, the teachers at Toukley Public School and the retail workers at Woolworths. As the Prime Minister said, its not the job of a leader to sit back and wring their hands when confronted with new challenges. Its their job to act, to take responsibility, to do the right thing. Thats exactly what were doing. We want people to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. Take agedcare worker Kylie, who recently received a 15 per cent pay rise and has just purchased her first home. She will now be receiving a tax cut. Take Julie from RFBI in Lake Haven, or Tracey, a single parent and personal care worker. They were on the front line of the global pandemic and they deserve more than thanks; they deserve proper costofliving relief. The agedcare sector was completely neglected by those opposite for a decade, and now those agedcare workers, who support our loved ones, are receiving the investment and support to care for others that they rightly deserve under our government and Minister Wells. Since the stage 3 tax cuts were legislated by Scott Morrison five years ago, there has been a onein100year global pandemic. There have been wars, conflict, a global inflation spike and higher interest rates. These events have put people under greater costofliving pressure. As the Prime Minister has said, its our job as a government, when global economic circumstances change, to change the support that we can provide Australians. While were focused on supporting Australians, the opposition have tied themselves in knots over whether to support Labors tax cuts. The opposition were on the front foot in coming out against our tax reforms. Everyone remembers the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying: We will fight this legislation in the parliament. We dont even know what it will look like. When you think about it, Madam Deputy Speaker, this is their instinct on everything. Another key element of our governments costofliving relief is feefree TAFE. I know that in my community on the Central Coast—and I know Dr Reid, the member for Robertson, will absolutely agree—so many people have benefited from feefree TAFE. Last year more than 300,000 people undertook a course through the program. I had the privilege of inviting the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister Marles, to Ourimbah campus to meet many of the people who are benefiting from feefree TAFE—people starting out in work, people changing careers or people getting the skills they need for more secure work. That is real costofliving relief, and the success of this program in setting people up for work has led our government to commit to a further 300,000 places this year. For workers in areas from hairdressing to plumbing, our government is supporting people to upskill at no cost, helping them into the workforce, into more secure work and better pay. Just this week the House passed the second part of our governments closing loopholes legislation, after the first half passed the parliament late last year. This legislation delivers muchneeded protections and a minimum wage for gig workers, who often work extended hours for minimal pay just to make ends meet. Unsurprisingly, because the legislation made others better off, those opposite fought it every step of the way while being happy to order Uber Eats or Deliveroo. Our government wants all workers to be better off, and this legislation means that gig workers arent left behind—workers too often forgotten, left behind by the former government unless they were ordering Menulog. In my area of responsibility, working with Minister Butler in health, this is particularly important in the discussion about the cost of living. As everybody knows, health outcomes, our health and wellbeing, arent just a result of access to clinical care—although this access is critical, and I will come to that; financial insecurity itself is an important driver of physical and mental ill health. Its no secret that the social grading in this country gives a pretty good proxy for health outcomes. You can map it geographically, too. Equally, in mental health, when youre under financial strain, youre more likely to experience distress. This is why the Albanese government is so deeply focused on costofliving relief across all arms of government. Its a genuine wholeofgovernment approach to reduce the drivers to stress, to boost protective factors for all Australians. Its why were getting on with record investment in health to unwind some of the damage those opposite did. And were strengthening Medicare so that all Australians can access and, importantly, afford quality health care closer to home. Nowhere is this more the case that in bulkbilling. There is a sharp contrast here. As health minister, Peter Dutton tried to establish a GP tax. When the Senate blocked that, he froze Medicare rebates for six long years. As we said in question time today, he was voted the worst Australian health minister. That demonstrated to GPs what he thought of their profession and to every patient what he thought about their right to care. Those opposite dont see it as a right at all. Thats the truth of the matter. In contrast, under Labor we have brought bulkbilling back to be the absolute beating heart of Medicare. In the two short months since the tripling of the bulkbilling GP incentive, weve stopped the absolute freefall that was happening under the former government and weve seen a big increase in the number of Australians getting their GP appointment for free. It is estimated that some 360,000 additional GP consults were bulkbilled in the first two months of this policy, saving Australians some $15 million in gap fees—$15 million! I see the member for Deakin, who was so concerned about the cost of living, during his bluster and bluffing earlier, has now left the chamber.

The member for Deakin might be pleased to know that his constituents saved some $76,000 in that period. I encourage him to go out there and to recognise and acknowledge the doctors that have moved back to bulkbilling or mixed billing in response to the governments policy change. If not, Im happy to go and do it for him.  I am delighted to properly acknowledge and recognise every GP around Australia who has responded to a government which genuinely values their time, their skills and their expertise by bulkbilling or mixed billing again. In my electorate of Dobell, our bulkbilling rate has risen by 5.5 per cent in just two months—5.5 per cent. And do you know who benefits most? Aged pensioners, families with young children, people on low and fixed incomes—those who need it most. Thats what Labor governments do. This is a targeted costofliving relief for people under pressure which doesnt put pressure on inflation but makes a real difference to the weekly household budget in every community right around the country. It represents a major strengthening of Medicare from the only party who will truly fight for every Australians right to quality health care. Before Medicare was introduced, the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in Australia was unpaid healthcare bills. That was the leading cause. Its still the case in the United States, despite Obamacare. One in seven Australians didnt have any health cover. That shows you why its so important to rescue and revive Medicare, and were doing that by tripling the bulkbilling incentive. It represents a major strengthening of Medicare and genuine universal access for all Australians, wherever they live. In finishing, in addition to 360,000 bulkbilled GP appointments, Australian people have also benefited through more than 160,000 presentations to Medicare urgentcare clinics. Just recently, the Prime Minister joined the member for Robertson, Doctor Reid, and I at the urgentcare clinic in Umina, where more than 1,200 patients benefited in the weeks it had been open. This is costofliving relief.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[18]","N/A","N/A"

But, as usual, it doesnt deal with the fundamental issues facing the Australian people. As I said in this place earlier today, the government can wax lyrical all it likes about $15 a week on average for workers across Australia. By the time we get to 1 July, those people will hardly notice that change in their takehome pay, because the multitude of other issues facing the Australian economy are not being dealt with by this government. In effect, in many cases, this government is assisting to make it worse. Lets look at some of the figures to date. Food is up over nine per cent. Housing is up over 12 per cent. Electricity is up over 20 per cent. Insurance premiums are up over 22 per cent. Gas is up over 27 per cent.

But we have seen, over the 18 or 20 months of this government so far, the amount of personal income tax collected by this government grow by 27 per cent. That has been in large part driven by the removal of the low and middleincome tax offset. While theyre talking about 15 bucks a week over there, theyve forgotten to mention they took away the low and middleincome tax offset. Real net disposable income per person has fallen by some 8.6 per cent. On average, that represents a $150 a week fall in real, net disposable income. The tradeoff the government is waxing lyrical about is, Oh, well, your position is $150 a week worse off, so well give you 15 bucks a week back. Wow! Thats very generous! Its extraordinarily generous of those opposite to make people $150 a week worse off and give back $15.  As Ive said many times in this place—and we can go through the long list of broken promises by this government—never listen to what the Labor Party say; look at what they do. Nine times out of 10, they are two completely and utterly different things, and the second one will always make you worse off. Weve seen people in real terms about $8,000 a year worse off. But thats before we get to mortgage payments. Theyre paying on average an extra $24,000 a year in interest out of aftertax income. That doesnt include the capital payments on top of that. So, if we think that, on average, people are $32,000 a year worse off in total—$600 a week—and those opposite, out of the generosity of their heart, are giving people an extra $15 a week, then: wow. I think thats an extraordinary amount of hubris on their part, to say, Well, look how good we are, giving you $15 a week, when in real terms youre actually $600 a week worse off per year. Its a disgrace. And the government has no answers to this problem. They havent had any for 18 months.

They keep bandying around a 20 per cent increase. It was a 0.4 per cent increase. In fact, wholesale prices have halved, and that will start to flow on, as we committed to.  To higher income support payments—a great costofliving measure—they said no. The biggest boost to rent assistance in 30 years: they said no. Expanding paid parental leave: they opposed that. Making child care cheaper: they opposed that. Free TAFE, with 300,000 people getting the benefit—they opposed it. Weve strengthened Medicare and rolled out cheaper medicines for Australians—something the coalition voted against. So, we have the member for Dickson saying one thing—hes supposed to be the champion of the workers—but doing something completely different when it comes to the cost of living. It reminds me of Elton John. Now, Im not comparing the Leader of the Opposition to Elton John in terms of being incredibly talented and wearing big glasses or anything like that. But it does remind me—and because its Valentines Day I thought Id touch on this, change the tone a bit and talk about that song by Elton John, which many of us saw in Rocketman: Dont Go Breaking My Heart. There was that duet he did with Kiki Dee in 1976, and it was No. 1 around the world, back when I was in grade 6. Dont Go Breaking My Heart has incredible harmonies—and harmony obviously isnt something Id associate the member for Dickson with. But this is what Elton John and Kiki Dee sing. They say: Right from the start I gave you my heart Oh, I gave you my heart Dont go breaking my heart I wont go breaking your heart We know that when Elton John said that to Kiki Dee he didnt actually mean it, did he? They were beautiful words, but he didnt mean, You will never break my heart, Kiki Dee, and Kiki Dee knew that, because they were just singing a duet together; theyre professional singers. In fact, 40 years ago today Elton John married Renate, on 14 February 1984 at St Marks Church at Darling Point in Sydney. As Elton John later said of Renate: She was the classiest woman Ive ever met, but it wasnt meant to be. I was living a lie. And the Leader of the Opposition gets to go to the people of Australia and ask, Do you want to be Kiki Dee, or do you want to be Renate? They get to make a choice. The member for Dickson cant sing and he cant play the piano, but we do know that we cant believe his words. So my advice to the people of Australia is, when it comes to the member for Dickson, be a lot more like Kiki Dee, not Renate, because thats not going to work out. Its going to end up being a sham, and youll end up in a marriage you dont want to be in. Okay? And therell be secrecy clauses and all that sort of thing. My advice to the people of Australia is to look for someone you can sing with in harmony—and thats the Leader of the Labor Party, Anthony Albanese.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"
288,0,0,0,1,1,"Birrell, Sam MP",288713,"Nicholls","NATS","N/A",881," We know that, when it comes to positive economic policy development, the member for Moreton and the Labor Party are too low for zero. Deputy Speaker, do you remember that supermarket advertising jingle, Down, down? You had people jumping around and singing to a not very good jingle, Down, down, and you had the red arrows going down, down? If theres any integrity in electoral advertising at the next election, the Labor Partys posters should all be Up, up because thats whats happened to costs since the Labor Party came to office. As the member for Forde reminded us, food is up nine per cent, housing is up 12 per cent, electricity is up 20 per cent, insurance is up 22 per cent and gas is up 27 per cent. Its all just going up, up, and I look forward to seeing posters with arrows pointing to the sky.  Ill tell you one thing that is down, and thats net disposable income, particularly in Victoria. Not only are Victorians suffering from inflation because of the irresponsible economic management of the federal Labor government; theyre being hit with all sorts of taxes by the state Victorian government. Consequently—and I think a year 8 economics student would have been able to work this out—they dont spend as much as they used to. If they dont spend as much as they used to, the economy slows, and people are at risk of losing their jobs. Weve got inflation problems. Weve got stubbornly high inflation. Every time we ask the government about inflation or they talk about inflation, they say: Were doing things to get it under control. Were addressing inflation. What causes inflation? Excessive and wasteful government spending causes inflation. We saw a lot of that during the RuddGillard years. I spoke about that when I was talking about some of the ripoffs in vocational education training and the RTOs that ran rampant during those years. Were seeing wasteful government spending again. Even worse than that are taxes on productivity. We seem to be having a debate about how much stuff the federal government can give to people. Im not averse to the federal government helping people out, but surely we should be having a discussion about productivity and growing the economy and making sure that weve got profitable, competitive, productive businesses, because that will get inflation down and thatll mean real wage rises for people. Ill give you some examples in an area Im very passionate about, which is agriculture. Everyones affected by agriculture, because, as I said, food prices are going up. The way to bring food prices down is to give agriculturalists and farmers the tools they need to increase productivity, profitability and efficiency in their business. The government is taking a lot of those tools away. The PALM scheme is no longer workable for many people in horticulture. The ripping out of extra irrigation water from the MurrayDarling Basin means that investment in agriculture is threatened because people dont know whether their water costs are going to be so high that its not worth growing stuff. These things affect our economy and they affect the prices people pay when they go into the supermarket. The government is very excited during question time for members to get up and ask ministers questions like: In your portfolio, whats the tax cut going to mean? Whats $15 a week going to do? Well, it is not going to do much compared to how much they have already been smashed under the costofliving increases since the Albanese government came to office. The previous government had a scheme called the low and middleincome tax offset. That could have been extended.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BIRRELL (Nicholls—Deputy Nationals Whip) ","(15:45):"

292,0,0,0,1,1,"Mulino, Daniel MP",132880,"Fraser","ALP","N/A",882," I believe I can say with some accuracy—and I do not mean to belabour this analogy—I am the only person in this chamber to be directly named after an Elton John song, the 1973 hit which inspired my mother to call me Daniel. I cite from that song its important refrain, Daniel, you are a star. As the Speaker said, I am not here to comment on the accuracy of the statement; I just put it to the chamber and the chamber can do with it what it wishes.  On the cost of living, those opposite have come into this chamber and given us a long list of things which are increasing in price. What they havent given us a long list of is their ideas for dealing with it or the things that we have put forward which they have been willing to vote for. It is all well and good to say that they feel the pain of the Australian people, but they have not actually put anything constructive on the table in the last 18 months. In fact, at every opportunity, they have stood in the way of the government putting forward its plan. I want to start with one of the most important areas of this governments action, one of the first things we did, which was increasing wages. We did that in a number of ways. Firstly, we took action on the minimum wage. We made a representation to the Fair Work Commission, and the minimum wage was increased by $1 an hour. Those opposite said that would wreck the economy. There were also 15 per cent increases in the agedcare award. There have been tranches of IR reform. At every step of the way, those opposite have opposed those measures to increase peoples wages, yet that is one of the most powerful ways to help people deal with the cost of living. The member for Deakin said that we should acknowledge that in fact they are the true representatives of the workers. After all those steps, Im not quite sure how, but I dont think they are the true representatives of the workers; I think they really are the true heroes of the workers! Theyre saving workers the burden of having to deal with all the complexity of thinking about how to allocate more household resources to different things, how to deal with the burden of so many more financial resources and how to deal with the guilt of having wrecked the economy through their wages and conditions improving a little! But, no, they are not the true representatives of workers. When it comes to the most basic of things, when it comes to workers pay and conditions, those opposite have stood in the way at every single step. Secondly, lets look at our first two budgets. I wont be able to go through all of the measures, but there is measure after measure, whether it be rent assistance, cheaper child care, energy bill relief—speakers on this side have run through all of the various measures, critical measures, that deal with some of the biggest pressures that households are facing. These are measures that make concrete differences to the lives of people, which matter around the kitchen table every morning. Again, on so many of these measures, those opposite stood in the way; those opposite voted against them. I might just add we have put in place all of these measures totalling over $20 billion in a way which is responsible in its budgeting, which means that fiscal policy has been set in such a way that it is aligned with monetary policy, so we have had targeted measures that help those who need the assistance the most but we have done it in a way which has seen inflation continue its downward trajectory. Thirdly, I want to touch briefly on the issue that has taken up so much time in this chamber this week, which is the amendments to the stage 3 tax cuts. What we have learned from Treasury is that over recent months it has become clear that inflation is not falling evenly across households. We have seen that, across household income deciles, the lowest decile is dissaving at a very high rate. Moreover, increases in prices are falling unevenly across cohorts, and workers are facing increases in prices two percentage points or more greater than other cohorts. What we were faced with was the original Morrison stage 3 tax cuts—legislated in a bygone era, when times were totally different—that would have given millions of households earning $18,000 to $45,000 absolutely nothing, when the Treasury modelling showed that that was a cohort facing more of the burden of price increases than other cohorts. Clearly the community wanted us to change those tax cuts so that they fell in a more appropriate way, in a more just way and in a more economically sensible way. They are also going to fall in a way which deals with bracket creep and which encourages labour supply. But, again, those opposite have in this case a completely incoherent position. Their deputy leader stridently opposes the tax cuts, but all of the rest of them seem to come in here and deliver speeches where for 14 minutes and 30 seconds they kind of oppose them, and then for 30 seconds they say, I dont want to, but I am going to vote for them because people need them after all. When it comes to any actual measures, those opposite either havent come up with any ideas or oppose anything useful that has come into this place.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr MULINO (Fraser) ","(15:50):"

But the member for Fraser has just summed up very well with statistics—as he does, as a wellrenowned economist—how Australians are struggling. I commend him on that. What he didnt talk about was the mistake after mistake that the Albanese government have made that have led to this. But I will talk a little bit about the member for Moreton, because the song he so beautifully deconstructed for us was about trust and integrity. I thought, Wow, thats a brave place to go, given your Prime Minister misled the Australian people over 100 times.  Lets look through whats happened in the last 20 months since the Prime Minister made a few comments. Lets be really clear. The quotes Im about to provide from the Prime Minister were from his campaign launch. This wasnt off the cuff. This was decisions that he and his team had made for his campaign launch. Lets start with a direct quote. He talked about meaningful help with your cost of living. Well, as the member for Fraser just pointed out so articulately, in the last 20 months he has done nothing to help Australians with their cost of living. Thank you, Member for Fraser, for outlining that so well for me. In the second quote from the Prime Minister—Leader of the Opposition at the time—he talks about going to embark on a new era of economic reform with productivity growth at the centre. How is productivity growth going since this Prime Minister took over 20 months ago? Its negative 6.1 per cent, and thats with this Prime Minister putting it at the centre of his objectives. Wow! I have another quote, and this is one of my favourites. The member for Groom will understand how important this one is: Labor has real, lasting plans for Cheaper electricity Twenty months later, how is that going, Member for Banks? Not very well for this Prime Minister, not very well for the Australian people. But its okay; theyll get back $15 a week in five months time—problem solved! The Prime Minister has solved it. The next quote is: Labor has real, lasting plans for … … … Cheaper mortgages Were 20 months into this prime ministership, so hes responsible for everything thats happened. Hes had opportunities to make decisions to improve the lives of Australians. What have we seen under this Prime Minister? Interest rates up 12 times. Thats not cheaper mortgages for the Australian people. This is another good one, and its become very relevant: I will lead with integrity … The member for Moreton talked about integrity and not misleading people. How has the Prime Minister gone with integrity in the last few weeks? Well, he misled the Australian people over 100 times when it came to the stage 3 tax cuts, including in January this year, well after the invasion of Ukraine, well after the IsraelGaza conflict began, well after the costofliving challenges were all facing. Then he even said, My word is my bond. Wow! Thats integrity. His solution to these challenges for the Australian people is $15 a week in five months time. But the other bit he doesnt talk about is when the government made a decision last year to let the low and middleincome tax offset lapse. That was $1,500 a year taken away from the Australian people.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VIOLI (Casey) ","(15:55):"

I chose that because of a few lines in there, which are:  Oh, no, no, no No, no, no, no, no That really reflects the opposition to me. I think you should judge people on what they do and not what they say. Those opposite suggested the cost of living as their MPI, but they didnt bother asking a single question in question time on this issue, because, clearly, its not so important for them, and, of course, they didnt vote for any of the costofliving measures—or the wage rises or the tax cuts, when they come. Labor is the party that wants Australians to earn more. Workers should earn a decent wage for their efforts. We backed a rise in the minimum wage and we backed a raise for agedcare workers. Those opposite had wage suppression as a deliberate part of their economic strategy, if you can call nine deficits in a row an economic strategy. They voted against every measure to get wages moving. Labor is the party that wants Australians to be paid fairly for their time. Our closing the loopholes bill means that workers shouldnt have to be on call 24/7 without being paid for that. The opposition doesnt want workers to have any family time or any downtime. They want workers on call 24/7 but unpaid. Those opposite are happy to talk a good game about the cost of living, but when it comes to the vote—cold heart—they vote no, no, no. They voted no to energy bill relief. They voted no to cheaper child care. They voted no to cheaper medicines. They voted no to tripling the bulkbilling incentive. They voted no to more social and affordable housing. They voted no to feefree TAFE. I think you get the theme. Now, the latest, those opposite were horrified at our plans to give tax relief to low and middleincome workers. The Labor government says Australia workers should keep more of their hardearned in their pockets. Labor tax cuts will make a real difference for every taxpayer. No taxpayer will be left behind and no taxpayer ignored; 2.9 million more taxpayers will benefit than would have benefited from the Morrison plan from five years ago. Eightyfour per cent of taxpayers will get a bigger tax cut under this plan. In my electorate of Boothby, its 85 per cent. Ninety per cent of women taxpayers are better off under this plan. Ninetyseven per cent of care economy workers are better off under this plan. Ninetyeight per cent of young taxpayers are better off under this plan, because gen Z were ignored by the Liberal and National parties. Under Labors tax plan, taxpayers earning less than $45,000 will now receive a tax cut. Under the coalitions plan, they got nothing. An Australian taxpayer earning an average wage will now get double the tax cut they would have got under the coalitions plan. An Australian family on an average household income will now get a combined tax cut of $2,600, which is $1,600 more than they would have got under the coalition. Labors tax plan also addresses bracket creep better than the oppositions stage 3 tax cuts ever did. As a result, the average taxpayer will pay—wait for it—$21,635 less in tax from their income over the next decade. But the Leader of the Opposition, the Liberals and the Nationals have made it clear that they do not want tax cuts for Middle Australia. I know theyve voted against every other form of costofliving relief here, but these are tax changes that will put money in the pockets of their own constituents. Our tax cuts come on top of billions of dollars of targeted and responsible costofliving relief, including electricity bill relief, cheaper child care, increased rent assistance, tripling the Medicare bulkbilling incentive, cheaper medicines, boosting income support payments and expanding the eligibility criteria for the single parent payment and the supplement for older job seekers, feefree TAFE, more social and affordable homes, expanding paid parental leave, creating jobs and getting wages moving again. The Labor governments tax cuts have been very welcome across my electorate. Its a great news story. A hundred per cent of taxpayers will get a tax cut, 85 per cent of Boothby taxpayers, 90 per cent of women taxpayers and 98 per cent of young taxpayers. Labor is the government of higher wages, lower taxes and good economic management.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MILLERFROST (Boothby) ","(16:00):"

Nowadays, Elton John does the job just fine in the way he has brought us together. Im going to blame the member for Moreton for this. I hope his song isnt Goodbye Yellow Brick Road as rumours would persist, but Im glad he started us off. For my contribution to the Elton John analogies Ill go with Sacrifice, because the Prime Minister chose to sacrifice his integrity when he reversed his position on the stage 3 tax cuts. Speaker, Ill leave it to your good discretion who had the best Elton John song.  I am going to mix it up, though, and move musical direction to that wellknown economist Sir MixaLot, because I like tax cuts and I cannot lie. Its been a wonderful question that weve had so many times on our position on these stage 3 tax cuts. Where are we? Where are we going to end up? Its where weve always been—voting for lower taxes. Thats what weve always done. That is the Liberal Party legacy, from the days of Menzies and right the way through. This is exactly what we do. Quite frankly, when it comes to tax cuts, Labor has all the legitimacy of a 13yearold kid walking around in an Elton John shirt. Thats not what you grew up with. Thats not what moves you. Thats not who you are. Thats not part of your structure and your DNA. Its cool; tax cuts are cool when youre coming towards a byelection in Dunkley when everybody is hurting. Its very cool to get on board then, but its not who youve been. This is not whats in your DNA. This is who we are. Its our legacy to the Australian people. Its what were called upon to do every time we come in, and its what the Australian people trust us to do. The great part is that I genuinely hope we are still talking about tax cuts at the next election. I really hope we do, because I know who the Australian people trust when it comes to tax cuts. Its the people who have delivered them time and time again. Its wonderful to hear what the benefits of the new stage 3 tax cuts will be for people, and every time they say, And they were going to get nothing from those opposite. Thats except, of course, for stage 1 and stage 2—except for those two little things the Romans did for us. They dont talk about whats happened. Were at stage 3. The clues in the number three. Thats where you go back from. So what happened in stage 1 and stage 2? The same people, who its often pointed out are going to benefit by $800, benefited by $6,000 under stages 1 and 2. Then theres the wonderful story of the LMITO, which was a decision by this side to step in and address costofliving concerns for low and mediumincome tax earners. Thats a step that we took. We took another one, which was $420 for the costofliving tax offset—another step we took for taxpayers. Do you know why? It was because we understand that when times are tight, the best thing we can do—weve heard Labor trying to take this line now—is to let people keep more of what they earn. Thats what we do. Thats have we have always done. That is our legacy and what we have done time and time again. When John Howard was in government, he delivered tax relief in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. Fascinatingly, when Kevin Rudd came to be Prime Minister, he was smart enough to keep all of those changes that we had from 2007. There we go—Kevin Rudd, one; Mr Albanese, unfortunately, zero on that front. Ill speak to another one. When times changed—and the government speakers talk about this—a review of their position on tax policy came about. That has happened before. It happened with the GST. In 1993 Mr Howard was against the GST. He went to the election in 1996 and changed his mind. The circumstances changed, and he changed his position. What did he do? He went to an election. He took that commitment to an election and sought a mandate from the Australian people so that he could continue to look them in the eye.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HAMILTON (Groom) ","(16:05):"

Eightyfour per cent of my electorate are going to benefit from these tax cuts and be better off, so I hope that at the next election we are still talking about this, because Australian families are under pressure and our Labor government is responding. From 1 July, every Australian taxpayer will get a tax cut, because on this side of the chamber we want people to earn more and keep more of what they earn. Thats why, as I said, 84 per cent of people in my community are receiving a bigger tax cut on their hardearned wages.  Tackling costofliving pressures is our No. 1 priority. Thats why were working to cut taxes, boost wages, bring inflation under control and drive fairer prices for Australian consumers. We have seen the world and our country face unprecedented changes since 2018, when the coalition first introduced the stage 3 tax cuts. It is the role of government to make hard choices and not just easy choices. It is the role of government to respond to the country we have now and not to one that we lived in six years ago. We are doing the right thing for the right reasons. Our tax cuts are good for Middle Australia, good for women, good for young people, good for helping with costofliving pressures, good for labour supply and good for the economy. Our tax cuts are in addition to our $23 billion costofliving package introduced last year. In the past 18 months, we have introduced cheaper child care. Weve reduced the cost of medicine. Weve funded feefree TAFE, provided energy bill relief and backed a 15 per cent wage rise for 250,000 agedcare workers, just to name a few. Labor has also increased the rate of JobSeeker and rent assistance to ensure that those in greatest need receive the additional financial assistance that they deserve. And, from 1 July last year, the national minimum wage was increased by 5.75 per cent, and wages are still on the rise, predicted to rise by four per cent in the coming financial year. We have made historic and recordbreaking investments in Medicare after years of neglect by those opposite. As part of Labors $6.1 billion strengthening Medicare reforms, we have tripled the bulkbilling incentive for GPs, making it easier and cheaper for people to see a doctor. In the Illawarra, we have already seen, as my friend the member for Whitlam knows, an increase in bulkbilling rates. In November and December alone, locals saved an estimated $480,000 in gap fees, helping to ease the cost of living in the Illawarra. Medicare is part of Labors DNA. We are proud to have been the party that introduced universal health insurance to Australia, unlike those opposite, who continually seek to dismantle and disrupt it. We also know that rising grocery prices are impacting millions of Australians experiencing costofliving pressure, and we are acting. On 24 January, we commissioned the ACCC to conduct an inquiry into Australias supermarket sector and pricing practices to ensure that savings are passed on to our community—the consumer at the checkout. When those opposite were last in government, their finance minister described low wage growth as a deliberate design feature of our economic architecture. Well, at least he was honest. When the coalition talks about a fair go, its not a fair go for all. For nine long years, it was the policy of those opposite to keep wages low. Labors tax cuts will benefit all Australians, not just highincome earners. Lowincome earners who were forgotten by the coalitions plan have been included in Labors plan. From Woollahra to Wollongong and from Point Piper to Port Kembla, all Australians will receive a tax cut under our plan. In just 18 months, the Albanese Labor government has started to turn things around and deliver real outcomes for all Australians. We will help deliver the governments commitment of 30,000 new social and affordable rental homes in our Housing Australia Future Funds first five years. We are getting on with rolling out the costofliving relief that is carefully calibrated to take the edge off pressure for our families.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"

As we know, its the first charge of any government to make sure that they take decisions to keep their people safe. Every prime minister should have that as their first charge. Yet the reality is that this Prime Minister, a weak prime minister, has a minister who is not up to the task of keeping Australians safe. This minister, during the course of court proceedings, has ceded ground that should not have been ceded and has given weak evidence which has resulted in the High Court directing the release of an individual. From there the government has decided to release, in total, 149 hardened criminals into the Australian community. That makes the Australian public less safe than if those people had been kept in detention. We are talking about people who have serious and questionable backgrounds. Were talking of 149 criminals. We have seven who have been convicted of murder—seven murderers. We have 37 sex offenders. We have 72 other violent offenders, including offenders who have committed repeated acts of domestic violence.  We further learned from estimates this week—the government wasnt forthcoming with the detail, but the bureaucrats were able to provide us with some detail, although they took a lot on notice, I might say—that 18 of these criminals have been arrested and charged by state and territory police for reoffending. So we know that there are further Australian citizens who have fallen victim to these criminals. These criminals should not be on the streets. They should be in immigration detention awaiting deportation. Look at the inept performance of the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs today. The Minister for Home Affairs is completely and utterly out of her depth and completely and utterly incompetent. They are presiding over a situation where they have allowed these hardened criminals to commit offences against Australian citizens. In June of last year, the AttorneyGeneral was informed of the prospects in this matter by his department, and the prospects were weak because the immigration minister and the home affairs minister are weak. The reality is that they knew that this bad decision was coming from the High Court.","National Security","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DUTTON (Dickson—Leader of the Opposition) ","(16:16):"

321,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation","00AKI","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr DUTTON: without any options on the table for the government to turn to. They knew a decision was coming from the court and they knew that they could address it somehow through legislation or through support from a third country to export people. They took up none of those options. They decided instead—in all their incompetence and because of their ideology—that they didnt want to see these people locked up. They wanted these people released. What has happened is that these people have now committed offences against Australian citizens. That is a very serious claim to make against a government and against a minister.  We move today in this parliament that the minister should be dismissed, and so he should. His incompetence has resulted in Australians falling victim to crimes by these offenders. Do you think that the Prime Minister could be here to defend his minister? Do you think that he could have taken this suspension of standing orders during question time to defend his minister? No, he could not, because he knows that this minister is not worthy of defence, and he doesnt want to tarnish his own reputation with what the minister has presided over here. I have not seen anything like this in my time in parliament. During my time in parliament it is hard to imagine a more incompetent act from a minister. We know that these criminals, 149 of them, will go on to commit further offences. We can say that much with certainty. The minister was asked if he knew where these 149 were. He was asked, Could you tell me where they are? It was a simple question. No answer. He didnt know where they were. He then carried on with this fiction that people are being continuously monitored. He repeated the statement that the 149 criminals out in the community were continuously monitored. What happened when they were committing the offences? Were they being monitored while they committed offences against Australian citizens? If thats the revelation, its even worse than we first thought. We know that the minister hasnt taken one case to the Federal Court to make an application regarding one of these individuals—not one of these sex offenders, not one of these paedophiles, not one of these rapists. He has not sought to petition the court to return one person to immigration detention—not one of them. I think the Australian public, at the moment, is rightly concerned about a wave of crime across our suburbs in many of the capital cities. Many Australians are falling victim to crime rates that, frankly, are completely and utterly unacceptable. Many older Australians are worried about their homes being broken into, their keys being stolen and their car being stolen. We know that many of these young offenders, in particular, will post Instagram photos of themselves standing in someones bedroom or making sure that theyre taking a car so that they can get a photo—","National Security","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[11]","N/A","N/A"

They dont want some soft touch as minister out there telling criminals that they can be released into the community. Thats exactly what has happened on his watch. Thats why this minister should go. The minister refuses to provide details to the parliament about why many of these criminals dont have ankle bracelets and why the government had no preparation in place to deal with mitigating the risk that these people presented as they were released. Weve got a government here thats telling victims of crime across the country, Theres nothing to see here, and Youre on your own.

The Australian people want answers to very serious questions, and the minister cannot give them. The first question we asked in question time today was: can the minister confirm, as hed said in the parliament last year, that all those victims had been contacted by the department? Could he answer that question? No, he couldnt. The second question we asked was: are the 149 hardened criminals being continuously monitored? Could he answer that question? No, he couldnt. We know that 36 of those hardened criminals dont have ankle bracelets, so how could they be continuously monitored? Yet he said in this parliament that they were being continuously monitored. He misled the parliament in doing that.  We asked him: are those 149 hardened criminals being continuously monitored? He couldnt answer it. We then asked him: how have 18 of those people committed crimes in the states and territories? Theyve reoffended. How could they have been continuously monitored? He couldnt answer that. Its damning, and its continuously damning. We asked the minister why he didnt attend crucial meetings in the leadup to the decision to let the 149 hardened criminals go. On 14 September, his office met with the legal counsel of his department. On 12 October, his office met with the legal counsel of his department. On 31 October his office met with the legal counsel of his department. Where was the minister? He was completely absent. As a matter of fact, we found out from Senate estimates last night that in June the government was warned that they were likely to lose the case, yet the minister did not meet once—not once—with the legal counsel from his department until after the High Court had handed down its decision. He stood in here and said his No. 1 priority was to keep the Australian community safe. Is that keeping the community safe—not turning up to one meeting with the legal counsel? That is a dereliction of duty. That means nothing else than that the Prime Minister should sack his minister. We cannot get a straight answer out of this minister. The last question today was a very simple one: are all the people that have been released from the NZYQ cohort on bridging visas R? The home affairs minister laughs about this.

That was 15 minutes of just about the greatest incompetent drivel and hypocrisy that Ive ever heard in this parliament. The way that this important national security problem for our country is being relentlessly politicised by those opposite is disgraceful.  I want to speak a little bit first about the substance of the matter, the governments NZYQ response, and I want to start with some home truths, because the mistruths that are being told on that side of the chamber about this case are very, very important and, importantly, very, very wrong. The first thing I want to say is: lets just be very clear about one important point here. Our government did not want these people released from detention, and the proof is in the pudding there, because, when we had the power to keep these people in detention, thats exactly what we did. That is why all these people were in a form of detention when NZYQ was brought down. The High Court had a case before it brought by NZYQ, and I will remind the parliament at this point that the reason that NZYQ was still in our country is that the Leader of the Opposition, who sits opposite me here, took a personal ministerial intervention and lifted the bar, allowing NZYQ to apply for a protection visa, which he then proceeded to do. But thats not the only culpability of the Leader of the Opposition here. Do you know what would have really helped with NZYQ? It would have really helped if some attempts had been made to remove this person from the country before Minister Giles and I started to get onto that part of the problem. We would not have had an NZYQ case if the Leader of the Opposition had just done his job and made that remote effort to approach other countries and remove NZYQ from the country, as a good minister would have done and as Minister Giles and I did. The High Court made a decision that our government did not agree with. We went before the High Court and we argued against the decision they made. But governments do need to manage changes in the law that are made by the High Court of Australia. That includes a Liberal government, a Labor government or government of any stripe.

This is a landmark report, and what it shows is that under the Leader of the Opposition the home affairs department paid hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money on companies and individuals that dealt in arms and drugs and trafficked in human beings. This all happened under the watch of this supposed tough guy on the borders, this person whos coming into the parliament today and giving us all a lecture about how tough he is on crime. Well, under his watch, hundreds of millions of dollars were funnelled into these companies.  A lot of people out there will be thinking: What the hell? How did this happen under his watch? We got a little bit of insight into that this week during estimates. What we heard in estimates is that the department actually raised these issues with the minister. They raised issues about a company that was about to be awarded a contract worth more than half a billion dollars for the management of an offshore processing centre. He was told in a report that the company had never been awarded work of anything like this kind. I understand that this company was actually headquartered in a beach shack on Kangaroo Island. Under him, they got a halfabilliondollar contract.","National Security","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[12]","N/A","N/A"

But what did the Leader of the Opposition do? He didnt ask a question. He didnt ask for a meeting. He didnt ask for a further briefing. He just said, Noted, and on he moved. And after that, half a billion dollars went into that company.  There are many other examples, but I dont want to dwell just on the Richardson review, because there are many other things that need to be put onto the public record here. I want to talk now about the report that Christine Nixon wrote into the exploitation in our migration system, and again I table that for the parliament. In some ways, this is actually the most damning report into the Leader of the Opposition. For almost the whole time he has been in parliament, his whole public persona has been puffing himself up as a big tough guy on the border. But what did the Nixon review find? It found that there were serious and systemic problems with exploitation in the migration system. It found that the system had been used to perpetrate some of the worst crimes that there are—sexual slavery and human trafficking—under the watch of the Leader of the Opposition, our socalled tough guy on the beat. She found there was delay and dysfunction in the system. She also found something very interesting: for all the tough talk that we have heard over previous years from the Leader of the Opposition, he halved immigration compliance funding to the Department of Home Affairs. Have you ever heard of anything more hypocritical than that? I dont want to finish without talking about the Parkinson review. In fairness to the Leader of the Opposition, I dont think he has ever pretended to actually care about the central importance of migration to the future of our country. It has just never been a particular interest of his. And, of course, the Parkinson review told us that our migration system is fundamentally broken. Martin Parkinson said that this was due to a decade of deliberate neglect under the Leader of the Opposition. Weve got some critiques today for the Leader of the Opposition.

Speaker, let me remind you about defence. This is a guy who likes to think of himself as a real tough guy on national defence, but what did he do when he was minister? He left behind a litany of delayed projects, which I believe were up to 97 years late by the time Labor came to office. Seriously, what a fraud. Let me not forget the most important one of all, perhaps, for many Australians, which is the catastrophic failure in our healthcare system. There is only one person in this parliament who has been voted the worst health minister in the entire history of Medicare, and he sits in the chair opposite me. This is someone who tried to trash Medicare, and its only because of Labor that Australians are not paying $5 on top of every other fee every time they go to the doctor. He shakes his head, but its a matter of public record that this is what he did. We shouldnt suspend standing orders, at least not for the substance of the matter that has been brought forward, because the truth is that the person with questions to answer here is the Leader of the Opposition.

365,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation","C2T","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr WILKIE: Sadly, weve just about run out of time to save Julian Assange, because on Tuesday and Wednesday, just next week, in what could well be Julian Assanges last two days before a British court, the High Court of Justice in London is hearing Julian Assanges request for leave to appeal his US extradition. If Mr Assange is unsuccessful next week in the UK High Court of Justice, the frightful reality is that he could be on a plane to the United States of America within hours.  Good God! This man has already been in Belmarsh highsecurity prison in London for about five years. This is the prison for the worst of the worst in the UK. It is where they put mass murderers and terrorists. It is where a prisoner was knifed and killed, elsewhere in the prison, the very afternoon I visited Julian Assange in 2000. Of course, the five years in Belmarsh followed some seven years holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy. Surely this man has suffered enough. The matter must be brought to an end. But if he is unsuccessful next week in the London court, he could be on a plane within hours to another court—this time in the United States of America—where hell be facing 17 charges under the US Espionage Act and one charge under the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. If he is convicted, he will be facing 175 years in prison in the United States. In other words, if he is extradited, perhaps as soon as next week, he will be handed, more or less, a death sentence. Why? It is because this Walkley awardwinning journalist did his job. Its as simple as that. He did his job. Lets not forget that in 2010 Julian Assange, through WikiLeaks, revealed hard evidence of US war crimes and other misconduct in Iraq, in Afghanistan and at Guantanamo Bay. Who could possibly forget the grainy image, provided to WikiLeaks by a brave whistleblower, that subsequently was released under the title collateral murder? It was footage of a US attack helicopter gunning down and killing innocent civilians and Reuters journalists in a street in Iraq. We only know of that because Julian Assange made us aware of it. He was doing his job. He was exercising every right he has as a journalist to tell us about wrongdoing. As much as the attack on journalism is terrifying, the injustice of all this is absolutely breathtaking because if this matter runs to its shameful conclusion then it will have set a precedent that applies to all Australian journalists. If ever any Australian journalist annoys a foreign government in any way, and if that government is a government that the Australian government is hoping to curry favour with, then whos to say that the Australian government wont be complicit in the extradition or the transport of that Australian journalist to that country? What happens if an Australian journalist offends China at a time when were seeking to improve our relationship with China? The precedent will have been set and that journalist may well find him or herself on a plane to China. What about if were trying to curry favour with Saudi Arabia and an Australian journalist writes something that offends Saudi Arabia? Will the Australian government come to that Australian journalists aid? Well, the precedent will have been set and no Australian journalist can be confident they will be safe in the future if this extradition goes ahead. Thats why we have this very important part of this motion: the importance of the UK and the USA bringing the matter to a close. Finally, after seven years in the embassy, after five years in a highsecurity prison, just allow this longsuffering Australian journalist to come home, to be with his wife, to be with his children. The importance of this is so great that I will certainly be jumping on a plane next Tuesday, hoping to be in London for the second day of the court hearing. I think its very important that a member of this parliament bears witness to what is going on in London next week, stands with Julians family and offers them some comfort and communicates to Julian Assange and his family and his legal team the widespread support already in this parliament. Lets not forget there are dozens of members of this parliament who are members of the Bring Julian Assange Home Parliamentary Group. Almost onethird of this parliament signed an open letter to the US government not that long ago calling for this matter to be brought to an end. Today, in this place, shortly, it will be time for all of us to stand up and take a stand: to stand with Julian Assange, to stand for the principles of justice and to stand for the principles of media freedom and the rights of journalists to do their jobs. Im hopeful this motion can pass this afternoon. Im hopeful that I can go to London next week and make it clear to the British government and, through the media, to the US government that the Australian parliament stands as one and calls for this matter to be brought to an end. Regardless of what you might think of Julian Assange, and I acknowledge in this place theres a range of views—there are people who loathe the man, there are people who worship the man, but Ill tell you what: no matter which end of that spectrum you are positioned, just about everyone agrees that this has gone on too long and that it must be brought to an end. Im confident that if this parliament can support this motion this afternoon, it will send a very powerful political signal to the British government and to the US government. It will send a very powerful signal to the British government that it should not entertain the idea of Mr Assange being extradited to the US. It will send a very powerful signal to Washington that Australia stands as one in saying that this matter has gone on long enough. Regardless of what you might think of Mr Assange, justice is not being served in this case now. In any case, hes suffered enough. For heavens sakes, something like five years in Belmarsh, about seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy. How much is enough? This is the afternoon when this parliament takes a stand and says enough is enough, and when we call on the US and on the UK to let him out of prison, to drop the charges, to let him be rejoined with his family and to let him come home.","Assange, Mr Julian Paul","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[16]","N/A","N/A"

368,0,0,0,1,1,"Wilson, Josh MP",265970,"Fremantle","ALP","N/A",893," I am very glad to second this motion. Make no mistake, the Australian community wants to see Julian Assange go free. While there may be a range of views about Mr Assange, as the member for Clark said, his further incarceration and prosecution are seen by many to represent an injustice, and thats my personal view; it is not shared by everyone. But there are many in this chamber and in the other place who want to see the matter resolved. Indeed, the open letter from the coconvenor of the Bring Julian Assange Home Parliamentary Friendship Group, which includes the member for Clark and the member for Bass—with whom I am glad to share this debate—was signed by 63 members of the Australian parliament. It is significant that both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have been clear in saying that the matter should come to an end.  The Prime Minister has properly raised a matter of Julian Assange with the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom and that marks a shift from what occurred previously. In May last year, the Prime Minister said enough is enough when it comes to the ongoing incarceration of Julian Assange, and also said there is nothing to be served by the ongoing incarceration of Julian Assange. That is quite right, because Julian Assange has been held in maximum security conditions at Belmarsh prison for nearly five years. His health has suffered. His extradition to the US was previously denied by a UK court on the basis of his seriously poor mental health, which made him a suicide risk. While every country is of course entitled to apply its justice system and the US is entitled to apply its justice system, we should remember that Julian Assange has been now imprisoned for a considerable period without having being convicted of any substantial charge. He is an Australian citizen being pursued under the United States Espionage Act for the dissemination of material the United States regards as secret. The same material has been published without legal consequence by media organisations in the US. The open letter I referred to earlier was published in the Washington Post. The coconvenors wrote and 63 parliamentarians signed up to the statement that it is wrong for Mr Assange to be further persecuted and denied his liberty. When one considers the duration and circumstances of the detention he has already suffered, it serves no purpose. The letter concluded by saying: We note with gratitude the considerable support in the United States for an end to the legal pursuit of Mr Assange from members of Congress, human rights advocates, academics, and civil society, and from within the US media in defence of free speech and independent journalism. In acknowledging the death of American whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg last year, I noted his support for and solidarity with Julian Assange. Daniel Ellsberg was responsible for exposing some of the details of the circumstances of the Vietnam War. In a 2021 interview he said in relation to Julian, Look, I was available for people to point to and say, We support good whistleblowers, but that is just ridiculous. Whatever he is guilty of, Im guilty of. I identify with him completely. The notion that he is guilty of something that I, the good guy, wasnt, is false. We must never forget that, contrary to the idea that our safety and wellbeing depends more than anything else on secrecy, the reality is that our safety and wellbeing is at enormous risk when the most grave applications of state power are not held to account. In truth, the distinctive and most precious quality of all liberal democracies, including our own, is the capacity to apply open and proper scrutiny to all decisionmaking but especially decisionmaking that involves military action or the infringement of civil liberties through a security apparatus. There are many in the United States and in the United Kingdom, in the media, in the Congress and in civil society that share the view that, when it comes to Julian Assange, enough is enough. It is healthy that this matter is openly and respectfully debated in all three countries. I think I can say on behalf of the coconvenors of the group that we have always found an openness in the United States and in the United Kingdom to have these conversations. That is a mark of what makes those three countries—ourselves, the United States and the United Kingdom—examples of liberal democracies at their best, the fact that we can have those conversations. But I say clearly that the further prosecution and incarceration of Julian Assange has no point, it serves no purpose and it should end. Question agreed to, with an absolute majority.","Assange, Mr Julian Paul","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JOSH WILSON (Fremantle) ","(16:59):"

373,0,0,0,1,1,"Archer, Bridget MP",282237,"Bass","LP","N/A",894," Thanks to my coconveners, the member for Clark and the member for Fremantle, for bringing this motion forward. For more than 4½ thousand days and counting, Julian Assange has not experienced true freedom. Were now just a week away from a decision on his final UK court appeal, where he faces up to 175 years in prison over 17 espionage charges and one charge of computer misuse. We know that his life is at risk. His lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, recently said:  Because of the treatment he has suffered, he suffers a major depressive illness, he has been diagnosed as being on the [autism] spectrum, and the medical evidence is if he was extradited to the United States those conditions would cause him to commit suicide. So his life is at risk and I am not exaggerating that. I joined this group because of my ongoing concerns about the treatment that he has endured over the past decade. While there are, as weve heard, a range of views about the actions of Mr Assange and WikiLeaks which can be debated, at the end of the day its no longer the point. What I can say is that the ongoing prosecution of Mr Assange offends my sense of natural justice, my sense of human dignity and my sense of fairness. Hes an Australian citizen who has endured terrible conditions and has suffered significant mental and physical challenges as a result of his ongoing incarceration due to the lengthy legal battle. Its not clear to me that Mr Assange committed any crime in the jurisdiction of the United States, and the pursuit of him by American authorities even now is an overreach and does not serve the interests of justice. Even if Mr Assange were guilty of a crime, which Im not sure is true, and there were due punishment, hasnt he already served that punishment? Surely he has paid that price and has suffered enough. It is worth noting that the person who gathered the information published by WikiLeaks, Chelsea Manning, has been free for the past seven years. Is it not ultimately a matter of fairness? The ongoing prosecution and, indeed, persecution of Mr Assange does not serve the interests of justice or human dignity. He ought to be released from custody and allowed to return to Australia with his family. I echo the words of fellow parliamentary group member the member for Bruce, who has said: There can never be a legal solution to this case. It is inherently political. I also agree with barrister Greg Barns SC, adviser to the Australian Assange Campaign, who said: Of course, some say the Assange case must be allowed to take its course via the courts because extradition is a legal process. While that is true in the vast majority of cases this is an exceptional set of circumstances. In that sense it is like the case of David Hicks … Rightly that case was resolved via the political relationship between the Howard government here and the Bush Administration because it too was a case infused with a political overlay. Now is the time to end a dangerous threat to basic freedoms and the rule of law. We have previously managed to secure the safe return of Australian citizens under difficult diplomatic circumstances, and we have a responsibility to do the same for Mr Assange. I called on the previous government to step up and stand up to bring Mr Assange home, and I am pleased that his case now has some bipartisan support from the leaders of both parties, who acknowledge that enough is enough. And I acknowledge that there has been work to lobby the US government. Our group had a constructive meeting with Ambassador Caroline Kennedy last year to discuss the case. I also thank parliamentary colleagues who undertook a trip to the US last year to make direct representation to our US counterparts. Prior to this trip more than 60 colleagues across the political divide signed a letter of support explicitly calling on the US to drop the prosecution of Assange. The letter said: It serves no purpose, it is unjust, and we say clearly—as friends should always be honest with friends—that the prolonged pursuit of Mr Assange wears away at the substantial foundation of regard and respect that Australians have for the justice system of the United States of America. Surely we can all agree that we do not want to see an Australian citizen continue to languish in a foreign prison. Enough is enough.","Assange, Mr Julian Paul","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ARCHER (Bass) ","(17:06):"
374,0,0,0,1,1,"Bandt, Adam Paul MP","M3C","Melbourne","AG","N/A",895," I rise to support this motion regarding Julian Assange and I commend the member for Clark and all those other members who have been involved in bringing this motion before this place. Unfortunately, it is not the first time that this parliament has had to move and push to ensure that Julian Assange is brought home. But it is perhaps more critical now than ever that we speak with, hopefully, one voice, to make it clear that it is time to bring Julian Assange home.  Julian Assange is a brave Australian whistleblower and journalist. He has been locked in the UKs notorious Belmarsh prison since April 2019, largely in solitary confinement, having never faced trial or been convicted. And of course that follows years spent in the embassy. The offence he is charged with, ultimately, is telling the public the truth about the appalling conduct of the US military in the illegal invasion of Iraq. I want to say a bit more about that in a moment, but, as other speakers have drawn attention to, one of the most pressing issues at the moment is Julian Assanges health and what is facing him over the coming days and potentially over the coming years. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment visited Julian in May 2019 and even at that stage reported serious concerns about his detention and his health. Now, years later, we have a situation where the very next thing that might happen to Julian Assange is his transport to the United States. And lets be clear that, given Julians health, any sentence of imprisonment under the notorious US Espionage Act and extradition to the US would almost certainly be a death sentence. It cannot be allowed to come to that. That is a large part of the reason you see so many people from across the political spectrum saying it has gone on for far too long. He is now facing a grave risk to his life because it has gone on for far too long. That is why the critical next step must be to ensure that Julian Assange is brought home. As to the fundamental matters that underlie the whole reason for his incarceration and his imprisonment, its that hes on trial for telling the truth. As a result of the 2010 and 2011 work of Wikileaks, media organisations around the world published information that showed that US military operations engaged in attacks on civilians and other atrocities, including images that we must never forget, like the chilling video now known as Collateral Murder. Chelsea Manning, a former US soldier who was involved in leaking many of these classified documents, has already been released from prison after their sentence was commuted by former US President Obama. But Julian remains locked up. There is global support for Julian Assange to be returned home, and this is particularly strong in Australia, as it should be. He has become symbolic of journalists around the world who face attacks on press freedom, oftenshrinking government accountability and, in some jurisdictions, persecution ranging from political prosecutions through to murder. As the member for Clark ably said before, this sets an incredibly chilling precedent for journalists in the future and for journalists ability to hold governments to account, to say uncomfortable things about governments—things that might be uncomfortable for their own government—and to know that you can tell the truth without facing imprisonment and without facing a risk to your own life. I will also note that prime minister after prime minister in this place has signed Australia up to AUKUS, an arrangement that, in our view, is one where Australia fronts up with a chequebook and does what its told to do by the other partners. If governments think that participation in the AUKUS agreement and alliance is so critical, surely part of that should be the insistence on human rights and the proper treatment of our citizens—of Australian citizens. If we are sitting around a table with these governments, we should be able to insist that Julian Assange is brought home. I commend this motion to the House. I acknowledge the work of the parliamentary friends of Assange group. Lets join together today and say clearly: bring Julian Assange home.","Assange, Mr Julian Paul","MOTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BANDT (Melbourne—Leader of the Australian Greens) ","(17:10):"

380,0,0,0,1,1,"Ware, Jenny MP",300123,"Hughes","LP","N/A",898," The actual provisions of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 are that the tax on incomes of $18,000 to $45,000 will reduce from 19c to 16c in the dollar and that the flat $45,000 to $200,000 threshold, taxed at 30c in the dollar, will now split into two, where $45,000 to $135,000 will be taxed at 30c and $135,000 to $190,000 will be taxed at 37c. The 37c tax rate was the subject of the coalitions very sensible stage 3 tax cut legislation. Labor has claimed this will be broadly revenueneutral. However, Treasury has said the measure will cost at least an extra $1.3 billion over the next four years, while, over the medium term, the measure will increase tax receipts by $28 billion over the next decade. This in effect means that, going into the future, this will make a lot of our taxpayers significantly worse off with bracket creep. The fact that the government has not addressed this has shown, yet again, that, since coming to office, the Prime Minister and the government have made the wrong decisions. Theyve been very distracted by other matters and they have also been breaking promises at every opportunity.  Meanwhile, in the first 18 months of Labors government, personal income tax has risen by a record 27 per cent. However, the purchasing power of an Australian earning a gross salary of $85,000 has fallen by more than $7,000. It has fallen by $7,600 since Labor came to office, and Labor has no answers as to how to address this. This is a symptom of economic mismanagement, where we still see headline inflation remaining far too high—much higher than most other OECD countries and our competitors. One of the other objections to this legislation was that this was another broken promise of this Prime Minister and this government. And, just to reiterate, some of those promises that were made before and after the election were that there would be a $275 reduction in energy prices. Broken promise. There will be no change to super taxes. Broken promise. There would be an increase in real wages. Broken promise. There will be no changes to franking credits. Broken promise. You will all have cheaper mortgages; all Australians will have cheaper mortgages, said the Prime Minister during the election campaign. Broken promise. Lets tell that to the average mortgage holder. The average mortgage holder in my electorate of Hughes, for example, is now paying $25,000 a year more. They now have to find $500 a week in aftertax income to pay their mortgage. There will be no changes to stage 3 tax cuts, said the Prime Minister. My word is my bond. Another broken promise. While it is the case that the coalition will support this legislation because we are a party that is committed to lower taxes, smaller government and less regulation, what is important here is that Australians are now seeing this Prime Minister cannot be trusted. His repetitive oath, My word is my bond, and further broken promises mean that he has broken trust with the Australian people.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WARE (Hughes) ","(17:28):"
381,0,0,0,1,1,"Repacholi, Dan MP",298840,"Hunter","ALP","N/A",899," I rise to make a contribution to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024. The great part about these tax cuts is every taxpayer gets one. Its simple. In my electorate of Hunter, every single taxpayer will receive a tax cut under our new tax cuts, with 86 per cent of Hunter taxpayers receiving an even bigger tax cut from 1 July. Australians across the board are doing it tough, and tough times call for tough decisions. What we have seen is a leader who is willing to make some tough decisions. I know in my electorate the people congratulate the Prime Minister for making that tough decision.  When the previous government legislated the original stage 3 tax cuts five years ago, the world was a very different place. It was before a onceinalifetime pandemic, persistent and stubborn high inflation, higher interest rates, two conflicts and global uncertainty that put Australians under more sustained costofliving pressures. There is no doubt that this decision was very difficult politically. But this is about people and not about politics, and its the responsible thing to do. We are making the right decision, not the easy one, to make sure that costofliving relief goes to everyone, especially those who are doing it tough. So here are the facts. From 1 July this year the government will reduce the 19 per cent tax rate to 16 per cent, reduce the 32.5 per cent tax rate to 30 per cent, increase the threshold above which the 37 per cent tax rate applies from $120,000 to $135,000, and increase the threshold above which the 45 per cent tax rate applies from $180,000 to $190,000. The 45 per cent threshold will be lifted on 1 July for the first time since Labor was last in office. What does that mean for taxpayers in the Hunter electorate? Our new tax cuts will make a real difference for 73,000 taxpayers who will receive a tax cut. It means that 63,000 taxpayers will receive a bigger tax cut than what was being proposed under the old plan. This translates to a larger tax cut for 90 per cent of female taxpayers. Nurses, teachers, childcare educators, chefs and truckies are some of the most likely to benefit, with more than 95 per cent of those taxpayers getting a bigger tax cut. Parents, particularly women with young children, will be meaningfully supported to return to work under the governments changes through increases to their takehome pay. Under the proposed changes, taxpayers earning less than $45,000 will now receive a tax cut. The old plan would have seen them receive a big fat zero—doughnuts. This will significantly boost the takehome pay for Australians on modest incomes and people working parttime. So lets break it down into numbers. Someone on the average Australian wage, of around $73,000, will now get a tax cut of more than $1,500 year. Thats around $29 a week, and its more than double what they would have received under the old plan. For a family on an average household income of around $130,000 with one partner earning $80,000 and the other earning $50,000, their combined tax cut will be over $2,600, which is around $50 a week, and about $1,600 a year more than what they would have got under the old plan. A person earning $40,000 a year will get a tax cut of $654, compared with nothing under the previous plan. A person earning $100,000 will get a tax cut of $2,179. Thats $804 more than they would have received under the previous plan. And a person earning $200,000 will still get a tax cut, which will be $4,529. Over the last few weeks Ive been out speaking to my community about the tax cuts and what they mean for local residents. Emma from Branxton is a registered nurse in the Hunter electorate. She earns around $90,000 a year and paid $21,517 in income tax in the 202324 financial year. On the same salary Emma will pay $1,929 less in tax in the 202425 financial year under the governments new tax plan. That is $804 more than under the previous plan. Gordon is an electrician in Lake Macquarie and is married to Tracy, who is at home caring for their child. Gordon expects his wage to be around $130,000 in the 202425 financial year. With the new tax cuts, Gordon will receive $3,379 of income tax relief. While these tax cuts benefit everyone, I understand that some people in my community who make over $150,000 might not be entirely happy with these changes. I want to reassure those individuals that you will still receive a tax cut. Actually, youll get the largest tax cut of all. How? you ask. Were increasing the highest tax threshold from $180,000 a year to $190,000 for the first time in 16 years. Just like everyone else, these individuals have expenses, like school fees, childcare fees, health insurance and housing costs, either rent or mortgage. Many of them bought homes when interest rates were expected to stay low, but now theyre dealing with higher rates, like many other Australians. They are facing similar financial pressures. Theyve been waiting for tax relief, and were delivering it by raising the tax threshold to $190,000 and giving them a tax cut too. I spoke with Ian, a miner from Muswellbrook, who told me that this is a far more equitable outcome. Ian earns more than $170,000 a year and still gets a tax cut, but his children, who are in the childcare and service industries, get a far better deal on their tax. Those opposite love a good scare campaign. Its the only policy they can come up with. We hear them running around like Chicken Little, telling everyone the sky is falling in, but this couldnt be further from the truth. The advice from Treasury is clear: our tax cuts will not add to inflationary pressure, because they are broadly revenue neutral. With the continuing fall of the inflation rate, Treasury are clear that our tax plan will not impact their forecast for inflation to fall to the target band. Australians are under pressure right now and deserve a tax plan that responds to the challenges they are facing, but those opposite have backflipped on what they will do for struggling Australians. Why are they standing in the way of bigger tax cuts for Middle Australia? We had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying they would roll back these changes, meaning that 63,000 people in the Hunter electorate would not get a tax cut and would pay more tax under the Liberals and Nationals. Think about that for a second, Mr Deputy Speaker. Their plan is to tell those who are struggling that, if the Liberals and Nationals are elected, the relief that will be delivered from 1 July this year will be taken away and given to those people on $200,000 a year or more. How is that fair? The Liberals and Nationals are addicted to opposing costofliving relief. The only word they seem to know is no. The stage 3 tax cuts represent a transformative step forward for our nation, a step towards a future of opportunity, prosperity and fairness. By empowering individuals, stimulating economic activity and promoting equality within our tax system, these cuts lay the foundation for a stronger, more resilient Australia. I commend the bill to the House.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr REPACHOLI (Hunter) ","(17:33):"
382,0,0,0,1,1,"Wallace, Andrew MP",265967,"Fisher","LNP","N/A",900," I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024. Im amazed when I come into this place and listen to members opposite talk about the cost of living. It seems that they have finally awoken from their political slumber to realise that actually Australians are hurting right now. For 20 months this government has been distracted by so many other different things, and it has failed, at every point and every level, to address the costofliving issues that weve been talking about—that is, until the Prime Minister realised and said: Ive got a problem here. I need to do something about this.  It has taken this government 20 months to come up with something meaningful—albeit, for the average punter, were talking about a tax reduction of $15 a week. I look at how much the average Australian familys costs have increased in the period since this government came to power, the extraordinary costs that the average family is now enduring. Rents are skyhigh. Weve seen 12 interest rate rises. The average mortgage holder in this country is now paying $24,000 more than they were under the coalition government, and thats after tax. We often dont seem to remember or recognise that its after tax. Think about the average Australian family that is often, sadly, living from hand to mouth. Now, if theyve got a mortgage, they are paying an additional $24,000 after tax. Their electricity bill has gone through the roof—far from the $275 reduction under Labor that the Prime Minister promised, a claim he has not repeated once since the election. Rents have gone up because most landlords have a mortgage. If their mortgage goes up, rents will go up. Rents have gone up exponentially because this government is introducing over 1.5 million immigrants to this country, with no plan on where these people are going to work or live. That is having unbelievably drastic consequences for housing pressures. I am getting people contacting my office every day—I had another one today—with some really sad stories about young people and old people who cant find a house. A gentlemans mum contacted my office yesterday and said her son has five days until hes evicted and hes got nowhere to go. There is story after story after story. This government talks big about housing. At the same time its just pulled $160 million in funding from the Mooloolah River interchange in my electorate. Over a hundred houses were demolished to make way for the Mooloolah River interchange. Now, because of this governments slashing of infrastructure spending, the people who were living in over a hundred demolished houses may be homeless. Do the maths. On average, around two and a half people live in a house. I dont know where theyve gone. Trying to find a house on the Sunshine Coast is virtually impossible. This government is only now talking the big talk about cost of living because this Prime Minister realised that he was in trouble with the defeat at the referendum and because of the costofliving pressures that Australians are feeling. During the 90second statements every single one of those opposite came in here and talked about the cost of living. When was the last time government members opposite talked about the cost of living until very recently? The government has the oppositions support for this bill because we are a party that supports lower taxes and smaller government. Theyre slapping themselves on the back and congratulating themselves, on the backs of Australians that have never done it so hard. I was a carpenter in the 1980s in the recession that we had to have—Paul Keatings recession. Ive seen tough times as a carpenter. But although interest rates climbed to 18 per cent back then, there are more people doing it hard now. Perhaps its because of my job that Im exposed to peoples difficulties. It doesnt matter where I go. I opened Gateway Cares new facilities in Caloundra just before Christmas. When we were in government, we provided them with some funding to build a new shed. Gateway Care is like a Foodbank for the Sunshine Coast. They told me that they have got people turning up to Gateway Care who work; both mum and dad work. They might drive nice cars, but they are in real strife because they cannot make ends meet. When you look at those figures that I talked about earlier—an additional $24,000 for the average punter with the average mortgage, after tax—where can the average mum and dad find that sort of money? They cant. A lot of families saved up a lot of money during COVID, so a lot of those savings are being exhausted, but, equally, there are a lot of families in which mums and dads are having to go back and get a second job and, in some cases, a third job. For those members opposite to come in here and be slapping themselves on the back about how good this government purports to be, it is a direct affront to the pain and the suffering that Australians across this country are feeling, particularly in regional Queensland—places like where you live and I live, Mr Deputy Speaker. There are things in this bill which the government supports. We support the lower tax bracket reducing down to 16 cents. Thats a good thing. But, when it comes down to trying to ease the cost of living, I know that at 10 minutes to six—and its 10 minutes to five back home—people will be driving to and from sport or will be just about to drive home from work or maybe from one job to the next job because they have to work two jobs, or maybe theyre not taking their kids to sport, because they cant afford for their kids to do sport any more. Australians are doing it tough, and it grates on each and every single one of them to hear the government come in here and pat themselves on the back. The reality is that the stage 3 tax cuts that we legislated when we were in government were supported by those members opposite, the government, when they were in opposition. They supported those changes. But now theres a Dunkley byelection and now the Prime Minister is under pressure as a result of his appalling leadership during the referendum. Surely his backbench was feeding information to him. Boss, weve got a real problem here. There are a lot of people out there hurting. Youve got to do something. As a result of the sad passing of Peta Murphy, we have the byelection in Dunkley. This byelection will be a test for this Prime Ministers leadership. He knows that as well as anybody. The reality is thats why these new tax cuts were born. On more than a hundred occasions, this Prime Minister told us that this government was not going to change the legislated stage 3 tax cuts. My word is my bond, he said. They told us they werent going to change the franking credits. They told us they werent going to make any changes to superannuation. Now theyre telling us: Oh, there will be no changes to negative gearing. There will be no changes to the capital gains tax offsets. Well, when Australians hear the Prime Minister speak, they have every single right to wonder whether what he is saying is truthful. There are only so many times you can break faith with the Australian people before the Australian people will call you out. At least the member for Maribyrnong, when he was the Leader of the Opposition, ran at the 2019 election with, it has to be said, a very upfront approach to taxation policies and what Labor were going to do. We fought him on that, and the Australian people spoke very loudly, but at least the member for Maribyrnong had the intestinal fortitude to be honest and to nail his colours to the mast. This Prime Minister went to the 2022 election making numerous commitments from which he has since backtracked. Labor has gone against those commitments, and now Australians are wondering whether the person in the Lodge is someone who they can trust. That is a sad state of affairs. Politicians cop a bad rap no matter what, doesnt matter what party is in government, but when the Prime Minister of the land stands up and says, You can trust me on this—says it on over 100 occasions: We dont plan on making any changes, and, My word is my bond—Australians have a reasonable expectation that things will not change. When you break that bond, Australians are rightly able to question everything that comes out of that persons lips thereafter, and that person is the Prime Minister of this country. The LiberalNational coalition has always stood for smaller government. It has always stood for lower taxes. For those opposite to try and mount some sort of an argument that were not supporting these changes is clearly incorrect. Its manufacturing. At the end of the day, this bill will be supported by the coalition. That will be reflected in the votes and tallies. I look forward to making a further contribution later.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WALLACE (Fisher) ","(17:43):"
383,0,0,0,1,1,"Watts, Tim MP",193430,"Gellibrand","ALP","N/A",902," The Albanese government wants Australians to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. Thats why we are delivering a tax cut to every Australian who pays income tax and a bigger benefit to 84 per cent of Australians. I know that many Australians are doing it tough at the moment. The pandemic, the global economic downturn and two international conflicts have had farreaching impacts on our economy here in Australia, and Australians, especially low and middleincome earners, are under pressure. Weve been tackling the most pressing challenges faced by Australians while also making responsible choices in the longterm interests of our country.  Were providing responsible costofliving relief without adding to inflationary pressures. Thats why we have been delivering $23 billion in costofliving relief across child care, TAFE, Medicare, cheaper medicines, energy bill relief, affordable homes and paid parental leave. Were investing $3.5 billion to triple the bulkbilling incentive, allowing 11.6 million Australians to access a GP with no outofpocket costs. Were reducing the cost of medicine by up to half for at least six million Australians. Were committing up to $3 billion on electricity bill relief to take pressure off more than five million eligible households and one million eligible small businesses. As a result, power bills are lower than they otherwise would have been. And, importantly, as Australian Bureau of Statistics data has confirmed, the Albanese Labor governments costofliving relief has shaved 0.5 per cent off inflation. Weve also increased the base rate of the JobSeeker payment and the youth allowance, and weve committed $1.9 billion to expand eligibility of single parent payments. But we know more needs to be done. Thats why from 1 July this year, through this bill, we will be delivering a tax cut to every taxpayer in Australia. Our policy will mean that Middle Australia will receive bigger tax cuts to help with costofliving pressures. Weve made the hard choice to change our position to deliver these tax cuts. Were introducing these changes because we recognise the economic realities of 2024. We recognise that Australians are under pressure and deserve a plan that responds to the challenges they are facing. When the former governments tax plan was legislated five years ago, the world was a very different place. Their plan was legislated before a oncein100years pandemic, before higher interest rates driven by persistent international inflation and before two global conflicts and the ensuing global economic uncertainty. All of this put Australians under more sustained costofliving pressure. We recognise that, when circumstances change, changing policy is the right thing to do. The tax cuts will have a real tangible difference for 13.6 million taxpaying Australians, and these tax cuts will make a difference to 2.9 million more people than would have benefited from the fiveyearold Morrison tax plan. We want people to earn more, and we want them to keep more of what they earn. In my electorate in Melbournes west, every single taxpayer will receive a tax cut under Labors tax plan. Eightyfour thousand people in my electorate will get a tax cut. Seventy thousand people—thats almost 84 per cent of people in my electorate—will get a bigger tax cut. And 5.8 million women, 90 per cent of women taxpayers, will now receive a bigger tax cut. Ninetyeight per cent of teachers, 97 per cent of truckies, 96 per cent of cleaners, 91 per cent of police officers and 91 per cent of mechanics will get a bigger tax cut. More than 90 per cent of all Australians under 35 will receive a bigger tax cut. Under our plans, an early childhood educator who earns $69,000 a year will receive an additional $1,404 as a tax cut. Under the Morrison plan, they would have received nothing—not a cent. These reforms make our tax system more progressive and more fair, and our plan returns bracket creep for all taxpayers and does more to reduce the impact on those who are most burdened by it. By dropping the two tax rates and lifting the two thresholds, were giving everyone a tax cut and providing $359 billion in help with the cost of living. We are returning the most bracket creep to where we can do the most good in Middle Australia. In spite of the mendacious lines being run by those opposite, the average taxpayer will pay $21,635 less of their income in tax over the next decade. And, as identified by the Grattan Institute, the median taxpayer is still better off after 10 years. They found that a typical taxpayer, someone earning around $59,000, will pay cumulatively $8,040 less in tax over the next decade. Those opposite dont like this bill. You only have to listen to their speeches to see how much this bill irritates them. The opposition leader would rather a fight than a fix. Listening to those opposite contort themselves over this bill to find a way to be outraged by it while also supporting it has really been something to behold. Its been a collective credibility bonfire. Credibility is an impediment to career progression on the opposition frontbench. The deputy Liberal leader understands this better than anyone. She has put in a really strong performance in destroying her credibility in her current role. She has had strong opposition from the shadow Treasurer, who labelled these tax cuts for all Australians as Marxism, before saying that he would vote for them. It takes a lot to be less credible than that, but the deputy Liberal leader has been putting in the work. As an MP who utterly capitulated on her former positions on live exports and on Palestine, the deputy leader has now added tax cuts to the bonfire of her policy credibility. When asked if the opposition would roll back Labors tax cuts, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said: Well this is our position. This is absolutely our position … Except, according to the Leader of the Opposition, it isnt. Well, its hard to know what their position is. Theyve opposed it. Theyve said theyll roll it back. Theyve said theyll amend it. Theyve said theyll support it. Theyve said theyll take a different policy to the next election. You dont need to believe in numerology to see that this doesnt add up. But, in their negativity, they reveal their true priorities. This week the member for Bowman stood up in this place, as a representative example of the kinds of contributions weve heard in this debate, to suggest that this bill meant that the government were killers of aspirations. Whose aspirations was he talking about when he said this? He went on: … what about the next generation of Australians, the next generation of aspirants … who aspire to one day own an investment property? Is the government proposing to kill off their aspiration to do so? He really seems to think that the only aspirational people in this country are those who wish to own an investment property. We are aspirational for all Australians, no matter who you are or where you come from. The people in my community in Melbournes west are aspirational too. There is aspiration in every corner of my electorate. There are people working hard now to aspire to something better in the future for themselves and their family, right up and down the income ladder. People in Melbournes west work hard every day to look after their family and their community. They are aspirational, working hard now and aspiring to something better for themselves and their family. When I think of aspirational Australians, I think of Vietnamese Australian manufacturing workers in my electorate, working hard for decades—I think of one person in particular, working hard so that his daughter could get the grades she needed to become a doctor. I think of an Indian Australian truck driver, working hard, putting in the overtime to save the money that he needs to start his own business. I think of the Afghan Australian refugee working hard in a logistics job so that his sixyearold daughter could attend school for the very first time ever. I think of the Chinese Australian mum who has been able to continue with her career progression because of our cheaper child care reforms and paid parental leave. If someones aspiration is to buy an investment property, good luck to them. Theres nothing wrong with that. Thats great. But, if youre an MP in this House and thats the only aspiration that you can see, youre selling our country short; youre selling Australians short. Parents who are sacrificing everything to give their children the very best future they possibly can all deserve a tax cut, and theyll get one, thanks to the Albanese government, because we are delivering a tax cut to all Australians. Were delivering costofliving relief, no matter who you are or what you do. This is a tax cut right up and down the income ladder, which will fuel the aspirations of everyone, not only in my community but across Australia. Its part of an economic strategy that deals with the challenges of the present, while also preparing our nation to succeed in the future.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WATTS (Gellibrand—Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs) ","(17:58):"

My single parent, my mum, was at that time a doctor—a cardiothoracic surgeon, to be precise, a qualification that took her the better part of 20 years to acquire, with undergraduate study in medicine and science over seven years, five years of general surgical training and two years as a specialist fellow training at the Alfred, followed by two years at the Mass General in Boston and six months at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto in Canada, before she brought her skills back home to Australia and had me.  Having me, of course, was a huge risk for a woman who had just embarked on a career surrounded by men with not too much expectation of women being around, and, in particular, not forthright, bloody smart women like my mother coming into their midst. As I have explained elsewhere, in my first speech to this place, she went to extraordinary lengths to make sure I was safe and fed while she went back to work. My mum took just two weeks off when she had me, not because she was desperate to get back to work—even though my mother is the very definition of a careerist woman. She went back to work because she had to. Being selfemployed, as most specialist surgeons are, she knew that no work equals no money. So mum picked up the plumbing tools, as she would so often describe her surgical instruments, a week or so postpartum and went back to the operating theatre and the hospital wards. She would take me with her on the weekends to visit the patients on Saturdays and Sundays, and in the school holidays I would sit in her consulting suite and, in truly terrible handwriting, take patients histories. In hindsight, I thank them for their patience, as I would interrogate their smoking and drinking habits and their next of kin and diligently write down their sixdigit phone numbers. When I got a bit older, sometimes her team would let me into the operating theatre. Fully dressed up in all the garb you need, I would stand on a small ladder and peer over the shoulders of the doctors and nurses and see their remarkable skill at work, with the human form converted into science and art. The patients would wake up an hour or so later in recovery and, like a cheery oompaloompa, I would greet them with glee. It was my job to tell mum that they were awake so she could go in and check on how they were faring. More than once, I think, some went back to sleep, or maybe just passed out, wondering if theyd been in a dream where the doctors had all converted into midgets. But on the night of 5 March 1983 my mum looked ashen. I couldnt understand why. Mum, why dont you look happy? As the Hawke landslide rolled in, mum quietly said: Itll be okay. Its just going to be harder for me to send you to school now. School was, of course, my world, my safe space, my joy, my mates, my curiosity and a fun park for a galloping brain, but it was also my parent—the parent Mum could not always be because, at least it felt this way at the time, her patients always came first. Every night after school she would spend hour after hour talking on the phone to the patients, their families, other doctors, oncologists and physicians. And words that would never normally appear in a 10yearolds vocabulary, like adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, mesothelioma—I knew them all, and I knew exactly which words to listen out for to work out whether the conversation she was about to start on the phone after dinner was going to be a difficult one or an optimistic one. You see, my mother did medicine the hard way. She charged patients who were in tough times the Medicare rebate, and sometimes not at all. She frowned on colleagues who charged the AMA rates. She watched her earnings carefully, and I realised sometime later that she did this so that she was able to send me to a good school—a great school—that did some of the parenting she could not always be available to do so that, when she couldnt be there to pick me up from school after play practice, debating or netball, which, frankly, was more often than not, someone would make sure I wasnt forgotten and got home. Dont get me wrong—I should be fair—Liberal to the bootstraps, my mum loved Hawkey. There was something about his large, larrikin and articulate brilliance that cheered her greatly. But that night her pale face was all about what it meant for her ability to make ends meet and, specifically, it was all about Labors approach to taxation policy. So, when I come to this place and talk about Labors approach to taxation policy and its impact on aspiration, you know it comes from a little kid looking at her mothers face, thinking, Seriously? Could you work any harder? Australia is founded on aspiration. Sure, many were compelled to come here, but most came here willingly for a better chance for them and their families to get ahead in ways they could not in the country where they started out. Its what makes us so successful: having a go and taking a risk. I see that spirit across my electorate of Flinders every day—the small business, independent contractor and tradie heaven that Flinders is. We live well, surrounded by the sand, the hills and the sea, but people work their guts out. I see it every day. People in Flinders still want to own a home. Its still a common aspiration. Roughly 40 per cent of my electorate own their home, 34 per cent have mortgages and about 20 per cent rent. High rates of home ownership have excellent outcomes for social cohesion and continuity when it comes to community participation. Its one of the reasons we have thriving footy clubs like the Somerville Junior Football Club. Its one of the reasons we have wellloved and muchused mens sheds, like the one I visited in Blairgowrie just before Christmas. Its why our rotary clubs are full and fantastic, as demonstrated by the Rotary Club of Mt Martha on Australia Day, and also in their generous and constant reach and assistance across the peninsula. Dont get me started on my local Probus clubs, where retired leaders across the spectrum of Australian industry share their wisdom on contemporary issues. I thank the Probus Club of Main Ridge for their recent invitation to talk about social media. But with each day the aspiration of home ownership in my electorate gets harder to realise. On 3 February the Herald Sun published a table, based on PropTrack data, setting out what you need to earn to be able to buy a house or unit in Flinders, assuming a 20 per cent deposit, which is what you need to avoid mortgage lenders insurance, and a 6.2 per cent interest rate, even though at present some interest rates are as high as nine per cent. To buy a house in Somerville you need to earn $159,000 a year. To buy a house in Crib Point or Tyabb you need to earn $152,000 a year. To buy a house in Capel Sound you need to earn $144,000 a year. To buy a house in Hastings you need to earn $137,000 a year. These are entrypoint homes in my electorate of Flinders. If you want to buy in McCrae, Mornington, Mt Martha, Safety Beach or Rye, you have to earn more than $200,000 a year. Families striving to buy or pay down a mortgage in Crib Point or Capel Sound are not the rich or the top end, as Labors demonisation of this demographic would have you believe. They are working their butts off making ends meet, and yet they are exactly the people Labor will tell you arent deserving of keeping their own money in their own pocket to use as they see fit. I am so tired of hearing about Labors tax cuts. Theyre all weve heard about for two weeks. But these arent Labors tax cuts; theyre the coalitions tax cuts with some crafty, selfserving, ideological class warfare bait and switch at the last minute, designed to win a byelection in my neighbouring electorate of Dunkley: Heres the sugar pill on 1 July. Ignore my broken promises, all 100 of them, to deliver the stage 3 tax cuts in full. Ignore all my broken promises on energy bills, where I told you youd get a $275 discount. Ignore my promise back in 2018 to electrify the rail line to Baxter. Let me read you the now Prime Ministers press release dated 31 July 2018—bless him, because its still on his website—in which Anthony Albanese, as shadow minister for infrastructure, said: A … Labor Government will move quickly to deliver the muchneeded Frankston to Baxter Rail Upgrade, building on the significant investment the Andrews Labor Government has made in Frankston infrastructure. Federal Labor is an advocate of the electrification and duplication of the Stony Point Line to Baxter to improve train services for commuters across Dunkley and on the Mornington Peninsula. In 2016, Federal Labor committed funding for a business case to ensure the project could proceed as soon as possible upon the election of a Federal Labor Government. Hmm. Currently thousands of Dunkley and Peninsula residents drive and park at Frankston, Kananook or Seaford stations because the Metro line service ends at Frankston. A Federal Labor Government will electrify and duplicate the track to Baxter, giving commuters better access to high quality public transport and parkandride options. It sounds great, but the Prime Minister cancelled funding for this project—all $225 million that the coalition had provided for it back in budgets past—after his 90day review, which then became a 200day review, and he snatched $300 million out of infrastructure from the Mornington Peninsula to pad highways somewhere around the current infrastructure ministers electorate of Ballarat. A couple of weeks ago, I joined the Leader of the Opposition, Peter Dutton, together with our sensational candidate for the byelection in Dunkley, Nathan Conroy, to announce a future coalition government would provide up to $900 million to electrify the rail line and reduce parking congestion around Frankston. It will also provide study and work opportunities for my residents in Baxter and, in time, further down the Stony Point line. Here we are fixing yet another broken Albanese government promise, like the hundred promises he made before to keep the stage 3 tax cuts in full. Today on the front page of the Australian we read that Labors deception will hit the middle ground, not the superrich or the top end as the Prime Minister would like you to think the tradies, subbies, landscapers and smallbusiness families in my electorate are. Patrick Commins and Geoff Chambers write on the front page of the Australian today: Sparkies, paramedics, police officers and accountants will be longterm losers under Labors stage three tax changes, as a major credit rating agency says Anthony Albaneses revamped tax cuts will likely be more inflationary than Scott Morrisons original plan. Under Labors tax changes, electricians, school principals, cops, train drivers and others will pay more tax under the proposed legislation in a decade, analysis by The Australian has revealed. Bigger tax cuts for middleincome earners promoted by the Prime Minister and Jim Chalmers are projected to erode over time as bracket creep captures more Australians under a higher 37c tax rate. In 10 years, Australians earning the equivalent of more than $104,000 today will be worse off under Labors redistribution of the tax relief. Oh, dear. The truth comes out again. Labor deceived the Australian people when it went to the election in May 2022 with a suite of what can only be called Liberallite propositions. As we have seen over the last year, can you trust Labor on energy policy? You cannot. As we have seen over the last few months, can you trust Labor on defence, national security or community safety? No, you cannot. As we will see with this bill today, can you trust them on taxation policy? No, you cannot. Add to that the avalanche of industrial relations and employment changes designed to stifle innovation, risktaking, growth and productivity in the small and mediumbusiness sector. In this place, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Tony Bring Back the Beeper Burke, is singlehandedly, although encouraged and abetted by his union masters, strangling the lifeblood of Australias smallbusiness sector, crushing ambition and the great Australian courage in having a go and creating an opportunity for others. The opposition will not oppose this bill. After all, without the opposition and its nineyear term of careful management of the Australian economy, there would be no tax cuts today. I cant remember the last time Labor delivered tax cuts. I do vaguely remember Prime Minister Paul Keating reassuring the Australian people before the 1993 election that the tax cuts he promised werent just a promise; they were the law—law law. But then, in what appears to be a crafty but now customary switcheroo for the Australian Labor Party, Keating went off to the National Press Club after the election and told everyone that hed had another think and that it couldnt be done anymore. Does that sound familiar? The Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, equally said he had a mandate for this change to the legislated tax cuts programmed by the coalition. And how did he get the renewed mandate? He went down to the National Press Club. Well, blow me down. If you can just fundamentally break a contract with the Australian people by going to the Press Club, why didnt anyone tell us? Last time we decided to change taxation policy, we gave the electorate the chance to throw us out both at the 1998 election, at which the proposed GST introduction and the choice the Australian public had were made clear to them, and then immediately afterwards at the 2001 election. That is transparency, that is accountability, and in that the Australian Labor Party has a lot to learn.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms McKENZIE (Flinders) ","(18:09):"
385,0,0,0,1,1,"Elliot, Justine MP","DZW","Richmond","ALP","N/A",906," I too rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, and I am very pleased to be speaking on this very important bill. It is very important because this bill means that all 13.6 million Australian taxpayers will receive a tax cut from 1 July this year. Of course, this is on top of the Albanese Labor governments costofliving relief, which is already being delivered right across the country in the form of cheaper medicines, more bulkbilling, cheaper child care, feefree TAFE, building more social and affordable homes, and increasing rent assistance. These, combined with the tax cuts, are vitally important.  These tax cuts mean, for example, that in my electorate on the New South Wales North Coast every taxpayer will receive a tax cut this year. In fact, 71,000 taxpayers in Richmond will receive that tax cut, with the average tax cut being $1,384. I will just put in perspective what our tax cuts are delivering compared to what we saw previously with the Liberals and Nationals. Under our plan, under these new tax cuts, 61,000 residents in my electorate will receive a bigger tax cut than they would have otherwise under the Liberals and Nationals. That is a huge amount for my electorate, and what a difference it will make for people. Certainly there has been a very positive response from my community in terms of the fact that Labor is delivering these tax cuts for so many people across the community. Our tax cuts are very good for Middle Australia, good for working families, good for women, good for helping with costofliving pressures, good for labour supply and good for the economy. The tax cuts will make a real difference for those 13.6 million taxpayers who will be receiving that tax cut—2.9 million more than would have benefited under the previous governments plans. That means 11.5 million taxpayers will receive a bigger tax cut, and it means that 5.8 million women will receive a bigger tax cut. People such as nurses, teachers and police are some of the most likely to benefit, with more than 95 per cent of those taxpayers getting a bigger tax cut. I want to discuss this in the context of Labors strong support for workers and improving working conditions right across the board. Whether its job security or working conditions, it is only Labor that consistently delivers this support. Particularly, our righttodisconnect laws are vitally important for workers across the country, and that is especially true for police and emergency service personnel. I am a former frontline police officer, and I know how important it is for police to have really good working conditions in place, especially the right to disconnect. What are we seeing? We are seeing the opposition leader opposing it and claiming that he will repeal it. We finally see an election policy from the Liberals and Nationals, and what is it? Theyre going to repeal all these laws that create better working conditions for Australians, including the right to disconnect. Thats really appalling when it comes to police officers. I can tell you, as a former police officer, how important it is to have those working conditions in place to make sure that police have that worklife balance. Our police do an amazing job under often very difficult circumstances, and it is Labor who backs them. It really shows how out of touch the opposition leader is that he wants to repeal these laws. It is quite disturbing and appalling. Yesterday we saw the Police Federation of Australia come out and condemn the opposition for their stance. In fact, they have said that the oppositions measures are disrespectful and wrong. I stand with the Police Federation of Australia and I stand with all police officers. Indeed, many of the former police colleagues I have spoken to also condemn the opposition leader for wanting to take away important workplace rules. As I said, our police work very hard, and Labor delivers for them, whether its their working conditions or their tax cuts. For example, a police officer on $110,000 a year will now get a tax cut of $2,400 under Labor. We certainly stand with our police forces, but the opposition leader doesnt, and he is certainly out of touch. In terms of tax cuts, parents, particularly those with young children, will be meaningfully supported to return to work under the governments tax cut changes through increases to their takehome pay. I want to speak about what a positive impact this will particularly have for women. I am very proud to represent a government that is absolutely committed to gender equality. First and foremost, let me emphasise our governments resolute dedication to take real action on gender equality. We understand that achieving true equality requires more than just words; it demands concrete steps to achieve that real change. Our commitment to gender equality is directly reflected in these tax cuts, because every single taxpaying woman in this country will receive a tax cut. Now, thanks to this government, 90 per cent of taxpaying women will receive an even bigger tax cut, and that certainly will make a huge difference. These targeted measures are essential in narrowing the gender pay gap and promoting economic equality. As Ive said, Labors new tax plan is part of a suite of costofliving relief for women. Over our past two budgets weve made significant investments to support women across various sectors and right across the board, through investment in child care, paid parental leave, womens safety, family law, workplace safety, womens health and fair wages. We have placed women at the centre of our economic agenda, whether it be through the Jobs and Skills Summit, the employment white paper or recommendations from our Womens Economic Equality Taskforce, along with analysis contained in the white paper, integral to developing our national strategy to achieve gender equality. By investing in womens education, training and entrepreneurship, were not only fostering economic growth were creating a much more equitable society for all. As a government we are committed to leading the charge and change and creating a future where every individual—everyone, regardless of gender—has the opportunity to fulfil their potential. It is through this commitment to real change that we can do that. As I said, these tax cuts have widespread benefits. Under the proposed changes, taxpayers earning less than $45,000 will now receive a larger tax cut. This will significantly boost the takehome pay of Australians on modest incomes and people working part time. Someone on the average wage in Australia, which is around $73,000, will now get a tax cut of more than $1,500 a year, which is more than double what they would have received under the Liberals and Nationals. This is particularly important for those living in regional and rural Australia. As we know, people in these communities earn less than people in the city, so it makes a huge difference percentagewise for people living in regional areas like mine and throughout regional and rural Australia. Labor are always very cognisant of making sure we are delivering for people in country Australia. We know how important that is. These tax cuts will make a huge difference, and our changes will also deliver a better, more progressive tax system. By dropping two tax rates and lifting two thresholds, were giving everyone a tax cut and providing a significant amount of help right across the board. The Albanese Labor government are introducing these changes because we recognise the economic realities of 2024. Australians are under real pressure right now and deserve a tax plan that responds to the challenges they are facing every day. Im sure we all agree that five years ago, when the coalition initially legislated these stage 3 tax cuts, we were in a very different place. That was before the pandemic, before persistent inflation, before higher interest rates, before global conflicts and before global uncertainty. All of those factors have put Australians under much more sustained costofliving pressures. From talking to people, we know the costofliving pressures they are experiencing. When circumstances change, changing policy is the responsible thing to do to provide support to people. Cutting taxes is one measure that can help provide costofliving relief. We are getting wages moving again, bringing inflation under control and driving fairer prices for Australian consumers. Also, really importantly, we are providing costofliving relief in the form of energy bill relief, cheaper medicines, more income support and the biggest boost to rental assistance in 30 years. We spent more than $20 billion on that costofliving measures package. We are providing this costofliving relief in a responsible way that doesnt add to inflationary pressures, while laying the foundations for a stronger and more resilient economy. This bill is all about delivering a tax cut for every taxpayer and more tax relief for people to help with costofliving pressures. Weve heard a measure of negativity from all the opposition speakers. They dont like our changes. Theyd prefer wages to be lower. We know that Liberals and Nationals want Australians to work more for less money. We dont. We want to assist them by giving them tax cuts and ensuring theyve got costofliving relief because, in comparison to the Liberals and Nationals, Labor are absolutely committed to providing support for Australians through tax cuts and costofliving relief. In conclusion, I am very proud to be speaking on this bill because it will have a real impact and deliver real assistance to people by providing tax cuts right across the country. It will be particularly good for people in regional and rural Australia and will have a major impact on and provide benefits to women in our society. I commend the bill to the House.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ELLIOT (Richmond—Assistant Minister for Social Services and Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence) ","(18:23):"
386,0,0,0,1,1,"Willcox, Andrew MP",286535,"Dawson","LNP","N/A",907," I rise today to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024. My word is my bond. Weve all heard this statement and we all know who said it. But it has now come to light that this is not the case. The Prime Minister has gone back on his word, changed his mind and flipflopped again. As a matter of fact, hes done more flipflops than a Moscow circus and told more stories—tall stories, I might add—than Charles Dickens.  The government asked Treasury to look at some options, including revising stage 3 tax cuts, on 11 December. But, following that, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer stated at least a dozen times that they hadnt changed their position, including when the Prime Minister said, We are not reconsidering that position. What a fibber. But were getting used to this. Were getting used to the tall stories and the deceit from the other side. What about the reduction of $275 in power prices that was promised before the election? This wasnt a slip of the tongue by the Prime Minister. He stated this 97 times. So were getting used to the Prime Minister just saying whatever he feels like whenever he feels like it. But what Im really concerned about is this: What is this teaching our younger generation? What example does that set? How hard is this for the teachers who are saying: Boys and girls, you must tell the truth. Boys and girls, do the right thing? Theyd be thinking, Why do I have to do that, when we have an example like our Prime Minister? who, lets face it, is very, very careless with the truth. Noone will be left behind. Thats another broken promise, because everyone today in Australia is worse off under this Labor government. Australians are living in a Laborcreated costofliving crisis. On this side of the House, weve been talking about the dire situation for Australian families for months, but it seems the penny has only just dropped for the Albanese Labor government. Now theyve finally caught up, but theyre not going to do anything about it till July. The Australian people cant wait. They need help now. I realise the Prime Minister was totally focused on his referendum, a referendum that was designed to divide the nation on the basis of race—and what happened? A $450 million spend of taxpayers money on the failed referendum. Australians have seen their living standards collapse by 8.6 per cent, or $8,000, under this hapless Albanese Labor government. If you have a mortgage, its a lot more than that. Everything has been going up under Labor, including power prices. What they tried to do with power prices clearly didnt work. Power prices are actually increasing. Interest rates have been increasing, increasing, increasing. The Albanese Labor government seem to blame everyone else. They tried to blame Putin. They tried to blame the invasion of Ukraine. They try to blame anything they can think of. Its a wonder theyre not blaming lightning strikes in Zimbabwe! But what is really happening here is that Labor are enhancing the inflation. Theyve spent another $209 billion that theyve added into this economy. While theyre telling you at home to pull your belt in and do the right thing and be conservative in your household, theyre just spraying it around willynilly—$209 billion extra. Grocery prices have gone up on their watch by nearly 10 per cent, and fruit and veggie prices have gone through the roof. Thats why the Nationals demanded that the ACCC do an inquiry into what farmers are receiving at the farm gate versus what the big supermarkets—Coles, Woolworths, IGA—are selling it for. This was very sensible policy to thresh out, because what happens in a supplyanddemand situation when the supermarkets charge too much? People cant afford to buy something. It sits on the shelf. Then farmers do not get a return. But, if we do this and actually keep our farmers farming and give them the right return on their investment, they will then be able to grow more and stay in business longer, and the average taxpayer will end up better off at the checkout. These tax changes are a political response from the government, not a costofliving response. This is more about the Dunkley byelection than a genuine tax reform, but Australians can see through this deceitful Prime Minister. An analysis done by the Australian has revealed that, under Labors tax changes, many essential workers will pay more under the proposed legislation in the next 10 years. Those who are at risk of having less money in their pockets are electricians, school principals, paramedics, police officers, train and tram drivers, engineers, construction managers—and the list goes on. Sparkies, paramedics, police officers and more will be longterm losers under Labors stage 3 tax cuts. As a major credit rating agency says, Anthony Albaneses revamped tax cuts will more likely be inflationary than the original plan. The proposed tax cuts will leave essential workers worse off in the future as their average tax rates push higher and bracket creep captures more Australians. Last week we heard from the Treasurer that these changes will mean more relief for workers to help with the cost of living. The truckies, the nurses and the police officers will get a bigger tax cut. What the Treasurer forgot to mention was that these benefits will be temporary and our essential frontline workers will lose out in the long run. By 2034—just 10 years away—66 professions that are reportedly going to benefit from these proposed tax cuts will be worse off and paying more under Labors illthoughtout changes. This is less about genuine tax reform and more about shortterm political tactics. A report released by SMP Global said the Labor governments proposed tax cuts could be more inflationary than the initial coalition governments proposed stage 3 tax cuts. If the Albanese government is true in its intention to help Australians, why did they abolish the low and middleincome tax offset? This tax offset, which delivered a tax break of up to $1,500 for people earning up to $126,000, was quietly stopped by this tricky Albanese Labor government in June 2022. But many people didnt realise this and the massive impact it may have on their home budget—until they receive their 20222023 tax refund, which will either be drastically smaller or disappear altogether, or theyll be lumped with a tax bill. And this is right in the middle of a Laborcreated costofliving crisis. The low and middleincome tax offset did exactly what it was called. It provided a tax offset for low or middleincome earners: anyone with a taxable income of $126,000 or less. This offset varied depending on your income. Let me put it in simple terms. Earners of less than $37,000 received $675. For earners of between $37,001 and $48,000, the offset increased steadily up to $1,500. Earners of income between $48,001 and $90,000 received the full $1,500, and gradually this became less, with no offset at the end, at $126,000. Again I ask the question: if the Albanese Labor government want the income earner to keep more, why would they be abolishing something that is designed specifically for the low and middleincome earners? The coalition is committed to lower, simpler and fairer taxes, which is why we will not oppose the reduction in the 19c tax rate to 16c. We are the party of lower taxes. We are the party of business. We are the party that can manage money. My fundamental belief is that in this country you should be able to earn a quid and, more importantly, keep a quid. We support small business. Small business is the backbone of the nation. When youre in small business and you finish your day and sit down with maybe a beer or a wine, or, if youre fortunate enough, a Bundy and Coke, you can say, Hey, we did all right today, so lets expand our business, or lets put someone else on. Thats how wealth is created in this country. The coalition is committed to going to the next election with a tax reform package that will keep the stage 3 tax cuts reform. It will be a package that will give immediate relief and also pass the longterm test. We are committed to fighting bracket creep. We are the party of aspiration, because, when there is incentive, people will work hard and strive to accomplish their best. We, on this side of the House, understand that hard work supports a strong economy, and we want every Australian to get ahead. But what we all know, and what everybody knows, is that we have a Prime Minister who tells porky pies. I will finish with a poem that best sums up the Prime Minister, and I will respect the parliament and the parliamentary procedure with what I say here. The poem is quite simple. Untruther, untruther, pants on fire.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WILLCOX (Dawson) ","(18:34):"
387,0,0,0,1,1,"Zappia, Tony MP","HWB","Makin","ALP","N/A",909," In my time in this place, I do not recall a piece of legislation coming before us that has caused so much indecision and vacillation amongst coalition members. In fact, listening to the speeches—and Ive listened to quite a few of them—its clear that they are all over the place with their response to this legislation. The fact is that this is good legislation. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 has the support of the majority of Australians. It is good legislation because it is the right thing to do, and members opposite know that. That is why they are in such confusion.  The reality is that coalition members dont really want to support this legislation, but they know they have to because the Australian people would not forgive them if they didnt. They come into the chamber, trying to justify their support on one hand, while on the other hand looking at how they can criticise it. The reality is that this legislation has the support of the Australian people because 84 per cent of Australian taxpayers will be better off under Labors stage 3 tax cuts. Nearly seven in eight taxpayers will be better off under this legislation. Nine out of 10 women taxpayers will be better off under this legislation. Every taxpayer gets a tax break. That includes those earning less than $45,000, who are probably in the greatest need bracket out there and who would have got nothing under the coalition governments stage 3 tax cuts. Most importantly, this legislation addresses one of the key features that is debated and discussed in this parliament each and every day, and that is the cost of living, because this legislation provides costofliving relief to more families struggling and unable to make ends meet. It goes directly towards addressing one of the issues that we have debated in this place over recent months more than any other. I hear members opposite who come into the chamber and, quite rightly, point out that the cost of living is affecting people in their community. They talk about the hardship that those people are experiencing. But what I dont hear are the solutions for how to deal with those costofliving hardships. I simply hear criticism of the government but no meaningful solutions being put on the table. If they genuinely cared about those people who are doing it tough, perhaps they would come in and propose some solutions and urge the government to take them up or embrace them so that we could, in fact, provide the help that they believe the people out there in the community actually need. It begs the question: if they really dont want to support this legislation—I listened to the last speaker say that there are so many faults with it, that in years to come people will actually be worse off and so on—why are they actually supporting it? Why are they coming into this place and saying, Well support it, but its terrible legislation? Really, its either one or the other. You cant have it both ways. The reality is that deep down they know that the Albanese government has responded to the needs of the community and is doing the right thing by modifying the stage 3 tax cuts in the way that it has. What it will mean is that its not only good for individuals but good for the economy more broadly, and that ultimately flows back to more certainty and security for people throughout Australia. If people are going to get a bigger tax break, they will keep more of the money they earn. If people keep more of the money they earn, it is more likely that they will take on more work and do more hours. It is more likely that they will get involved in employment to a much higher level than they otherwise would because they know that they will keep more of what they earn. I heard the last speaker talk about small business. Can I say I totally accept that small business throughout Australia is so important. It is important to the individual business owners who, in many cases, have invested their life savings. The services they provide are critical to local communities, and throughout the country small business is probably the single biggest employer if viewed as an industry sector. This will be good for small business, because most of the money that is going back in the form of tax breaks will go to people that are in the greatest need—people who will spend that money on goods and services in their local community. That means that it is money that will go directly into the small businesses in and around the communities where these people live. So this legislation is not only good for individuals but also good for small business and the economic results. Once those small businesses do better, they can remain viable too. They will employ more people. As we all know, small businesses are also the greatest supporters of the local community facilities and sports facilities in and around them, so the whole community benefits because of it. Under the stage 3 tax cuts that were proposed by the previous government, most of the money would have gone to the top end of earners. That means that that money would very likely have been spent in larger amounts on, perhaps, overseas holidays or luxury goods, which dont give that same level of support to the small businesses that those opposite claim they are so concerned about. We often talk about the cost of living being blamed on or attributed to the inflationary pressures on providers of goods and services—that is, inflation drives up the cost of living. But that is not always the case. From my observations, some providers of goods and services are simply exploiting the costofliving narrative and using it as an excuse to jack up their prices. That also applies to local, state and federal governments, who are also increasing their fees and charges. In some places and at some times, they are doing so to an unreasonable level, because they know they can. They dont operate in a competitive environment, and they simply do so because theyre able to. Of course, there are also businesses that engage in pricegouging. Again, weve heard plenty of comment about that. Can I say it is not just the two major supermarket chains that are doing that; it is happening across the board in so many different areas. I refer to airlines—Im sure every member in this place will be able to understand where Im going with this—where airline prices, at times, have been absolutely exorbitant and unnecessarily so. Were seeing it in the banks. I saw today that one of the largest major banks, the CBA, has suggested that its profits will only be some $5 billion. All of the four major banks made record profits last year, yet their fees and charges dont ever seem to come down, nor do their interest charges when the Reserve Bank cash rate moves. They are very quick to put it up but not so quick to bring it back down. Theyre still making huge profits whilst they cut their services and increase their charges. Energy retailers are doing exactly the same. We also see it with medical professionals, and consultants and professionals in other areas. They know that people are perhaps in a corner, with no option but to use their service, and they just charge whatever they like. Unfortunately, whether its someone whos trapped because they have a medical problem and have to see a specialist of some sort or whether its someone caught up in a bank loan, sometimes people have nowhere else to go and have to wear the unnecessarily high charges that are imposed on them. We also know that inequality in this country is increasing and has been over the last decade or so. I want to quote from a media release about an Oxfam report from January 2023. I know it is one year old, but the trend in the statistics pretty much explains what is happening right now. The report highlights how the superrich are getting richer at the expense of the worlds poor. Ill quote from the release, because there are two or three sentences in it that I think sum up how the world is travelling and show how here in Australia we are falling back even further than other countries with respect to inequality. It says: The richest 1 percent grabbed nearly twothirds of all new wealth— that is, $42 trillion— created since 2020— only a twoyear period— almost twice as much money as the bottom 99 percent of the worlds population Thats one of Oxfams statements. They also say: During the past decade, the richest 1 percent had captured around half of all new wealth. The third quote is: The report shows that 95 food and energy corporations have more than doubled their profits in 2022. The last quote, which I believe is the critical one relating to this legislation and inflation more broadly, is: Excess corporate profits have driven at least half of inflation in Australia, the US and the UK. Ill repeat that: excess corporate profits have driven at least half of inflation in Australia, the US and the UK. The point being made by that quote and by the report is that the inflationary pressures are coming from those people who are price gouging in what they are charging. They are making superprofits whilst people struggle, and governments have to fill the gap by providing different kinds of services in order to help the public they represent. Another quote from the same release is: The World Bank says we are likely seeing the biggest increase in global inequality and poverty since WW2. That trend is equally evident in Australia today. When so much wealth in this country is being pocketed by the top 10 per cent of income earners, whilst less than seven per cent of real per adult economic growth goes to the rest of the people, that is absolutely something to worry about. With respect to what has happened over the last decade, it was members opposite who were in government. It wasnt this side of the House who were in office; it was a coalition government that allowed inequality to grow as it has. The issue of price gouging is obviously of concern, and there are inquiries taking place right now with respect to groceries and the like. Back in 1973, the Whitlam government brought in the Prices Justification Tribunal. That tribunal was subsequently done away with, but it seems to me that there is a good case for something similar being reinstated in this country. All too often I hear concerns from people across my electorate—and Im sure other members hear the same—about the price gouging going on across a whole range of areas. There is only one way to fix it, and that is to have a proper commission or tribunal in place with the authority to act when price gouging occurs. In the time I have left I want to respond briefly to some of points made by opposition speakers with respect to this legislation. One of them is bracket creep. I say to members opposite: bracket creep has always been a part of and a problem with the Australian taxation system, and it is a matter that can and should be addressed separately from this legislation. It has nothing to do with the legislation before us in a direct sense. It is something that certainly is worthy of being discussed, but it can be addressed separately. Members talk about bracket creep and the difference it will make in 10 years time, but theres a lot of water to go under the bridge in the next 10 years. I dont have a crystal ball—and neither does anyone else here—as to what might be the case with respect to the tax thats being paid then. The other issue is that real wages have fallen, and Ive heard members talk about that. Again, what did members opposite do when they were in government to support wage growth in this country? Absolutely nothing. Wages stagnated under their watch. In fact, I have never heard any member opposite come in and talk about increasing and improving wages for workers throughout this country. Ive heard them talking about the lowincome tax offset that was brought in by their government and how we could have continued it. It was never intended to continue past 2022. Their government brought it in as a shortterm measure, and we simply applied that policy when Labor came to office. The last thing I will talk about is aspiration. How insulting is it to suggest that people on low incomes do not have aspiration and that its only people on high incomes who do? This is good legislation. It complements other measures that this government has brought in to try and help with cost of living, such as cheaper child care, tripling the GP bulkbilling incentive, cheaper medicines, energy bill relief, rent assistance and so on. Its good legislation. Thats why members opposite are supporting it, and thats why the Australian public are supporting it even more strongly.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ZAPPIA (Makin) ","(18:46):"
388,0,0,0,1,1,"Wilson, Rick MP",198084,"OConnor","LP","N/A",911," I thank the member for Makin, who raised a couple of points that Ill touch on at the start. Firstly, he mentioned the low and middleincome tax offset, which, yes, was a temporary measure that was brought in by the previous coalition government during times of extreme uncertainty and financial stress for many people in the middle of the COVID pandemic. It did have a sunset clause, but it is up to governments to look at the situation and review whether such sunset clauses are appropriate. Last year, when inflation was running rampant and cost of living was really starting to bite households across the country, all we heard the government talk about was the Voice. We didnt hear them mention the low and middleincome tax offset once. It would have been a very simple thing for the Treasurer, in his budget, to have a look at the situation and the costofliving squeeze that Australian families were under and to extend the low and middleincome tax offset for an undefined period until we came out at the other side of this current financial crisis. Thank you, Member for Makin, for raising the low and middleincome tax offset. I dont think its been aired and ventilated enough during this debate.  I stand today to support the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024. Its in my DNA that lower taxes are better for everybody in this nation, whether they be lowincome earners or highincome earners. The more money can be left in the pay packets of Australian workers, the better, and I will support that every time. I would prefer it if the bill had been named the stage 3 costofliving tax cuts, because that would have reminded people that it was preceded by stage 1 and stage 2, which were part of the overall package. I dont have the numbers in front of me, but I recall from the debate back when the initial package was passed that someone on $60,000 a year received, over both stages, around $2,000 additional in their pay packet, reducing their tax burden from around $10,000 to $8,000. On top of that, as Ive previously mentioned, they also received the low and middleincome tax offset during that period of great uncertainty and difficulty during the COVID pandemic. That puts a bit of perspective on this particular debate, where weve come from and where we are today. We cant discuss this issue and talk about this legislation without looking at the issue of trust. There are 1.3 million Australians who will be worse off after this legislation passes. They had legislated tax cuts they had been looking at for the last five years. They have been thinking: Okay, if I go that extra five, 10 yards on buying the house, I will be receiving a significant tax cut on 1 July 2024, so I will factor that into my household budget. Ill factor putting the kid into an independent school. I want to give them the best opportunity. They did that on the basis that on 1 July 2024 they would receive a tax cut, and that was reassured I think over 100 times by the Prime Minister—that that tax cut would take place. He looked down the barrel of a camera on many occasions and assured those 1.2 million Australians. Those on the other side dont have a lot of time for people who are earning highlevel incomes over $135,000, but the fact is they voted for that legislation five years ago, and those people who were banking on that extra income had every right to believe the Prime Minister. They had every right to think that on 1 July 2024 they would be receiving extra money in their pay packets. Budgets were done around that, plans were made, and today we are debating taking those tax cuts away from them, tax cuts that have been enshrined in legislation for five years now. That is the most egregious broken promise that I have seen in my 10 years in this place. The Australian people generally cut politicians a bit of slack. They understand that sometimes situations change. But when they have been reassured over 100 times, as recently as the middle of January, that these tax cuts wouldnt be tampered with then the Australian people, not just the 1.3 million people who wont be receiving those tax cuts, generally will take a fairly dim view of that. They will look at the motivation for it. It is all about cost of living now. We are hearing Labor members stand up in question time and in 90second statements, and it is all about cost of living. Last year it was all about the Voice; we barely heard the phrase cost of living in this place. The cynics out there, and there are probably a few cynics in here, might think, Weve got a byelection coming up in Dunkley and perhaps the polling isnt looking all that good. Perhaps the message was coming through that cost of living was really starting to bite in electorates like Dunkley. So all of a sudden we have a complete backflip on a promise, on a piece of legislation that has been enshrined for the last five years, a few weeks out from a byelection. There are a lot of people out there who are thinking the motivation for this is not quite as altruistic as it might have been made out to be in this place over the last few days. It might be something a little more base—that is, to try to get over the line in Dunkley and save Prime Ministers job. We have heard a lot about the cost of living and how it is impacting on families and I see that across my electorate. There is no question about that. These tax cuts for the lower and middleincome people will be greatly appreciated. I have no problem with that—good on them—and Im glad that we can support this legislation. But I also feel that those 1.3 million Australians who had every right to bank on those tax cuts coming through on 1 July have been betrayed. The coalition, while we are supporting these tax cuts, will be taking a tax package to the next election which will deliver lower, simpler and fairer taxes. That is something that the coalition has been committed to since day one of my election. We need to fight bracket creep. Once again, my friend the member for Makin mentioned bracket creep as if its something thats a bit too hard: Its been part of the landscape for a long time, so lets keep it separate from this particular debate. But the whole point of the tax package that was voted for by the coalition and the Labor Party—stages 1, 2 and 3—was to deliver tax cuts but also to address bracket creep. Of course, by taking away those stage 3 tax cuts were back to the old situation when somebody progresses up through the ranks, gets a promotion, works a bit harder, gets a new job that pays a bit better—and for people in my electorate of OConnor, the mining industry is a great opportunity for people to get into those higherpaying jobs—and hits $135,000 a year. I know people in here say theyre filthyrich people who dont deserve a break, but there are a lot of people in my electorate on that sort of money who are hardworking miners, truck drivers and farmers—people who work really hard and do earn a good quid, and good on em; they deserve to keep every cent. They deserve, as they move up through the ranks and earn more money, which everybody aspires to, to keep the bulk of that money, rather than have it taken back through bracket creep. So 1.8 million taxpayers will be worse off. I have to correct the record; I was using the number 1.3 million. Not only will those 1.8 million be worse off but over the next 10 years there are going to be around 4½ million who will be worse off as this insidious bracket creep takes effect. Weve seen the effect of bracket creep on the current governments budget. They talk very proudly of the surplus theyve recorded, and I for one think thats a very worthy goal, reducing the budget surplus. But personal income tax receipts have risen by 27 per cent in the past 18 months. Thats because there are more people in work than perhaps there historically have been, although they inherited recordlow unemployment. But its also because bracket creep is sneaking up and taking an extra bite of peoples pay packet. Its as simple as that. Its a huge amount of money that has come out of the pay packets of Australian people. Its a massive amount of money and it needs to be addressed, and thats what the stage 3 tax cuts are all about. To go back to the Prime Ministers integrity and whether he can be believed going forward, this is not the first promise hes broken. He made a promise on 93 occasions before the election that thered be a $275 reduction in energy bills. People are not seeing that. People are questioning whether that was a promise that was given in good faith. He said thered be an increase in real wages. There hasnt been an increase in real wages. And of course he promised he wouldnt touch the stage 3 tax cuts and, as weve seen, thats another broken promise. But now anybody whos got a negatively geared property or aspires to own a negatively geared property is under the gun. And when the Prime Minister denies that theyre going after those people whove got a negatively geared property, who can put any store in his word whatsoever? I say to those opposite—particularly the Greens, who arent here—who think that negatively geared rental properties are the plaything of the rich and famous, that rich people dont worry about buying rental properties and having to deal with tenants and so on. For the wage earner, the nurse or the policeman, its their one opportunity to actually get a bit of wealth over and above their family home, which they are probably paying off a mortgage for, and their super. Its their one chance to make a bit of wealth and set themselves up for retirement. They are the people who invest in rental properties. Theyre not highwage earners. Theyre just people who want to have a go, get ahead, set themselves up for a comfortable retirement and maybe leave something to their kids one day or be able to help their kids out. They are the people who invest in rental properties. Finally, being a proud Western Australian, I can only reiterate and express my concern about the future of the GST deal. We know that, over here on the east coast, weve got every premier and every economist calling for the end of the GST deal, which the previous finance minister Mattias Corman and treasurer Scott Morrison put in place to rectify—","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RICK WILSON (OConnor) ","(19:01):"

I dont think theyre going to be able to say, Yes, Prime Minister.

392,0,0,0,1,1,"Ryan, Joanne MP",249224,"Lalor","ALP","N/A",913," Im pleased to rise to join my colleagues in supporting Labors costofliving tax cuts. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024 offer costofliving relief and tax reform. As the Prime Minister has said, Labor has been very concerned about the costofliving impact on families, individuals and Australians around the country. Those on this side of the House have been critically concerned with this, none more so than myself, representing, as I do, a community in the outer west of Melbourne where most people have a mortgage. Watching the interest rate rises and having an understanding of the impact of those and what this means for many in my community, I have been incredibly concerned.  Ive been very proud to be part of the Albanese Labor government. All the members of our cabinet, all the members of the executive and all the members of the backbench are critically concerned about these things and have been working together collaboratively across 20 months of government to find ways to put supports in place for people. It began in that December after we were first elected, when caucus members saw what was going to happen and came back to Canberra to fix it by bringing in legislation to put downward pressure on energy prices. From that point, the Australian public was in good hands, because we had a cabinet whose members were going to work together to find ways to support Australians. We saw it again in health. We saw it with cheaper medicine, and I know what that means on the ground for my community. I know what that means in my house. It means that, when you are on a longterm medications and you go to the chemist, youre getting longer scripts, there are more scripts on the PBS and all medicines are cheaper than they were. This is critical, and it has made a real difference on the ground. Of course, there is the tripling of the bulkbilling incentives, which is turning around the bulkbilling rates across the country, and those bulkbilling rates are reversing in the electorate of Lalor. We introduced an increase to the rental subsidy. We did the childcare support package. This government has been focused on reducing the pressure on families across the country. Today, the legislation before us is the introduction of Labors tax cuts costofliving relief. This is a critical piece of legislation, because it will deliver a tax cut to every Australian taxpayer, first and foremost. Its hard to use that language of a tax cut, for me, because it isnt the tax cut; its actually the increase in your pay packet because less tax has been taken. It will give families and everyone in my electorate more disposable income at a time when they really need it. Importantly, it doesnt have an inflationary impact. This, of course, is critical, because were still fighting inflation. In Lalor, there are 95,000 taxpayers who will be getting a tax cut from 1 July under this package that is being introduced, as the Prime Minister said, because it is the right decision made at the right time in response to costofliving pressures. Eightyeight per cent of the taxpayers in Lalor will be better off under Labors stage 3 tax system, so 84,000 taxpayers will be better off. Weve heard speaker after speaker go through what that means. We heard the member for OConnor talking about teachers, police officers and rental properties. I tell you what I can tell teachers and police officers in my electorate: from 1 July, under this government, you will have more in your pockets because of these tax cuts than you would have had under the Liberal plan. Its not just teachers, and its not just police officers. Its the nurses, agedcare workers, childcare workers, those who work in transport and logistics, forklift drivers, truck drivers, bus drivers, people working in retail, people working in building and construction and people working in the public sector. This will have a positive impact on the gamut of people across my electorate. As I said here in another opportunity last week, I know that, on 1 July, I can look the people of my community in the eye. Like thousands of other Australians who, under the Morrison tax cuts, would have received a smaller tax cut, I am pleased that this decision means that families, young people and women in my community will get more money in their pockets rather than in mine. I cant be blunter than that. I know that thats a sentiment shared across the country, because thats what were hearing. The feedback coming back to me from families and people I know outside my electorate—people who earn $200,000 plus—is that they are happy that this is happening. Theres no denying that that is real. To those opposite, I say it would be nice, as the Treasurer said today, if you were enthusiastically supporting this legislation. Thats probably too much to hope for. Im pleased that the member for OConnor, at least, has expressed quite clearly that hes pleased. The speech wasnt overwhelmingly positive, but hes pleased to support this, because he knows the difference it will make to people in his electorate who earn $40,000 a year. It means something where they were going to get nothing. Those opposite may not be enthusiastic, but I welcome them reluctantly supporting the tax cuts and reluctantly supporting this. Theres been a lot of talk in here this evening about what weve spoken about in this place across 20 months. I tell you what weve talked a lot about: the cost of living. On this side, weve talked a lot about the things that weve been doing to address cost of living and assist people in that while, as a government and as a country, we fight inflation. Thats what weve heard a lot about. Do you know what else weve heard a lot about? Weve had a lot of questions from the other side about energy bills across 20 months. Unfortunately, in December, they all came in and voted against things that were designed to put downward pressure on energy bills, so any question they ask on energy bills completely loses credibility and validity, as far as Im concerned. But I note that, in the last two weeks since the Prime Minister stood up at the National Press Club and explained his and our decision and our processes to get to this place, theres been a complete lack of interest from that side of the chamber on the impacts of the cost of living on residents around this country. It is glaring that it is suddenly not of interest to those opposite. One of the things Im concerned about with that is that people might think that the costofliving pressures have gone away, and of course they havent. And, as the Prime Minister has also said, this legislation brings some relief. It brings some reform around bracket creep, some reform around taxation to support people, but its not the job finished. The inflationary pressures are still there—moderating but still there. People are still doing it tough. Im really proud to be a member of the Albanese Labor government. Im really proud to work with the members of the government on this side who are so concerned about these pressures. Im really proud to support a cabinet who are prepared to work together to find ways to support Australians in communities like mine and in communities across this country. Im really proud that, as a government, weve demonstrated that we can chew gum and walk at the same time. We can deal with an inflationary crisis and care for people and, more importantly, meet our commitment to not leave people behind.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms RYAN (Lalor—Chief Government Whip) ","(19:16):"
393,0,0,0,1,1,"Young, Terry MP",201906,"Longman","LNP","N/A",914," I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024. There has been much talk and spin about the fact that Labor have tweaked the coalition stage 3 tax cuts in a manner that attempts to cement the narrative that they are the party of the battler, of the lowincome worker. Thats just a load of rubbish. This continuing rhetoric and attempt to project themselves as the Robin Hood party, where they take from the rich and give to the poor, is not washing with Australian people, because they arent fools.  Let us look at the facts—a new concept, I know! Firstly, these are proposed stage 3 tax cuts. This means there were two stages before this one. I know this because it was the coalition who legislated all three stages. It was our idea, our policy, because we are, and always have been, the party that believes in and delivers lower taxes to all workers. Were also the party that believes in simplifying the tax system, not making it more complicated. The original legislation not only allowed hardworking Australians to keep more of what they earned—a term first coined by the coalition, which I notice Labor have now picked up on and are using with gusto and enthusiasm. They do say that, when you are copied, that is the greatest form of flattery. I digress. The coalitions legislated tax cuts eliminated entirely the 37c in the dollar tax bracket and reduced the 32½ per cent bracket to 30 per cent. To assist low and middleincome workers, from July 2020 we lifted the 19c bracket from $37,000 to $45,000. These measures meant that every worker earning up to $200,000 would not pay more than 30c in tax on any dollar they earnt. What a wonderful incentive for people who have aspirations to work hard, take risks and/or upskill themselves. Labor have recomplicated the tax system by reintroducing the 37c bracket for those who earn more than $135,000—in doing so, punishing those with these aspirations. They have also legislated that those earning $190,000 or more will pay 45c in tax on every dollar they earn over that figure. The coalition understand that a percentage of a bigger number is a larger amount in real dollar terms, and we wanted to ensure low and middleincome workers on under $120,000 were looked after as well as those on higher incomes. This was achieved in two ways. First, stages 1 and 2 of these tax cuts implemented the tax cuts for those on these lower incomes back in 201819 and in 202021, when we were in government. Stage 3, where the tax cuts came in for those on higher incomes, were due to commence this July. This is further evidence that the coalition is the party of all workers, including those on lower incomes. Second, the LMITO, or the low and middleincome tax offset, was introduced for those on an income of less than $120,000. I can testify firsthand, from speaking to people on these lower incomes, to the real difference this made in their lives. Getting their tax done and receiving a windfall of up to an extra $1,500 in their tax refund was, for some, lifechanging. Debate interrupted.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr YOUNG (Longman) ","(19:26):"

After enjoying almost 70 years of relative peace, prosperity and strategic order, we are now entering a period of tension, hardship and strategic disorder. Authoritarian powers are on the move. China and Russia deepened their strategic cooperation in February 2022 with their no limits partnership. Since that time, Russia has drawn the sword against Ukraine, invading sovereign territory and killing thousands of people. China has flexed its muscles in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea, with multiple provocations. Terrorism is back. Hamas attacked and murdered more than a thousand Israelis on 7 October, and Iranianbacked Houthi rebels, out of Yemen, are firing missiles at drones and international shipping in the Red Sea, forcing up the cost of freight and compromising around12 per cent of global trade.  Despite all our national advantages in geography and resources, the liberty of distance and abundance, we are a country that is dependent upon the security of the seas for our importation of goods, especially liquid fuels, and for our exports that underwrite our prosperity. We are a trading nation and vulnerable to this emerging strategic disorder. It would not take much to severely damage our prosperity, either through regional conflict or an adversary conducting supply chain warfare against our country. Now, more than ever, is the time to act to secure our future, which is why the Albanese governments weakness in defence is so inexcusable. The times demand strong leadership. Instead, we get weak leadership from the Prime Minister and his parttime defence minister. There is much to do, and this Labor government is failing to do it. Since April last year, weve known that the Albanese government is not serious about defence. The Defence Strategic Review in April last year revealed that there is no new money for defence. In fact, with inflation, the budget has gone backwards in real terms. This means they are making cuts to the ADF across the board—to Army, Navy and Air Force. Army has had its infantry fighting vehicles order slashed from 450 to 129. Its shrinking from three fighting brigades to one. Under the Albanese government, the Army is weaker and our ability to prevail in land combat is diminished. Thats the consequence of weak leadership. Our budget with the AUKUS commitment must grow; otherwise, we sacrifice other important capabilities and our readiness to fight. Sustainment budgets will be cannibalised, and the historical record reflects this, as we saw when we operated two aircraft carriers in the Royal Australian Navy. This is fundamentally a question of leadership for the defence minister. We know that he lost at the ERC last year to Senator Penny Wong, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. He needs to secure more money for the defence budget. The speed of the boss is the speed of the team, and the Minister for Defence agreed with this sentiment in October 2022, when he said that he takes responsibility for defence—that the buck stops with him. But under this minister we see a host of failings, and estimates has revealed that today—a deferral of tough decisions. It was five months ago that the minister received the surface fleet review, and we are still waiting for his decision on it. Its causing massive uncertainty for defence industry and in South Australia. We are yet to see a defence strategy, the most important thing you must have in defending the nation. You must know what the threat is and you must have a plan to defeat it. It shapes everything, particularly in the budget, and in a time of scarcity we need a strategy first and foremost. We wont see this until midyear at the earliest, only after the big decisions are taken on capabilities, platforms and equipment. The paperwork piling up on the ministers desk has resulted in a 37year delay on our most significant defence programs. The department is dysfunctional, with senior officials airing their grievances against the minister through the Australian Financial Review. The Labor government havent deployed a naval vessel to the Red Sea, a weak decision when you consider the US, the UK, France, Italy and other nations are stepping up. The Albanese government wont send otherwise serviceable Taipan helicopters to Ukraine even after our friends have asked for them, preferring to bury them along with our reputation as a toughminded people who look after our mates. This government is weak in defence, and that has caused a recruiting and retention crisis. We are not getting enough people joining and we are losing too many. I am worried for Australia, as are all those on this side of the House. The Minister for Defence is on notice: show some strength, secure money for the ADF, make the hard decisions. If you cant by the May budget, resign and make way for someone who can. We cant afford to be weak any longer.","National Security","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HASTIE (Canning) ","(19:30):"
395,0,0,0,1,1,"Perrett, Graham Douglas MP","HVP","Moreton","ALP","N/A",916," I rise to acknowledge the great work and the leadership of Queenslands African community. Just a few weekends ago, Queenslanders were shocked by the murder of the muchloved grandmother Vyleen White at the Redbank Plains shopping centre, just down the Ipswich motorway from my electorate of Moreton. This tragedy has shocked everyone and, unfortunately, has led to some rising tensions in my local community and throughout Queensland, as well as reports of racist attacks. My office has received some calls that were very, very racist in their tone. However, the leadership of the African Communities Council of Queensland; its president, Beny Bol OAM; and members of Mrs Whites family, despite their grief, recognised the need to address the growing disharmony in our community.  Vyleens daughter, Cindy Micallef, worked with Beny Bol. Cindy and Beny came together as a unified force, speaking to media and inviting locals to attend an open community meeting because, in Benys words, The best way we can honour her legacy is for us to preach peace, unity and accountability, and to make sure people who do wrong things are held accountable individually. Beny said it was important to send a message out that hate has no place here—noble words. I have spoken before in this House about the Queensland African Communities Council and Beny Bol OAM. Beny has a long history of working with young people and is committed to making sure that African youth are not overrepresented in our criminal justice system. Beny has spent more than 10 years working with young people and was awarded an OAM for his service to youth. Beny believes that many community services and state government programs are not designed or run to meet the needs of younger community members. So, rather than wait for something to come along, the Queensland African Communities Council decided to be proactive and designed a youth early intervention strategy. The African Village at Moorooka—the suburb I live in, in my electorate—and other sites at Redbank Plains and at Geebung are all part of the strategy. These centres are modelled on the concept of it takes a village to raise a child approach. At each site or each village, African youth mentors organise locally designed and structured activities to support individual young people, families and schools, to make sure those at risk of becoming disengaged at school are supported at an early stage. Just as an aside, I want to thank my niece, Trish, for donating furniture to these centres. It is important to recognise the crucial work that has been done by our African community leaders because it specifically targets young adults who are disengaged from school or who have already spent some time in youth detention. They help them reconnect with their family, their culture and their community, and provide them with the skills to reconnect with our community in a positive way. But there is other important work we should recognise about the African leadership in Queensland. The African diaspora know about division. In fact, many of their families are here because of division—because their communities disintegrated back in their country of origin. They know what division brings and are quick to present a unified front on any issue that could possibly divide our community. They know because they fled from countries where division forced them to seek refuge elsewhere. They know the destruction, the despair and the tragedy that divisive behaviour can fuel. Some politicians should sit at their feet and learn these lessons. African leaders like Beny Bol understand and recognise the threats to social cohesion and how important it is that, in times of conflict, crisis and tragedy, our purpose should be to ensure that our people come together to make sure that they dont divide and inflame. Beny and his peers witnessed the results of too little trust and of not seeking common ground. Too little trust undermines the foundation of our democracy. Cheap, shortterm political points can actually be longterm corrosive. We know that there are politicians and community leaders fuelling division right now over conflicts that are occurring overseas. They are using these tragedies to promote division in our community because it serves no other purpose than to progress their own political agendas. As politicians and representatives, we should lead by example. We need to recognise that sometimes whats at stake is something that is far greater than our own selfish political needs. All of us, including politicians in this House, should look at the actions of Beny Bol, Cindy Micallef and Vyleen Whites family and take a leaf out of their book as an example of how to show leadership and unite a community that is hurting and grieving. We all want justice and harmony.","Queensland: African Community","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PERRETT (Moreton) ","(19:35):"

He was stillborn, and they named him Tony. But, because he was stillborn, he was buried in an unmarked plot in a grave at Adelong. That is what the view was then. Three hundred women a day have a miscarriage. But for them it is their child; it is their baby. Thats 110,000 a year. This is an issue which is not getting the attention it should. Just recently we had the case in Queensland where a lady at 12 weeks went to the hospital and was holding her 12weekold child in a biohazard bag in the waiting room for hours. There isnt a focus on the emotional trauma that this issue causes. At the time, the Premier of Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk, noted that she had also had a miscarriage and the trauma it caused her. We have to do something further on this.  I want to talk about and acknowledge Claire Brett from my electorate. Claire had suffered multiple miscarriages and experienced severe anxiety with her pregnancy after the loss. Claire organised a function the other day. It sold out in seven minutes—bang! Completely sold the room—which goes to show you that even in New England, in a small city such as Armidale, there is a focus on this issue. I keep pretty sombre company, but at that function we had so many women, especially younger women who had experienced this. There was a focus on it. As part of the fundraising, we had a sixfootthree transvestite. Usually Im not found in their company, but on this day I made an exception. A really good night was had by all to raise money for this. I want to encourage as many areas as possible to be part of this group. It is called Lighting the Way. I want to encourage as many areas, groups and suburbs as possible to reach out to their constituents and have a similar organisation, because I think you will be amazed at the unrecognised hurt that is there. The people I was talking to were saying: We recognise that date just like any other birthday. We recognise that event as we do for other children. We felt that baby inside us. We had a relationship with that person, and that person died. That is exactly how they see it. We have to become vastly more civilised than we were in my grandmothers time, where they were just taken to the graveyard, buried in an unmarked plot and, forevermore, you would be wandering around trying to work out where this child—which would be my uncle—is. They are worth more than a plaque. As part of what were doing in a bipartisan way, we want to make sure that, for all the people at the inaugural fundraiser held in Armidale, it is just that: the inaugural fundraiser for many other fundraising activities that will follow. Between those of us on either side of this chamber, we will work with Claire Brett of Kentucky and all the other women who say that this is something that this parliament can do which is positive, which is effective and which would take us and our nation to a higher place. Lighting the Way provides counselling and support services for women who have experienced miscarriage, so we dont have to have these issues where people go through a miscarriage and are basically just told, Oh well—obviously you, Madam Deputy Speaker Chesters, know vastly more about this than I do. For guys out there like me: what you have to go through if you go through a birth post birth is what you have to go through if you go through a miscarriage post miscarriage. You have to have the same checks and the same issues. For so many people, its the same as having a baby. Congratulations, Claire.

397,0,0,0,1,1,"Mulino, Daniel MP",132880,"Fraser","ALP","N/A",918," I congratulate two women who live in my electorate on their welldeserved Australia Day honours: Professor Emerita Cynthia Mitchell, on her Officer of the Order of Australia award for distinguished service to the environment as an innovator, leader and academic through her work on water resource sustainability; and the Reverend Canon Professor Dorothy Lee, on her Member of the Order of Australia award for significant service to the Anglican Church of Australia.  While both women are recognised as global leaders in their fields, theyre so humble that neither woman initially believed that they were in fact recipients of the Australia Day honour. Cynthia thought the email, despite its fancy government crest, was a scam. She was about to delete the email, but, after checking the senders address, realised that it was legitimate. Dorothy, meanwhile, said she had to read the email she was sent three times before it sank in. Both women have also made their mark in traditionally male dominated environments—Cynthia in the world of engineering, and Dorothy in the world of theology and the church. As a teenager, Cynthia loved maths and chemistry. She also loved the natural environment and bushwalking. After completing her Bachelor of Chemical Engineering, she began working in the emerging field of biotechnology. However, it wasnt long before she realised she wanted to work in an area that more closely aligned with her values. After spending a year camping her way around Australia and travelling 40,000 kilometres, it was time to find a job. Fortuitously, the field of environmental engineering had emerged. Cynthia was soon tapped to lead the new environmental engineering programs at the Queensland University of Technology, the University of Queensland and the University of Sydney. She was able to combine her passion for the environment with her knowledge of biotech. And so her research career took off in the field of sustainable sanitation and water management. In 2001 Cynthia was looking for opportunities to make a practical difference, so she joined the new Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology Sydney. For the next two decades Cynthia was instrumental in its emergence as a worldclass research institute. The institute now numbers 150 people, a mark of its ongoing success. Cynthia worked alongside industry and governments across Australia, Asia and the Pacific to improve ecological, economic and social outcomes of urban infrastructure. Along the way she collected numerous accolades: a fellow of the Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, a fellow of Engineers Australia and a fellow of the Institute of Company Directors. Cynthia was honoured in 2015 as one of the Australian Financial Reviews 100 Women of Influence, and, in 2018, was recognised by the industry as a Legend of Water. But her work is not done. Determined to leave a proud legacy, in 2021 Cynthia started her first business, The Good Ancestor, which helps directors, leaders and their teams develop more effective ways to tackle the most complex challenges we face—including, of course, climate change. Dorothy Lee, meanwhile, was born in Scotland into a very conservative religious family—one where women were seen and not heard, and certainly not encouraged to have a career. However, Dorothy didnt let that stop her. Her love for the ancient world was sparked by a visit to Pompeii as a youngster. She was immediately transfixed. She went on to study English and the classic languages, Latin and Ancient Greek, as part of her Bachelor of Arts. While she initially wanted to be an archaeologist, she was soon drawn to study theology. She completed a Bachelor of Divinity and then a PhD. In an act of rebellion, given her conservative background, Dorothy joined the churchs ministry where she was eventually ordained an Anglican priest. Dorothy was determined to be a force for inclusion in the academic world and in society and, more specifically, to ensure a Christian faith that was affirming of women. A leading New Testament scholar with a particular interest in the gospels, Dorothy has many years of experience in lecturing in the area of feminist theology and womens ministry in the New Testament. She also has numerous publications to her name, with her bestknown work being The Ministry of Women in the New Testament. In October 2012, Dorothy was elected one of the 10 foundation professors of the University of Divinity, Australias first specialist university. She is also a Canon Emerita of St Pauls Cathedral Melbourne and a fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. Congratulations to both Cynthia and Dorothy on their welldeserved honours and to the people around them who have contributed to their success.","Mitchell, Professor Emerita Cynthia, AO, Lee, Reverend Canon Professor Dorothy, AM","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr MULINO (Fraser) ","(19:45):"
398,0,0,0,1,1,"Howarth, Luke MP",247742,"Petrie","LNP","N/A",918," I want to talk about the integrity of the Labor Party and broken promises. In May this year, it will be two years since the election when the Albanese government came to power. At the time, Prime Minister Albanese looked people in the eye and knowingly and repeatedly didnt tell them the truth. He gave them false information, because he promised Australians that they could trust him to keep his promise. My word is my bond, is what he said. The Albanese government have promised more than a hundred times since the election that they would deliver issues like the stage 3 income tax cuts costofliving relief to families in full—not changed, in full. Its a pattern from Prime Minister Albanese. Stage 3 income tax cuts, electricity prices lowered by $275, no changes to super, lower mortgages, and the front page of the paper on election day—in Queensland, at least—said, Life would be easier under me.  Life isnt easier under this Prime Minister and this government. Mortgages are not lower. Theyve actually increased 12 times. Electricity bills were not lowered by $275; they have also increased significantly. Superannuation has been changed, and stage 3 tax cuts are clearly being revised. The explanatory memorandum of the Treasury laws amendment bill that I spoke on this week says current law and new law. Current law: $45,000 to $200,000, 30 per cent tax; new law: $135,000 to $190,000, 37 per cent. Thats a seven per cent increase. And incomes of $190, 000 are now taxed at 45 per cent. One of my constituents is about to cop a 15 per cent increase in bracket creep because of the Albanese Labor government breaking their election commitment. Its not just me saying this.

He says:  Prime Minister I am positive you dont deserve this title, as you are weak and not observant of the real world, my name is Glenn Cullen a resident of Newport QLD and a businessman that employs people. Your broken promises are becoming overwhelming, and I do not believe your party has any credibility or integrity, you are stealing from the Australian people. Your tax alternative policy will benefit you by 28 billion. The strikes at the wharf will keep coming and with Wong giving money of the Australian people to the UNRWA is a joke as they were shown to support terrorism and your Voice Referendum which was a total failure as you are surely aware. Its time to call an early election so we can get back on with Australia being not a weak woke country as we are becoming under your party. The Prime Ministers broken promises mean that delivering the stage 3 tax cuts as theyre legislated here in the law of the land today, on 14 February 2024, will not be possible. The coalition is committed to going to the next election with a tax reform package that is in keeping with stage 3 tax reforms. We remain committed to fighting bracket creep and enshrining aspiration, because strong leaders keep their promises. They dont say one thing to the Australian people and then do the complete opposite. When it comes to bracket creep, that is based on your income. In a nutshell, a lot of people in my electorate will be impacted. Ive got 12,300 people who earn between $91,000 and $135,000 who will be impacted by bracket creep over the next five years, and these changes will be anywhere from seven to 15 per cent in bracket creep. Ian from Redcliffe is a concreter. He earns $105,800 but, as he progresses over the next few years, he will face the threat of bracket creep and move into the 37 per cent bracket. Louise from Newport, who is a single mother and a psychologist, earns around $189,000. With Labors new proposed tax brackets, Louise will lose $2,976 in comparison to what is currently legislated. She cannot work overtime or accept a bonus without jumping up into an even higher tax bracket of 45 per cent and having her income in the higher bracket taxed 15 per cent higher—another $1,500—by the Albanese Labor government. More residents fall into bracket creep. We will take a better package to the next election.

401,0,0,0,1,1,"Thwaites, Kate MP",282212,"Jagajaga","ALP","N/A",919," Tonight I rise to talk on two topics that I know are important to my community. Like so many people in my community, I have been devastated to hear Israel say in recent days that it has plans for a ground offensive in Rafah. This offensive will have, and is already having, devastating consequences. There are more than a million civilians sheltering in and around Rafah—civilians who have been displaced by fighting elsewhere and have moved to this area, often under Israeli direction. These civilians deserve to be safe. I share the horror of so many in my community at the destruction and death that have been occurring in Gaza under Israels military action. These people in my community want to see international law upheld and civilians protected, and they realise that any push into Rafah only puts more innocent lives at risk.  Australia expects Israel to act in accordance with the ICJ ruling, including to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance. Australia has voted for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. It is critical and urgent that we get a ceasefire. Of course, this cannot be a onesided ceasefire. It will also require Hamas to cease its attacks and to release the Israeli hostages it still holds. Australia will continue to advocate for a pathway out of this conflict and for ongoing peace and security. It is part of our shared humanity to want innocent lives to be protected—all innocent lives. There have been too many innocent civilians killed already. Tonight I want to talk about climate change, because ever since I was elected to this place people in my community have continued to be very clear with me that they support action that listens to the science, is driven by the science and secures the future of all of us. Our government has just recently announced our new vehicle efficiency standards. More efficient vehicles will mean savings on both maintenance and fuel costs for people in my community and communities right around Australia. I know that some of the Chicken Littles on the other side have predictably taken this announcement as a chance to run around and suggest that the sky is falling in. But it is not all of them who are Chicken Littles. Some, in fact, have been supporters of this policy for a long time. In 2017, the member for Bradfield and his then ministerial colleague Josh Frydenberg were big advocates for vehicle efficiency standards. They said: … European versions of the top selling … Mazda 3 and Mazda CX5— are— all more efficient than the models sold in Australia … What a revelation! They said: If Australia had fuel efficiency standards in line with comparable nations, estimates of the fuel saving per passenger vehicle could be above $500 per year, or nearly $28 billion in total by 2040. I am very glad that they did their homework. They also said: Consumers could also benefit from accessing better vehicles as manufacturers are currently holding back some of their latest fuel efficient stock from Australia. With better vehicles, fuel savings and more efficient car models, this is a winwinwin if Ive ever seen one. Im so pleased that those opposite saw it earlier, but I am very disappointed, including for consumers in my community and around this country, that those opposite didnt act earlier on their conviction. If the member for Bradfield and Josh Frydenberg had only had the courage to deliver fuel efficiency standards back then, when they sat on the government benches, consumers across this country could have been saving for years. Of course, just two years after those statements, Liberals and Nationals across the aisle were singing from a new song sheet called ending the weekend, and we have heard some of those refrains coming back in the past fortnight. Australians are too smart to fall for this scare campaign. It couldnt be further from the truth. Those opposite continue to play politics with climate change. They continue to do this country a disservice, putting their own political interests—we saw this again in Nemesis the other week—ahead of the outcomes that this country needs, and in this case ahead of savings for consumers that will come from vehicle fuel efficiency standards that should have been in place on their watch. When it comes to all these important policies and all these important decisions, when it comes to genuine action on climate change, it takes a Labor government. This Labor government is doing the work to secure a better future for my community and people across Australia.","Middle East, New Vehicle Efficiency Standard","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms THWAITES (Jagajaga) ","(19:55):"
402,0,0,0,1,1,"Young, Terry MP",201906,"Longman","LNP","N/A",921," For some, it made the difference from being evicted from the property they rent or being evicted because they couldnt pay their mortgage. Sadly, one of the first things this Labor government did when assuming office after the election was not continue the real costofliving initiative for those on low and middle incomes. I was contacted by people in this cohort, in dismay, asking why it had not been continued. My response was simply, Good question. I encourage the government to reinstate this tax offset to give real, meaningful help at this most difficult time.  How do we know that Australians are actually going to be worse off under this new legislation? Its simple: the numbers dont lie. Treasury have estimated that the extra tax the government will receive as a result of their proposed changes is $28 billion over the next decade. How can Australians keep more of what they earn when the government collects more tax? It just doesnt make any mathematical sense. Lets look at a real example. A worker on $60,000 in 2017 paid $10,947 in tax. After the coalitions tax cuts and the low and middleincome tax offsets in 2022, they paid $8,367 in tax. They were $2,580 per annum better off. Under this new Labor legislation, they will be paying $8,688 in tax, which means they are $321 worse off. As I say, the numbers dont lie; they actually expose the spin. Labor are saying, Why would the coalition support these tax cuts if people are worse off? I will be supporting them because, since they have not continued the low and middleincome tax offset, this worker on $60,000 is now paying $9,867 in tax, and $8,688 is better than that. Its still not as good as when they were under the coalition government, when they only paid $8,367. Thats why we are speaking out on behalf of these workers who will be earning less takehome pay under this government. The coalition will always go in to bat for all workers, regardless of what they earn. Were only talking about gross and net wages here, or beforetax and aftertax wages. The real wages measure is the only true measure. This tells us what people actually get for their money. Under these proposed changes and the discontinuation of the low and middleincome offset, as we have already established, people will be worse off in takehome pay terms. This would be fine if the cost of living were going down, but we see the exact opposite. We see that inflation is at 5.4 per cent, electricity is up by 20 per cent, food is up by nine per cent, insurance is up a whopping 22 per cent, and interest rates have risen an incredible 12 times under this government, meaning someone with a mortgage of $500,000 is paying just under $350 more per week in repayments than when the coalition was in government. This means that over the past 18 months real net disposable income, or what you have left after youve paid tax and your bills, has dropped by a massive 8.6 per cent. For an average income earner thats just under $8,000 that they are worse off. This is confirmed by the correspondence I receive in my office each day and when I am out and about talking to people. Cafe owners are telling me business is slowing and people who would buy three coffees a week are now buying two. Those who had coffee and cake now have just coffee. Hairdressers tell me many who used to have their hair done every six weeks are now having it done every eight weeks. These are real signs of the struggle people are enduring. To make matters even worse, we see that Labor are investigating ways to implement other policies that will inflict even more pain on Australians, especially those on lower incomes. These are policies like the vehicle efficiency standards, which is to try to force people into purchasing an EV. This will add greater costs for those who choose or simply have to purchase a petrol or diesel vehicle because they cant afford the higher initial outlay incurred when purchasing an electric car. In New Zealand, when this policy was implemented, it drove up the cost of a car by around $7,000 New Zealand dollars. For many in my community of Longman, this is simply unaffordable. Thats not to mention the impact on the motor vehicle industry and car dealers, who are still feeling the hangover from the COVID pandemic, where supply was a massive issue. There has been research and polling done on policies like capital gains tax on the family home and changes to negative gearing, franking credits and family trusts all to raise money to fund policies like the $450 million failed Voice referendum, the $100 million for the new transmission lines needed for their energy policy and all the other crazy items on their agenda. Basically its anything but the thing which matters most to most Australians—costofliving relief. Why wouldnt the government be delivering real costofliving relief? Political pointscoring, of course. They are simply obsessed with trying to deliver a budget surplus for no other reason than to try to hoodwink the Australian people into thinking that they are better managers of the economy. They will do this at the expense of the very people they say they are trying to help—low and middleincome workers. The coalition always aimed for a surplus but never at the expense of the Australian people. The time of the COVID pandemic is a prime example. We were on track to deliver a surplus. It was put on hold, and rightly so, to ensure costly but necessary measures could be put in place to ensure we minimised the economic pain during the pandemic for the people we were elected to serve. A touch of irony is that these COVID measures will in part help deliver the surplus Labor are claiming from increased tax receipts, along with the windfall from the mining and resources sector, including coal, which, again ironically, Labor so often berates and vilifies. So I say to this government: forget the spin, smoke and mirrors, put the political pointscoring aside, reinstate the low and middle income tax offset in full, get rid of the fuel excise and deliver to the Australian people real costofliving relief, because they deserve it.","Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living Tax Cuts) Bill 2024, Treasury Laws Amendment (Cost of Living—Medicare Levy) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr YOUNG (Longman) ","(20:01):"

They trusted his word that he would change our country for the better. They trusted his word that he would deliver cheaper mortgages, medicines and electric vehicles. They trusted him when he said, My word is my bond. The Prime Minister looked Australians in the eye and repeatedly misled them. As each day passed, he and the Treasurer plotted and plotted to break their word. The Prime Minister and Treasurer said they hadnt changed their position on the stage 3 tax cuts despite asking Treasury to look at other options last December. They made a commitment more than 100 times to the Australian people.  Australians can see through the Prime Ministers misleading words now. They wont be deceived. They can see the deception, the magicians trick, that he is trying to perform, because, despite promises for a better future, Australians currently find themselves grappling with the highest interest rates since 2011 and rising costs of food, electricity, gas, mortgages and rents. Families disposable incomes are going down, which is putting pressure on household budgets. It means that families are having to make choices between fuel and food, between school fees, private health cover and recreational activities—maybe paying for sporting uniforms or paying for registration fees for their kids to play sport. This costofliving crisis has consequences for the Australian people, and the Albanese government has been distracted. Last year it spent the whole year distracted by the Voice referendum, a very divisive exercise by the Prime Minister which cost $450 million and only served to divide the nation and deliver a resounding no to his plan. Meanwhile, Australians are now thousands of dollars worse off as a result of this governments economic mismanagement. While Labor claims their changes to the stage 3 tax cut legislation will be broadly revenue neutral, its going to cost an extra $1.3 billion over the next four years and $28 billion over the next decade. An average income earner is only going to receive just over $15 a week more under Labors tax cuts, hardly enough for the cheapest item on the menu in a cafe in Marrickville or a restaurant in Mandurah, where I live. This is less than one per cent of their annual wage and returns just 10c for every dollar that they have lost to costofliving pressures during Labors first 18 months in office. Before the election the Prime Minister promised a $275 reduction in power bills, no changes to superannuation taxes, an increase in real wages, no changes to franking credits, cheaper mortgages and no changes to the stage 3 tax cuts. The Prime Minister has broken all of these promises, so whats next? Is negative gearing next on the governments hit list? The Prime Minister and the Treasurer cant give a straight answer when theyre asked to rule out their promise on negative gearing. The Treasurer was asked on 29 January about the plan to make changes to negative gearing and he said, Labor wasnt considering it. Thats what they said 100 times about the stage 3 tax cuts. The finance minister was asked the same question on the Today show and said, We have no plans to do that. Thats what they said about the stage 3 tax cuts. The truth here is that the Australian people cant trust a word from this Prime Minister or his economic team. The opposition wont break its promises. We wont desert Australians whove been promised something. Were committed to lower, simpler and fairer taxes, which is why were not standing in the way of this legislation. We acknowledge that there are tax cuts in this legislation, and we want to see the Australian people benefit from those, but were committed to aspiration. We can promise Australians that well go to the next election with an aspirational tax reform package that is in keeping with our commitment to giving Australians more of their own money back. It will be a distinct choice at the next election. It will be a choice between aspiration on the one hand and redistribution on the other. Australians can trust our word. Debate adjourned.

I started the day at the Monbulk Rotary and then went to the Wandin Rotary breakfast. Thank you to them for a wonderful celebration but also the amazing work that Rotary does in our community, giving back to help those that need it. Congratulations to my good friend John Hasan, who was awarded the Paul Harris Fellow award at the Wandin Rotary, their highest award. It was also amazing to see Arnold Dix at Monbulk. Some people would remember Arnold; he was the man that helped save 41 miners in India late last year. It was great to see him there. I couldnt stay for his speech, but I have had the opportunity to hear him speak about the sacrifices that he made to save those miners in India, so it was wonderful to see Arnold recognised. Were proud that hes from Monbulk—from our community.  After that, it was off to the Yarra Ranges Council facilities for their Australia Day citizenship ceremony, where we got to welcome 60 new citizens to our country. Citizenship ceremonies are always wonderful events but particularly on Australia Day, when you see the joy, and the passion and the pride that these new citizens have for our country, for joining the great Australian dream. But theres also the acknowledgement and recognition of their culture that they have brought with them to our country, and that was on show with the wonderful dress that was worn on the day. Its very important that we recognise the many citizens that do so much in our community. At the Yarra Ranges community awards I was proud to present the Ian De La Rue Award to Randall Bourchier, and the Mayors Lifetime Achievement Award to Alan Somers, two great people that Ive got to know over many years, who have given so much to our community. I also want to congratulate the Millgrove Residents Action Group for winning the Community Group of the Year Award. It was very well deserved. To Lachlan Hudak from Lilydale Heights and Sophie Morris from Mount Lilydale: congratulations on being the young environmentalists of the year. Congratulations also to Chris McAleer, Jean Steel and Bruce Argyle for their certificates of recognition. It was wonderful to be there to see my good friend Sharyn Manning recognised as the 2024 Yarra Ranges Council Citizen of the Year. Shes a person Ive known for many years. We were on the Lilydale Township Action Group together. I want to thank Wandin Rotary, the Wandin football club and the Wandin Cricket club for their family fun day and also acknowledge the work of Bendigo Bank, the community bank that donated $10,000 to each of the Coldstream, Gruyere, Wandin and Seville CFAs—community groups and CFAs that need to be supported more than ever. It was a wonderful day, celebrating everything that is great about this country and everything that is great about our community—coming together, supporting each other and recognising this wonderful country.","Casey Electorate: Australia Day","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VIOLI (Casey) ","(09:30):"

Its always an honour to attend these ceremonies and be part of the personal chapters in peoples lives as they take that huge step towards citizenship. That day, as well, is used as a backdrop to recognise champions who make a difference in our community.  I want to make special mention of Blacktown Citizen of the Year Rachael Hanlon for her tireless—genuinely tireless—efforts through the Blacktown City Lions Club. Ive known Rachael for years and I know how hard she works. For example, she works to support fundraising drives to help the Blacktown and Mount Druitt Hospital, gets involved in Indigenous reading collection drives and also, importantly, takes leadership roles in local initiatives to tackle domestic violence. In her 10year campaign, Rachael has helped raise over $400,000 and delivered $500,000 worth of food donations to support people in need in our area. I want to extend my deep thanks and congratulations to her not just for winning the award but for what shes done to make a difference in peoples lives. Recognised on the day as well was Ebony OConnor, who was awarded the citys Young Citizen of the Year award for outstanding achievement and dedication to youth initiatives through the Blacktown Youth Advisory Committee. I acknowledge the Environmental Citizen of the Year, Ariana Goanta. Ariana was recognised for her contributions in promoting recycling and teaching others how to look after wildlife. And congrats to the Rotary Club of Blacktown City, who received the Community Event of the Year award for their successful seniors Christmas lunch. On Australia Day there were a number of Chifley people honoured with the Order of Australia. Deep congrats to Dr Amanda White OAM, who has rightly earned that abbreviation at the end of her name, for her remarkable service in the tertiary education sector, and to Mr Francis Avis OAM for his outstanding work in broadcast media. I also recognise Alexa Player, a young girl from the Blacktown District Girl Guides, who has received the Queens Guide Gold Endeavour award; that will be awarded to her formally later this year. It is the highest attainable recognition for youth members of Girl Guides Australia. Well done to Alexa. Finally, late last year I attended the Mount Druitt and Blacktown Police Awards. One of the officers acknowledged was Chief Inspector Bob Fitzgerald, someone I have known for quite some time, with a dedicated service of 36 years. Congratulations to Bob on the award he received, and to other police officers from our area on awards received. Thank you for your hard work and courage to help keep our community safe.","Chifley Electorate: Australia Day","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HUSIC (Chifley—Minister for Industry and Science) ","(09:33):"

We have offences for assaults. Anyone who has been the victim of an assault, especially in a family violence situation, can take out an intervention order. I congratulate New South Wales; they have coercive control legislation in place for specific offences. I know Queensland will bring in this offence in 2025. Victoria must do the same.  As the shadow minister for multicultural affairs, I go to many multicultural events and speak to many women. The sad reality out there—and I wont name any specific groups—is there are socalled cultural customs or beliefs where women may not have the same rights as men. I very much point this out to the women, and the women say to me, You can tell us, but go and tell the blokes too. The sad reality out there—and Ive seen and experienced this firsthand in my office square—is you can have a situation where the control is not only that you are not allowed to leave the house or, if you do leave the house, you are asked where you are going and who youre going to be meeting with; youre not allowed to get a job or a drivers licence. If they apply with Immigration, they dont even see any emails from the immigration department; their passports are held. Its very much coercive control. I congratulate Victoria Police because I know that, when these matters have been reported to them, they have taken very firm action when it comes to intervention orders. The only thing I say to Victoria Police on what is needed is: keep the victims informed of what is going on. Ive had victims come to me and say: Theres been an intervention order put in place. Theres a court date. They then believe they have to go to court and represent themselves and are not actually aware that Victoria Police will be representing them. We need more to be done in this place. I know all governments are trying to do their utmost, but I really call on the Victorian government to take action in this space. I acknowledge that the previous Liberal government committed $3.4 billion in the Womens Budget Statement. On all sides we need to do more, especially when it comes to coercive control. It is devastating not only for the women involved but for their children, because everything is controlled.","Domestic and Family Violence","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WOOD (La Trobe) ","(09:36):"

These awards recognise the extraordinary contributions made by Australians who have impacted our communities for the better.  I wish to extend my congratulations to Professor Christopher Maher AM, of Epping, recognised with the award of Member of the Order of Australia for his outstanding contributions to physiotherapy, particularly in pain management, positively impacting numerous lives. We also honour the late Emeritus Professor Robin King AO, who was posthumously awarded the Officer of the Order of Australia for his remarkable service to engineering, tertiary education and professional bodies, leaving a lasting legacy for our community. Furthermore, my heartfelt congratulations go to Peter Bacha OAM, honoured with the Medal of the Order of Australia for his dedication to a game I love, football, and community engagement as well, notably through his leadership of the Rydalmere Lions Football Club. Then we have Dr Starlette Beaumont Isaacs OAM. She is deserving of recognition for her service to medicine and community health, exemplified by her commitment to patient care and bulkbilling, earning her the Medal of the Order of Australia. Next we have Professor Elizabeth New OAM. She was commended for her contributions to science as a researcher, receiving the Medal of the Order of Australia, inspiring our community with her passion for discovery and innovation. I also acknowledge Tony Pang OAM. Although he resides outside of Bennelong, he has played a significant role in our local multicultural community, notably as vicechairman and secretary of CASS, demonstrating admirable dedication to serving the elderly and disadvantaged. Lastly, Id like to acknowledge the City of Ryde citizen and young citizen of the year. Ryde Citizen of the Year is scouting legend Lyn Mann. Her dedication to Ryde East scouts has been extraordinary. She has been involved with them for over 40 years. Her leadership of the 1st East Ryde Scout Group has been constant, and her tireless efforts in advocating for the welfare of our citizens, her involvement in community projects and her spirit embody the essence of what it means to be a citizen in Bennelong. The Ryde Young Citizen of the Year, Areg Grigorian, is a passionate, energetic and committed young community member. I had the pleasure of working alongside Areg in his role at the Armenian National Committee, but Aregs commitment to bettering our community reaches much further than that. At the age of eight, he inspired the City of Rydes Walk. Ride. Share. campaign after seeing his brother injured in a bicycle accident. His acknowledgement is well deserved.

Sadly, this was not the case for the residents of the southern suburbs of Logan, the northern Gold Coast and the Scenic Rim, who had a tornado form a destructive path from Jimboomba through to Upper Coomera, through Helensvale and out to sea. Winds of over 200 kilometres an hour raged, classifying it as an EF2 tornado. Hundreds of mature trees were uprooted, and many houses, sadly, were destroyed. Sadly, one lady in Helensvale passed away after she was hit by a falling tree. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones. In the days following the storms, heavy rainfall and high winds battered the already tornadosmashed area, causing more damage including flooding, particularly due to debris choking various waterways. Nearly 1,000 homes and businesses across the Gold Coast, Logan and Scenic Rim were impacted across the electorates of Wright, Forde and Fadden. At the peak of the disaster, some 130,000 homes were without electricity, with close to 4,000 of these still not having been reconnected nearly a fortnight later. More than 100 power poles and over 50 kilometres of powerlines were brought down in the storms and needed to be replaced.  From Boxing Day to early January, I spent much of my time visiting the area and working with those affected communities—checking in with residents who had reached out to my office seeking assistance but also, importantly, finding residents who hadnt been contacted, because mobile phone services were out and people couldnt get in contact with friends and loved ones. Suburbs including Willow Vale, Wongawallan, Upper Coomera, Pimpama and Cedar Creek were especially hard hit on Christmas night, followed by flooding on New Years Day. Witnessing that damage firsthand and seeing entire homes in Wongawallan destroyed, becoming but a pile of splintered timber, was a humbling experience. In Willow Vale, power poles were split and lying across roads and properties. We saw cars and homes crushed by fallen tree limbs. As I said, the flooding on New Years Day created havoc. I want to thank all of the SES and volunteers, the Energex crews and everybody involved through our rural fire brigades for their tremendous work in helping clean up this disaster area. Much more needs to be done yet.

When Canberra Week began in 1977, it starred Al Grassby, the godfather of Australian multiculturalism, and honoured the First Nations and migrant communities. The National Multicultural Festival began in 1996 and has become our city s largest festival, drawing support from volunteers in the diplomatic corps.  This weekend Canberra will celebrate the National Multicultural Festival, the event made possible by the dedication of numerous communities. I want to acknowledge some of the unsung heroes today: Andrew Yan and Robert Feng from the Chinese showcase, Jo Chivers and Duncan Smith from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander showcase, Toa Takiari and Elena Sione from the Pacific Islander showcase, Deepak Raj Gupta from India in the City, Tracy Dennis from the European village, George Karkazis from Greek Glendi, Lauren Harvey from Contact Canberra, Gonzales Olmos from Latin American Quarters, Bianca Abreu from Latin American embassies, Trevlyn Gilmour and Alicia Doherty from the USA showcase, Brooke Thomas from the bellydancing showcase, Charles Koker from the African village, Malcolm Buchanan from the Celtic Irish showcase, Jacqui Dillon and Mandy Scott from community languages, Franco Papandrea from the Italian community, Suren Deonarain from the festival parade, Helen Musa from CityNews and Lee Donnelly from Fyshwick Fresh Food Markets. The festival thrives on the support of community members, volunteers and organisations like the Australian National University, represented by Ashley Zmijewski, who ensure its success. And, of course, we cant forget the role of public servants such as Anita Perkins in the Community Services Directorate and the leadership of Minister Mick Gentleman. The festival community reference panel of Giovani AlvarezCano, Ambreen Atif, Kofi Bonsu, Malcolm Buchanan, Ruchika Goel, Luka Musicki, Toa Takiari and Chin Wong provide guidance, ensuring the festivals growth and relevance. I acknowledge, too, the festivals directors, remembering the late Domenic Mico, and celebrating the leadership of Azra Khan and Jayne Simon. The success of the National Multicultural Festival has been reflected in it winning an award for the best Australian community event at the 2023 Australian Event Awards. From humble beginnings, the National Multicultural Festival has evolved into an event that annually attracts over a quarter of a million attendees. It is testament to Canberras transformation into a cosmopolitan centre, enriched by the contributions of individuals from over 170 nations. As we celebrate today, let us be inspired by the shared traditions and continue to build a festival that celebrates diversity, fosters understanding and enriches our community.","National Multicultural Festival","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr LEIGH (Fenner—Assistant Minister for Competition, Charities and Treasury, Assistant Minister for Employment) ","(09:45):"

Today I would like to make special mention of two of those: the Lions Club of Burleigh Heads and the Lions Club of Mudgeeraba. Both of those clubs put on an amazing show of support to our community on Australia Day following our citizenship ceremonies.  The Burleigh Heads Lions Club put on an absolutely awesome barbecue at the end of the citizenship ceremony that was held at the Burleigh Heads RSL. The feedback was that it was topnotch. The sausages were amazing. It was a great way to welcome our newest Australians. That ceremony was held at the Burleigh Heads RSL, and I would also like to give a shoutout to the community of the Burleigh Heads RSL. They do an outstanding job supporting veterans in our community. Over the last couple of years in particular that club has raised so much money to upgrade the facilities of their hall. It looks fantastic and they should be very proud of their efforts. Id also like to congratulate the Lions Club of Mudgeeraba. Every year for many years now, they have hosted a citizenship ceremony at the Mudgeeraba hall. Its a very unique ceremony that really touches on the hinterland area of the Gold Coast, Mudgeeraba and the Lions Club. The Mudgeeraba Lions Club hosts the ceremony. I go along as the presiding officer, but its conducted like a Lions meeting, so the values and the missions that are associated with the club are certainly on display. Again, they do an amazing job, and its a great way to be able to welcome our newest Australians. We have in our community, as I said at the beginning, so many wonderful community groups. We also have some very amazing individuals that have contributed for many years, sometimes to one organisation but often to many organisations on the Gold Coast. Each year since Ive been elected, Ive held what I have called McPherson Community Achiever Awards, where I recognise those individuals. Whether they be directly from a service organisation, sporting club or local charity, I recognise them for the work they have done to support our community, because, quite frankly, without them we would not be able to help those people who, in some cases, need the most support from their communities. For those individuals, time is running out to get your nominations in for this year. There are three categories of awards. There are the McPherson Community Achiever Award, the McPherson Young Community Achiever Award for people under 25 years of age and the McPherson Surf Life Saving Community Achiever Award.","McPherson Electorate: Lions Club","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[7]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ANDREWS (McPherson) ","(09:48):"

Turkish Airlines have decided to call Melbourne their home in Australia. From March this year, there will be flights leaving Melbourne three times a week to Istanbul. In Melbourne we have Australias largest Turkish community, so this new expansion will allow easier access to visiting family and friends and provide greater connection to their homeland. It also means that we will have more opportunities for Australians to take on different adventures. For those who want to explore Turkiye, especially Istanbul, the city of two continents, this UNESCO World Heritage location is the perfect place to stop and shop.  Conversely, Turkiye will have greater access to Australias best capital city and capital of food, sport, wine and culture. Its expected to bring thousands of new visitors to our beautiful state of Victoria, contribute more than $132 million annually to the states economy and create an estimated 840 jobs in our aviation and tourism sector. This connectivity is so important for our future as a nation. Turkish Airlines flights will increase Victorias access to key European, Middle Eastern, Balkan and African markets through this new connection. You may not know, but the Turkiye, Middle East and Africa region is one of Victorias major trading partners, with a twoway merchandise trade valued at almost $5.5 billion in 202223. Daily flights by Turkish airlines, which is what they hope to grow to, would add some 3,650 tonnes of airfreight capacity annually. This didnt happen quite easily. I have to acknowledge the Deputy Premier of Victoria, Ben Carroll, who is the minister; Minister Suleyman; and all of the Victorian government, which worked hard as we met with the Turkish Airlines CEO and all the people involved in that to make this happen. Its because Victorias got a strong connection with Turkiye that this happened, and we should acknowledge that this is one of the wonderful things that are happening under the Allan government. Id also like to briefly talk about a very important birthday we celebrated at the start of February: 40 years of Medicare. I am proud to be part of a party that has stood and fought hard to make sure Australians have access to a free and universal healthcare system—a system that is the envy of the world. Id like to say thank you to the team at Nexus GP Superclinic Wallan for allowing me to come celebrate with them. It was great being at the Wallan superclinic because this was one of the superclinics that were built under the Gillard government. Of course, when the Abbott government took over, the then health minister and now opposition leader refused to open the superclinic. That way, he could walk around and say the Gillard government never delivered their commitment on superclinics. Its childish sooking, but thats what you expect with him. At the end of the day, this was a Labor project that delivered for our community. Its been servicing everyone ever since, and Labor will always stand by Medicare and universal health care.","Turkish Airlines, Medicare: 40th Anniversary","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[8]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ROB MITCHELL (McEwen) ","(09:51):"

Green spaces improve air quality and increase rates of physical activity, improving physical and mental health.  As Perth swelters through another hot week, our urban vegetation is particularly significant. It cools down our cities, combating the urban heatisland effect, which makes cities several degrees hotter than the surrounding countryside. In late 2022, a group of Curtin residents concerned about Perths shrinking urban canopy came together to form the WA Tree Canopy Advocates, which now comprises 24 groups from across WA and almost 20,000 members—all worried about Perths dwindling tree canopy. Sarah, the founding member of WATCA, recently told me that, between 2011 and 2020, one quarter of Perths urban canopy was lost, largely through the clearing of private land for development. Overall canopy cover in Perth is 16 per cent, the lowest of all Australian cities. For context, cities like Barcelona, New York city and Canberra have a canopy cover target of 30 per cent or higher. Metropolitan Perth is one of the only cities in Australia that does not have a tree canopy target. The most important thing we can do to improve our urban greenery is to protect the trees we already have, but Perth has no blanket protections for large mature trees on private land. But local councils, like Nedlands, in my electorate, are trying to change this by introducing regulations that require landowners to apply for permission to clear trees on private property that are more than eight metres tall. Last Friday, Sarah and the WA Tree Canopy Advocates were devastated to hear that the WA state government has overruled this regulation, and is instead developing a strategy that will not include any requirement for protection of trees on private land. This is despite the fact 80 per cent of the canopy being lost is on private land. We absolutely need increased housing density and infill to address housing shortages, but we must not lose the mature canopy and green spaces that make Curtin a beautiful place to live. We must ensure that these decisions are made in the longterm interests of communities, not property developers. It takes one person a few minutes to cut down a tree, but it takes coordinated effort across all levels of government to protect one. As part of my Curtins Pathway to Net Zero project, local volunteers discussed the need for consistent regulation between federal, state and local governments to improve urban greening. This years anticipated reform of the EPBC Act is an opportunity for our national nature laws to better protect biodiversity in our cities. Many in my community are calling for a national framework to protect urban vegetation so councils can sow the seeds and reap the benefits of leafy cities.","Curtin Electorate: Environment","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[9]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CHANEY (Curtin) ","(09:54):"

Congratulations to Gail Eastaway of Cooma, who was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day 2024 Honours List. Gail has had a really impressive 50year career in journalism, starting as a cadet with the Cooma Express newspaper and covering most aspects across the Snowy Monaro, from fatal accidents to helping fight to keep Snowy Hydro in public hands. Her OAM also recognises her almost 50year involvement with the Cooma Show and the amazing work she does for the Cooma races.  Robert Johnsons Medal of the Order of Australia was awarded for service to the Bermagui community. He is a Red Cross Lifeblood blood and plasma donor, and he drives to Canberra, which is a threehour trip, once a fortnight to make his donation. Hes raised funds through the New South Wales container deposit scheme for the Bermagui surf club by rescuing thousands upon thousands of bottles from local businesses and homes. The award also recognises his efforts with the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, particularly during the Black Summer. Ben Maguire AM and Marina Maguire OAM run the amazing Remount facility in this electorate as well. I went out there, and spoke about them in this chamber not long ago. The work that they do with the veterans and first responders community is nothing short of amazing. The Medal of the Order of Australia went to Michele Bootes of Merimbula for her services to surf lifesaving. She created the Same Wave project, which is a Nippers project especially designed for people with disabilities. Its celebrating its 25th year this year and has rolled out to other surf lifesaving communities across the country. On the day she found out, she was actually volunteering at the beach as well. I want to give a special shoutout to the other members, whom I have contacted personally: Isaac Cotter, Colin Dunn, Ronald Miller, Paul Jones and Katherine Laidler. Public Service medals were awarded to Natalie Cooper, Rodney Dix and Emma Gowling. Conspicuous Service medals were awarded to Wing Commander Denis French, Warrant Officer Class One Megan Griffiths, Colonel Alison Kaine and Squadron Leader Melissa Vreugdenburg. The Medal of the Order of Australia was awarded to Darrell Hegarty, Professor AllenJohn Collins and Catherine Walker. Thank you so much for the work you do in our communities.

418,0,0,0,1,2,"Tehan, Dan MP",210911,"Wannon","LP","N/A",929," In continuing my contribution to the debate on the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2024, I want to go back to where I was when I began the speech in the House and give this quote from 2017 from the then shadow tourism minister. The then shadow tourism minister in 2017 said:  … the increase in the Passenger Movement Charge has real consequences for tourism and will have jobs impacts in the tourism industry, which employs a million Australians, is Australias largest services export and has been nominated as one of Australias five super growth sectors … There was a bit of frowning from the other side when I read that quote because I dont think they quite understood who the 2017 shadow tourism minister was. It was the now Prime Minister. Its quite funny that the Prime Minister, in 2017, was aghast at any idea of increasing the passenger movement charge yet now we see it going up by $10. What are we doing here? What are we seeing now? We are seeing the consequences of a government that cant manage the economy. What happens when you cant manage the economy, the cost of living goes up and the cost of doing business goes up? It is that, sadly, you have to tax more and you have to charge more. Thats what were seeing right here and now. The tourism industry, at a time when the cost of doing business continues to increase, is now seeing the passenger movement charge go up, even though the Prime Minister knows that this will have real consequences. One of the great shames of a government that cant handle the economy, especially for smaller businesses, is that they are impacted by the decisions that governments have to make as a consequence of their failure to manage the economy. This is one of those decisions. We already know that the passenger movement charge in Australia is one of the highest departure taxes in the developed world. At a time when we want to be doing everything we can to help and support our tourism industry, it is unfortunate that we now see that the passenger movement charge is increasing. One of the things that is very fortunate is that the last time the passenger movement charge increased—and thats when we had those fine words from the Prime Minister—is that the then government put a fiveyear freeze in place through legislation. That obviously has rolled over and that fiveyear freeze has ended, but we saw the passenger movement charge stay stationary for five years. This $10 increase is consistent with the CPI over that time. For that reason and because of what we did previously, the opposition is not going to stand in the way of this passenger movement charge increase. In the end, given the governments economic mismanagement, we know and understand that they have no alternatives as a bigspending government to, sadly, being a higherregulation, highertaxing government as well. Were not going to stand in the way of it, but what we would say is: please, government, get your economic management right, because you cannot continue to put higher taxes and higher regulatory costs on every industry in this nation. If you do, to quote the Prime Ministers own words, it will have: … real consequences for tourism and will have jobs impacts in the tourism industry, which employs a million Australians, is Australias largest services export and has been nominated as one of Australias five super growth sectors …","Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TEHAN (Wannon) ","(10:01):"
419,0,0,0,1,2,"Tink, Kylea MP",300124,"North Sydney","IND","N/A",930," I rise to speak to the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2024, as, while on the surface it would seem of little consequence to add a $10 fee that has not been adjusted since 2017, the truth is that the approach being taken here is symptomatic of a much larger issue—that is, the challenge of encouraging travellers to spend more where they land rather than eating up their disposable income through taxes on airfares. While this charge may not have been increased in seven years, theres no lack of other additional charges added to a base fare which, in some instance, ultimately mean the oncosts can sometimes be more expensive than the base fare.  The charge to be imposed on every passenger onboard a departing international flight from 1 July 2024 will add $10 to the current passenger movement charge of $60, meaning each airfare, regardless of where you are headed, will be $10 more expensive from 1 July. Whether or not this $10 will change anyones mind about taking the trip in or out of Australia really isnt the issue to me—after all, were only talking about adding another 1½ per cent to the cost of a return flight from Melbourne or Sydney to Bali. It is, however, about just how many additional costs are borne by a traveller and the transparency around where these fees or taxes are even going in the first place or why they are ultimately there. Finding out what charges and taxes are added to the cost of an air ticket is usually pretty straightforward. They are usually all documented at the bottom of your ticket receipt. But finding out whose pocket those charges end up in and for what purpose is a completely different scenario. I have to declare here that I have family who work in the travel industry, and over many years Ive seen my family members struggle to adjust to the changing environment. Whether it was the shrinking commissions on all forms of travel, particularly those available on airfares for agents, or the increasingly angry discussions I see them having with customers who are frustrated that everything seems to be getting so expensive, it can be emotionally draining watching someone you love work themselves to the ground for diminishing returns while others come forward to take an increase in cuts. The passenger movement charge used to be more commonly known as the departure tax, and for a long time now it has simply been included in airfares, so its been difficult to actually feel the pinch. For agents and industry, this tax is recognisable via the code AU. But there are other taxes that are also routinely applied, and they include the passenger service charge, which has the code WY; the safety and security charge, which applies to all international and domestic airfares, which has the code WG; and the passenger service charge on domesticonly flights, which has the code QR. Then, depending on where youre going, there are also arrival charges or taxes, and this is where I take issue with the entire system. In terms of providing a reallife example: last September I took my children and my parents to Bali for a holiday. We hadnt been overseas since before 2020, so Id been saving really hard for a long time for this trip. Looking back at my airfares, the following taxes and fees were charged. There was, of course, the base fee for each ticket, which is a fee that covers exactly what you would expect it to cover: the seat that youre sitting on in the plane. Then there was the passenger movement charge, which, as I said earlier, used to be known as the departure tax and is an Australian government tax on all passengers departing for an overseas destination. In my case, this was charged at $60 per ticket. Then came the safety and security charge departure tax, which is an Australian government charge, again, on every domestic and international air ticket. It was introduced following 9/11 and seemingly is charged to cover the cost of underwriting safety and security services on all flights in Australian airspace. For this reason, the charge imposed on a longdistance domestic flight is likely to be higher than on an international flight. For me on my Bali flights, the charge was $32.11 on each ticket. The passenger service charge departure international tax was the next one on my ticket. This tax goes to the Australian airport youre using and is payable for both departure and arrival. The amount for this tax varies from one airport to another, but in my case I paid this fee on three separate occasions, as we travelled to Bali via Brisbane. In total, this fee cost me another $110.77 per ticket. Finally, a charge that was coded as TD, of the amount of $24.20, was applied as an additional passenger service charge at some point—but, to be honest, I really dont know why. It seemed to be applied when I added the domestic leg to our international tickets, but not even my travel agent could actually tell me what it was for. In total, I ended up paying an additional $227.08 per person for each of those airfares, or nearly $1,400, and that doesnt include the money that I then paid in the form of an arrival tax when we landed in Bali. Thats $1,400 that was no longer available for me or my kids to spend. We couldnt spend it in Bali supporting local businesses, we couldnt spend it on the way out in the airports, and we certainly couldnt bank it and put it towards another holiday at another time. But the shocking truth is that, had we been going somewhere like Los Angeles in the United States, the taxes would have been even higher, with the total oncosts increasing by an additional $40 per person, or another $240 overall. While I understand why this government would argue a $10 increase in this one passenger movement charge should hardly be challenged, I just dont agree. Every additional oncost charge by a government should always be scrutinised, as they rarely exist in isolation and, as we have seen with the introduction of the safety and security charges, once applied they just dont ever seem to be removed. It should be said that, as a citizen, there is no tax for arriving back in Australia, and children under 12 and international travellers transiting through Australia to another country are exempt. It is also worth noting that these charges are not just levied on Australian residents but also borne by tourists, based on what I can only assume is the idea that, if youre wealthy enough to travel overseas, the government would like a piece of the action. But my question here then is: why should the government take money that would otherwise be spent in small businesses and tourism outlets both here and internationally? When its introduced in July 2024, the $10 increase in the passenger movement charge will ultimately add another 1.43 per cent to a $701 transTasman return economy airfare and another 0.32 per cent to a $3,000 return flight from Sydney to Dallas. Many will assume that, given travellers heading overseas have already been whacked with massive price increases since the resumption of overseas travel, a $10 increase will just be a drop in the bucket—right? Surely it doesnt matter that both domestic and international tourists will take the hit—after all, youre either wealthy enough to travel in the first place or youre just a tourist and you dont vote, so you really have no choice but to cop it. But even the government is prepared to confess that this $10 drop in the bucket will ultimately earn around $100 million per year for the Australian government. In making the case for this increase, the government can point to other countries with far higher departure taxes. Leave the United Kingdom on a flight bound for Singapore or Hong Kong, and the air passenger duty, which is the United Kingdoms equivalent of the passenger movement charge, is $172 per passenger. But, even with that as the international standard, the question remains: is it the amount being charged or the very principle of the charge that needs to be challenged here? Once collected, what is this money even going to be used for? Looking at this through a broader lens: after the horror years of 2020 and 2021, the tourism gross domestic product, or GDP, rose 60.1 per cent, to $57.1 billion, in chain volume terms in 202223, but this remains below the 201819 peak of $63.4 billion. Tourisms overall contribution to our economic GDP growth rose to 2.5 per cent in 202223, but again this remains below the 201819 level of 3.1 per cent. It is currently estimated that 44 per cent of every tourism dollar in Australia is spent in regional destinations, and tourism hovers around fourthlargest of Australias exporting industries, accounting for 8.2 per cent of Australias export earnings. Domestically there are 8,478 flights per week, with 56.6 million passengers being carried over the course of the year. This is 26 per cent growth year on year. In total, 76.2 million seats were sold in the last 12 months. Thats up 19 per cent year on year. But this is still significantly less than the prepandemic peak of nearly 78 million. Whilst internationally we have recently bounced back to an average of 2,118 flights per week to 61 destinations, its still behind the 2,183 flights that were taken in January 2019. Importantly, tourism directly employs some 666,000—or, as we just heard the previous speaker say, one million—Australians, making up five per cent of Australias workforce, and there are nearly 11½ thousand travel agents spread around Australia. Over 355 of them are registered as being in my electorate of North Sydney, and these are the people I worry about. They will now need to look their customers in the eye and inform them that, through no fault of their own and with no meaningful benefit to themselves, the airfares theyre quoting them are guaranteed to increase in price by $10, come 1 July. Ten dollars across 56.6 million passengers is a lot more than the $100 million gain currently predicted by the government, so Im not sure what to make of that calculation. But then, talking to those who work in this industry and those who travel, the lack of transparency and accountability is something were becoming way too accustomed to. So next time you find yourself angered by the behaviour of airlines or travel agents, spare a thought for those involved in the industry, for they seem to currently be both the whipping boy and the trough when it comes to political intentions. Given this, on behalf of the community of North Sydney, I do not support this legislation—not because I think the dollar increase is unreasonable in and of itself but because I just dont think its okay to whack an extra cost onto a service on the basis that it shouldnt really matter. I would, however, very much welcome a full, thorough and transparent review of all taxes currently applied within the travel industry. For that reason, I stand ready to work with the government to see that realised.","Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TINK (North Sydney) ","(10:06):"

I want to thank the member for North Sydney, whose contribution I was glad to hear. I respect her perspective. She has obviously thought about this matter a great deal.  I commend the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2024 to the House. Its an important part of the governments overall strategy for managing the security of our borders, an area where costs are growing year on year. The Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2024 will amend the Passenger Movement Charge Act 1978 to implement one of our governments budget measures—that is, increasing the passenger movement charge from $60 to $70, effective from 1 July. As I mentioned, this is one of several measures the government announced in the 202324 budget as part of our overall economic and fiscal strategy to make sure that we can continue to deliver services where costs are rising. Of course, it is very important to continue to deliver a strong budget, and youll note that our Treasurer Jim Chalmers has been able to deliver a budget surplus for the first time in a very long time. The increase of $10 is broadly in line with inflation. Some of the other speakers have noted that it was 2017 when this charge was last increased, and that $10 increase that were seeing on top of the $60 is broadly in line with inflation. The additional revenue generated from this increase will help advance Australias economic interests and support the rising cost of services on our border. Im pleased to support this bill before the parliament. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

421,0,0,0,1,2,"Mitchell, Brian MP",129164,"Lyons","ALP","N/A",932," I rise today in support of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards and Other Measures) Bill 2023. Reliable internet access is now an expectation and necessity in 21st century Australia; were a quarter of the way into this century—wow! Telecommunication access and reliability is vital in much of todays economic, social, cultural and political activity.  Weve seen in recent years just how important broadband connectivity has become, with hundreds of thousands of people socialising, working and studying online. That was only heightened during the COVID19 pandemic, and it continues today. The sixhour Tasmania Telstra outage in February 2022 and the more recent 14hour national Optus outage left people unable to connect with loved ones, TV and radio stations inaccessible and urgent emails unread and unanswered, with the daytoday routines of many coming to a halt. Such outages cost businesses thousands of dollars when payments cannot be taken, while the simplest of tasks are unable to be communicated to coworkers. It may be seen as a minor hindrance or annoyance to some, but in an emergency communication becomes a critical tool to save property or, above all, life. As the member for a rural and regional electorate, I know this is especially true in the regions. This bill will deliver certainty to consumers and industry alike around access to these critical services. Through changes to five key areas of telecommunications regulation, the statutory infrastructure provider—or SIP—regime, this bill will also improve safeguards for Australians when they access broadband and voice services. Schedule 1 of the bill refines the statutory infrastructure provider, SIP, regime, which currently ensures all people in Australia can access highspeed broadband wherever they live or work. This will bring private networks for new developments under the SIP regime. Such networks are sometimes deployed in lifestyle or retirement villages or in multiunit buildings and have not previously been subject to SIP obligations. Bringing those areas under this regime will mean consumers serviced by private networks will have greater certainty that they can access broadband and voice at appropriate standards. Schedule 2 of the bill will provide powers for the Australian Communications and Media Authority to encourage better compliance with requirements for new installations. This will provide a mechanism for SIPs to be required to pay compensation to customers where they do not meet a standard or a rule. While there are no detailed standards or rules in place due to the recent processes to finalise NBN Cos special access undertaking and standard terms, the existence of the mechanism will provide incentives to lift performance. Schedule 3 of the bill provides powers for ACMA to publish the identities of carriers and carriage service providers in its reports on certain customer service issues and to share information more easily with the government. Importantly, this will allow consumers to make purchasing decisions that are better informed and improve competition and service delivery. Schedule 4 of the bill will amend the universal service obligation so the minister can determine specific universal service areas in Australia. This will provide flexibility for potential future changes such as bringing Norfolk Island into the universal service regime. While several legislative steps need to be taken for this to occur, this is a foundational step that may assist in the future. Schedule 5 of the bill makes technical amendments to specific aspects of the regulatory framework. This includes important changes to enhance the enforcement of the carrier separation rules of the Telecommunications Act and the Regional Broadband Scheme, which funds NBN Cos fixed wireless and satellite networks. I am particularly pleased to see measures in the bill that will give the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman a clearer role in resolving disputes about service connections. Under the new laws, the ombudsman will be able to work with customers and providers to resolve problems. My office often assists farmers and others who live in the most regional part of Lyons who need additional assistance from telcos to make sure they can access the phone and internet services they need. This bill makes it easier for rural and regional Tasmanians to get access to broadband and voice services and empowers the ombudsman to work with both customers and providers should issues arise during the connection process. At the end of last year in my role as Chair of the House Standing Committee on Communications and the Arts, I had the opportunity to table the committees most recent report, Connecting the country: missioncritical, from the inquiry into current investment into multicarrier regional infrastructure. The report goes directly to what I am speaking about today—ensuring that the necessary infrastructure and regulations are in place so all Australians, including regional and rural Australians, can reliably access critical telecommunications services. During the inquiry that informed the report, the committee heard from consumers and industry alike, including state and territory governments, Indigenous communities, primary producers, councils, business chambers, emergency services, health services and community groups. They were a very complex set of hearings and we took a lot of evidence. The overwhelming feedback from across the country was clear: reliable telecommunication services are not a nicetohave but as essential a service as electricity or running water in our everyday lives. Part of the title of the committees report—mission critical—says it all. I am proud to be part of a government that recognises this and is committed to delivering improved communications infrastructure, services and resilience for all Australians. I would like to thank the minister for her support through the process. I think she is doing terrific work in this regard. In my electorate of Lyons, for example, I was recently able to announce funding for new mobile base stations in Sheffield, Tea Tree and Ansons Bay through the improving mobile coverage round. This funding delivered my election commitment of a $2.25 million investment by the Albanese Labor government to improve mobile phone coverage in these areas. At the end of last year I met with the Ansons Bay Telecommunications Working Group to discuss the progress of the new mobile phone tower and just how important this project is to members of this isolated northeast community. For those who may not know Ansons Bay, it is a one road in and one road out community. Its a beautiful little spot up in the northeast of Tasmania. Its very isolated and prone to bushfires and so telecommunications is an absolute must. Residents of Lyons have also benefited from the governments Mobile Black Spot Program, which has extended and improved mobile coverage in Pyengana, Murdunna, Liena, Colebrook. Blackstone Heights, Lachlan and Wilmot, just to name a few. Further, the Albanese governments $480 million investment to upgrade NBN fixed wireless services has meant more than 7,500 residents and businesses across Lyons now have access to uncapped satellite broadband services through NBN Cos Sky Muster Plus product, delivering faster speeds and responding to the demand for more data. Thats not to mention the families and businesses in Lyons that already have and those who soon will be able to upgrade to a fullfibre broadband connection as part of the Albanese governments plan for a better National Broadband Network. These upgrades are possible thanks to the Albanese governments $2.4 billion investment to expand fullfibre access to an additional 1.5 million premises by the end of 2025. I think were a long way removed from the words of former prime minister Abbott, who I think back then said five megabytes or something like that was all you needed in the regions. I cant remember the exact quote, but its laughable now when we look at the data needs in the regions, not just in homes but also in businesses and on farms, where they are using technology on farm. The communications requirements are just growing and growing. Its fair to say that the telecommunications requirements in the bush are just as critical, if not more so, than they are in elements of the city. My constituents in Evandale, Longford, Perth, Scamander, Bridgewater, Campbell Town, New Norfolk, Old Beach and Pontville can now upgrade from the slower, less reliable copper broadband network retained by the former coalition government to affordable, reliable, highspeed fibre broadband with no upfront installation cost. It is investments like these that ensure more of my constituents—more Australians—can take advantage of all the opportunities of the digital global economy. Taken together, the measures in this bill will improve access to broadband and voice services for people across Australia, including in the regions. Australians expect to have access to broadband and voice services and to be able to access these services with a minimum of fuss. They expect the infrastructure to be built and the necessary regulations and consumer safeguards to be in place. This bill is key to meeting those expectations, to improving access to critical communications in Australia and to ensuring certainty for consumers and industry alike of access to broadband and voice services. I commend the bill to the House.","Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards and Other Measures) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) ","(10:20):"
422,0,0,0,1,2,"Birrell, Sam MP",288713,"Nicholls","NATS","N/A",934," I too rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards and Other Measures) Bill 2023. I make the point that the National Broadband Network is critical infrastructure in regional Australia. It connects people, it connects communities and it connects businesses.  Many people will know that the electorate of Nicholls is one of the food bowls, if not the food bowl, of Australia, and agriculture is incredibly important to our region and our economy. The NBN and a reliable internet connection have become a critical element of operating modern, productive and profitable agricultural businesses, whether it be the links between agricultural machinery in the field, like tractors, headers or other machinery that have internet links to GPS or other outside pieces of technology; whether it be access to the Bureau of Meteorology data which helps farmers make decisions; or whether it be, as it was in an occupation I had before coming to this place, using the internet to link together irrigation networks—both networks on farm, where an internet connection can inform farmers of whats happening in relation to soil moisture levels, water and the status of irrigation events, and broader networks. Thats a key part of the Goulburn Valley Water and GoulburnMurray Water connected system. That helps with water efficiency, in that broadband internet networks can talk to each other and can inform GoulburnMurray Water headquarters when to fill channels because irrigators might need to use that water. Doing that in more of a realtime sense means we have much better water efficiency. A lot of that great technological work and enhancement of the broadband network that led to that being able to be done happened under the previous coalition government. Its also in terms of manufacturing and service industries. Reliable broadband internet connectivity is critical for emergency service workers to be able to communicate with each other and see whats happening both with weather and with emergency events. In relation to that in particular, I want to make special mention of some of the things that are going on in Victoria at the moment. There are some serious bushfire threats, mostly, as I understand it, in the electorates of Mallee and Wannon, and my thoughts are with those people and the members for those two electorates because theyre very concerned at the moment about the bushfires that are happening. A lot of people are also without power in Victoria at the moment as a result of the failure of the network. On the ground in those electorates—in Wannon and Mallee in particular—Im sure that the enhanced internet access is helping the firefighters and emergency services deal with those problems. When I was campaigning for the 2022 election, in which I was elected to this place, there was some funding that was committed to enhancing the resilience of some of those broadband networks and the towers, and that has certainly helped in relation to the flooding that occurred in my electorate and also in relation to the fires. Thats something that successive governments need to keep doing. They need to look at how we can make sure people have reliable internet not only in the good times but also when they are suffering from some threats. As at 1 November 2023, the electorate of Nicholls has around 84,000 premises ready connect to the NBN, with 71 per cent served by one of a number of fixedline technologies, which may include fibre to the basement, fibre to the node, fibre to the curb, hybrid fibre coaxial and fibre to the premises. There are approximately 11,000 premises that are fibre to the node within Nicholls that may be able to access fibre to the premises and an additional 9,700 fibretothenode premises scheduled for an upgrade in the future. Over 6,000 of those are currently under construction. These upgrades have taken place in some of the smaller areas in my electorate, including Cobram, Echuca, Kialla, Kyabram, Nagambie, Numurkah, Rochester, Seymour—which has suffered from some flooding in recent times—Tatura and Yarrawonga, and an upgrade in Broadford is expected to be completed later this year. Its a continuing effort to make sure the latest technology gets, in particular, to the regional areas. This demonstrates that the NBN is not static infrastructure; it is being improved, expanded to more regional towns and growing constantly with new development. This bill looks to provide a refresh to a system that was introduced by the coalition government, setting out rules for the connection and supply of internet and voice services. It appears to be largely an uncontroversial bill and it will be supported, but there are some issues that we have uncovered that we want to highlight. Firstly, the bill was promised by the minister to be in the House at the end of 2022. Thats 2022, not 2023, and here we are now. If there had been comprehensive industry engagement that wound up satisfying or resolving concerns that had been raised, you could understand this delay, but, as is often the case with the Albanese government, unfortunately, there was no such consultation. Even after this delay, the feedback weve got is that the minister did not listen to many industry concerns and failed to properly engage with them. This bill primarily makes a number of changes to the operation and enforcement of what is known as the statutory infrastructure provider, or the SIP regime. The regime sets rules related to the connection and supply of internet and voice services across Australia and was introduced by the coalition government in July 2020, acting essentially as a universal broadband service guarantee. In the history of telecommunications in Australia, universal service guarantees have played an important part in ensuring that regional and remote Australians such as the people in my electorate of Nicholls have access to quality services. SIPs are carriers that must provide basic wholesale broadband services in the areas they service. The NBN is the default SIP for the vast majority of Australian premises, but other carriers that have installed network infrastructure to connect premises in areas such as new real estate developments, shopping centres or apartments may also be deemed to be SIPs. There are 32 registered SIPs in Australia, covering areas large and small. The SIPs have obligations under the Telecommunications Act 1997 to connect premises in their service areas to their networks. These obligations include ensuring wholesale services are made available to retailers to provide connections for consumers, including setting minimum broadband speeds. In February 2021 the then minister for communications announced plans to engage industry stakeholders on new standards, rules and benchmarks for SIP networks. This government continued that process, and, in late August 2022, the Minister for Communications announced a new round of public consultation on the laws and invited submissions on a draft bill. The submissions were to close, after a relatively short period, in late September 2022, and the bill was supposed to be before the parliament by the end of 2022. But the bill was finally introduced in the House in the very last sitting week of 2023. Maybe the government were a bit distracted during 2023—Im not sure. So, a year late, here we are. The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that, while there was general support for the provisions of the draft bill, concerns raised during the consultation process resulted in amendments and further consultation on changes to the draft bill. Stakeholders—some in my electorate—may have felt that they have been ignored and their concerns about the disclosure provisions havent been listened to properly. But the coalition generally supports this bill because it provides a range of technical updates to tweak the system which the coalition introduced. Such tweaks are of course normal and expected in such a fastchanging telecommunications environment, where technology is evolving at a very fast pace. As I explained earlier, digital connectivity and new technologies are very important, especially in regional Australia. This parliament has a responsibility—the coalition did it, and Im pleased that this government is continuing on with that work—to make sure that that digital connectivity is available to all, not just the easy stuff, which is so often the way. The easy stuff is where the big populations are and you need fewer assets for a higher density of people, so that gets done, and then, where there are low density populations, that gets pushed out or doesnt happen at all. The coalition will be watching carefully to see what the Senate inquiry comes up with. Weve reserved our right to consider amendments recommended by that committee, but were broadly supportive and we encourage the government to continue to be committed to providing the latest technology and broadband access to those in regional Australian. People in metropolitan areas benefit from that, even though they may not know it. People sitting in some of the metropolitan seats in Melbourne and Sydney are interested in what their broadband speeds are in their own houses or in their own businesses. But, as is so often the case—and we in the National Party are here to explain that and advocate for that across this parliament—what happens in regional Australia affects you in the metropolitan areas. Thats because so many of our resources—whether they be in agriculture or mining or a range of other industries—depend on the viability and productivity of regional Australia. Its important that all legislation looks out to the regions as well as the metropolitan areas.","Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards and Other Measures) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BIRRELL (Nicholls—Deputy Nationals Whip) ","(10:31):"
423,0,0,0,1,2,"McCormack, Michael MP",219646,"Riverina","NATS","N/A",935," Im truly grateful that weve been joined by the Minister for Communications. At the outset, Im going to be very bipartisan and give the minister some kudos. Her first visit as the minister, I understand, was to the Riverina electorate. We met with Peter, Meegan, Todd and Lily McCarten at Naradhan. The McCartens operate a large mixed farming enterprise. At the time, theyd recently upgraded their internet through NBN Australias Sky Muster Plus satellite service, and the minister was good enough to not only go and visit them at their farm but also, I understand, follow up with them and with the services that were being provided to that district. Thats important. Thats what a good minister does.  At the time, the minister also looked at the new solar farm on the Newell Highway just outside West Wyalong in Bland Shire. I can happily report to the minister that that is progressing very nicely. Each time I travel along the Newell Highway between West Wyalong and Forbes, I look at that project and reflect back to that day. Again, its what can be done when ministers look to regional Australia, as the member for Nicholls has just said. I joined the parliament with the member for Greenway back in 2010. I believe weve got a very good working relationship, and thats important. As the member for Nicholls pointed out, the government should look at every piece of policy through the lens of how it is going to affect regional Australia, because its regional Australia where the action is. I appreciate, Deputy Speaker Payne, that youre from this fine centre of Canberra. Canberra could not operate without what happens in regional Australia—it just could not. We saw that writ large during COVID. In those very dark days, it was regional Australia that led the way. It led the economy, through providing the food and through providing the resources that kept food on the table and the balance of payments as they should be. That is why communications are also so vital. Back when my father was farming, if they needed to sell grain or stock, they had to get off their tractor or their farm implement, get in the ute, drive back to the house, get on the landline and hope that it coincided with the time that the seller or the buyer was available. Now they can do it on their tractors. They can do it and keep that tractor, or header or harvester or scarifier or whatever it might be, still operating. They can do it via telecommunications. And farming is now very much in the digital world. Indeed, the farm equipment is operating with GPS technology. So its not as it was, back in the day when a young Michael McCormack would sometimes deliberately drive the tractor offline so that he wouldnt have to do it the next day, and his exasperated father would tell him: That was it! Youve been banned from doing this until you can get your line straight, and that was always great! But these days, the tractors literally drive themselves and not a skerrick of property or land is wasted. And thats important. So thats why it is so important that we get communications right and continue that investment. Thats why its good that the minister is here. This legislation does make a number of changes to the operation and enforcement of the statutory infrastructure provider regime. I heard the member for Nicholls talking about how important communications technology, digital technology, is to the irrigation systems and the channels and the operators within his fine electorate, where they grow so much of the food and fibre this nation relies upon. Again, that is of critical importance. The SIP regime in this particular piece of legislation was established by the coalition government. It set rules related to the connection and supply of internet and voice services across Australia. The changes in this bill are aimed at providing better access to these services, with additional safeguards—and safeguards are so important—for consumers, and improved recourse in the event there is disputation. The bill seeks to provide clarity and certainty for industry and consumers. As the member for Nicholls has pointed out, the coalition is broadly supportive of the bill. We do believe it is late. It has been unnecessarily delayed. I get that the minister has had other things on her mind, and I know how busy she would be. Its a big, broad portfolio. The bill would also confirm the ability of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman to deal with consumer complaints on SIP related issues. In addition, the bill expands the powers of the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, relating to reports on the performance of telecommunications companies. That is vital, because the government needs to ensure that companies are kept to their KPIs and are upfront and transparent and accountable to government. Government makes a big investment in the communications space. I appreciate that telecommunications companies do as well. But the SIP regime, as I say, was introduced by the coalition government. That was back in July 2020. It essentially acts as a universal broadband service guarantee. And those guarantees are necessary. I know that my predecessor in the seat of Riverina, Kay Hull, crossed the floor on the sale of Telstra because she understood just how important it was, for those universal service obligations, for the biggest telco in the country to ensure that—both then and in the long distance future—they didnt forget the bush and that they didnt ignore their responsibilities when it came to providing those sorts of services. Given the fact that they are, in a sense, relying on government investment, given the fact that they have a lot of customers, some of those communities dont have a lot of consumers. They dont have a lot of people, but their ability to tap in to the economy and provide what is needed is absolutely important. Ill give you two examples of those kinds of communities. One is Murringo near Young. I can remember the delight of that community when they were put online, so to speak, with a telecommunications tower. It brought them into the known universe. They had felt so isolated. I can remember a number of women in that community coming up to me at the launch and saying how important it was for them to be able to run their little businesses which were selling to the world and how this had brought them online. But it was more important, perhaps, for their children, some of whom were in the vital years of schooling. Every year in education is important, but year 12 of course is a big year. In year 11 and 12, when young people are doing their high school certificate, to be able to learn online and have access after they go home from school when theyre doing their homework et cetera is of critical importance to their futures. The people of Murringo—particularly the women of Murringo—were so delighted. The other community I do want to mention is Goobarragandra. Theres a fellow there called Tony Keremelevski and Tony was very concerned about the fact that so many people used that wonderful little escape on the river near Tumut for holidays and camping, particularly during summer but during other seasons as well. The population swelled to double, if not quadruple, during the warmer months, and there were no telecommunications whatsoever. It becomes a safety issue. Not only that, but Tony had family members who werent exactly in the best of health, and he was concerned that one day there would be an incident either for the visitors or closer to home and they would not able to communicate with emergency authorities. Tumut went out of my electorate, but I maintained advocacy through the member for Parkes, who was then in a regional development role as minister. We were able to get that communications tower for that community. I well recall ringing the member for Parkes on the day just to prove that the technology worked. It was rather an amusing conversation. Im not quite sure that the member for Parkes realised that the entire audience there was listening. I think the transcript is available for those who wish to view it. It was rather an interesting conversation. I then announced to him that he was talking to the entire audience, and he changed his conversation very quickly. He was a good regional development minister who understood exactly what was required in these local communities. Murringo and Goobarragandra are vital for different reasons. As I say, this legislation is important. It is broadly supported by the coalition. The bill does look to provide a refresh to a system introduced by us when we were in government, setting out the rules for connection, supply of internet and voice services. I would impress upon the minister—the member for Greenway—that, in relation to future rounds of mobile phone towers, the people who are ticking off on those should look beyond government electorates. I do think thats important. The member for Indi has joined us. The member for Indis electorate never missed out under a coalition government, even though the seat was no longer in government when we were running the show. Sometimes I was quite jealous of the number of towers that the member for Indi got, as opposed to the member for Riverina—but thats another story! It was based on need and it was based on geography.","Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards and Other Measures) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr McCORMACK (Riverina) ","(10:43):"

No doubt they were excellent applications—not just by the Independent member for Indi, who is also a good friend of mine.  The member for Wide Bay sits behind me too. He, as much as anybody, understands the importance of good communications not just because of his advocacy for his electorate but because his electorate takes in Noosa. Thats important. The number of visitors who go there each summer is incredible. As a former police officer, he would well understand the importance of good communications and good mobile phone technology in a time of emergency and crisis. This bill is something that the Minister for Communications promised would be in the House by the end of 2022. It is now 2024. I get the fact that she is busy. I understand the fact that this is largely an uncontroversial bill. But I do impress upon the minister—and she understands this because she not only is the communications minister but also communicate with other members—the importance of continuing the investment in regional Australia. This is not just for regional Australia and rural Australia but for remote Australia. I know we went through a complete referendum process last year for a voice to parliament. Ill tell you whats more important than a voice to parliament in remote communities in, particularly, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Ill throw in South Australia, western New South Wales and even Queensland. Why stop there? Whats important is getting Aboriginal communities to be able to have a voice on the phone that can be heard because theres technology there and they can be connected to the outside world. If ever there was importance for a voice for those communities, its through mobile phone technology. The bill is important. The bill is supported. Again, Im pleased that the minister has seen fit to come in and listen to the contributions. Thats not always done by government ministers. I know this minister has knowledge across the brief, and I appreciate her for that. I appreciate the work that she is doing. Again, its so important that regional Australia is front and centre of absolutely anything to do with communications, because regional Australia is where the action in the economy is.","Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards and Other Measures) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[16]","N/A","N/A"

427,0,0,0,1,2,"Haines, Helen MP",282335,"Indi","IND","N/A",937," I acknowledge the contribution from the previous speaker, the member for Riverina. Theres a really good reason why regional MPs are speaking on this bill: it really matters to us. I, too, appreciate having the Minister for Communications and the ministers team in the room to listen to our contributions. Much of what you hear you would have heard before, but you will continue to hear it until we have solved the problem of telecommunications connectivity right across rural, regional and remote Australia.  I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards and Other Measures) Bill 2023. This bill makes important reforms to the way we regulate internet providers like the NBN so that the system better meets the needs of a modern Australia. I welcome the reforms to make the internet more available and more reliable, especially in country Australia. I want to put on the record that I thank the minister for her work on this. Its critical because, in regional, rural and remote Australia, the NBN rollout has really been disappointingly slow. If ever there was a case of overpromising and underdelivery, it is the disappointment for rural, regional and remote Australians from the time that the NBN was announced. I will continue to advocate until it is as good as it can possibly be. In Indi towns like Violet Town and across the Strathbogie shire, many residents rely on fixed wireless and satellite. Those who do have access to the NBN face congestion, slower speeds and dropouts still to this very day. This bill is a step towards strengthening consumer protections when it comes to the internet, because when you pay for a service like the NBN you expect it to work. This bill will improve consumer safeguards through a series of amendments, including: (1) requiring providers to pay compensation to customers if providers contravene a standard, including standards about connecting and supplying internet; (2) expanding the powers of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman to resolve complaints about internet connections; and (3) empowering the internet provider regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, to issue notices to developers who do not install functional, fibreready facilities in new developments, because, when you move into a new home, you expect your power and water to be connected, and the same standards should apply to the internet. Finally, the bill also empowers the ACMA to publicly identify internet carriers that arent up to scratch. This will help give consumers more information on how the NBN and other internet service providers are performing, including which are meeting standards and which are lagging behind. And I am always pro transparency. I am supporting this bill because all Australians deserve better consumer protections when it comes to the delivery and supply of reliable, adequate internet. People across my electorate of Indi work online, study online and keep in touch with family and friends online. Telehealth has made health care more accessible to those of us in the regions, and this is critical; I cant overstate it. Our agricultural communities and our farmers have come to rely on realtime weather information and other internet provided technologies—storm tracking is a case in point in the last 24 hours—to protect their livestock, their crops and their very livelihood. We rely on internet connectivity to pay at local stores, and even stalls at farmers markets may take cards more than cash now; they have their little squares. At times theyve had to stand with one leg facing towards the breeze to try and get connectivity. It needs to be reliable. They rely on payment systems operating all the time, not just some of the time. Back at home, its not just one person online, of course. Its often mum and dad in the lounge room, perhaps watching television or potentially doing office work, and their kids in the bedrooms, studying or videocalling their friends. We especially need reliable phone and internet in times of emergencies, as other speakers have pointed to—something that people in rural and regional Australia know so deeply. Only yesterday those terrible storms and bushfires sweeping across Victoria heightened the awareness of the dependency that we have on internet that works. A survey by the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network, ACCAN, a fantastic organisation, found that 88 per cent of respondents expect their phone and internet services to work during emergencies like bushfires and floods. In every Australian household, and especially in country areas, were relying on the internet more than ever. It is an essential service. But, with so many households in my electorate relying on dodgy NBN connections or snailpace ADSL lines, still, clearly regional Australia is getting left behind, and we cant allow that to be the case. I hear from constituents whose ADSL lines are flooded at the first sign of rain, meaning their home internet is offline more than its online. I hear from constituents whose only option, if they want any home internet at all, is to buy expensive aftermarket satellite hardware. Ive heard from a constituent whose job was put at risk because they simply couldnt rely on a consistent connection through the day. In Mansfield, businesses are having to adjust their schedule based on when the internet connection is fast enough to handle videoconferences with their clients. In Kinglake, in the south of my electorate, Pam Lawless lives just off the main road, but NBN Co says it has no plans to connect her to the network. Despite living less than two kilometres from the outskirts of metropolitan Melbourne—its extraordinary, really—the best that NBN Co can suggest is that she look into satellite options. She finds it frustrating that, despite living and working on the fringes of a major city, she and her neighbours feel like theyre being left behind. Thats why in 2022 I introduced my Faster Internet for Regional Australia Bill. This bill would have required the NBN and internet service providers to do better by regional Australia. My bill would have required internet providers to provide average speeds of 25 megabits per second all day, every day. It would have ensured regional customers arent waiting a month to get connected, when people in the cities get connected in a day. Even where people have an NBN connection, there is no guarantee theyll get what they pay for. Broadband providers often advertise speeds which do not match what customers actually receive. The standard of 19 days to provide a new service in regional Australia and up to three days to fix a network fault is simply too slow to attract businesses to come to regional areas with confidence. Its clear to me that the NBN rollout has not been delivering for regional Australia, and we have to keep on this; we have to make sure it does. Its very encouraging to see the government moving on this issue; it truly is. In addition to this bill, I note new industry standards on how telcos manage financial hardship. So many families are truly doing it tough now, and paying these bills is a real hardship. Ensuring those trying to balance their budgets are not disconnected from study, work or just staying in touch with family shows the government can listen and design fairer processes for people doing it tough, and I congratulate them for that. The School Student Broadband Initiative has also been so valuable in the past few years, and Im glad to see the government recommit for another two years. Its really important, and I thank them for continuing this program that was started by the coalition—so credit where credit is due across the board. The program provides free NBN access to families who are otherwise struggling to afford it on their own. With over 40 per cent of beneficiaries from this program coming from the regions, this is a commonsense policy for ensuring our kids in rural and regional Australia dont miss out on their education. Weve seen horrifying data in the last few days indicating that rural and regional kids are behind, and we cannot reinforce that disadvantage by not having access for every single child to this fundamental and essential service. Unfortunately, the very need for this program shows that rural and regional Australia is still missing out on worldclass connectivity. Another positive development is the new special access undertaking, or SAU, which was finalised only last year. The SAU expands the powers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, to oversee and regulate the service standards of NBN across Australia. This is a really important part of making sure internet users get fast, reliable and affordable internet. When this SAU expires in 2040 its expected that NBN Co will make more than $100 billion from consumers—so they need to deliver on the promise. Its only fair that customers are getting what they pay for, which is why the SAU requires NBN Co to consult with consumer advocacy groups to make sure the standards are actually working. To make consultation truly work, Id like to see the government fund a communications consumer organisation to lead engagement with NBN Co and ensure the interests of all Australians, including and especially those in the regions, are well represented. The SAU also means the ACCC can now oversee and regulate the NBNs minimum service performance benchmarks. For anyone listening at home, its acronym city here! I apologise for that; there needs to be a glossary of terms at the end of this speech! But it underscores that this is a complex but critical area of public policy. It is really important that these minimum service standards improve because, right now, theyre just not good enough for people living in regional, rural and remote Australia. Internet connectivity especially continues to be a daily challenge; it really does. I will continue to advocate—and the minister knows that—a better NBN for the regions, whether that be through mechanisms like the special access undertaking from NBN Co, the universal service obligation or the guarantee that a person will receive phone service—thats under review right now. Ill continue to work with local councils and with the Indi Telecommunications Advisory Group, or ITAG, which the member for Riverina was just referring to. The extraordinary success that Indi has had in being funded for mobile telecommunications towers isnt an accident; that is a very deliberate collaborative approach across my electorate, with nine local governments and me working together to put in topquality applications to government funds and to do everything we can as a community to identify where there are problems and work with government—whoevers in government—to try and get them fixed. Im very, very proud that through ITAG we were able to secure funding for key NBN infrastructure just a couple of months ago, such as the more than $2 million announced last year to establish fibretothepremises NBN in the tiny little alpine village of Harrietville as part of the Regional Connectivity Program. Those people are absolutely delighted. Theyve waited a long time. I urge the government to continue funding this program in the next budget—please, do that—to make sure we can continue and finish the job of connecting regional, rural and remote areas to the internet. When the NBN isnt available, I want to see better satellite and mobile broadband solutions because my constituents are tired of hearing that because they live in a regional area they must accept the NBN may not make it to them. Its not good enough. We must make sure that, if it is to be satellite, its absolutely top class. This issue is so important for the development of the regions. We cant let them fall behind the cities because they cant connect. Its absolutely critical to my electorate because its a disaster prone area. I know Im not the only one in that situation. The Black Summer bushfires, the Black Saturday bushfires 10 years before that, flooding, catastrophic storms and so on absolutely underscore the critical nature of this. This is not just for a Netflix connection, even though Im the first to want one of those too! People rely on phone and internet services to keep themselves and their families safe. They just do. I know the minister knows that. Throughout my career as a nurse, a midwife, an academic researcher and an MP, I have learnt that you dont stop until the job is done. Thats my message to the government. The reforms in this bill will benefit consumers across Australia, but there is much more to be done before we can say with confidence that all Australians have access to reliable, affordable, fast internet.","Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards and Other Measures) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr HAINES (Indi) ","(10:58):"
428,0,0,0,1,2,"Violi, Aaron MP",300147,"Casey","LP","N/A",940," I want to commend the member for Indi for her contribution. The member for Indi is correct. There is a common theme coming through from the speakers on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards and Other Measures) Bill 2023, and that is regional and rural Australia. Ill add another element to that—the periurban regions as well. The members for Riverina and Indi have both paid compliments to the Minister for Communications, and I want to do that as well. Communications is such an important issue that should be bipartisan, and its a credit to her that she is here today to listen.  Ill talk a little bit about whats happening in my community today. Ive been inundated with calls and messages. I know it will mean a lot to them that the minister is here to listen, because it is such an important issue, particularly in emergencies. I will give the minister and her team fair warning that there is some correspondence coming following up our correspondence earlier this year looking at eligibility around the Dandenong Ranges. I know and appreciate the minister acknowledged the concerns about resilience in periurban areas and having to look at the boundaries of the funding schemes and how we can resolve these. We will be looking forward to working with the ministers office on how we can find funding for periurban areas. Its a continual frustration for my community in the Dandenong Ranges, the Upper Yarra and the Yarra Valley. Its a 40 to 50minute drive with no traffic from the CBD, but anyone who visits knows its not suburban. It is beautiful nature. Its farmland, agricultural land, mountains and challenging terrain. There are a lot of beautiful trees. There are a lot of tall trees, hundreds of feet high. The problem is that, when theres a storm, lots of trees fall down and we lose power. When we lose power in our community, we lose communications. There are about 70,000 properties that are without power today across my community, including many community groups and many schools, including my own childrens school. I want to pay tribute quickly to all those teachers that I know are teaching and doing the best they can today without any power at the schools. I say thank you to them and all the community members who are rallying around to make sure we can get through. Hopefully it will be only a couple of days or the next week or so without power and communications. I also need to acknowledge that for many people today is actually going to be a tough day. Its going to bring back some trauma from the June storms of 2021. Anyone that lived in my area and community then was impacted by those storms. We were three weeks without power ourselves, but that was nothing. Many people in the Dandenong were three months without power and, 2½ years on, they havent rebuilt yet. So I want to acknowledge that for those people, who might be okay physically and whose house might be okay, there will be a lot of trauma. Its important we rally around and support each other. I want to share a couple of stories of my experience on that day but also from the CFA with the minister in the room so she can understand my passion and my communitys passion about why we need strong, resilient emergency services. On that day, my wife and I were blocked in our house for about six to eight hours. Trees had come down at the front of our road, so we couldnt leave our house. The CFA came and checked on us within a couple of hours. We were really fortunate. The scary part about that experience is that we had quite a few trees around our house. No trees fell down on the house, so we were safe, but we had that conversation because, while phones are very convenient, when theres no internet and no phone reception, theyre the most useless things in the world. Like many houses, we dont have a land line, so we had that conversation in that moment. If a tree had fallen on our house and my wife, our children or I had been hurt, wed have had literally no ability to get out or to get help. The cars couldnt leave the driveway. Its a moment where you realise how vulnerable you are. Bushfires are another significant threat in our community. I lived through Black Saturday. The 2019 bushfires live with us all. The CFA have said we were fortunate, in a way, that the storms were a static event. It was a significant event, but it wasnt a dynamic, fastmoving event. Communication was a significant issue, but it wasnt as significant as if it were a bushfire and we were trying to get updates on the spot. Thats what were talking about. To highlight the challenges from an emergency services perspective: I spoke to Sarah, whos a friend of mine I have known for many years from the SassafrasFerny Creek CFA. During the storms, the only way they could communicate was by having her mobile phone placed on one little spot in their station. She was trying to text people. If she moved it even a centimetre, she said, it felt like it would drop in and out. That was how the CFA across the Dandenong ranges were trying to communicate with each other in the middle of the night with trees continuing to fall down. The Emerald SES had one of their vehicles crushed on that night. By luck, the two SES members werent in the vehicle, but, again, if they had been and theyd been hit, theyd have had no ability to call for support or for help during that storm. So I do want to pay tribute to all our volunteers. They dont get paid for this. They are volunteers that have left their families in the middle of the night, in pitch dark, to go help other people, to put their lives on the line. What we need to do as governments—and this is not a criticism of the government; this is bipartisan, because I acknowledge it is a challenging situation with the terrain and the topography. Its not about politics; its about working in a bipartisan way to make them as safe as possible so that, when they risk their lives to protect our community, they have the communications they need to call for backup. I understand its challenging, but the frustration my community has—and its happened previously; its not about this government—is about things like the Mobile Network Hardening Program. When the community is not able to get funding and is told it is a metropolitan area, it furthers that frustration for us. I am really grateful; I didnt expect the minister to be here, but Im glad I could share those stories on behalf of my community. Im looking forward to continuing to work with you on that. Weve got people that are lucky, but its also about resilience and the reality that NBN and communications are essential services in emergencies but also day to day in our community. Belinda Young, from Mums of the Hills, has been an amazing advocate for this. You need to understand: if you live in the Dandenong Ranges or you live in the Upper Yarra or Yarra Valley, your neighbour is not 15 or 20 metres away; they are kilometres away. Even if theyre next door, youve got a couple of kays up your driveway and a couple of kays around. You cannot just walk to your neighbours. Isolation, for mums in particular and young mothers at home with their children, is a significant issue. Being able to communicate with their friends on their phones through Facebook and social media is so crucial. I want to share how Mums of the Hills started, because its an important story that highlights how important communications are. Belinda founded Mums of the Hills because shed moved to the area and her husband was at work. She was at home with their young son and she fell off a ladder and hurt herself. She was lucky that it wasnt significant. It was in that moment that she realised she didnt know anyone in the area that could support her. She literally couldnt walk, but even if she could, she wouldnt have been able to walk to the neighbours because she was living in the Dandenong. Thats how she founded Mum of the Hills, as a Facebook group to support mums as they go through challenges and to build that connection. This is the only way, as I said, that these mums can initially communicate. I didnt stay at home, but my wife reminds me often that, even if you can duck out, with a couple of young kids, its not five minutes; there is a process you need to go through. This network of friends, through Facebook, is really important. They got through COVID as a community, and they continue to support each other through financial challenges and other challenges. I know Belinda has spent a lot of time advocating for communications as an essential service. I want to thank her for her advocacy and continue to support her. We need to do more in this regard. Its not just the Dandenong but its also our farming communities in the Yarra Valley that have challenges. Last year, as an example, a satellite went down and tractors across the country stopped working. Farmers werent able to farm. Its a great example of the advantages of the digital economy and of the productivity gains and efficiencies we can get from technology and digital, but, if were so reliant on it and if weve got no redundancy in our system, that creates risk. Thats why we need to continue to make sure that, in our regional farming communities, NBN isnt a nicetohave. As the member for Indi said, we dont want a strong NBN just so we can watch Netflix. We need a strong connection to the internet so we can farm, so we can work from home if we need to and so kids can access schooling from home, as we saw through COVID. Its a way of being able to just live—and I dont want to use the term normally, but its having the basic ability to communicate. If something happens, your neighbours are not two minutes away; theyre a long way away. I spoke about this in my first speech. I think we need to look at understanding the new technologies that are available. Satellite communication is moving at a rapid pace. It provides opportunities that can alleviate some of the geographical and topographical challenges that we face. I understand were moving down an NBN path, and that is important, but I believe—whether its NBN or private partnerships—we need to look at how we can maximise satellites to solve some of these challenges in hardtoreach places, in areas like mine where there are valleys and mountains, where geography plays a huge part in the challenges we face. Satellites provide that opportunity. We talk a lot about communications. For many people it is about better internet access for Netflix and for living their lives, working from home in the suburbs in Middle Australia. Thats important. I dont denigrate that, but theres a reason that a lot of regional, rural and periurban members have spoken today. Its because this is one of the biggest challenges our communities face. Ill finish by thanking the minister for being here to listen. I look forward to continuing to work with her on some bipartisan solutions for my community and many other communities as well.","Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards and Other Measures) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VIOLI (Casey) ","(11:11):"
429,0,0,0,1,2,"Joyce, Barnaby MP","e5d","New England","NATS","N/A",942," First of all, Id like to also acknowledge the member for Greenway, the Minister for Communications, for being here. It shows a professionalism that should be respected by so many others in the job they do. Thats very encouraging. Its important because this is all part of our nation.  For me, one of the biggest fights I had was when I first arrived in parliament as a senator in 2005. It was the time of the sale of the remainder of the shares in Telstra. It was a big issue, and we had to, on behalf of those representing regional constituencies, try and bargain as best we could to get the best deal possible. Ill be frank. At the end, the whole range of the network guarantee, the customer service guarantee—all these things that we got, including $2 billion for things that we hadnt thought of at the time—was important, because we had to try and get regional people to a position. Basically, I held out my vote until we dealt with these things. At the start, we got nothing, then apparently they offered us $600 million. That came through, and then I was being pressured by my leader at the time to say yes. Then we got a billion dollars, and I still held out because I was in negotiations with other people telling me what funds we needed to actually do what we had to do. In the end, amongst all the guarantees we got, there was an extra $2 billion. I have to be frank; once we lost the election, my colleagues in the coalition voted with the Labor Party to get rid of the money. That was a huge disappointment, because it showed a lack of understanding of what exactly we were doing in regional areas. Madam Deputy Speaker, I want to take you briefly to a conversation I just had in the other chamber. The member for Hotham and I had an exchange. I was saying how important it was to look after people in regional areas, especially with things such as roads, because we dont have bus services. Because we dont bus services, I said, A mother is unable to have a job because she spends the whole time trying to manage getting kids to school and back from school. The interjection was: Its 2024. Dont you think guys should do it as well? Yes, they could. But theyve got to organise someone in the house to go out and have a job. Unfortunately, so often its the reality that it falls on the mother to pick up this responsibility. It just does. What mothers want to do in regional areas is work from home; then they can have a job. But they cant work from home if they dont have any telecommunications or if its unreliable. The employer just says: Im sorry; its unreliable. We cant do this. We cant have you as part of our office environment because we just cant rely on your internet connection. Therefore, that person is relegated to home duties. They dont want to; they want to have a professional life like everybody else. I know this, with my wife being a journalist. She absolutely tunes me up about how things are going in telecommunications. I know there are quite a number of people on the other side probably thinking thats a very good reason not to give her telecommunications! Lets go through some of the things that are important. Id like to thank Elon Musk, because, before Elon Musk turned up with Starlink, having any satellite was really dodgy. They say go satellite. Satellites just drop out. Things can happen in the house, like another kid turns on another program, and then your telecommunications drops out. This is just not viable. Youll probably note, colleagues, when I do mornings with Sunrise, that Ive got this beautiful view. They say: Isnt that lovely? Hes on the top of a hill. Theres a very good reason for that. Its the only place I get reception. Thats why we go up the hill. We go up the hill to get reception. Sometimes we can get it from halfway up; sometimes we go to the top. Weve got to have good reception for that link. Even that links at 4G, not 5G. One of our big worries about how weve gone from CDMA to 2G to 3G to 4G to 5G is that theyre going to turn off 3G. For a lot of us, thats all we get. The No. 1 issue is that, if something goes wrong, you need to be able to make a phone call. We have 14 kilometres of dirt road—these are simple things. Just the other day, the road was out. A tree fell across it. Noone turns up with a chainsaw. Imagine if someone had a heart attack. Imagine if something had gone wrong and you cant get out. Were worried when they turn off 3G, Minister, that were going to have 0G. We will have 5G come on board, but its a much better service for a much smaller range. Weve got to hold these peoples feet to the fire and say: You dont turn off 3G till you can prove to the government that youve got 5G. Were going to go to areas that have got 3G, and, if they dont get 5G, were going to say, You cant turn off 3G until theyve got a service. Theyve got to have a service. It is the No. 1 issue for our security and for anybody whos sick. If youre sick and you dont have a phone, youve got to move into town, and there are a whole range of other expenses. Youve got to rent a house. You mightnt want to go into aged care, so youve got to rent a house. These things all come off telecommunications. Were finding this out lately. Were going higher and higher up the hill. As, apparently, the broadband gets better, were going higher up the hill to try and get that connection. Its basic standardofliving things. If something goes wrong, you have to call the police. In the country, a lot of people own firearms, so, if something goes wrong, you have to call the police. If a problem arrives at the house, you cant drive out, because the problem is at your front door. You have to have that phone service to say, I have a problem here, and I need help in a big hurry. If someone is home alone and has a stroke, a heart attack, appendicitis or something else go wrong, they need a phone service, otherwise theyre in trouble. We do have instances, tragically, where people die because they cant call anybody. If you just work phone services on profitability, you will have areas that have a great standard of living and other areas that have poor people made poorer because they dont have any service at all. You need to hold their foot to the fire. I want to give another example, Minister. A lot of these mobile phone towers are connected with electricity. Youve just seen what happens when the electricity goes out. When it goes out, all your mobile phone towers go out. We had a meeting about this in a place called Nowendoc which almost filled the hall. These things are really important in local areas. They said: On our farms, if a pump goes out or if a house goes out, we have whats called a Murphy switch on a generator. The generator kicks in straightaway and the power is restored. We understand that, at times, the power goes out. We rig things up so we can deal with it. For some unknown reason, mobile phone towers dont have that. We want someone to say to them, We want you to give us assurity that, if the power goes out, the mobile phone tower keeps going. They trip and then you can have three or four go out, and then you have no mobile reception. These people say: We will help you out, if you want. We can rig up the generator and make sure its there. As soon as the power goes out, it will turn the switch and on it will go. Sometimes you almost get a sense of belligerence. It gets put in the toohard basket. They cant quite get there. Theyre not listening to these people and what they say. They need that tower going. Minister, I understand the parochialism about mobile phone coverage, but its really important that within your department you say: Get back to me. We need a basic service. I want you to tell me where on the map that basic service isnt. That basic service might also be in the periurban areas of a major capital, where they just dont have mobile phone service. Ive found that. We all know that when you drive along and go over a certain ridge there will be no phone service, and then you have it back later. Find out where those areas are and then say, Lets have a program to do this, and hold them to the fire. Say, If youre going to get cash from the government, I want something back in return: your guarantee on exactly what youre going to do for us. Another thing is that theyre very parochial—and Im sure you understand—about roaming. They dont like roaming, because they like monopolies. There has to be a discussion that, even if its not global, we need to have roaming in situ in certain areas of critical need. You can charge them a premium for using a tower, but youve got to allow them to use the tower. If someone goes from the city, theyre on Optus and they roll their car where I live, Danglemah: forget it; theres no service. But if you go to other places, roll your car and youre on Telstra: no service. We have to say that in situ in certain areas, in critical areas, part of the deal is that you have to allow roaming. Its a safety thing. A telecommunications network that only works in Sydney isnt effective; its effective when it works across the nation. Work from home is something so many women want to do. That is the reality in regional areas. Once your kid goes to school, you are working at home or youre not working. For Zoom meetings, Teams meetings and all these types of meetings, they need the bandwidth to stay on that meeting, otherwise people dont take them seriously. In our areas we have farm machinery. Farm machinery these days is completely different to the farm machinery of the past. It works with a 100 per cent connection to places like Detroit. If youre on a John Deere, your tractor is talking to Detroit. Why? If you have a bearing or heat issue or something else going wrong, you have to turn the engine off straightaway, because otherwise the problem goes from a $3,000 problem to a $50,000 problem. The message comes back to you to switch it off—obviously its not a person ringing you; you get a message to immediately turn it off. Thats how farming works now, thats the level its at. For it to be at that level, you need the telecommunications capacity for you to buy that infrastructure from Detroit—and soon it will be from India and all over the place—because thats how it works these days. Youve got to be able to do that. Also, for us—I live in the hills—theres occupational health and safety. If people go out, theyve got to be contactable if something goes wrong. If they come off a horse; if theyre working with machinery and something goes wrong; or if they roll a car, a tractor or a truck, weve got to know that something has gone wrong. If they havent got telecommunications, that is a big problem. Rather than saying, We just cant do it, weve got to think around the corners. How can we deliver this to that area? We have microcells, and thats worked with microcells. The big mobile phone towers can be hellishly expensive, but you can get microcells that at least partly deal with the issue in certain areas. Im thinking of Upper Horton. Im thinking of out the back of Scone and at Moonan Flat. Weve got microcells in these areas, so at least the people in the village, including elderly people, have got the capacity and the security. Other things are coming our way. Artificial intelligence is coming our way, and this is going to absolutely exponentially change the relevance of telecommunications. Its going to go through the roof. Therefore, its going to exponentially change the disconnection of people who cant be on board with it. If you dont have a connection with it, youre going to be light years away. Weve also got to acknowledge, with artificial intelligence coming forward, that a lot of people today have clerical jobs, and, just like factories knocked out weavers, this will knock out clerical jobs; theyll go. A computer will be able to do it better than you, and it will be vastly cheaper. So were going to need a telecommunications system to get these people who will be out of work back into work. Youre going to see some massive changes. Heres a classic one, tangential to this: why do we need office blocks if we dont have office workers in them? Im an accountant. Youre starting to get impairments on those assets right now. People are starting to ask the question, Why do we need that—because these people will have to find a different job. We can be Luddites and think, Well just smash the telecommunications system; well smash AI, but you wont. So weve got to have a telecommunications system that reaches over and says: This is coming our way; how do we make sure these people are still employed? How do they work? What are their jobs in this new era of artificial intelligence? What is artificial intelligence going to do? What are the jobs that our kids and grandkids—and you—are going to do when this event arises? And its arriving right now. So I thank you very much for that. The final thing I think we need to check in on is adversaries, especially countries. We know that people are hacking into our systems. They could create such disruption—like the communist Peoples Republic of China, the Iranians and the Russians. If they take down our system, if we dont have proper security there, they can have half the battle won before they do anything else. The first event in a conflict will not be you hearing bombs dropping out of the sky; itll be in the cyber world, all of a sudden. The only thing thats going to drop out is your telecommunications system, taking out the banking system, taking out everything with it, creating absolute chaos on the ground before you can do anything. So we have to make sure our telecommunications system is bulletproof against that. Unless youve got the investment—I know we invested $10 billion and youre investing in it. Were all doing it because, on national security, there should be very little differentiation between parties. Well all go down the same toilet if it comes unstuck. I ask you to make sure we have a strong line of sight there. Go to the National Security Committee and insist that they prove to you that theyve got it all under control.","Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards and Other Measures) Bill 2023","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JOYCE (New England) ","(11:23):"
430,0,0,0,1,2,"Rowland, Michelle MP",159771,"Greenway","ALP","N/A",944," I appreciate all the contributions that have been made today that have been very insightful and instructive, which I will continue to follow up with individual members. There are a number of initiatives on foot that a number of members did raise on specific issues. I wont go into the detail of all them, but Im grateful to the member for New England for highlighting the issue of roaming. Ill just highlight that temporary disaster roaming was recently found by the ACCC to be technically feasible, and its something that we are pursuing now within the department. I welcome the cooperation that has been shown by the mobile carriers to date. But I can assure the member that this is a very high priority within the portfolio, and I completely agree with him on the need for that to be realised.  The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Enhancing Consumer Safeguards and Other Measures) Bill 2023 will deliver improved safeguards for Australian consumers when they access broadband and voice services. It does this through a number of measures. First, the bill refines and improves the statutory infrastructure provider, or SIP, regime. Key measures that will benefit consumers include introducing the power for the minister to require SIPs to pay compensation where they do not meet a standard or rule; allowing the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman to resolve complaints about SIP connections; and providing clearer rules for SIPs when they exit areas or when premises in their areas begin to be occupied. Second, the bill provides powers for the Australian Communications and Media Authority to issue remedial notices to developers who do not install functional fibre ready facilities, such as pit and pipe, in developments. Third, the bill allows the ACMA to identify carriers and carriage service providers in public reports on their performance. This will improve transparency and accountability. Fourth, the bill allows universal service providers to be determined in relation to specific areas of Australia. This could, for example, be helpful if Norfolk Island is fully integrated into the Australian telecommunications regulatory framework. Finally, the bill makes some technical amendments to legislation, including to clarify the powers of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to issue infringement notices and to clarify the maximum penalties that should apply for breaches of carrier separation rules and the antiavoidance measures relating to the Regional Broadband Scheme. I thank all members for their participation in the debate on this legislation that will deliver better outcomes for people in Australia accessing essential telecommunications services.

431,0,0,0,1,2,"Stanley, Anne MP",265990,"Werriwa","ALP","N/A",945," I rise to make my contribution on the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Strengthening Quality and Integrity in Vocational Education and Training No. 1) Bill 2024. Now more than ever, we recognise the importance of a strong vocational education and training system. Work shortages across the country have stalled or delayed vital infrastructure and housing, seeing our hospital, agedcare and childcare systems under pressure and seeing other vital sectors struggle across the economy. These have only been exacerbated by the former governments mismanagement of or lack of direction in the VET sector. Under the previous government, apprenticeship rates declined from 220,000 in 2014 to 135,000 in 2019, only increasing after the COVID era wage subsidy support. The emergency support was not sustainable and was to be reduced back to preCOVID levels. As a result of the Albanese governments investment in apprenticeships and training, trade commencements were up almost 20 per cent in our governments first year compared to June 2019. In my community, the number of those in training increased from 1,415 people in June 2021 to 1,750 people in June 2023.  Now more than ever, the Australian government must ensure Australians and employers have access to a goodquality VET sector that they can trust. It is unfortunate, however, that we know that, whilst they are in the minority, there are registered training organisations out there that have exploited students and undermined the reputation of the sector. The Albanese government is committed to protecting students and ensuring the RTOs in our VET sector can be trusted to continue to provide training to Australians. The reports of several reviews throughout the years have highlighted concerns with the VET sector, including the recent Rapid review into the exploitation of Australias visa system, also known as the Nixon review; the 2018 All eyes on quality: Review of the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011, the Braithwaite review; as well as Quality and integrity—the quest for sustainable growth:interim report into international education by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. All of these have provided extensive insights from different perspectives into the VET system and provided recommendations as to how we can better the system. This bill is the Albanese governments first tranche of legislation to implement the integrity measures needed to elevate the status of our VET sector and target that minority of dodgy RTOs. It does this by ensuring that the national VET regulator, the Australian Skills Quality Authority, has the powers it needs to properly police the sector and enforce new penalties established in this legislation. Under the new rules set out in the legislation, RTOs who have not delivered any training and/or assessments in 12 consecutive months will be automatically deregistered, ensuring that RTOs that are legitimate and committed to delivering training remain in the sector. However, the regulator, to ensure fairness, can grant an extension of a maximum of 12 months, should an RTO demonstrate that it has legitimate reasons as to why it cannot provide training and/or assessment and that these reasons are outside of its control. Extension decisions will be subject to internal and external merit reviews, via the AAT or the proposed Administrative Review Tribunal, ensuring that there is fairness and there are avenues of review for these RTOs. The bill will strengthen the registration requirement for RTOs, to prevent them from altering the scope of their registration. RTOs will be unable to change the list of the courses they are registered to deliver for two years from registration, in line with recommendations of the Braithwaite review. RTOs will be required to demonstrate they are able to provide highquality training in the areas that they were originally approved for. If an RTO cannot adequately provide the courses it was originally approved for, how can it then be trusted to expand its offerings or deliver the quality training that students should, rightly, expect? The twoyear period allows ASQA to monitor and assess the operations of an RTO before being able to expand their course offerings. These are reasonable changes that will stop providers that are failing to deliver on proper training outcomes from expanding or shifting their business to other markets. Its simple. In order to expand, you must demonstrate that you are committed to providing quality education to the students that you already have, in the segment of the market you are operating in. Additional changes that will be made to the regulators powers relate to increased flexibility during the registration process. The regulator will be able to determine how it prioritises, considers and makes decisions, allowing for it to apply greater scrutiny to complex applications but also to make decisions more efficiently on noncomplex applications. It will also be able to take into consideration the broader labour market and those areas that are experiencing training shortages or where there is greater community need for certain skills. The minister, in consultation with the regulator, will be, with the agreement of the Skills and Workforce Ministerial Council, empowered to determine a period of time in which the regulator will not be required to, or must not, accept or process applications. This can be applied broadly or in relation to specific classes of application in instances where the regulator has identified applications that pose a risk to the integrity of the sector. This measure is to ensure that the regulator can manage the VET market and address risks as they arise. ASQA will also be given additional time in which to conduct an internal review of a decision, should a review application be made by the RTO. The period will increase from 90 to 120 days, to allow the regulator additional time to assess decisions that are complex or require further examination. While the period will be increased, most reviews are still expected to be completed well within the 90day period. Expanding the powers of the regulator is a key aspect of ensuring a more robust and quality VET sector, but its not the only measure that will be introduced with this bill. Enforcement is important, and so are the penalties for engaging in nongenuine and dodgy behaviour. The bill will apply tougher penalties and introduce new provisions to expand and clarify prohibited behaviour that is false and misleading, including false and misleading claims in advertisements, publishing false and misleading descriptions or images of RTO facilities or training locations, falsely claiming an RTO has associations with or endorsements from reputable institutions, fabricating testimonials and misleading potential students to believe that the RTO offers student services that it doesnt deliver. These are just a few examples of prohibited conduct. The bill will also increase the penalty units for certain provisions. Penalties for bad behaviour should not be seen as a cost of doing business. There should be a clear deterrent for bad behaviour, and punishment, should an RTO engage in these bad practices. Maximum penalties for a breach of such an offence or civil penalty provision will increase fivefold. Penalties will now range from $46,950 to $939,000, increasing from the current range of $9,390 to $187,800. RTOs that encourage disingenuous behaviour and fail to provide quality education to their students should be properly penalised. It has caused constituents in my community great grief and often large debt. These amendments will ensure that those RTOs are penalised. Additional measures in this bill will assist in more efficient and effective regulation of the VET sector, aligning regulation requirements with the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 and aligning internal review processes with the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act 2011. The Albanese government understands the importance of the VET sector. Thats why we signed the $30 billion National Skills Agreement, the first in a decade, and its why weve invested $414 million for a further 300,000 feefree TAFE places in vocational education courses from January this year. No matter where a student trains, they have to be assured that our government is committed to them receiving the quality education they deserve. This bill is the first step in realising that commitment. I commend the bill to the House.","National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Strengthening Quality and Integrity in Vocational Education and Training No. 1) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STANLEY (Werriwa—Government Whip) ","(11:42):"
432,0,0,0,1,2,"Birrell, Sam MP",288713,"Nicholls","NATS","N/A",946," Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Strengthening Quality and Integrity in Vocational Education and Training No. 1) Bill 2024. I am a firm believer in the positive power of education. After school, I went and worked on a farm for a while and then was able to go and complete a Bachelor of Applied Science and Agriculture degree at a university which had a regional campus very close to the place where I was living. Later on, when I wanted to do an MBA, that was available in a regional location too. So university was my pathway to education, but I have a lot of mates in my electorate who went down the apprenticeship and vocational education route, and they have done very well. Some of them went straight out of school and some of them went back to it later on. The local firms, building companies and manufacturers, such as Furphy, have a strong record of shepherding apprentices through, with the assistance of vocational education providers such as GOTAFE in my area.  This bill will amend the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act to give the National VET Regulator stronger powers. It will provide for automatic lapsing of regulated training organisations registration with the Australian Skills and Quality Agency where the provider has not delivered training or assessments for 12 consecutive months from 1 January 2023. Further, it will prevent RTOs from changing the courses they are registered to deliver to students in the first two years of registration. A new legislative instrument will allow the minister to pause the ASQA registration either for a specific class of applicants or for all applicants. Its not a power we are totally opposed to, but its a power we think needs greater transparency. The coalition will put forward several amendments to improve that and also restrict the amount of time a pause can be put in force. Any extension would then require further engagement with the ministerial council. We dont want these powers to be used to manipulate the market and drive students to preferred course providers—those provided by the government. This government has a track record of putting government run training providers first, instead of students and their outcomes. Finally, the bill increases the civil penalties for false and misleading representations by operators. We are supportive of that. We dont want junk VET courses. Weve seen junk VET courses out there before. I must say, when Labor were last in government they demonstrated a lack of skill when it came to skills training. Apprenticeship numbers plummeted. When Labor left office, the apprentice and trainee numbers had fallen by 22 per cent. Then there was the disaster of VET FEEHELP. This scheme sent the reputation of the Australian skills system to rock bottom. There are much better examples around the world that Ill talk about later. These poor Australians were loaded up with debt for doing courses that were never going to land them a job. The scheme, established by the Labor government in 2008 and expanded in 2012, suffered systemic rorting. Students who wanted nothing more than to improve their knowledge and skills were at the mercy of dodgy providers exploiting loose rules and charging students substantial fees for training they never undertook or benefited from. Ill give an anecdote. At the time, I was working in a hightech agricultural firm—I wont mention any names. This hightech agricultural firm was provided with government funded sales training. This was in the RuddGillard years. We were all sitting around there. This was very hightech stuff. The sales we had involved explaining the benefits of certain agricultural technology to customers. We had this guy from a sales company that got taxpayer funds come in and talk to us. It was basically a lesson on how to be a telemarketer: These are the soothsaying words you should use for a potential customer. Thats the easiest part of my day. Can I help you with this? Would you like fries with that? It wasnt really what we were doing. Yet there was no departmental or government oversight to say, This is an RTO that should not get government funding to do what theyre doing. The people from the company didnt benefit from that. The RTO got paid, but they werent delivering something of substantial benefit to the Australian economy. We dont want to see that happen again. I think that in the RuddGillard years things got a bit lost, taxpayers money was taken for granted and things like that were happening. We dont want to see that again. I do worry that we are going to have a few problems in the future. Trade apprentices in training hit record highs in the final months of the coalition government. As of June 2022, there were 429,000 apprentices and trainees in training, 20 per cent more than at the same time in 2021. Things had been improving. But, after just one year of the new government, the number has now fallen to 377,645. Im worried about that because we need more apprentices. In my electorate of Nicholls, the drop in apprentices and trainees under this government is 11.75 per cent. My businesses are struggling to find workers. We need to pumpprime the economy with skilled, trained workers—not with junk VET degrees, diplomas and qualifications but with real skills training. I identified this as an issue because it has been an issue for a long time. Its not just the current governments fault, although things seem to be getting worse. I identified this as an issue in my electorate a number of years ago, and, before coming to this place, I was awarded a Churchill Fellowship to study the European approach to vocational education and training and the encouragement of young people in schools to undertake vocational education and training so that they could then land a productive job in the workforce. Because of COVID, I couldnt do it straightaway, so I ended up taking some time during the midwinter break to go to the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden and Finland to look at how they do vocational education and training. One of the things that was most stark for me was, firstly, the cultural difference. Here, we have a bit of a if youre a smart kid, you go to uni, and everyone else goes and gets an apprenticeship situation. In Germany, Sweden and Finland particularly, university education and vocational education are held in the same esteem. I think thats something that we all should be working towards, because the students who graduate from the vocational education and training systems are as important, if not more important, to our economy—notwithstanding all the people, whom I much respect, whove got degrees in law or engineering. Theyre very important, but these electricians, these plumbers, these people with these trades and vocational education are so important to our economy. I think weve all got work to do to make sure that, when schools talk to young people about careers, weve got vocational education and training and university on the same level. Thats something I saw in Germany and Finland. When I was in Germany I was in Stuttgart and I went to MercedesBenz. MercedesBenz go into schools in the Stuttgart and the towns around there. They try to talk to kids in their version of our years 7 and 8, trying to find the kids whove got an aptitude for mechanics and engineering and also the ones who have a bit of a future focus. Thats IT. They try to encourage these kids to consider a career at MercedesBenz. The German system means that, if that kid says, Yes, a career at MercedesBenz sounds good to me, they go to MercedesBenz and do whats called dual vocational education and training. Theyll probably spend three days a week at Mercedes. I saw these young people working away. Theyll spend either two or three days a week at a vocational education and training school or a tech school. These tech schools in Germany look a lot different from our TAFE schools. Theyre a lot more high tech, and the companies and the tech schools are working together to make sure that what the kids are learning both practically but also in the theory around, say, mechatronics or electronic engineering is completely relevant to whats going on with MercedesBenzs strategic direction. That works really well. When I come back to Australia, I dont see it working as well. In this discussion, this debate that were having over vocational education and training, I think we all want the same outcomes. We want hightech industries with kids coming out of school and finding apprenticeships. We want those apprenticeships and training systems to be completely relevant to whats going on out there in the world of industry. We want those kids to turn into veryhighskilled technicians in industry and we want them to drive the Australian economy forward. So heres an opportunity. Well have a bit of a crack at each other over what we did and what you are doing, and I think thats healthy. Thats part of the debate. But we want the same outcome, which is a hightech workforce. I went over and had a look at it. I single out Germany and Finland because thats where I saw an approach that is different from us but I think is working better. I understand that there are cultural differences between, for example, Finland and Australia, but, to give you an example of a place that is perhaps more culturally aligned with us: the United Kingdom is moving in this direction too. Theyre realising that university is not the beall and endall. Theyre realising that they need to improve the vocational education and training systems. We talk a lot about a green energy or lowemissionsenergy future. Its interesting that, when I was in Sweden, they were talking about a future powered by renewables. Now theyre talking about a lowemissions future because theyve realised that they need to ramp up their nuclear industry to get to where they want to get with their emissions reduction, and I think thats the conversation weve got to have. The UK have decided that theyve got to ramp up nuclear as well. The skills and the technicians required to do that mean they need to lift the game from what they had in vocational education and training and perhaps look more at what Finland and Germany are doing. I pose the question: are we training the employees of the future? I think its a question weve all got to ask ourselves. When Labors in government or the coalitions in government, weve all got to strive towards making sure that our vocational education and training system is fit for purpose and that that moneys not being wasted on RTOs that are just trying to get a bit of government money to go and give some training that doesnt mean anything or on people that are trying to exploit students, who might get some qualifications that are never going to help them land a job. Instead, we need to focus in on what we really need as an economy. Sure, we need lawyers—Ive just seen another one come into the room, a great contributor as well—but vocational education and training is critical to our countrys future. I dont think were doing it as well as we need to. I think we need to be in schools, saying: Apprenticeships are just as good, and you can earn just as much if youre a good operator. Heres the pathway for you with a really good RTO thats going to work with industry to deliver relevant training and skills. That is a partnership. The partnership is between the training organisations, government and industry. Ive seen it work well overseas. In small patches, Ive seen it work well here in Australia, but I think weve got a long way to go. My commitment, while Ive got some time in this place, is to work constructively with all members to see if we can get this one right.","National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Strengthening Quality and Integrity in Vocational Education and Training No. 1) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BIRRELL (Nicholls—Deputy Nationals Whip) ","(11:52):"
433,0,0,0,1,2,"Coker, Libby MP",263547,"Corangamite","ALP","N/A",948," In my electorate of Corangamite, TAFE is more than good; its world class. Gordon TAFE serves as a cornerstone of opportunity, a catalyst for personal growth, and testament to the power of VET education to shape a brighter future for the students in my region. Our government recognises this, and we also recognise that we need to do much to help our students. Thats why I stand to support the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Strengthening Quality and Integrity in Vocational Education and Training No. 1) Bill 2024. This bill is about safeguarding the integrity of the sector. This bill is a significant step towards ensuring the integrity and excellence of our VET sector. This landmark legislation embodies our governments deep commitment to enhancing the regulatory framework governing the VET sector, ensuring that it remains a beacon of quality and opportunity. Instances of noncompliance, fraud and exploitation have cast a shadow over this sector, eroding public trust and undermining the hardearned achievements of students, educators and industry stakeholders.  It is incumbent upon us to confront these challenges head on to safeguard the integrity of this very vital sector and uphold its reputation as a bastion of quality education and training. Apprentice carpenter Trey McAuley is just one local success story that inspires apprentices and trainees to aim for the stars. Treys apprenticeship and training led to an opportunity to represent Australia in the 47th WorldSkills International Championships in Lyon, France this year. After his success at the national championships in Melbourne in August, he really is the best in his field. Trey said: Im the sole carpentry apprentice in the training squad, so Im determined to prove myself and represent Australia in my trade … I love my job, and to think it started with a regional competition at The Gordon and led me to where I am now is exciting … Im grateful for the support surrounding me. I love being a carpenter and having this extra opportunity through trade school. My employer is another reason why working in the trade industry has been a great career choice. Im committed to giving it my best. The Albanese government, like the Whitlam government before it, understands the value of education for the public good. Today, the Albanese government is materially reforming our vocation education and training, VET, sector. Were rebuilding a sector wilfully neglected by the previous government, because we understand a strong VET sector is critical. This is why were committed to building a strong, resilient and dynamic skills and training sector. The Albanese government understands that we must support quality TAFEs and boost the skilled workforce, and, through a genuine partnership with our state and territory counterparts, our feefree TAFE program is doing just that. It will be the flagship initiative to help support key industries experiencing skill shortages. Its focused on areas of emerging growth while providing access to priority cohorts, including the most vulnerable in our communities. The numbers speak for themselves. In the first six months we exceeded our target of 180,000 enrolments, with almost 215,000 Australians enrolling in a feefree TAFE course. Thats 215,000 people accessing highquality training in areas where we need skilled workers. Demographic data also shows that feefree TAFE is making inroads in supporting disadvantaged and inneed Australians, with enrolments including 50,849 jobseekers, 15,269 people with disability and 6,845 First Nations Australians. And were not stopping there; were providing funding for a further 300,000 feefree TAFE places, starting now. Put simply, the opportunities of feefree study can change lives and improve our economy. The Albanese government recognises this. However, among the countless success stories, we cant ignore the scams that threaten the integrity and value of the sector. After many years of inaction, our government is responding to the communitys call for change. This bill will empower the Australian Skills Quality Authority, who are tasked with overseeing the registration and quality assurance of VET providers. By providing the skills authority with enhanced powers and resources, we seek to strengthen its capacity to identify and address instances of noncompliant, fraudulent behaviour and substandard practices within the sector. A cornerstone of this bill is the introduction of robust measures aimed at combating the proliferation of nongenuine or unscrupulous registered training organisations—RTOs—that exploit regulatory loopholes for personal gain. Through targeted amendments to the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011, we aim to bolster ASQAs authority to take swift and decisive action against RTOs engaging in fraudulent activity, ensuring those who seek to undermine the integrity of this sector are held accountable for their actions. Furthermore, the bill seeks to enhance the transparency and accountability of RTOs by introducing measures to prevent the abuse of regulation status and the misrepresentation of educational offerings. By imposing stricter penalties for breaches of regulatory requirements and expanding ASQAs powers to conduct internal reviews of decisions, we aim to create a regulatory environment where compliance is not just an option but a fundamental requirement for participation in the VET sector. In addition to these enforcement measures, the bill includes provisions aimed at strengthening the integrity of the VET sectors registration process. By introducing safeguards to prevent the rapid expansion of newly registered RTOs and imposing restrictions on the addition of new courses to their scope of VET registration, we seek to ensure that providers demonstrate a genuine commitment to quality education and training before being granted broader accreditation. Moreover, the bill incorporates recommendations from various reviews, including the Nixon review and the Braithwaite review, which highlighted the need for targeted reforms to address integrity and equality issues within the VET sector. By drawing upon the insights and recommendations of these reviews, we will develop a comprehensive legislative framework that reflects the evolving needs and challenges facing the sector. The National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Strengthening Quality and Integrity in Vocational Education and Training No. 1) Bill 2024 represents a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to strengthen the integrity and quality of Australias VET sector. By empowering ASQA, imposing tougher penalties and enhancing regulatory efficiency, we lay the groundwork for a future where every individual has access to highquality vocational education and training opportunities, equipping them with the skills we need to succeed in an increasingly competitive global landscape. As we delve deeper into the provisions of the bill, it becomes evident that our focus is on equipping ASQA with the necessary tools to address integrity issues within the VET sector effectively. One of the fundamental aspects of this bill is the reinforcement of ASQAs enforcement powers. The proposed amendments enable ASQA to take swift and decisive action against nongenuine or unscrupulous RTOs that undermine the integrity of the sector. The bill introduces measures to prevent the abuse of registration status by dormant RTOs that fail to deliver training and/or assessment for an extended period. This provision addresses the inherent risk associated with RTOs that maintain their registration purely for onselling qualifications without fulfilling their educational obligations. Automatic lapsing of registration after 12 months of inactivity serves as a strong deterrent against such practices while ensuring procedural fairness through provisions for legitimate extensions under exceptional circumstances. Additionally, the bill imposes restrictions on newly registered RTOs, prohibiting them from expanding their course offerings within the first two years of registration. This measure aims to mitigate quality risk associated with rapid expansion and provides ASQA with an opportunity to assess the operational integrity of new entrants before granting them broader accreditation. By focusing on the quality of education and training delivery from the outset, we are laying the foundation for a stronger and better VET sector. Furthermore, the bill incorporates recommendations from various reviews that Ive spoken about: the Nixon and Braithwaite reviews. Weve highlighted the need for targeted reforms to enhance the integrity and quality of the VET sector. Drawing upon these insights and recommendations, we will develop a fantastic framework. Id like to give a shoutout to Gordon TAFE. It is such an amazing organisation. It started in the 19th century, and it began because there was such a need for skills growth in our growing economy. Now we are facing the same need for skills development so we have a skilled workforce that can meet the needs of Australia and take us into the future as a really strong economy. To do that, we need to empower TAFE to do this job well. That means having the right set of regulations to make sure that reputable TAFES are highly regarded and equip young people to do well. Id like to give a shoutout to the TAFE because they have about 13,000 students currently, and when they started in the 19th century, I think they first started with 10 students. Theyve come a long way, and they do an amazing job. In closing, the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Strengthening Quality and Integrity in Vocational Education and Training No. 1) Bill 2024 represents a significant step forward in our collective effort to strengthen the integrity and quality of Australias VET sector. By empowering ASQA, imposing tougher penalties and enhancing regulatory efficiency, we do lay the groundwork for a future where every individual has access to highquality vocational education. We must ensure that this continues. We think about Whitlam and the fact that he sought to significantly widen educational opportunities for all Australians and reform postschool training. The Albanese government is continuing this legacy and ensuring that in the future our young people will be able to choose to go to university or to go to TAFE. They will be able to find the skills that will provide them with rewarding work, and, very importantly, will equip Australia with the skilled workforce we need for the future. I commend the bill.","National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Strengthening Quality and Integrity in Vocational Education and Training No. 1) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms COKER (Corangamite) ","(12:06):"
434,0,0,0,1,2,"Le, Dai MP",295676,"Fowler","IND","N/A",950," I rise to speak on the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Strengthening Quality and Integrity in Vocational Education and Training No. 1) Bill 2024. Vocational education and training is an integral part of the Australian workforce. Apprenticeships and traineeships are fuelling our economy to meet changing demands.  Im pleased to see that the government is taking action to reform and strengthen the quality and integrity of the VET sector. I understand that a review was conducted in January 2018, known as the Braithwaite review of the NVETR Act, with recommendations for change. The review also revealed that students have shared their VET experience as being disappointing and demoralising, with students accumulating significant debt for courses that, ultimately, they did not complete. More concerningly, the report also revealed experiences of abuse and exploitation. This should have set off alarm bells for the government to consider taking immediate action to address the systemic issues. It has been six years since the review, and we now have a bill to adopt some of the recommended changes. I have to ask the government why it took so long. Fowler has a significant number of students engaging in the VET sector, ranging from hospitality and early childhood to aged care. Approximately 12 per cent of employed people aged 15 and over are currently working in the trade or technician sector. With manufacturing and construction being the largest employers in Fowler, offering our people opportunities to develop skills in these industries is critical. I am committed to ensuring that the government continue to propose measures that not only support the VET sector but also uplift and create better access and opportunity for those engaging in the sector. I have been vocal about supporting the VET sector in the past year, such as by proposing the reversal of indexation on the trade support loans, which were later rebranded as Australian apprenticeship support loans, back to the 2022 rate of 3.9 per cent. Although it was known as an interestfree loan, it was hard to reconcile this belief when loans were still indexed according to CPI. My plea to the government for this relief was to give more students hope to enter the trades industry without the fear of crippling debt. I am still of the view that the government must address this issue of indexation at a time of costofliving crisis for my constituents in Fowler and across Western Sydney. Ive spoken often in this House of the struggles and pains of my constituents in Fowler. Due to the lowincome status of many families, they are struggling to put food on the table while coming to terms with the soaring costs of electricity, fuel, rent, food and insurance, as well as the general cost of living. For a sector that is the backbone of the Australian workforce and the future of many young hopefuls, I am disappointed it has taken us this long to holistically review the flaws of the VET sector. The proposed bill is a move by the government to crack down on dodgy registered training organisations, who are engaging in borderline criminal behaviour within the VET sector. I note that the bill makes several amendments to improve the integrity of the vocational education sector and to ensure that only those registered training organisations that demonstrate a genuine commitment to training and education are able to operate. ASQA is to be provided with more discretion in managing and deciding on RTO applications. I welcome these efforts to clean up the VET sector. However, it is important that the government also has mechanisms in place to prevent the misuse of power. Will there be internal guidelines for ASQA to ensure that regulatory duties are in line? While we focus on the unscrupulous registered training organisations, we also need to ensure that we are relieving the burden on those RTOs that are doing the right thing—that they are not overburdened in dealing with regulations that are constantly changing. Many RTOs that I have spoken to find it difficult to continuously keep up to date with the course and skill set requirements, and there is immense pressure on trainers, assessors and people working in the sector to constantly retrain, which adds burden, cost and time to the sector. I know that the government invested $37.8 million to support the establishment of the integrity unit within ASQA to upgrade systems and create a tipoff line for the misconduct of RTOs. This is not an insignificant sum. While it is important that systems are constantly up to date, I would like to know whether the funding was also utilised to improve the delivery of VET courses and to support students. VET is an essential pathway to upskill and reskill Australias workforce. As the agedcare and disabilitycare sector continues to grow, and as we address the shortages in the education sector and in others, we know that VET will play an important role in preparing our workforce to meet these challenges. I agree that we need regulators in the field of VET that demonstrate a genuine commitment to providing quality education and training. I would like to highlight that as legislators we need to ensure we get the balance right. What are the key benchmarks we are categorising for quality and are we providing too many hurdles to the VET providers that are doing the right thing? I support the amendment to the bill that expands and strengthens the offence and civil penalty provisions regarding false and misleading representations made by an RTO, offering greater protection for students. This is even more important when the students, like many of those in my community of Fowler, are from a migrant or refugee background and are more vulnerable to being exploited by false and misleading claims made by RTOs. I think we can all agree this is an important provision to include in the legislation. I also agree with the amendment that automatically lapses an RTOs registration when it does not deliver training for a period of 12 consecutive months, as there is also the ability for the RTO to request an extension and provide an explanation as to the reason. I note that this amendment will be the first piece of legislation among others which are set to reform and elevate the status of VET and TAFE in Australia. I ask the government to ensure that there is constructive consultation with the sector to ensure the experiences of those at the coalface are considered in providing legislation to best meet the needs of both RTOs and students. I acknowledge that this is a step forward. However, there are many things amiss with the VET sector beyond regulatory issues. Vocational education and training is an essential element we must get right to prepare Australias workforce to drive our economy forward. In 2023, I conducted a consultation with community stakeholders about the VET sector to understand the key issues that affect students and providers. The emerging theme from the consultation was that there is a lack of support for students and VET teachers due to the constant changes to VET courses as well as workforce shortages. Following my community consultation, I now call on the government to take the following action as the next tranche of reform. Firstly, implement measures to maintain the course and skillset requirements for at least three years. A stakeholder has shared that they are dissatisfied that government bodies are constantly changing the course and skillset requirements. This adds immense pressure to keep up and streamline compliance. In particular, a stakeholder has said the following: What has changed in hospitality so much that there is a constant need to send VET teachers to training annually? It was also shared that VET teachers are often sent to training for at least five to 15 days, which takes them away from school and their ability to connect with their students. Accordingly, students feel like they are not adequately supported whilst undertaking their VET courses. Secondly, provide VET teachers with wider support within schools. VET teachers have shared with me the struggles of having to constantly upskill and attend training, as I have mentioned above. They are also met with administrative burdens to upload evidence for each student to be assessed. This may also produce burnout and potentially affect how they deliver the courses to students. VET teachers feel like they are being pulled in multiple directions and cannot keep up. While I can appreciate that this may be a matter for state governments to consider, it would be worthwhile to explore conversations about allocating funding to give VET teachers support with student engagement. Thirdly, implement measures to support students engaging in the VET sector. The Braithwaite review has described some students VET journeys as being demoralising. I ask the government to consult and engage with providers so that the delivery of VET courses can be enhanced and made meaningful to reduce the number of students discontinuing their courses. Students need more confidence from the government that they can pursue VET courses. In conclusion, I commend the bill to the House.","National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Strengthening Quality and Integrity in Vocational Education and Training No. 1) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms LE (Fowler) ","(12:19):"
435,0,0,0,1,2,"Mascarenhas, Zaneta MP",298800,"Swan","ALP","N/A",952," It is an amazing pleasure to speak on the importance of this bill before the House, the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Strengthening Quality and Integrity in Vocational Education and Training No. 1) Bill 2024. A good education is a ticket to a good life and a good wage. My electorate knows how passionate I am about education. One of the things Id also highlight is that I agree with some but not all of the comments of the member for Nicholls. Having a look at our society and seeing the importance of university education and vocational education, I think its important that we place an emphasis on both of these types of education. Particularly in WA there can be comparable wages and comparable job security, and I think that something we need to highlight is the importance of apprenticeships and traineeships in our broader economy.  In the electorate of Swan Im very lucky because there are a range of registered training providers that provide excellent services. I have two thriving TAFEs. South Metropolitan TAFE has two campuses, Bentley and Carlisle, and they provide amazing opportunities for our community, for young people and adults looking to start or change their careers. Bentley campus, on Hayman Road, is one of the largest TAFE campuses. Its conveniently located across the road from Curtin University and colocated with the Bentley business precinct, known as Tech Park. It has brilliant facilities that are open to the public, such as the awardwinning Bentley Pines Training Restaurant—Im very lucky my niece has trained to become a pastry chef there! Its a live and interactive training environment for our students preparing for work in the hospitality industry. Hospitality and cookery students serve and prepare food in the restaurant and showcase their skills in planning a menu; budgeting and making purchases; and preparing and serving food and drinks to members of the public. Events students provide menu presentations and advertise when special events or exhibitions are staged in the venue. There are a wide variety of specialist facilities and courses on offer at Bentley TAFE. Its such an awesome facility that on more than one occasion Ive had the opportunity to share it firsthand with the Prime Minister and the Minister for Skills and Training. On the most recent occasion, we announced the milestone in feefree TAFE places that this government has achieved. Its a centrepiece of the Albanese costofliving package, helping the community address the skills shortage. Also in my electorate is the Carlisle campus of South Metropolitan TAFE. It features a range of trades, paraprofessionals and course facilities. Its a purposebuilt facility for refrigeration training and automotive refinishing, and its the only one in Western Australia. Carlisle is also the location for the Adult Migrant English Program—as you can tell, Im super proud of my electorate and the amazing facilities it has. Before I get into the important changes this bill makes, I want to take this opportunity to address some of the incorrect assertions made by the member for Farrer in relation to this bill. There was an assertion about the number of apprentices rising under the Liberal government. Its simply not true. The member might like to know that, under the coalition government, the apprentice commencement rates declined. The facts are that there were 220,000 apprenticeships in 2014. By 2019, that number declined by 95,000 places, to 135,000. Thats almost a 40 per cent decrease in apprenticeship opportunities under the coalitions watch. Thats 95,000 fewer trained workers than we would have had if it werent for coalition policy. It was only a COVID funding boost that arrested this slide. The member for Farrer once again started throwing accusations before checking the facts, because it was Labor that, after the election, made it a priority to invest in apprenticeships and traineeships, to invest in the areas where the economy needs skills the most. It also means that more money is going into apprenticeships. Another fact the member for Farrer might like to know is that trade commencements went up by almost 20 per cent in Labors first year of government—thats very impressive—and the almost 70,000 apprenticeships rose to 84,000 in 2023. Thats 14,000 newly trained workers playing valuable roles in our jobs market thanks to Labor. With a blossoming VET sector thanks to the Albanese government, its important that were ensuring integrity of the system. Integrity is vital to our training and education system. Thats why this legislation is before us, because when our education sector is strong our economy can be strong. Our government is responsive to the needs of the sector that is serving us so well. Its also responding to the quality issues that have come to our attention via important reports and reviews that were acted upon by Labor. It was the work of the 2023 Nixon review into the exploitation of the visa system and of the Braithwaite review which highlighted these issues. The joint standing committee report into international education shone a light on these matters that simply need to be addressed when it comes to maintaining quality and integrity while ensuring growth in the sector. The changes put forward by this bill will mean action can be taken against registered training organisations, RTOs, who are not genuine in their purpose. Fraudulent activity will be stamped out. As the Minister for Skills and Training put it: What we are simply doing is were making it tougher for the bottomfeeders, the fraudsters and the cheats who take advantage of students for a quick buck. Were restoring integrity to the sector. Most importantly, students will benefit. Exploiting students is a low act. Students are simply aspiring to a better future, with hope and dreams. It is sad that this was fostered under the coalition government. Im delighted about these key amendments in this bill which will help stamp out behaviour such as exploiting and luring students with false descriptions of training facilities and false testimonials. Tougher penalties will deter those operators who currently see penalties as a risk worth taking or a cost of doing business. Penalties will need to be tougher, and under this bill they will be. Fraud will be stopped, and the whole community will benefit. The message is clear: step up or step out. The bill will stamp out fraud by empowering the Australian Skills Quality Authority, known as ASQA, to act when it identifies organisations that are not adhering to the requirements set by legislation. Last year the government invested $37.8 million to support the establishment of an integrity unit within ASQA. The funding was also used to upgrade ASQAs digital and data systems. A tipoff line has been established to detect and address unacceptable and dodgy RTO conduct. The bill will strengthen ASQA further. It will empower ASQA to take swift action to deter, and remove, these RTOs and apply greater scrutiny to the RTOs seeking to enter the VET sector. The bill also expands the kinds of false and misleading conduct that ASQA can target. It does this by providing for longoverdue increases to the penalties applicable to dodgy conduct and statutory breaches. We must remember that this bill supports the majority of providers who are doing the right thing and providing quality education and training. There are genuine providers who are in the sector for genuine reasons and are providing outstanding, quality training for our future workforce. This bill will only benefit them. We are enhancing the quality of the service that they provide by stamping out rogue operators who risk bringing parts of the sector into disrepute. The removal of dodgy providers will make a big difference in securing the future of VET. The bill will also force an RTOs registration to automatically lapse where an RTO has not delivered training and/or assessment for 12 months and prevent RTOs from expanding their course offering if theyve been operating for less than two years. The bill will provide ASQA with greater discretion in prioritising, considering and deciding on RTO applications and empower the minister, with the agreement of state and territory ministers, to determine that ASQA need not, and must not, accept or process new RTO applications. It will expand offence and civil penalty provisions to cover a broader range of false and misleading representations by RTOs about their operations and increase fivefold the maximum penalties for breaches of relevant offences or civil penalties under the act. These changes build on the Albanese governments investment in integrity and quality in the VET sector. We must respond and act. I know that the genuine RTOs in my community will applaud these changes. Theyre doing an outstanding job, and Im excited about the new and flourishing service providers that were working with in different communities to tailor training to specific needs. They need our support to ensure that were equipped with the correct regulatory framework to protect their integrity and to make sure that we get great outcomes not just for students but also for our economy. I commend the bill to the House.","National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Strengthening Quality and Integrity in Vocational Education and Training No. 1) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MASCARENHAS (Swan) ","(12:29):"
436,0,0,0,1,2,"Templeman, Susan MP",181810,"Macquarie","ALP","N/A",953," I have always seen vocational training as something that can have a real transformative effect on peoples lives. It can help kids who might not necessarily be terrific at school find a pathway where the skills they have can really be used. That obviously goes for TAFE, but it also applies to the goodquality private training providers. My experience of goodquality private training providers is that they can help businesses really target the skills they need for their staff. But what brings this sector unstuck and what Ive seen for nearly the last decade has been a sense that there are always going to be dodgy providers and theres not much you can do about it. The consequence of that has been terrible outcomes for many students. And these are not just young students; sometimes these are older, mature workers who want to reskill or people who come in from overseas in good faith to do courses and find out that theyve been sold a dud.  Its really important that we dont accept that theres nothing that can be done about dodgy providers, and thats what the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Strengthening Quality and Integrity in Vocational Education and Training No. 1) Bill 2024 is about. Its saying that there should be standards and, whats more, those standards should be enforced. We are absolutely committed to protecting students and to ensuring the integrity of our vocational education and training schemes in the whole sector as well as the registered training organisations. This legislation, which I am very pleased to support, is the first tranche to implement our quality and integrity reforms, including by elevating the status of TAFE and vocational education and training and targeting the minority of unscrupulous and nongenuine providers, who tarnish the reputation of the whole sector. For someone whos been in business, as I have—I was in business for nearly 25 years before I came to this place—your sector gets a bad name not because of the good operators but because a small number of people do the wrong thing. We can fix that. That is in the best interests of all the honest operators who have integrity and who are genuinely running businesses where they do want to help people change their lives. I really welcome the measures in this bill, which include things that are probably not that exciting as I run through them but are actually the practical things that will make a difference, For instance, there are things to ensure that ASQA, which is the qualitycontrol body—I know I have certainly referred constituents to ASQA and I have certainly raised issues that have been brought to my attention with ASQA in the past—is now going to have the appropriate powers to take swift action to address integrity risks posed by these nongenuine, completely unscrupulous registered training organisations. Itll be able to apply greater scrutiny to new RTOs and promote a quality vocational education and training sector so that students benefit, the industry itself benefits and businesses who rely on skilled workers benefit. That means the whole community benefits. Other changes include the ability to do a rapid review of whether something is going wrong but also to stop a new provider from being able to keep adding courses in its first two years of operation so it can be established and there can be a demonstrable basis on which to determine that it is meeting the standards that are required. The flexibility that ASQA is going to have will also make a difference. This ensures that ASQAs rules allow it to determine its priorities and to consider and make decisions in relation to applications. This matters because it further enables ASQA to apply the appropriate scrutiny to complex applications or to applications from providers that raise potential integrity issues. So this is about empowering the very body that monitors and enforces the standards, to ensure it can actually do the job that were asking it to do. Its worth pointing out that this bill brings together recommendations from various different reviews, including one that happened in 2018. So this isnt new. Weve known that this needed to be done, but the previous government just let it drift. It failed miserably to enforce standards and to provide a better framework for the standards. That 2018 review, called the Braithwaite review, was a review of the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011. Its recommendations sat, unimplemented by the previous coalition government. We are a government that identifies a problem and then acts on it, and strengthening the provisions in this bill will enable ASQA to take decisive action, to be able to do what were asking them to do. As a government, we are encouraging young people and more mature workers to look at vocational education, to see where the skills shortages are and where opportunities for themselves might lie. This is a really key part of it. Of course, TAFE remains an absolutely central part of what we do. Tens of thousands of students in New South Wales have taken advantage of feefree TAFE. We have had our first full year of it. There have been tens of thousands in the care sector. The last figures that I pulled out went up to the last financial year, and there were 20,700 care sector workers, 6,400 technical and digital students, 5,800 construction students and 5,200 agriculture students going through feefree TAFE—and they are figures that go to the last financial year. There have been a lot more in the second half of last year and, obviously, in this new TAFE year. I would really encourage people: if you want to skill up, check out feefree TAFE. That is going to provide a pathway to address the skills issues that we have in this nation.","National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Strengthening Quality and Integrity in Vocational Education and Training No. 1) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) ","(12:39):"
437,0,0,0,1,2,"Fernando, Cassandra MP",299964,"Holt","ALP","N/A",954," I rise today to speak on the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Strengthening Quality and Integrity in Vocational Education and Training No. 1) Bill 2024. This comprehensive bill aims to fortify the integrity and enhance the quality of Australias vocational education and training sector. It addresses integrity risk prevalent in the VET sector, mitigates the exploitation of vulnerable students by unscrupulous registered training organisations, and promotes a culture of excellence and accountability across the vocational education and training landscape. It also cracks down on the loopholes in our migration system that shameless organisations use to exploit and profit from vulnerable students.  VET serves as a cornerstone of Australias education system. It offers a pathway for millions of Australians to acquire the skills and qualifications necessary to thrive in the workforce. Like 5,551 others in Holt, I have had the privilege of upskilling and learning a new qualification thanks to our VET sector. I earned a Certificate IV in Patisserie at William Angliss Institute, and I also did a Certificate III in Commercial Cookery at Box Hill TAFE. Those who finish a diploma earn, on average, $1,300 a week—$312 more than those who only finished high school. This is equal to $16,000 a year more for workingclass individuals—a huge boost in income and possible opportunities. For a family, this can represent the difference between living pay cheque to pay cheque and having a sense of financial security. However, the proliferation of fraudulent RTOs engaging in deceptive practices poses a significant threat to the integrity and reputation of the sector. This jeopardises the aspirations and futures of countless students. At the heart of this bill lies a commitment to safeguard the interests of students and to uphold the quality standards of vocational education. The spread of socalled ghost colleges in Australia, as highlighted in the recent investigative article by Clay Lucas for the Age, underscores the pressing issue of dodgy education providers exploiting the visa system. These institutions, often hidden within office buildings in Melbournes CBD, claim to offer education to thousands of international students. There are nearly 300 private vocational institutions operating in Melbourne. At 190 Queen Street, there are 20 different colleges, where students can choose from 200 different courses. Sounds great, right? However, investigations by the Age reveal that many of these classrooms remain empty, with students nowhere to be found. Despite regulatory efforts and changes in visa laws, these ghost colleges persist, exploiting loopholes to profit from students who are primarily seeking work opportunities rather than genuine education. In light of the spread of fraudulent practices within the vocational education system, it is imperative to uphold the integrity of both our visa system and our education system. The exploitation of loopholes and deceptive practices not only undermine the credibility of our education system but also jeopardise the integrity of our immigration processes by allowing a minority of operators to manipulate the system for personal gain. We risk tarnishing the reputation of Australia as a destination for quality education and skilled migration. Upholding the integrity of our visa system is essential to ensuring that genuine students and skilled workers have access to opportunities that contribute positively to our society and economy. By enhancing robust measures to address integrity risk and by strengthening funding regulatory oversight, we seek to protect the rights and welfare of students while fostering a VET sector characterised by transparency, accountability and excellence. This bill introduces a range of measures designed to enhance the efficacy and integrity of the Australian Skills Quality Authority, our national VET regulator. Among its key provisions, the bill empowers ASQA with greater authority to swiftly address integrity risk posed by a minority of nongenuine RTOs. Firstly, it mandates the automatic lapsing of an RTOs registration if it fails to provide training or assessment for 12 consecutive months, addressing concerns raised by the Braithwaite review. To ensure fairness, RTOs can seek extensions for legitimate reasons, such as natural disasters. Secondly, the bill restricts newly registered RTOs from adding new courses for the first two years, allowing ASQA to assess their operations thoroughly. Thirdly, it extends the period of internal review by the regulator, ensuring thorough consideration of complex decisions. Fourthly, ASQA gains greater discretion in prioritising registration applications, enhancing efficiency while maintaining scrutiny. In addition to these, the bill empowers the minister to halt processing of registration applications in consultation with ASQA, targeting nongenuine providers without disrupting the system. This safeguards the reputation of the VET sector and ensures the delivery of highquality training outcomes for all students. One of the central objectives of this bill is to prevent fraudulent RTOs taking advantage of vulnerable students through deceptive practices. This bill strengthens student protection by expanding penalties for false representations by RTOs. Tougher penalties are crucial to deter unscrupulous behaviour and safeguard the integrity of the VET sector. Currently, the maximum penalties for affected offences under the act have not changed since 2011. They range from $9,390 to $187,800. These amendments mean that those penalties will now range from $46,950 to $939,000 under the current penalty unit values. Furthermore, this bill seeks to empower students with a robust system to raise complaints and seek redress against dodgy RTOs. This measure ensures that their voices are heard and their rights are protected. By establishing avenues for students to report instances of misconduct, ASQA can effectively investigate allegations of noncompliance and take firm action to hold offending RTOs accountable for their actions. Through implementing strict registration requirements and imposing harsh penalties for misconduct, the government aims to create a regulatory framework that deters bad actors while promoting the interest of students and the broader community. Drawing from the recommendations dating back to 2018, including through the Nixon and Braithwaite reviews, the bill addresses longstanding concerns to ensure that students have confidence in the standard of education provided. Incorporating insights from the 2023 interim report by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, along with the elements from the lapsed Regulator Performance Omnibus Bill 2022, the bill emphasises its dedication to enhancing regulator efficiency. Incorporating local training providers, such as public TAFEs, into the discourse surrounding this bill underscores the vital role that genuine RTOs play in delivering quality vocational education and training to students across the country. Through this comprehensive approach, this bill seeks to uphold the reputation and effectiveness of the VET sector, reflecting a concerted effort to address longstanding issues and adapt to the evolving challenges. This bill builds upon the foundation laid by the National Skills Agreement, a landmark initiative led by the Albanese Labor government to revolutionise access to TAFE, enhance training quality and address crucial skills needs across the nation. The National Skills Agreement, backed by a groundbreaking $30 billion investment, reflects our governments steadfast commitment to working collaboratively with states and territories to achieve meaningful reform in the VET sector. This agreement reflects an acknowledgement that partnership cooperation and a longterm agreement are essential to implementing muchneeded quality and capacity reforms in the VET sector. In addition, under the leadership of the Albanese Labor government, the introduction of 300,000 feefree TAFE places stands as a testament to our commitment to accessible and equitable vocational education. This transformative program represents a significant investment in the future of Australias workforce, providing opportunities for individuals from all walks of life to pursue quality education without the burden of financial constraints. By removing the barriers to entry and expanding access to TAFE, we are empowering Australians to acquire the skills and qualifications needed to thrive in todays competitive job market, thereby laying the foundation for a more inclusive and prosperous society. The National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment Bill represents a comprehensive and forwardlooking approach to strengthen and transform Australias vocational education and training sector. To safeguard the credibility of our education system and maintain Australias status as a global leader in education and skilled migration, it is imperative to fortify the integrity of our systems. This bill supports those genuine providers doing vital work and takes decisive action against the minority of providers who rort the system. The strength of the vocational education sector is not just about providing individuals with skills and opportunities; its also about strengthening the foundation of our nations prosperity and resilience. These initiatives embody our dedication to unlocking the full potential of our skilled workforce, driving economic prosperity and building a brighter future for all Australians. A robust VET sector ensures that our workforce is equipped with the necessary expertise to drive innovation, productivity and economic growth. Moreover, it fosters social mobility by offering pathways to success for individuals from diverse backgrounds. By safeguarding the integrity and quality of vocational education, we uphold the promise of a brighter future for both our people and our country as a whole. As we strive to overcome challenges and seize opportunities in an everevolving global landscape, investing in the strength and integrity of our VET sector remains paramount.

438,0,0,0,1,2,"OConnor, Brendan Patrick John MP","00AN3","Gorton","ALP","N/A",956," I want to thank all members who have contributed to the debate on this important bill, the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Strengthening Quality and Integrity in Vocational Education and Training No. 1) Bill 2024, particularly the members for Farrer, Werriwa, Nicholls, Corangamite, Fowler, Holt, Macquarie and Swan. Id also like to thank stakeholders and states and territories for their invaluable feedback and insights into how this bill can best protect the reputation and integrity of our vocational education and training sector.  The Albanese government understands that a trustworthy and highperforming VET sector is essential not only to create meaningful and secure career opportunities but to deliver the skills our economy needs. The amendments in the bill will provide the regulator, the Australian Skills Quality Authority, better tools to protect students and tackle the minority of providers that engage in unscrupulous conduct and fail to demonstrate a genuine commitment to education and training delivery. These providers tarnish the reputation of the sector, and the bill reinforces that there is no place for them in the VET sector. The bill builds on the governments track record in strengthening the integrity and the quality in VET. This includes negotiating a landmark $30 billion fiveyear national skills agreement, the first of its kind in a decade, investing $37.8 million to increase ASQAs capacity to detect and address unacceptable behaviour by registered training organisations and strengthening the fit and proper persons requirements to apply increased scrutiny on those in management positions within RTOs. The governments track record includes turning around apprenticeships, and the member for Farrer particularly referred to apprentice commencements in her remarks. I remind her that the commencements steadily declined under the coalition, from 220,000 in 2014 to fewer than 135,000 in 2019, a drop of nearly 40 per cent. Were obviously at odds when it comes to the history of this area. It took a global pandemic and the emergency injection of wage subsidies, costing $7.7 billion, to arrest this decline. Perhaps apprentices expected some sort of direct support from this huge spend, but they should have known better. Those opposite saw fit to funnel every cent of the $7.7 billion directly into employers pockets. Not one cent went directly to an apprentice or trainee. The coalition knew that the spending was unsustainable, and their last budget, handed down by Josh Frydenberg, the then Treasurer, shows they planned to drop apprenticeship support to below preCOVID levels. To paraphrase the member for Farrer in her second reading speech on the bill: you can defend this wage subsidy or defund it; you cannot do both. The biggest users of the coalition wage subsidy were businesses like fastfood giants, retail stores and call centres. The design of the scheme allowed businesses to funnel employees into traineeships in name only to access wage subsidies and pay workers below the standard award wage. I can exemplify that by referring to the Fair Work Ombudsman investigation into the conduct of a fastfood employer, Grilld, that employed 2,800 employees and placed them on socalled traineeships under this agreement. I have to say, there were was, in many instances, very little training indeed, but it did allow the company to pay these workers below the minimum standards that would be provided to an employee. In some cases, some of these socalled trainees were providing evidence to the Fair Work Ombudsman that they received no more than eight hours of training in 18 months of employment. We dont really believe that the Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements program was really an apprenticeship scheme. Thats not to say we didnt support wage subsidies; obviously, we supported JobKeeper. We proposed it. It was originally rejected by the member for Cook, the then Prime Minister, but the previous government did finally accept it as a good approach, of course, and Labor supported that. And we do support wage subsidies, particularly at a time of a pandemic, but we do not accept that the Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements program was an apprenticeship scheme in the way in which traditional apprenticeship schemes are operated. For that reason we disagree with the contentions by the member for Farrer in relation to those issues in her contribution on this bill, but we do appreciate her support overall for the bill as introduced by the government. To illustrate my point, in media reporting one of the trainees involved in this program was quoted as saying, Originally I was told there would be no more than six months to a year, and then, about 18 months into my employment, I finally got off my traineeship, having had two training sessions totalling eight hours—as I said earlier. We would say we are very different from that approach. The Albanese government is targeting investment to apprentices and employers in areas of the economy where skills are needed the most, and I think its fair to say its working. You need only to look at the architecture of the New Energy Apprenticeships scheme to see the difference. It is not frontend loaded. Theres payment to employers and apprentices throughout the entire life of the scheme to ensure we increase the likelihood of apprentices completing their apprenticeships, because we need those skills for many sectors of the economy. Thats what we will continue to do. Trade commencements were up almost 20 per cent in Labors first year of government compared with June 2019, pre COVID and pre emergency stimulus spending. We agree with the coalition that we cannot continue to fund an unsustainable emergency $3.8 billion COVID wage subsidy. The member for Farrer also referred to the VET FEEHELP program in her remarks. From 2009 to leaving government in 2013, the previous Labor government provided VET FEEHELP scheme loans of a total of $1.39 billion. Over the next three years to 2016, the coalition allowed VET FEEHELP loans to skyrocket to over $9 billion total—a more than sixfold increase—overwhelmingly to forprofit providers. Despite being urged to rein the loans in, the coalition sat on their hands for years, taking too long to act. The nongenuine and unscrupulous providers we saw exploit the VET FEEHELP program are the kind of providers the Albanese government is cracking down on in this bill. This minority of providers continue to tarnish the sector and undermine the majority of genuine providers doing the right thing, whether they are public providers, industry providers or providers for profit who deliver excellent training and education in many respects. The bill also responds to issues highlighted in reviews related to the VET sector and the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011. These include the 2018 review, with its report entitled All eyes on quality: review of the National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Act 2011 report, conducted by Professor Valerie Braithwaite; the 2023 rapid review into the exploitation of Australias visa system, conducted by the former chief commissioner of Victoria Police, Christine Nixon; and the inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, with its report entitled Quality and integrity the quest for sustainable growth: interim report into international education. The measures in this bill increase ASQAs powers to take decisive action against nongenuine and unscrupulous training providers. The bill enables the automatic lapse of the RTO registration where it has not delivered training and/or assessment for 12 consecutive months, as recommended by the Braithwaite review that was commissioned by the previous government. This targets integrity risks posed by dormant RTOs that are not demonstrating a genuine commitment to training delivery. Students will be better protected by measures requiring new RTOs to demonstrate their ability to deliver quality training before being allowed to expand their course offerings. Providing ASQA with greater discretion to prioritise, consider and decide applications for initial registration means that ASQA can better address risks as well as skill shortages and community need. The bill supports the integrity, health and quality of the VET sector by empowering the minister responsible for VET to determine specific periods where ASQA is not required to accept or must not process initial applications for RTO registration. This will better enable ASQA to address trends in applications by nongenuine providers or manage unsustainable influxes into the VET sector. This ensures risks can be appropriately managed before providers enter the sector, for the benefit of students and the sector as a whole. To maintain appropriate checks and balances, the use of this ministerial power will be time limited and require the minister to consult with ASQA and seek the agreement of state and territory skills ministers prior to the determination being made. Expanding and increasing offence and civil penalties fivefold will make it clear to RTOs that ASQA is armed to impose tough punishment where RTOs seek to exploit vulnerable students through false and misleading representations or otherwise engage in egregious conduct. Providing ASQA with increased flexibility to expand the period within which it can conduct an internal review of decisions, combined with technical and administrative amendments in the bill, will support ASQA to be a more efficient regulator and make its processes more proportionate, effective and fair. The bill provides ASQA powers to respond effectively to integrity threats and safeguard the quality and reputation of the Australian VET sector, as well as support the vast majority of genuine registered training organisations. This bill is the next step in this governments plan to ensure the sector has the capacity to deliver quality training outcomes and meet Australias skills and training workforce needs into the future. I welcome the oppositions public statements of support for the bill, and I look forward to working constructively with them and crossbench members to facilitate swift passage of the bill. This will allow students, industry and the whole Australian community to benefit from the removal of nongenuine and unscrupulous providers who undermine integrity and trust in vocational education and training. A strong VET sector is vital for a strong economy. Once again, I thank members for their engagement on this bill. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.","National Vocational Education and Training Regulator Amendment (Strengthening Quality and Integrity in Vocational Education and Training No. 1) Bill 2024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr OCONNOR (Gorton—Minister for Skills and Training) ","(16:00):"
439,0,0,0,1,2,"Mitchell, Brian MP",129164,"Lyons","ALP","N/A",958," Its a great honour—a great privilege, in fact—to be part of a government that has the right priorities for Australia and particularly the right priorities for regional and Middle Australia. On 1 July, the Albanese Labor government will be ensuring that every Australian taxpayer gets a tax cut, and nine in 10 Tasmanian taxpayers will be getting a bigger tax cut than they would have under the nowtobediscarded stage 3.  The Albanese Labor government is determined to ensure Australians earn more. We want people to earn more; were backing higher wages. We want people to earn more and keep more of what they earn—not like those opposite, who want Australians to work longer for less. When you hear some of the debate that has been going on over the past week and a half over these tax cuts, you wouldnt believe that those opposite are getting set to actually support these tax cuts, because all the debate has been around how critical they are of the fact that the tax cuts under stage 3 have changed. I have a message for those opposite. If they truly believe that the stage 3 tax cuts are better for this country, then they should vote for them. They have the opportunity. They can vote for the stage 3 tax cuts unchanged and, if they have their way and that goes through the Senate, then the stage 3 tax cuts remain as they are currently legislated. If they truly believe that those stage 3 tax cuts are the best option for this nation, then they should stand by their words and vote for them. But, instead, we hear that theyre going to vote for the Labor governments changes because the evidence is clear: the Labor governments changes to tax cuts are better for the vast majority of Australian taxpayers and most particularly lower and middleincome Australians. That shows that we have the right priorities for the nation. While were talking about the right priorities, that brings me to my home state of Tasmania, because you may have heard the news today that Tasmania is going to yet another early election. We have fouryear state election terms in Tasmania. Three years ago, the Liberal government went to an election a year early, citing all sorts of reasons, and now, today, theyve announced again that theyre going a year early. So, rather than getting two fouryear terms over eight years, were getting two threeyear terms, equalling six years. This is the sort of strong, stable majority Liberal government that Tasmanians were promised but never received. Three years ago, of course, Tasmanians elected a Peter Gutwein led majority Liberal government, and, in the three years since, that government has absolutely imploded. Peter Gutweins gone. He was replaced by Jeremy Rockliff—nice guy, but, gee, its a hapless government that he leads. Theyve lost minister after minister after minister. Theyve lost two of their members to the crossbench. It is diabolical for the state and terrible for investor confidence. They cant manage the health system. They cant manage education. The place is falling apart under the Liberal government, and we desperately need a change. Thats where I come to the right priorities for Tasmania—because Rebecca White is a strong Labor leader in the great tradition of strong Labor leaders. She has youth, but she also has experience. She grew up on a farm, she knows the value of hard work and she knows the value of getting that work done. Shes got the right priorities for Tasmania, and I feel actually privileged to call her a friend. One of the things that Rebeccas going to do if elected Premier on 23 March is expand the services of 18 regional and rural hospitals. A Labor government led by Rebecca will establish a dedicated fund for upgrading regional hospital infrastructure, giving local communities the resources to invest in things like Xray, ultrasound or ECG machines, diagnostic equipment, extra beds, new rooms and more, and it will expand local services to include 24/7 emergency care, rehabilitation and more. This stands in stark contrast to the failures in regional health under the current minority Liberal government. Im pleased to say there will be regional and rural hospital upgrades for a number of district and regional hospitals around Tasmania, including in my electorate of Lyons. The New Norfolk District Hospital, Midlands MultiPurpose Health Centre in Oatlands, Campbell Town Health and Community Service, Deloraine District Hospital, St Helens District Hospital and Community Centre, St Marys Community Health Centre, May Shaw Health Centre in Swansea, Toosey Aged and Community Care in Longford and Tasman MultiPurpose Service down in Nubeena can all look forward to upgrades under a Tasmanian Labor government led by Rebecca White. A Labor government under Rebecca White will also upgrade six local ambulance stations to operate 24/7, because where you live shouldnt determine whether you live or die in an emergency. Labor will upgrade ambulance stations in six regional centres to operate 24/7, with staffing by permanent paramedics. Of those six, three are in my electorate. Theres Nubeena down there on the Tasman Peninsula, Swansea on the east coast and Oatlands in the midlands. Its a very important initiative by Rebecca White and the Tasmania Labor team. We all know that its getting more difficult to hire doctors and health professionals for the regions. Labor has a plan to offer free degrees for local doctors, nurses and health workers in order to get more people on the books in hospitals in local communities. We know Tasmania needs more nurses, paramedics, doctors and allied health workers. They are the backbone of our public health system. Labor, under Rebecca White, has a plan to attract and train 150 new health workers by offering free university degrees to encourage them to come to Tasmania and work in Tasmania for at least three years. These are great health initiatives from the Tasmanian Labor team. There are a whole raft of other priority plan areas from the Labor team under Rebecca, including on housing and education. There are all sorts of areas that Labor is focusing on. Rebecca White has the right priorities for Tasmania. She has been laser focused during her term as opposition leader on holding the failed Liberal minority government to account. The cost of living, health and housing have been Rebecca Whites priorities and they will be the priorities of Rebecca White as Premier. I look forward to 23 March and the election of a Rebecca White Labor government in Tasmania.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20232024, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 20232024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) ","(16:13):"
440,0,0,0,1,2,"Stevens, James MP",176304,"Sturt","LP","N/A",959," I am just checking this is Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024 we are debating here. I appreciate the previous members comments on the Tasmanian political scene, which he is very entitled to make on an appropriation bill, but I might come within the envelope of the more than $600 million of Commonwealth government expenditure that we can comment on when talking about appropriation here in this chamber. In particular, as we know, this is a way for the government to revise and adjust their budget predictions through the MidYear Economic and Fiscal Outlook. So this is the government implementing the MYEFO from late last year, which had a lot of things of great concern to me and my community. Regrettably, the most significant is the adjustments to infrastructure funding. We should really call them cuts to infrastructure funding. I know my electorate is not alone. So many parts of the country saw some tragic decisions by this government thanks to the ministers review of the very, very impressive forward program of infrastructure investment the previous government had announced. The current government went to the election claiming they were going to honour it. Much like many other things, whether it be the $275 cut to electricity prices or the legislated stage 3 tax cuts, the infrastructure cut is just another example of the now government saying one thing to get elected and doing a very different thing after that election. Again, I predict that the people of this country will take a very dim view of this and, when they go to the ballot box in the next 12 months or so, have a lot to say about a government that has broken so many promises.  This ones very significant and acute for my community. Most people who are not from Adelaide would be surprised to hear this, but Adelaide is the only capital city that has Highway 1 running through its suburbs. If you circumnavigate Australia, when you get to the big cities or, frankly, even a lot of small towns, you will almost always take a bypass. But due to a range of quirks of history it is the case that, in Adelaide, Highway 1 runs through the suburbs of the city. It goes through the suburbs of my electorate along whats called Portrush Road. The starkest example of the madness of the situation is that heavy freight going from Melbourne to Perth travels through my electorate. There are some 18 traffic lights and seven schools literally upon this thoroughfare. It is just not acceptable that in 2024 we have the major freight route around continental Australia going through the suburbs of a city of over 1.3 million people. The previous government had a plan to change all of that. The government I was a member of, the Morrison government, developed with the then state Liberal government, the Marshall government, a vision for the Greater Adelaide Freight Bypass. That would have seen all that heavy freight Ive just outlined leaving whats called the Southern Expressway before it goes through the Adelaide Hills—so around Monarto—and then travelling up around the back of the Adelaide Hills, rather than through suburban Adelaide, to connect with where most of that freight is looking to go: either to Port Adelaide or on to Port Augusta or Darwin or wherever. And obviously it would have worked in reverse when the freight was flowing in the opposite direction. It makes a lot of sense, and it has been talked about for some time. We even, finally, in the last couple of years, thanks to the work of those two governments, saw all of the stakeholders, all of the industry groups and all of the local councils that would be on the new route come together and express their support for this project. We did all that work. Then we announced and put funding in the budget for the Truro bypass, which is in the member for Barkers electorate. That is the first step in a series of projects that would see that bypass constructed. That was a very clear show of faith and show of commitment to this bypass—to getting this heavy freight out of suburban Adelaide—by the previous Morrison government and the state Liberal government. To be fair to the state Labor government that was elected some two years ago, they kept the funding for their part of the deal in their budget. In fact, they delivered two budgets where the funding of the Marshall government was left in there by that new government. Until late last year, it seemed fanciful and farcical that, for a funded project—one which had the support of Infrastructure Australia and of Infrastructure South Australia, the state governments commensurate body; one which a state Labor government continued to remain committed to; one for which funding had been outlined years earlier and was in the forward estimates of budgets; and where the federal Labor government had gone to an election saying it was going to honour and to proceed with all of these projects that we had announced and, in this case, put funding into and secured funding for—just before Christmas, that funding would be ripped away. Lets understand the significance of this project and the betrayal. I obviously speak for the interests of my electorate and how they are affected, but it impacts not just the electorate of Sturt. I mentioned that this project is actually in the member for Barkers electorate, and of course he is devastated at the impact on his community of seeing that this great opportunity to get freight out of the township of Truro has been defunded by the Albanese government. Indeed, its not just members of the opposition. The member for Mayo—of course, an Independent member—who represents the Adelaide Hills, is just as passionate about getting these heavy trucks out of her electorate. There are literally deaths from this heavy freight at whats called the tollgate, which is in my electorate but it is actually on the route of all the commuters that are coming from the member for Mayos electorate into and out of metropolitan Adelaide. That is a very dangerous part of the Adelaide metropolitan road network that would be transformed if all that heavy freight wasnt having to come down in low gear, constantly having issues with braking and, at times, running right through an extremely busy intersection. Even the Labor member for Boothby has said—at least, at public meetings full of residents that are furious about this—that shes supportive of this and is going to talk to the minister and work on securing funding for it. Well, good luck. We look forward to seeing that happen, because you dont say one thing to your community and then do a different thing here in Canberra. At those meetings, these comments are made—and people record these meetings, evidently. The good thing is: theres no ambiguity, confusion or ability for someone to say, No, I didnt say that, when it has been recorded. Thats the very helpful thing about recording these public meetings. So we wish the member for Boothby well on delivering on her commitment to get this project funded. But it would surprise me that the government would defund project a few months ago and then refund it, when, in the meantime, theyve rubbished the project and had all sorts of disparaging things to say about it, months and months later. I hope that they have a conversion on the road to Damascus on this point. I fear that wont be the case, and, therefore, Im very committed to fighting at the community level alongside colleagues like the member for Barker and the member for Mayo to make sure that we show just how furious the people of Adelaide—in fact, the people of South Australia—are about this disgraceful betrayal. It is such a logical project that will deliver such significant productivity improvements to the Australian freight network. Were talking about investing in Highway 1. Like I say, the beneficiaries of investing in this are not just my constituents, who I prioritise. If youre sending heavy freight from Melbourne to Perth or vice versa, then theres a benefit from a productivity point of view for that freight. There are enormous road safety benefits to this. The Road Transport Association in South Australia warmly welcomed the broader concept of the bypass when it was funded and said that, despite the fact that the route is longer, theres a lot of sense and efficiency for the road transport sector in shifting off the carriageway through suburban Adelaide to instead go around the back of the Adelaide Hills. So its a completely logical project, and it concerns us greatly that this comes against the backdrop of so many other broken promises, as I outlined earlier in my contribution. It makes us start to wonder if we can take this government at their word on anything. I say that because, as we approach the next election, were going to have all sorts of other things said by this government that fall into the category of promises like cutting electricity bills by $275, honouring stage 3 tax cuts or building the Truro bypass. The people of my electorate—like the people across this country—are quite reasonably going to wonder why they would believe anything they say. Why would this government expect the people of this country to believe anything they say? Now what we know is that, if this government goes to the next election making commitments to my electorate, to my home state or to all Australians, all that means is that its something they will say before an election to get elected and then conveniently decide that they dont have to do after the election. Its a pretty fundamental part of our democracy. People should be expecting governments to honour commitments that they campaign on. They should expect that the promises they take to elections—just as in the case of this government—should be honoured when they are elected. Were, potentially, on the cusp of a very frightening scenario around naval shipbuilding, which were told about through all these leaks coming out of the defence department. Its good to see the defence department is leaking as consistently under this government as it was under the previous government. As per usual we read all this speculation—the softening of the ground for some major realignment of the surface shipbuilding program through the review that was commissioned by the government coming out of the Defence Strategic Review. Part of that review was to have another review. The review recommended by that review has been with the government for many months now, and apparently it is being announced next week. What Ill be looking for is to see whether the commitments that were made to my home state of South Australia on shipbuilding are honoured. Theres a bit of a pattern here, isnt there? It seems like no matter what the commitment was—whether its in defence, infrastructure, cost of living or tax—it all seems to change after an election. It all seems to be different. There are always very convenient weasel words that are put around these things. At the end of the day, if that surface ship review sees a loss of continuous shipbuilding and jobs in my home state of South Australia, I promise you there will be hell to pay in the state of South Australia. And, if theres some kind of trickery, where they say, Look, what were doing is just slightly scaling back the number of frigates, but then there are going to be these other vessels that well get to. Youll all still get continuous shipbuilding—if theres any fraud like that, people just wont buy it. They will not buy it. We can already see that the South Australian Premier seems to have been given quiet advance notice of this bad news for South Australia so he can figure out his spin and lines and try and make a silk purse out of a sows ear. Hes already adjusting all his commentary in saying, The nine vessels isnt whats key; its all about continuous shipbuilding. I suspect theres going to be some kind of attempt to say, Look, were doing six frigates and were building some alternate vessels on top of that, and were going to work through the detail of it all, but dont worry; its all going to happen in South Australia—just like they were going to build the Truro bypass and havent, just like they were going to cut our power bills by $275 a year and havent, and just like they were going to honour the stage 3 tax cuts and havent. When this comes up next week, if the leaks out of Defence in the media are true, we will watch for that and we will know what it really means if thats the announcement—that is, a breach of trust again with the people of South Australia and a broken promise by this government that goes to elections and says one thing and does another thing. When the people of South Australia and of my electorate of Sturt get the chance to adjudicate on that, Im pretty confident what the message will be, loud and clear, at the ballot box.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20232024, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 20232024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr STEVENS (Sturt) ","(16:21):"

It may be that we have to break and go to the other place, but well come back when that happens.  We have spoken so much about the costofliving issues facing Australian families, for good reason; it is the No. 1 issue facing families throughout this nation. Its one thing to identify a problem; the onus is on us to find solutions. Weve spoken about the two key levers being fiscal and monetary policy. It is our contention and submission that all that work is being left to the Reserve Bank. The only blunt tool they have is interest rates, and that blunt tool hits a section of the economy and the nation harder than any other: young Australians who are paying off a mortgage. We know that the average income has dropped in real terms by $8,000 for Australians. But, for those paying a mortgage, in addition to that $8,000 drop in real income is an average increase in repayments for a mortgage of $24,000—so $8,000 plus $24,000, for the average. As land increases in cost, and the cost of buying a house or a unit rises as you get closer to the city, like in seats like mine, those costs are exponentially higher. But we work in averages here, and, in my seat, housing is more expensive, food is more expensive and transport is more expensive, and people are earning less and hurting more. If we leave it to the Reserve Bank, it means were not turning our minds to all the tools we have in this place and in the executive through fiscal policy. Id like to speak to two. One is spending and the other is productivity, and this government is not doing enough on either; in fact, its not doing anything on either. Before we get to the particular tools you can use in fiscal policy, Id like to briefly speak about trust. Trust in the institution of the executive, the government, and the institution of the parliament is paramount. These are serious problems, and Australians are hurting. But, if they dont trust us to look after their interests above our own, whats the point? Ive got a table in my office; I call it the pool room. If theres a particularly good report or article, that gets to go in the pool room. An honourable member: Straight to the pool room!","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20232024, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 20232024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WOLAHAN (Menzies) ","(16:35):"

I keep this one here, and I keep coming back to it. Its the Edelman trust report. Its been running for about 28 years. Its an annual report, and this is the 2023 report about the trust barometer; Im looking forward to seeing what it has to say in 2024! In 2023 they saw one of the greatest drops in trust in government since theyve been running this report for Australia. We are not alone in this around the world, but the drop here sees, as a percentage, only 45 per cent of Australians trusting the government. Thats not asked and conducted in a partisan way; its conducted as an institution: The institution of government, do you trust it? Sadly, with the way that real tax reform has been thrown in the bin, and the manner timing in which it has been conducted, weeks before a byelection, Im confident—and I say it with regret—that that number will drop again this year when we see the Edelman trust report. Whatever the merits of the particular change—and we have supported that for good reason—how the decision was made matters and the timing matters, because Australians will be looking to this government to solve the serious problems that they have, particularly when it comes to spending and productivity.  With that I would like to turn to the issue of spending. Another document that is in the pool room for good reason is the 2023 Intergenerational report. I urge all members to come back to this document whenever they can.

443,0,0,0,1,2,"MemberContinuation",235654,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr WOLAHAN: My reference to the pool room in my office was not a reference to a billiard table; it was a reference to a table where documents and reports go if they have said something of note thats worth coming back to. One of those documents that lives in my pool room is the Intergenerational report. If you go to chapter 7, it talks about government spending. There are some alarming numbers in there about government spending. Its important to note that, along with increasing productivity, constraining proportionate government spending is key to keeping inflation down and, therefore, key to keeping interest rates and mortgage payments down.  When you look at issues of government spending, the whole Intergenerational report looks at a timescale that, with due respect to the press gallery, they are not really interested in. It is a timescale that goes back through many governments, and it will go ahead through many governments. There is a chart on page 144 that I urge all members to have a look at. It is chart 7.2, titled Real Australian Government spending per person. It is measured in real dollars per person as at 202223 prices. So theres no claim that this is about inflation. It is not a story of inflation; it is a story of a real increase in spending. At the turn of this century, in 2001 and 2002, government spending per person in real dollars was just above $15,000. At the moment, it is just under $25,000 per person. Im not going to pretend there wasnt a spike on the previous governments watch. That was, of course, because of the extraordinary circumstances of COVID. So there was a spike and then it came back down. The bit that comes back down is what I am referring to. It is now sitting at just under $25,000 of government spending per person in this country. If you look at the trajectory forward, you will see that in 2062, in just under 40 years, when another generation of Australians will be here, they will be paying, in real terms, $40,000 per person. That is not adjusted for inflation; thats in real terms. If we as a nation are to continue to be a prosperous and free country that is able to provide all of the services that Australians want and expect from us, to allow people to have a standard of living that is better than the generations that have come before them—and thats why its called the intergenerational report—we collectively have to turn our minds to the issue of government spending. We have to. Of course, there is a variety of departments and ministries. You have just to stick your head out the window as you drive around Canberra to know how much of that money is spent on this town. Its a lovely town, but that is all money that is sent here by Australians. Australia is changing. Were getting older, and there are certain challenges that come with that. We dont pretend they dont occur. The five fastestgrowing areas are health, aged care, NDIS, defence and, No. 5, interest on government debt. Interest on government debt is the fifthlargest and fastestgrowing expenditure item. Were caught in this vicious cycle whereby, in not properly pulling our weight in terms of fiscal policy, one of the fastestgrowing areas contributing to inflation is government debt. We have seen this movie play out before. The then Labor opposition to John Howard didnt like that John Howard noted that Liberals would constrain government spending and therefore reduce interest rates. They didnt like that, but thats what the evidence shows. Thats what the economic theory shows. Its not something thats just part of a talking point. We have seen what actually happens if government spending is unconstrained. That is something that all of us on both sides of the aisle need to turn our minds to. Id now like to turn to the second lever of fiscal policy, which is productivity. Im on the House Standing Committee on Economics, and we are finishing up a report into productivity and dynamism in Australia. I thank all of the groups and individuals who have made submissions. I thank my colleagues on that committee from the government but also from the crossbench. It has been conducted in the spirit I hope future generations would appreciate. Some of the things we have learnt—without giving the game away for the report that we still have to sign off on—include that our economy lends itself to monopolies and oligopolies. The theory behind monopolies and oligopolies—I will stick with oligopolies—is quite simple. It is an example of market failure where were not truly competitive. Where there is a limited number of firms or providers, whether its manufacturing or services, it will necessarily lead to a rise in prices. Australians know that. They know that when it comes to shopping for food, where youve got two providers, Coles and Woolworths, occupying 60 per cent of the market. They know that when it comes to airlines, where you have a dominant player in Qantas, who have only ever really had one other competitor. They know that when it comes to banks, where we really have a fourpillar banking system. And they know it in a variety of other areas. I love going to Bunnings and getting my Bunnings sausage, but it does strike me that a lot of smaller, family hardware businesses no longer exist. One of the appeals and advantages for oligopoly firms is that, in the short term, they get to offer discount prices, often at a loss. But we know from repeated history that, over the long term, those reductions are recovered many times over. So we need to turn our minds to productivity, and there are so many options for us to look at to increase productivity, including actual tax reform. And this isnt the time to relitigate the stage 3 changes and what they mean for aspiration and opportunity in this country. But that change, removing the 37c bracket, was critical tax reform that wasnt just about productivity on a spreadsheet. It was productivity in our souls and in our minds, where young Australians who study hard and work hard say, Im not in that bracket now, but I really want to be and Im going to back myself to get there. Thats what aspiration is. Its not just a word. Its in peoples souls and their minds and how they conduct themselves and how they act and the decisions that they make. Its the fire in the belly that has made this country great. Thats why we back aspiration. Thats why we should look for policies that reward effort and aspiration. The true inequity in this country is that those who can truly afford to look down on their fellow Australians have got enough assets to engage accountants and lawyers to manage their affairs so theyre not actually paying the sort of tax that young Australians seeking to get ahead are. Theyre not doing that. But Im not here to relitigate the stage 3 tax reforms. The other is industrial relations. Industrial relations are key to every sector of our economy and our society. When you listen to the minister bringing forward productivitykilling bill after productivitykilling bill, from the talking points you would think that we are living in a Charles Dickens novel—that we are in the early stages of industrialisation, where youve got big fatcat bosses, and Oliver Twist and other poor, wretched creatures are living a slavelike existence. Thats not the modern economy or existence that we have now. I will come back to the documents in the pool room now, but we need to tell this government that, when it comes to looking after Australians, they are dreaming.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20232024, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 20232024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[11]","N/A","N/A"
444,0,0,0,1,2,"McCormack, Michael MP",219646,"Riverina","NATS","N/A",963," Prior to the election, the Prime Minister and Labor candidates, members and senators, made a lot of promises and pledges. They said they were going to do politics better. They said they were going to be accountable and transparent. Unfortunately, they havent been.  Im pleased to be able to rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024 because many of us werent permitted to speak on Appropriation Bill (No.1) because Labor guillotined the debate. They gagged the debate—wanted to rush it through. Appropriation bills are important because they allow the proper financing of the governments functions, and this bill, as well as others, provides the legislative authority for additional funding for government agencies to allow, as it were, the government to do what it needs to do. So thats important. And the government is doing what it needs to do insofar as the various departments et cetera will have the appropriate amount of money for the fiscal year ahead. But the government is not doing what it needs to do when it comes to regional Australia. There are many examples which are a blight on what the government is rolling out—on what the government is doing. Just this week the government announced changes made by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Murray Watt. I feel for the senator. Its a difficult job, being an agriculture minister in a Labor government, because they dont have the capacity to really have a vision for regional Australia, let alone farming in those areas. They have so many competing interests in cabinet, and the regions usually arent one of them. Farming and agriculture certainly are not part of the mix when the caucus get together and decide where theyre going to spend money, where they will have a focus and where they will do whats right—or what they think is right—for and on behalf of Australians. If the biosecurity levy model put in place by this government were not so disgraceful, it would be laughable. In no other country would farmers be expected to pay the biosecurity levies of imported foods from another nation, but in this country they are! Our hardworking farmers, already under siege because of the policies of those opposite, are being asked to pay a biosecurity protection levy for goods that are coming in from their competitors—imported products from other countries—which are going to sit alongside our farmers products on the same supermarket shelves in Australian cities and towns. How ridiculous! How nonsensical! How embarrassing! I am aghast at this. Minister Watt has announced that there will be a 30 per cent reduction of this proposed biosecurity protection levy, but its already too high. The levy shouldnt be there at all, yet farmers are expected to say, Alleluia! Let the sunshine in, because theres been a 30 per cent reduction in what they were going to have to pay. We should be so lucky! The levy shouldnt be there at all. There should be no levy. Why should Australian farmers pay the biosecurity levy for their competitors? I would love to know the answer to that question. I would love to know why it should be paid by our farmers, who are doing it so tough and who largely propped up this country, with their friends in mining, through COVID. They still put food on our tables. They still put food on ships and in the bellies of planes to go overseas to help our balance of payments. Our farmers feed our nation and many others besides, and yet what do they cop from the Labor government? They cop kicks in the guts all the time, like these biosecurity charges. Dont just take my word for it. The Chief Executive Officer of Grain Producers Australia, Colin Bettles—I know him well—said: Our view is that we spend enough on levies already and that the government should spend what they have better. I couldnt have said it better myself. He continued: We already pay 1.02 per cent of our bottom line in compulsory levies that go to research and development and biosecurity and global market access. Thats good, because we need R&D. We need to improve what were doing. I admire the work being done at Charles Sturt University at Wagga Wagga, particularly in the space of chickpeas and other products. They have a worldclass equine laboratory there, where theyre doing research not just into horses but into veterinary science. The work that theyre doing for agriculture and through the drought hub and everything else is second to none. Labor members opposite should know that part of that research and development is at the Graham Centre, named after a former Labor state agriculture minister, Eddie Graham, who was a very good man. But that was back in the fifties, when Labor actually cared about the regions. They have long since stopped caring about the regions and certainly about farming. Mr Bettles was quite right when he added: Its ridiculous for the government to call us the only beneficiaries of biosecurity, its fundamentally flawed logic … enough is enough. People like Mr Bettles would now be expected to bow and scrape at the feet of the Labor cabinet because they have reduced the biosecurity levy. He should be so thankful that they have reduced what is an unnecessary charge! It defies logic. There was another interesting quote, from Terry OLeary. He raises watermelons in the Queensland town of Chinchilla, in the Western Downs of that fine state, in the seat of Maranoa. He said: I think its disgusting the way they are treating us as a cash cow— This is a fascinating quote— You wouldnt go to the State of Origin and expect players to pay for security at the front gate out of their own pockets. So why should farmers? Good point! Its a very good point. When you look at horticulture, 32 per cent of the industry is considering leaving. Thats almost a third. Thats not just because of the biosecurity levies but also because of the changes to the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme, where farmers are expected to pay workers for a minimum 30 hours a week, every week—even during unseasonable conditions when there possibly might not be any work. All farmers know that you should be paid a fair days pay for a fair days work. Those people who use foreign labour, who do not do that—who exploit the systems—should be reported, should be charged and have the full force of authorities brought against them. But, in the main—the absolute extreme main—our farmers rely on Pacific workers. They do the right thing by Pacific workers; they pay Pacific workers the right amount. Yet, under the union conspired laws put in by those opposite, theyre now going to get whacked again. Theyre going to get whacked for having their competitors products. Theyre going to be charged for the biosecurity for overseas competitors. Theyre going to get whacked and have to pay workers to sit around and do nothing when theres no work to be done, under the new union conspired, union inspired, union led rules that are taking over PALM. We have Mr OLeary saying it is ridiculous that Labor is putting a tax on an industry that is shrinking, and this will affect our food security. The members here, who represent the electorates of OConnor, Nicholls and Casey, know how important food security is, particularly my regional colleagues. The member for OConnor is very upset about how his sheep farmers are being treated with the live export nonsense that is going on through this parliament and through this nation. No other country in the world has an Exporter Supply Chain Assurance System in place, where animal welfare is placed at No.1—and it should be. But we are now facing the prospect that we will just outsource animal welfare to other countries who couldnt give two hoots about sheep, cattle or anything else they are exporting live. But we do. Our farmers do. They take exception to the fact they get accused by the member for Clark, and many others besides, who say that they dont put animal welfare as their No.1 priority. Ill tell you what else they put down as a priority, and thats making a quid. Farmers shouldnt have to do something for nothing. Farmers shouldnt have to be hit all the time by charges and levies, whether its for biosecurity or to be told they arent animal welfare conscious. This is just nonsense! Its hard enough to farm in this nation now without the Labor government putting on all these imposts and impositions. When they do—as they probably will—ban all animal exports, those export trades and routes will be taken up by countries who dont care at all about animal welfare! Suffer, the poor sheep, as they will. That is what will happen. But theyll go to their little NIMBY meetings, theyll have their tofu, theyll sit around drinking their chamomile tea and theyll say: Arent we good? We stopped the sheep trade. Arent we good? But they wont even care about the sheep that will be on the ships, that wont be having their pant score measured, that wont have airflow on the ships, like we do, and when they die theyll just get thrown overboard. Its a disgrace. We in this country outsource so much these days to countries that just dont care. It is a nonsense. Then, as the member for Nicholls will rightly say, we have the changes to the MurrayDarling Basin Plan. My goodness! We in the Nationals, and regional Liberals too, fought so hard against the draft Basin Plan back in 2010. There we were with Labor wanting just about every available drop of water sent out the mouth of the Murray. The mouth of the Murray was not even put on the early maps of Australia because it was banked up by sand. But never let the historical facts get in the way of a good environmental story. The Murray, before manmade interventions such as weirs, locks and dams, dried up often. It did. People had picnics in the dry creek beds and the riverbeds of our various ephemeral streams. Yet what do Labor want to do? They want to take the water away. They want to buy it out of our communities. What happens when a farmer in stress and distress sells their water? The price of water goes through the roof because the government has just intervened and that farmer takes their money and they leave the community. It leaves the community literally high and dry. It is not just the farming community that suffers. It is the hairdresser, the motor mechanic and the school.

446,0,0,0,1,2,"Birrell, Sam MP",288713,"Nicholls","NATS","N/A",965," I too rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024 and cognate bills. The purpose of the three appropriation bills is to release money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the annual services of the government. We dont stand in the way of that. I can tell you that its very good to be speaking about this today. I wanted to speak on the appropriation bill following the May budget, but I didnt get the chance. There were many speakers lined up who didnt get the chance because the government ended the debate. It was incredibly inappropriate that we members, who are elected and are sent here to speak on behalf of our constituents, didnt get to talk about the most important thing—the appropriation of taxpayer money and the expenditure of such. So its nice to be able to speak today—although I did reflect on the speech I was going to deliver last May and what I have to say today, and, unfortunately, its devastating to report that things have got worse and are getting worse. If regional Australia was a dartboard, the walls around it would be full of holes. The government arent spending less; theyre spending a lot more, but theyre spending less in regional and rural Australia.  When I go around my wonderful electorate of Nicholls—one of my favourite parts of my job—people will ask, Are you enjoying it? I say: Yes. Parts of it are difficult, but there are parts that are enjoyable. One of the most enjoyable things is talking to schoolchildren, mostly in primary schools, and having a conversation about what it is we do up here and what the Australian democracy is all about. That leads to a fascinating conversation. It boils down to two major things were here for. Firstly, were here to enact legislation. I explain that to kids; I say: We make rules and we try to balance things. We try to balance the rights of people, the responsibilities of people and the good of society, and we have debates about that. The people of Nicholls have sent me here, and the people of Bendigo have sent you here, Deputy Speaker Chesters. We are probably from different ideological traditions, but we have debates about what those rules should be. Thats a form of democracy that has seen Australia prosper as one of the most successful nations, if not the most successful nation, on the globe. We also appropriate money in a variety of ways from taxpayers, and we decide how to spend it. Thats also a massive responsibility. Its our job to work out whats appropriate to take from people and businesses, and its our job to make sure we spend that money wisely, efficiently and on things and investments that are going to lead to the advancement of our nation and our economy. At the moment, were all talking about cost of living because its the biggest issue for people. When Im in the chamber, I hear, Were giving people money for this, were giving people money for that, making this cheaper and making that cheaper, which is, essentially, using taxpayer money to hand out money. Thats a debate we can have, and Im not opposed to that in general. Were also talking about tax cuts, which our side sees as redistribution and the other side sees as fairness. But I would remind those opposite that the tax system is designed not as a tool necessarily of redistribution but for providing for Australias economic future. Were not talking about the root cause of the cost of living, and I find that really frustrating. Were skirting around the edges. The success of Australias economy is based on the success of Australias businesses, and that means the success of Australias entrepreneurship—people who invest money to try and make something that didnt exist before, whether it be a good or a service, and sell that in a competitive way that improves the lives of Australians and/or makes us internationally competitive. Thats what were here to do. Theres a safety net to make sure that people dont suffer. I take the point of the member for Menzies, who said that if you were sitting in the chamber listening to the Labor members youd think wed been living in some sort of Dickensian world where everyone is doing absolutely terribly; theyre doing worse now than they were under the coalition government! Generally, modern Australia has been a partnership between the employer—so businesses—the capital and the labour. And that partnership is essential. The businesses cant do it without the labour, and the labour wont exist if the businesses arent successful and profitable. I think, with the policies of this government, we are moving away from that. I think thats regrettable and it will have poor longterm impacts on our nation. I will give you some examples—firstly, on regional infrastructure. If were going to take taxpayers money from them, it cant just be a redistribution exercise: You can have some here, and You can have some there. Theres got to be a strategic approach: What could we invest in that would make the Australian economy perform better? If you were in a business, youd say, Okay, weve got a surplus, or, Weve got a profit, or, Weve got a certain amount of money we can expend. Smart business people would say: How would we spend that money to make our business more competitive and more profitable into the future? Now, we argue that regional infrastructure can do that, because regional Australia is the engine room of the nations economic prosperity. Whether it be agriculture, manufacturing or mining, a lot of it happens in regional Australia. Thats not to dismiss the people who live in metropolitan areas of this country; they make a great contribution, too. But, because of the bulk of population being in those areas, we sometimes feel that they get an inordinate voice in this nation through our democracy. Thats why were here, from the regions—to fight for the people who live there and to explain the economic benefit that comes out of those places. Now, regional infrastructure is a real passion of mine. In my previous job, I worked for an organisation called the Committee for Greater Shepparton, and we tried to advocate regional infrastructure being built. I must say, not coming from a particularly partisan background as a young person, I had a lot of admiration for the Hawke and Keating governments; they made me impressed with Labor for a while, but that was cured a bit later on. When I was the CEO of the Committee for Greater Shepparton, I found the coalition government really responsive on building and funding regional infrastructure. The EchucaMoama Bridge was a fantastic bridge project. That bridge over the Murray River, linking those twin towns, improved the connectivity from southern New South Wales to that part of the west of my electorate. That has made a huge difference. That was funded by the coalition—really pushed, particularly, by then Minister Chester, who I want to congratulate on that. I spoke in this place the other day of many of my opponents at the last election—not the Labor Party; other opponents, at my last election—whose platform was We need to kick out the Nats because they dont do anything for our electorate. And what was the platform—the literal platform—that they used for that? They stood on top of the EchucaMoama Bridge—$360 million for which had been delivered by the National Party. Be that as it may, theres been some significant rail infrastructure, which is moving more professional people to Shepparton because not only have we got better trains between Shepparton and Melbourne but were going to have extra services. That was delivered by my friend the member for Riverina when he was in his portfolio in the previous government. There are other building blocks of the economy that people in metropolitan areas might not appreciate. I come back to the agricultural production of the MurrayDarling Basin and what that has meant for the Australian nation for over 100 years: the construction of channels which take water from the Murray and Goulburn Rivers in my electorate, through a network of farms, and deliver that water, so that areas that once grew very little now grow pastures, lucerne crops and corn crops, that all feed the dairy industry, and fruit crops—peaches, apples and pears. Im so proud that thats a part of Australia that I represent. But, for those people to continue doing that, they need a government that says, Okay; were going to spend money and make rules, as I say to those grade 6 kids, that increases your ability to do that, because its good for Australia, its good for our own people here and its also good because we export a lot of that produce to China, to SouthEast Asia, to South Asia and to the Middle East. That provides sustainable jobs for people and it provides economic income for this nation. So what do the Labor Party do about it when they come to government? Based on ideological tangents, the Minister for the Environment and Water has decided to rip up what was an agreement under the MurrayDarling Basin Plan and basically make it much harder for our horticulturalists and dairy farmers to grow the food that sustains Australia and provides export dollars for this nation. It threatens small communities that have sprung up because of hard work, because of the combination between capital and labour. Someone put their own money into a farm or a factory. People from all over the world came to work on that farm or in that factory and create something really special. There are communities across my electorate—Numurkah, Nathalia, Stanhope, Echuca, Cobram, Shepparton—where that Australian miracle has happened. Capital has been invested, labour has turned up and everyones done well out of it. The people who invested the capital have done well because these are profitable businesses because this was back in a time when government said, Our responsibility is to make sure weve got the building blocks for you to be profitable. The people who worked in those industries were winners because they moved to a beautiful part of regional Australia, bought their own houses, raised their families in caring and nurturing communities and have been part of something really special. Those people are proud to have worked in places like SPC, Bega and Kagome. Thats all threatened by this governments attitude towards agriculture policy and water policy in the new, brutal MurrayDarling Basin Plan regime. Its also threatened by the IR laws. What I was talking about just a few moments ago in relation to the success that Ive seen growing up in the seat of Nicholls—and this is the case anywhere in Australia—is that its the partnership between capital and labour. I do well if you work hard and throw yourself into this job. Thats what capital says. Labour says, Ive still got a job if youre profitable. That partnership is what its all about, and its worked so well in the Goulburn Valley and other parts of Australia. But what were seeing now is bringing the conflict back—the mean, nasty employer is trying to screw over the poor little worker. The modern Australia that we were moving towards where its a partnership and the employer wants to keep good workers, so they give flexibility but say, I might need to give you a phone call on the weekend if something happens and I dont know whats going on—all of those arrangements and agreements are being torn apart by this conflict thats being created out of nothing. I think thats regrettable and I think our economy will suffer for it. I hope we can rejig our direction as a nation and get back to productivity when were talking about the economy.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20232024, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 20232024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BIRRELL (Nicholls—Deputy Nationals Whip) ","(17:29):"
447,0,0,0,1,2,"Hamilton, Garth MP",291387,"Groom","LNP","N/A",967," What a fantastic contribution to end on productivity, a point that I will take further. I am going to make the obvious observation and repeat what has been said. The incursion of conflict into a conversation on productivity is something that is detrimental to all Australians across the workforce and all Australians full stop. How we do what we need to do, how we get together and produce what we need to produce, relies upon a conversation between employees and employers. In speaking on this appropriation bill, the context the last budget was delivered in, with the IR changes since and the regulatory framework weve seen—and I want to speak to a lot of these things—has led to the growth of this conflict again. I think it is something that is well worth us raising.  I want to address what is clearly becoming the biggest issue in the Australian economy, which is: how do we improve productivity levels? It is often pointed out that over about 20 years we have seen a downturn in productivity in Australia and in other Western countries as well, but there is nothing that compares to the significant downturn we have seen over the last 18odd months, where productivity in Australia fell through the floor and was at a level we had never recorded before. We have never seen this level of productivity drop. Its important that we address this. I think the Australian people rightly recognise real wages as an important issue. This government ran on the agenda of raising real wages. But, as has been pointed out repeatedly and was again by the RBA in presenting to the economics committee just last week, productivity is crucial to real wages growth. There are historical links between them. For generations we have seen the labour movement acknowledge the need for productivity. We have seen employers acknowledge the need for productivity improvements as a means of increasing real wages. I always point to: what does good look like? I point back again to the Howard era, 1996 to 2007, when real wages grew by 21.5 per cent in a time when we saw high levels of productivity. There is no surprise that those two things went together. We need to look at the policy settings that were deployed during that time to understand how we got those results. There are a lot of things that can impact on productivity. We just heard the RBA governor talk on some of these—skills, investment, taxation policy and IR. All of these things have an impact on productivity. But my biggest concern has been and remains that, unless those policy levers are used, the default for driving productivity is going to be unemployment. That is a significant concern for all of us when in an economic situation like we are. I want to address some of these areas. The hope amongst economists is that, having had this catastrophic fall in productivity in Australia, we can normalise and rebound. When the RBA suggested that, they admitted they were being very, very optimistic that productivity would normalise and come back. When pressed on what was in their modelling that would drive productivity, they admitted that assumptions around skills and business investment were unlikely to play any key role in driving productivity in the short term. In fact, while they may have longterm impacts, there is no significant change in the skills and investment policy settings that we see today to previous, so they dont expect that to be any significant driver in that normalisation process. If we go back and we look at that, what are some of the things that have changed during this term of government? What is the new norm? If we are able to normalise, what will that new norm look like? I think we can see that each one of these is a downward pressure or at best a neutral situation. We talk about business investment in new technology. One of the policy settings that the previous government deployed with great success when it came to driving productivity was the instant asset writeoff. When we talk about technology, we need to see that not all technology is made by Apple or exists in the cloud. Sometimes its a coffee machine that uses less water or heats up faster. Sometimes its a tractor that doesnt stop as often as my uncles does. Sometimes its a small improvement, and the investment in that by small business has a cumulative impact. Youre not looking at revolutionary steps forward in productivity; youre looking at small gains that could be made from oneoff investments. So, facing the realisation that productivity had fallen off a cliff, as we saw last year, the coalition called on the government to restore tax relief for small businesses and boost productivity by extending the instant asset writeoff and to extend the value of assets eligible to $30,000. Sadly, the government didnt take up these measures. This was a policy setting that has been deployed well. It has been acknowledged everywhere as a productivity driver, but the government hasnt chosen to take that up. I hope they will look at that again because, without that investment and without that incentive to invest, were leaving that lever alone. If we speak about skills, one of the saddest pieces of information we saw come out last week was that the number of people in apprenticeships and traineeships is 50,000 fewer than during the Morrison government. That could be responsive to drivers of the day. Whats important to point out is that, even if we take that as a normalisation pressure itself, its still fewer skilled people entering the workforce. It reinforces the conversation with the RBA. Skills are unlikely to be a driver of productivity in the short term and, certainly, in the medium term. It may well come again in the long term, if that number can be turned around, but its not there for us at the moment. With regard to technology, Ill refer to an article in the Australian by Patrick Commins: An adviser to the Fair Work Commission says the next generation of Australians may not be better off than their parents because of abysmally low productivity, and the Albanese governments industrial relations reforms threaten unforeseen consequences with little … payoff for the vast bulk of workers. In terms of the future that were seeing created for us and the threats to productivity, the important point is that theyre not just threats to us now. If we are unable to address productivity now and turn that number around, the impact is not just going to be felt by us now but by future generations. What it condemns us to is continued lower real wage growth, which is what we have seen. Real wages have not been growing. Further into the article is where we get a feel for economists views on the current policy settings with regard to productivity. The article says: With little obvious appetite for meaningful reform in areas such as taxation, and with workplace changes promising a less flexible workplace … coming generations may no longer be better off than the ones that preceded them. If we look at the IR legislation that has come through, across the board, there is nowhere in that suite of legislation where we can point to something that has a genuine upward pressure on productivity. In fact, as has been pointed out repeatedly, the expectation is that the IR reforms that have come through do very little to increase productivity and will drive them lower. An article in the AFR says, In both tax and IR, poor process and playing politics has produced bad policy outcomes. In the IR space, unfortunately, weve seen from this government steps that are quite regressive in terms of the workforce situation its trying to apply. There is no doubt that IR reform is an important part of a Labor or a coalition governments agenda, but, when the policy settings are driving productivity down in a period like this, they will have longterm impacts. My genuine concern is that we have missed the opportunity to drive skills investment and to address tax reform. The clear link established in the 2008 OECD report is that high tax at a corporate level and on income tax has a negative pressure on productivity. o, when we dont address tax reform in a meaningful way, and when we have IR legislation that goes negative, the only pathway to recovering productivity left to us is unemployment. I refer to another view, that of Innes Willox in the AFR: Australian chief executives are looking to the year ahead more anxious and uncertain about the national economy than they have felt for more than a decade. The government often talks about a wasted decade. It would appear that businesses viewed the last decade quite differently. The quote continues: This focus on productivityenhancing measures ranks far ahead of expected funding of capital expenditure and research and development. Businesses note that they need to find productivity. But the concern is that, the more we invest in technology, the worse off the employment trajectory will be. What were talking about in technology for some of these big tech corporations is AI. Were talking about replacing the workforce. This is not beneficial for employment figures. I cant help but be drawn to this point that, without a clear plan to address productivity with anything other than rising unemployment, the future gets bleaker and bleaker. Its a question of who the future gets bleaker for, because largely what were talking about is entrylevel workers in the workforce. Theyre likely to be lower paid and likely to be less educated. Weve already seen a shrinking manufacturing sector for decades, and now further pressures on these jobs mean that the prospects are very grim. Were a country that has relied upon social mobility. We rely upon that not just for those going through school but afterwards, and that requires jobs for people who work with their hands outside of airconditioned offices. That means people who didnt get qualifications while young but still have the willingness to work hard and push ahead. Pressures on their employment levels in a situation like this are incredibly difficult, particularly for regional communities, like mine, that simply have a different spread of workforce than you will see in city electorates. In Groom we are heavily reliant on mining, manufacturing and transport. Were a place that does all the work that leaves you with dirt underneath your fingernails and calluses on your hands. These are exactly the jobs that are being put at risk when you put the wrong policy settings in place. Without a key focus, without a policy direction that addresses productivity, the Australian people are being left in the lurch. There is little hope on the horizon that we see from the government, with its continued drive towards regressive IR legislation that puts the Fair Work Commission between the employer and the employee. I think thats probably one of the hardest pills to swallow. Weve come to accept that enterprise bargaining was a vehicle whereby agreements could be made between employers and those in the workplace directly, but under this government we have seen continued moves to push the Fair Work Commission between those two groups. As weve seen in the Productivity Commission report, when you move away from individual contracts, you drive lower productivity. Of all the challenges this government faces, none are greater than returning our productivity to prepandemic levels. Unfortunately, where we stand today is that, even if we are, as the RBA governor optimistically puts, capable of normalising productivity levels, the new norm with the policy settings that we now see in place is lower than what the norm was previously—be it in skills, where we see fewer apprenticeships and traineeships, or be it in investment, where we see lower investment in new technologies. We see taxation policy and IR reform that depowers individuals. The forecast for productivity growth is grim.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20232024, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 20232024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HAMILTON (Groom) ","(17:44):"
448,0,0,0,1,2,"Chester, Darren MP","IPZ","Gippsland","NATS","N/A",969," I rise to speak in relation to the wild storms which have caused enormous damage and had a huge impact on my home state of Victoria over the past 24 hours. Deputy Speaker Chesters, I know you, as a regional member, are well aware of the impact of these storms right across our regional communities. Firstly, I do want to acknowledge the tragic loss of life which has occurred in Mirboo North, with the death of a local farmer as a result of the storms. For those members in this place whose communities are still facing danger right now, I pass on my enormous sympathies, and my thoughts are with you. Obviously, there are bushfires still active in the communities surrounding the seats of Wannon and Mallee, bordering the seat of Ballarat and also near Bendigo. I want to acknowledge that we have lost a life already, as well as to appeal to those people now involved in the cleanup—householders and residents—to please take care. The cleanup after these major storm events is often as dangerous as the storm itself. There have been many occasions in the past where trees have fallen on people who have been involved in the cleanup activities, so please take care as you undertake that cleanup work.  In that same vein, I need to acknowledge the extraordinary effort of our emergency services crews, our volunteers from groups like the SES and the CFA, the professional crews, the shire contractors, the shire workers themselves, people involved in the cleanup activities, and the crews that are out there right now trying to restore power and telecommunications networks across the state. These people are out there doing an incredible job, working against the clock in cleaning up after natures ferocious storm swept across our state. Its worth reflecting that we got to this point as a direct result of large transmission lines coming down, which tripped four units at Loy Yang in my electorate of Gippsland and forced load shedding and disruption to power across hundreds of thousands of homes. As we stand here tonight, there are still thousands of Victorians experiencing another night without power and with unreliable communications. Its also worth reflecting that the Loy Yang Power Station is still an incredibly important part of the energy mix in my home state of Victoria. In fact, we still receive in Victoria in the order of 60 per cent of our generating capacity from a browncoalfired power station in Latrobe Valley. Its an incredibly important part of the energy mix in my home state. In the light of this storm event, its inevitable therell be conversations about energy security and reliability. I am concerned that there is a reckless rush to transition to renewable energy at the expense of reliable baseload energy. We need to make sure we get the balance right. By no means am I someone who doesnt believe in the importance of renewable energy, but I also understand you need to have a reliable and affordable source of energy for households, for families trying to meet their family budget, and for business and industry and manufacturing. They need a reliable and affordable source of energy. Weve got to learn some lessons from storm events like this. The conversation now in large parts of regional Australia is becoming quite heated around the transmission lines associated with establishing new renewable energy locations. Part of that conversation is around the fact that there is no plan whatsoever to put those transmission lines underground. The very cause of this dramatic disruption to Victoria today has been the major failure of transmission lines causing the Loy Yang units to trip and disrupting power supplies right across the state. We need to have this conversation about undergrounding transmission lines. It was one of the recommendations of the Black Saturday bushfire royal commission. We understand as regional people that quite often bushfires are starting as a result of powerlines being disrupted, sparking and causing fires, which then spread and cause enormous damage, including loss of life. Theres a huge logistical challenge on right now right across parts of my electorate of Gippsland to simply restore power because of the damage caused by trees falling over powerlines and the disruption that is then causing the community. This disruption is something that people need to think about. People need to think about how these disruptions occur. When the power goes out you can no longer operate the petrol bowser, so fuel becomes a problem in some of my towns. When the power goes out, the EFTPOS machines arent working either because the telecommunications network is compromised, so people who dont have cash are having trouble doing transactions. When the power goes out, you have issues at supermarkets with a rush on food. When the power goes out, householders with food in the fridge or food in the freezer start to worry about the wastage. These are all important considerations with an event like this. I do wish the crews all the luck in the world as they go about trying to reestablish power to vast numbers of impacted communities, which are almost inevitably some of the most remote locations and smaller country towns in Victoria. I know for a fact that there are towns and communities in my electorate right now who dont even have access to triple 0. If there were an emergency, they wouldnt be able to call triple 0 to get some help. So I appeal to people in my community who may be listening on the radio or something else to make sure you check in on your friends and family. Do a welfare check on those in your neighbourhood to make sure that theyre okay. Check on your friends at this difficult time. We are very dependent on our telecommunications. Some will have battery backup; others wont. Theyre supplying generators to try and restore the power. But, without the energy being provided to those telecommunications towers, a whole range of other impacts are felt throughout the community, and there are still thousands of Victorians, thousands of Gippslanders, who are without power tonight. On the bright side, Deputy Speaker Wilkie, as you well know, regional people are practical, resilient people. Weve been through very similar events in the past, and most people have a bit of a backup plan. But there are some lessons here for the Victorian government to learn. Whose stupid idea was it to introduce a ban on gas connections to new households in Victoria? What a spectacularly stupid idea by the environment minister. Right now in Gippsland, with no power, people are using their gas stoves. Theyve got an alternative source of energy. But in the future, if there are no gas cooktops in these houses, when theres no power, what will people do? Weve got to plan a more resilient system. Its complete madness for the Victorian minister to be banning gas connections to new households in Victoria and making people dependent on only one form of energy. Those on this side of the House are determined to play a practical role in the energy debate in this country. We understand how important a reliable and affordable source of energy is not just for Victoria but for every state. What we saw yesterday in Victoria, ironically, was that there was plenty of wind around, but there was too much wind, so the wind turbines didnt work. Wind turbines simply dont work when you exceed the specifications. Again, having a weather dependent form of energy in the future, without the reliability of the baseload supply from other sources such as coal or gas, is complete economic and, I would say, social madness which will cause enormous problems, going forward. I will give you an example from a friend of mine I was just talking to tonight. Hed dropped into one of the hardware stores and he reported to me—what a surprise—theyd sold out of generators. People have been down there today buying generators. Theyve sold out of any camping gas cookers. Again, people are preparing to be without power for an extended period of time. The staff at the hardware store were showing customers around by torchlight, and they were giving them handwritten receipts and writing down the details of their credit cards. People without cash were still able to buy things, and I thank the hardware store operators for doing that to allow the economy to still function. But at some point theyre going to have to reconcile all those purchases. Handwritten receipts will have to do for now. I think were finding cash is king in Gippsland right now. A lot of people are relying now on cash to make even the most basic purchases. So we do need a resilient system when it comes to energy. The events in Victoria over the last 24 hours have certainly exposed some of the fragilities of—and perhaps shown a lot of us to not take for granted—the systems we have in place, because, when they go down, it becomes very difficult for our community to function. Weve got to have this debate without the zealotry. Just forget about the zealotry. There are people at the extremes of the debate on both sides. Forget the zealots. Work out practical systems that are reliable and affordable for the Australian community. Speaking of zealotry, I want to use my remaining time in the debate tonight to reflect a little bit on the native hardwood timber industry in the state of Victoria, or the former native hardwood timber industry in the state of Victoria. The decision made by the Andrews government and endorsed by the Allan government was based on science—political science. There wasnt an ounce of environmental science behind the decision to ban the harvesting of all native hardwood timber in my home state of Victoria. Deputy Speaker Wilkie, your home state of Tasmania has a third of the timber available to it that Victoria has—a third. Victorias got three times as much timber on public land. There are now logs being harvested in Tasmania, floated across Bass Strait, processed in Victoria into highvalue products and sold into the Melbourne market. So supply is still being met. Demand is still there for this product, but it is complete environmental madness to think that Victoria taking timber from other places is the best way to manage our future demand for hardwood timber in my home state. When it comes to timber, there are two choices: you use your own wood or you use someone elses. The Victorian government, in an act of complete political bastardry, shut down the entire industry in six months and committed Victoria to just taking wood from other places. Now Victoria brings in timber from Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland, and our net imports of timber vastly exceed our exports. We are just taking timber now from countries with lower environmental protocols and selling it off in the Melbourne market. Right now there is a very impressive project in the heart of Melbourne: the St Kilda Pier. It is a beautiful project, a great project, a multimillion dollar project. The timber for that project is coming from North Queensland and the Northern Territory. It is madness to think that a state with three times the timber resources of Tasmania will not be using any of the hardwood timber on public land into the future. Im sure that at some point in the future reality will strike and a new government with half a brain in its head will work out a policy that allows the hardwood timber industry to be restored, but who in the private sector is going to invest in that industry, going forward, with the risk of a state government potentially shutting them down again? Who is going to put the money up? The big issue is not only the loss of jobs, which is significant enough. Its not only the fact that were now raiding other countries and other states for our timber supply. The other big loss is the very people I talked about in my first comments here today: the volunteers at the CFA and the SES—the people out there with chainsaws, clearing roads to get access to properties. These are people with practical bush skills. When they lose their jobs, they dont stay around. Theyve got no reason to stay around. If theres no job for them anymore, these people with practical bush skills will leave my community. Were already seeing that. People with skills in the bush, people who can use heavy equipment, people who have knowledge and understanding of how the forest can be managed—theyre going to leave, and they are leaving, because there are no jobs for them in the hardwood timber industry. Particularly in times of emergency, you cant replace them with someone who just jumps in a bulldozer once or twice a year over summer to clear a firebreak. We find that, during emergency situations, the contractors who work in the timber industry are the ones who have the skills to keep our communities safe. They have the practical bush skills. They know how to use the harvest equipment and the bulldozers—the large equipment—to keep our communities safe. Those people wont be there anymore. Those are the social, economic and environmental consequences of a political decision to shut down the hardwood timber industry for one reason only: Greens preferences in the city. There is no science to justify shutting down the entire hardwood timber industry in Victoria, only political science. It was all about gutless Labor MPs in my home state of Victoria not having the courage to stand up for bluecollar workers. Not one of them in the federal or state parliament lower house had the guts to stand up for bluecollar workers, because theyve sold their souls for Greens preferences. That has been the most appalling decision Ive seen a government make in my 15 years as a member of parliament. There is no logic behind it, and were seeing massive social and economic disruption in my community of Gippsland. The environmental consequences of a poorly maintained natural bush reserve in the future will be felt by all of us. Leaving the bush unattended and unmanaged is a recipe for disaster. All of the bushfires which occurred in the Black Summer in my community started on public land. They all started by natural causes—lightning—when the bush was dry after a long season of drought weather. Its poorly managed public land that is the worst neighbour to have if youre living in a community in Gippsland. If they dont have resources on the ground to do that practical work, my communities are put at greater risk. I say as a matter of philosophy and a matter of principle that, if my community is expected to be the custodian of a vast public land estate, it should get jobs associated with managing that public land estate, whether its through a sustainable and worldclass timber industry or natural resource management activities to keep our communities safe. I thank the House.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20232024, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 20232024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CHESTER (Gippsland) ","(17:59):"

We already know the answer. It will never happen under the Albanese Labor government, after they axed funding for local infrastructure projects right across the board in my community and right throughout Western Sydney. Mulgoa Roads next upgrade was going to widen lanes at three key junctions to provide muchneeded traffic relief. The government doesnt care about Glenmore Park mums and dads getting home sooner and safer. The government doesnt care about Regentville seniors who need help to take their grandkids to and from footy training during peak hour or to pick them up from school. And they certainly dont care about Penrith parents jumping off the M4 to get home to make dinner for their family. This government doesnt care about seniors in Jamisontown who might miss important doctor appointments because of the enormous amount of traffic, continual traffic, on Mulgoa Road.  Over $200 million for Mulgoa Road is only a fraction of the damage the Labor government is doing to my part of Western Sydney by not delivering on infrastructure commitments. In fact, there are over $5 billion of funds promised by this government in the midyear budget of October 2022 for needed infrastructure and transport projects, for the futureproofing of the growth of Western Sydney, that have just gone—$5 billion cut from Western Sydney infrastructure.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20232024, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 20232024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs McINTOSH (Lindsay) ","(18:14):"

The community of Luddenham are crying out for information and support from the Labor government, the infrastructure minister and the infrastructure department. Rather than help one of the most impacted communities adjacent to Western Sydney airport, the Labor infrastructure minister cut planning funding to upgrade Luddenham Road, which would have helped freight and nearby locals get around the airport. Unbelievably, the infrastructure minister cut funding for the M7M12 interchange. But—wait for this—this road wasnt in planning; this road had already started. Theyve cut the funding, and the Commonwealth are no longer involved in a major project that had already started.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20232024, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 20232024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

453,0,0,0,1,2,"MemberContinuation",281513,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mrs McINTOSH: Thats Western Sydney, New South Wales—the forgotten region, according to this Labor government. The project would have seen the M7 widened, and, importantly, would have connected the new M12 and assisted with links to the airport. This is not a tiny little local airport; this is an international airport of significance for our whole country.  Where are the tens of millions of dollars with which we were going to upgrade our community car parks in St Marys and Kingswood, in this growing Western Sydney? Theyve been cut. St Marys has a heavy rail train which is over capacity daily, and St Marys is also going to get a new metro site; its the key link between Sydney and Western Sydney airport. The community surrounding St Marys is growing, yet the government has decided to cut its car park. How do the locals get to and from the airport in a growing populated area? Penrith City Council had already spent funds in planning for this car park, and, likewise with Kingswood, the Labor government has cut funding for their car park as well. We also had planning money for Werrington Arterial stage 2 slashed. The planning was going to look at ways the road corridor would be improved and deal with congestion, with locals going to and from St Marys and Marsden Park and working hubs in the little business hubs around that area. It would have reviewed links to Werrington Road and the Great Western Highway for upgrades. The community around that area have for years been saying they desperately need this upgrade. It would have helped the constant logjam being faced by those living in Cambridge Gardens, Cambridge Park, Werrington, Werrington County, Werrington Downs and along Dunheved Road. This is a vital corridor in the heart of my Lindsay electorate. At the 2019 election, I secured over $60 million funding to upgrade this Penrith City Council road. Throughout the last period of government I was able to double the commitment and get the full amount, $127 million, for the full upgrade of the road, because the state government didnt chip in. Unfortunately, the Labor Party, desperate for votes in Lindsay at the last election, promised that when in government they would fasttrack the development of Dunheved Road and its upgrade. They even allotted funds to this during the election campaign. But here we are, in 2024, waiting for construction to begin. Penrith City Council officials told me that the road could not be fasttracked, so, again, this was just another Labor lie. The community desperately needs the upgrade of Dunheved Road to begin. It was 2019 when they secured the funds. The funds are there; the building just has to start. Labor coming in and making a promise that they knew they couldnt stick to was real desperation. It was really sad for my community. Its a pity that the Albanese government just doesnt care enough about Western Sydney to really invest, as opposed to stripping away funds from our growing community. Western Sydney represents the Australian dream, where you can get a house with enough space for a growing family. It is a beautiful place to live, in my part of the world. New homes continue to pop up to support the many young people and our newest citizens to take part in the Australian dream. It is so unfortunate that these Aussies are being let down by the Albanese Labor government. The need for more infrastructure is just going to grow. Cutting more than $5 billion will hinder how long it will take to get to job sites in the morning for our tradies. It will impact how long it will take for Penrith residents to get to work in the Penrith CBD—or beyond, to Parramatta and the city—and our new aerotropolis, which is only a couple of years away. It will impact the whole of Western Sydney and the way people travel across the region for kids sport on the weekend—for those who can afford to still go, which brings me to my next point about the costofliving crisis that is impacting so many families. You just have to step out onto the streets of my electorate for somebody to come up and speak with you about how hard it is out there right now with groceries, petrol, mortgage and rents. Grocery increases are causing Foodbank services in Lindsay to more than double their regular distribution. I know this is a common story right now, right across our country, but we should not be getting used to this story. It is dire out there. We need to be doing something about it. We need to be doing something about it? The Labor government needs to be doing something about it, because they have the levers and the mechanisms to make change. There are dualincome families lining up at the Penrith Community Kitchen and Mama Lanas—extraordinary local community groups who do so much for people in need. I know my Nationals and regional Liberal colleagues have been talking about the impact of the Labor governments remodelling of the fresh food tax and water changes causing issues in the market. Lets take the agriculture ministers rejig of the Biosecurity Protection Levy. That will cause Aussie farmers to have to pay more, for the biosecurity costs of international importers. This will impact everyone. The farmers in the semirural parts of my electorate—whether in Luddenham, Londonderry or Agnes Banks—will not be happy with this next hit on them from Labor. Were building an airport in Western Sydney to make it easier for local Western Sydney producers to get their products to the world. It could be extraordinary, yet locals will be slugged with these costs. Then theyll be passed on to the consumers, who are already struggling to pay for their groceries. This is more nonsensical Labor Party ideology impacting Aussies and impacting our local small businesses. Again, we have the truckies being taxed, which is impacting the many, many local truckies in my electorate. Does the Labor government understand that these added costs on businesses which provide our food and deliver essential products are part of what is fuelling this costofliving crisis? The Assistant Treasurer, in his second reading speech, had the audacity to proclaim a surplus that this government is responsible for and that Australians should be so grateful for what is being done for us. The previous government started the immense budgetary repairs this nation needed. That was the coalition government. Then we were hit with a onceinalifetime pandemic. Those opposite seem to forget this. The interest rate increases have slammed Western Sydney families. 60 Minutes aired locals who are now facing pressures on weekend sport and their kids going to school. They are having to cut back. It is having a real impact on young people as well. A mother from Londonderry who is so financially stressed wrote to me saying shes thinking of selling up and moving to the bush because Western Sydney is no longer affordable. Rental pressures are hitting lowincome earners and young people right across Lindsay, including in St Marys. What about the $275 reduction in energy bill costs? That seems to have been forgotten by everyone in the Albanese Labor government. It certainly has not been forgotten by people in my community of Lindsay. Over half of the Lindsay community travel to work by car. This is higher than the New South Wales average and is due to a lack of public transport options and the nature of work. Again, it is extraordinary that infrastructure such as roads and also commuter car parks is being cut. These car users include people like tradies that need to get to work and build those homes for the growing population in Western Sydney, people who are working from home. We have a hospital in my electorate which is one of the biggest employers. People are travelling there as well. There are teachers, nurses and people working at our local university. These infrastructure cuts, these promises and inflation impacting on the family budget are all issues the government actually has the levers to address. They just arent. Why arent they doing it? Why arent they trying to help people in my community? I think the fact is the Albanese Labor government simply doesnt care.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20232024, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 20232024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[7]","N/A","N/A"

455,0,0,0,1,2,"Coulton, Mark Maclean MP","HWN","Parkes","NATS","N/A",974," I rise tonight to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024 and express my concern about how the Albanese Labor government seems to have abandoned regional Australia and particularly my electorate in a whole range of ways. In some ways, I cant believe its on purpose. I think its out of just a lack of understanding and ignorance about how things work.  One little program I was particularly proud of and that I was involved in way back in 2013 was the Stronger Communities Program. Any member would know the benefit of those small grants—$150,000 per electorate. Those small grants that went to sporting clubs, service clubs and the like were so well received. It wasnt a lot of money, but in a small rural community it can free up a committee to actually do what they would like to do, whether its coach a footy team or look after a local community service club. It does help them not having to raise those funds. Thats been abandoned. The Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program was a great boon to communities through local government. It now no longer exists. If you drive right around Australia, including in my electorate, you can see fantastic projects that were funded under this scheme. Its gone. On the program that is particularly close to my heart, Inland Rail, the minister has been completely incompetent. The minister commissioned Kerry Schott to do a review. The Schott report was critical of some aspects, largely at the management level and the board level. The Schott review clearly reinforced the business case—the need for the Inland Rail—and the importance of it going from Melbourne to Brisbane. For those who might not understand, the Inland Rail is an intermodal capital city link. Its designed to take the pressure off the highway system for that citytocity freight that goes up and down—the truck that goes up and down the Newell Highway in my electorate every 70 seconds. The Inland Rail would save millions of tonnes of carbon. Its very efficient. One train would replace 150 trucks. Thats the business case, from the outskirts of Melbourne to the outskirts of Brisbane. Whats particularly exciting for my electorate, though, is it then gives a highcapacity, highquality railway line for my exporters to send grain, cotton or other produce to port. At the moment, the link that the previous government funded, that connects the parts of the Inland Rail that are completed to the port of Newcastle, has already been a great boon to the grain growers in my electorate. There is a bit of misunderstanding about Brisbane. Theres this thought that therell be no connection to the port of Brisbane and that there will be difficulty around that. But, once the Inland Rail gets to a point—and I think the current government might be looking at Ebenezer—with that link that would go from there to the Brisbane to Sydney line, there already is a standard gauge connection to the port of Brisbane. You cant doublestack grain or cotton or minerals, for that matter. So that connection will already be there. For the minister to basically put on hold the project north of Narromine has created great uncertainty. There has been the removal of the funding for the grade separations that local councils fought so hard for. The one in Moree in particular was actually part of the original funding for Inland Rail, so it wasnt additional infrastructure spending that they could remove, but they did. The grade separation and the bridge that would cross the Newell Highway and the Inland Rail to the special activation precinct that is going to be built at Moree was a vital part of infrastructure that would eventually lead to a heavy vehicle ring road around Moree. In communities right through my electorate, there has been enormous commitment. Whether it is Moree council, Narrabri, Gilgandra or Narromine, they have all put in an enormous effort and an enormous amount of resources to get to this point. Now theyre being told that its going to be pushed back to 2027. Its just not acceptable. Youve got to understand that, on the strength of the announcements that Inland Rail was to be constructed, people have invested in trucks and earthmoving equipment. A large number of Indigenous people in Moree undertook training and were working very, very hard and very successfully on the completed Narrabri to North Star stage 1 section. Theyve all just been put on ice. Theyve gone from employment back onto unemployment because of this break in the progress. So I call on the government to get that project going again because, if it loses momentum, the possibility of doing this project in a timely manner just gets harder and harder. Sadly, despite my efforts and my offer to help—because I have an understanding of this project—the only interaction Ive had from the government was when they tried to get me charged with trespass because I had the temerity to have a photograph taken on a level crossing near a railway line. Thats the smallmindedness that we have to deal with. Ill go to health and the changes to the distribution priority areas. For those who dont know, the DPA, or distribution priority area, program encouraged overseas trained doctors in particular, as part of their obligation, to go to a regional area. And it worked quite successfully. The first thing this government did was to open up distribution priority areas to periurban and large regional areas. The week that that was announced, Western Health—an area with small western towns—lost six doctors to places like Wollongong, Geelong and Newcastle, because there was no financial reason for those doctors to stay there. That has had an enormous impact on the health delivery for my town. Ive got to point out that the Parkes electorate is just under half of New South Wales. It has the secondhighest Indigenous population, percentagewise, of any electorate in this House. My frustration is that there has been a lot of discussion from this government about helping the livelihood and welfare of Aboriginal people; at the same time, theyre taking away all the projects, all the programs and all the funding that employ these people: Inland Rail; removing doctors through LRCI; taking 450 extra gigalitres of water from the MurrayDarling Basin—that production water. Who do you think is employed by that? What would be the biggest employer in a town like Moree? Its the irrigation industry. Who works in that industry? Aboriginal people. Its absolutely scandalous—not to mention the corporates. We have bank CEOs who wont work on Australia Day to show their affinity with Aboriginal people, while they close the branches at Lake Cargelligo, Warren, Gilgandra, Moree and Gunnedah. Whos impacted by that? Aboriginal people—particularly older people, who would struggle with the technology to go online. So the duplicity and double standards coming out of here, with ideology, pontificating about their greatness, while absolutely gutting the very people they say they represent, is scandalous. There are the changes to aged care. With the best of intentions—and I dont want to have a crack at Minister Wells, because shes been personally quite helpful with some of the issues Ive got—these issues have been caused by the changes to have 24/7 registered nurses in country agedcare facilities. So these facilities struggle with compliance. Theyre paying exorbitant wages for agency nurses to flyin flyout at towns like Broken Hill and Cobar. Last week in Broken Hill, in an effort to free up critical care beds, Far West health told 19 frail aged people that they had to move. I spoke to a person whose father has been told he has to go to Balranald, 450 kilometres away. He has dementia. His wife has dementia. They cant live at home; they cant live unsupervised. So here you have these people whove been together all their lives, and, for the last years or months of their lives, theyre 450 kilometres apart! This is what happens when you have government policy that doesnt understand regional Australia—not to mention the attacks we saw on community pharmacy. Hopefully, weve seen some sanity come back. There was the divisive nature of the Voice campaign. As I said, Ive got the secondhighest percentage of Aboriginal people in my electorate. They voted 80 per cent no. The Aboriginal people of Wilcannia, Bourke, Brewarrina, Moree—towns with very, very high Indigenous populations—said: No. We want to manage our own affairs. We dont want another bureaucracy in Canberra. We just want to be like everyone else. In here, once again, I was accused of racism and all sorts of things. The Aboriginal people in my electorate are people. They have the same issues as everyone else. They want to educate their kids. They want to be able to see a doctor. They want to have somewhere for their parents to go when they cant look after themselves. They want a job. It got caught up in this ridiculous debate that absolutely divided families in my electorate. On the water buybacks—water is life in my electorate. This is such an ideologically driven thing, because the 450 extra gigalitres wasnt part of the Basin Plan. One of the advantages of being in this place for a while is that you get a bit of a memory for whats gone on. The extra 450 gigs wasnt part of the Basin Plan. It wasnt part of the plan that was agreed upon in a bipartisan way. It wasnt part of the plan I voted on. It was a political fix for Senate votes in South Australia cooked up by Julia Gillard and the current Leader of the House, Tony Burke, in the leadup to the 2013 election. It cant be delivered, but, basically, that water has now been removed. If you want to know what happens when water is removed from a community, I welcome anyone to come and visit me in Collarenebri. When Minister Wong purchased the water from Collymongle station, the biggest and probably only employer in the district closed down, and we went from being a prosperous community to being a welfare town. Its a frustration—it really is a frustration. With the benefit of doubt, I dont think the Labor government is deliberately trying to attack my electorate, but inadvertently, through their lack of understanding and ignorance on every level that youd like to mention, the people of my electorate are copping it. Theyre starting to come up to me in great despair. I havent even touched on the IR laws, where some of the larger farms will need to have a union organiser. They are going to be trying to take over the shearing industry, which has prospered since the AWU declined. I could go on for much longer. I am terribly concerned. The sooner this government either wakes up to itself or moves on and lets someone that knows regional Australia come in and run the country, the better.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20232024, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 20232024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr COULTON (Parkes—Chief Nationals Whip) ","(18:27):"
456,0,0,0,1,2,"Violi, Aaron MP",300147,"Casey","LP","N/A",976," Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024 is an important bill to speak on. Spending money is one of the core functions of government, and how they do that has ramifications and significant impacts. We also know that, despite the size of the budget, how we spend it is crucial. We dont have unlimited resources.  So its interesting that, today of all days, we look at government spending. We saw their announcement earlier today of about $14 million for food banks. That is important money. Im lucky to have a lot of great food banks that Ive been able to visit in my community. They play a crucial role and, unfortunately, are needed more than ever. I often think about the Mustard Tree Op Shop & Cafe in Lilydale. I visited them in May last year—it was quite a few months ago that I visited them. They have been in Lilydale for over 30 years. May last year was the biggest month on record for them for demand. It has only gotten worse since. I have been out there since May, and it has gotten worse since. But it is interesting that, at the same time as this government has committed $14 million to food banks, we hear in Senate estimates that it has committed $40 million of taxpayer money to sell its broken promise on the stage 3 tax cuts. We have $14 million for food banks in a costofliving crisis, and we have $40 million of taxpayer money, as the Minister for Finance said in Senate estimates, to sell their broken promise for the stage 3 tax cuts. That example really shows everything that is wrong with the priorities of the Albanese government. Its why, after 20 months of the Albanese government, Australians are struggling so much with this costofliving crisis. There is a focus—a $40 million focus, as we found out today—on spin, optics and looking like theyre doing something, but there is only a $14 million focus, which is a lot less, on actually giving money to food banks to make a tangible difference in my community and every community across the country. I think about $14 million, and that wont go very far across the country; it is very much a token effort. It is better than nothing—a bit like the stage 3 tax cuts of $15 a week in five months time—but not enough and not soon enough. These are some of the challenges that were facing, and a lot of the challenges we face are due to the decisions that have been made by the government. Government spending has a direct impact on inflation and on interest rates. If a government spends more, that drives up demand, drives up inflation and forces the RBA governor to increase interest rates. Weve seen that, with 12 increases in interest rates since this government was elected. We talk about government spending, and we see the MYEFO reports that show the Labor government has spent, in the last 18 months, about $209 billion more than the coalition committed in its last budget. Thats before we include the $45 billion in offbudget spending thats not part of that $209 billion; thats a cheap little accounting trick by the Treasurer to spend money but not put it in the budget. The reality in the real world and in an economy is: whether its on budget or off budget, it still drives demand, still drives inflation and still forces the RBA governor to increase interest rates. As economist Chris Richardson said recently in the AFR: The rough tradeoff is that interest rates would be a quarter of a percentage point lower than theyd otherwise have been if the government cut spending by about $6 billion over the coming year or if it raised taxes by about $9 billion … to leave the RBA (and hence borrowers) bearing the brunt of the inflation fight, as it allows the government to blame someone else for the pain that many are feeling. As the new Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock, said in November last year: … the remaining inflation challenge … is increasingly homegrown and demand driven.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20232024, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 20232024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VIOLI (Casey) ","(18:42):"

She wont say it because she cant, and I understand and respect that, but you see $209 billion of spending and $45 billion in offbudget spending—that drives a lot of demand and a lot of homegrown demand. We can join the dots there on the RBA governors words.  She also said: While labour costs are a big part of the increase, huge increases in the cost of energy, rent, and insurance are all keeping inflation higher for longer. In the September inflation report, energy (utilities) prices increased more than 12% yearonyear and insurance premia increased more than 8% yearonyear. A 12 per cent yearonyear increase in energy prices—well, that $275 reduction in power bills is well gone. We know why the Prime Minister was happy to make that commitment 97 times, I think it was, before the election and not one time after. The Australian people know prices are not coming down; theyre going up. This is what happens: you spend more, you dont actually have a plan to address cost of living, you commit $40 million to sell a plan of $15 a week in five months, and you give $14 million to food banks. When your priorities are wrong, it makes it harder and harder for the Australian people. An Australian who was on $55,000 when Labor came to government has seen their real buying power decrease by almost $4,000 because of the $209 billion in additional spending plus the $45 billion off budget. Its driving inflation and driving costs up. Those opposite like to say: Weve delivered a surplus. Weve delivered a surplus, and thats solved all the problems. Theres a problem with a surplus: theres a headline, but there are two sides to how a budget surplus is delivered. There are increases in revenue, and there are decreases in spending. If the revenue was increasing, but the spending is also going up, even though its not going up as much, it still drives inflation. The Treasurer likes to take credit for the surplus, but what he doesnt talk about is whats driving that surplus. The reality is that, as the budget papers confirm, its increased revenues coming in. Its soaring iron ore and coal exports that are delivering the trade surplus. Its commodity prices that are helping to deliver that $4 billion surplus. As EYs chief economist, Cherelle Murphy, commented last year in May about the budget: The $36.9 billion deficit projection for 202223 was revised to a modest $4.2 billion surplus … through a combination of higher company and personal income tax receipts and conservative commodity price forecasts. The surplus projection ends there, as positive cyclical forces fade and the economy slows. The position of the Budget is expected to worsen after 202425 as tax receipts moderate, along with spending pressures across the forward estimates. Weve seen that those tax receipts have increased, and thats why were likely to get another surplus this year. Dr Steven Kennedy, Secretary to the Treasury, has flagged in Senate estimates this week that the higher than assumed commodity prices are going to continue to increase government revenue. Hes said that there are further upside risks to the tax receipts. He went on to say, Over the fouryear forward estimates period, there was a $39.5 billion improvement, driven by soaring personal income taxes and company taxes. That is the detail that matters when we talk about a surplus in a high inflation environment. It is whether youre bringing demand out of the economy or whether youre continuing to feed demand into the economy. The Treasurer can stand in the House at question time and talk about a surplus, but its not actually bringing inflation down because inflation is being driven by higher receipts on tax—your personal tax. The little trick this government played is that theyre happy to change stage 3, but they dont talk about how they let the low and middleincome tax offset lapse last year—the $1,500. Many people in my community and across the country in July and August last year were desperate for a tax return because the cost of living is so tough. When they put their tax return in, they were disappointed. They were disappointed because the $1,500 that theyd received in the previous years was no longer there. What had happened is the government made the decision to let the low and middleincome tax offset lapse, which is fine. We didnt talk about it, because that was part of stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 of the tax cut package that they voted for in 2019.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20232024, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 20232024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[10]","N/A","N/A"

So theyre prepared to change the legislation to give the Australian people $15 a week extra in five months, but this government wasnt prepared to change the legislation last year to give the Australian people $1,500 straightaway in July or August when they did their tax return, when they needed it.  This is what the Australian people know: everything has gone up under this government, despite the promises of the Prime Minister during the campaign. Food has gone up more than nine per cent. Housing has gone up more than 12 per cent. Electricity is up by 23 per cent, despite that promise to reduce bills by $275. Gas has gone up by more than 29 per cent, and every resident in Casey knows this when they get their bills or go to the grocery store. Energy and gas in particular are important because they hit the Australian people in two ways. They hit you when the bill comes in, but they hit you every time you go to the grocery store. I worked in food manufacturing for many years prior to this role, and energy was one of the largest costs in manufacturing our food. It wasnt just our largest cost; it was one of the largest costs in the materials that we bought. When you go into the supermarket, you need to understand that the food manufacturer is being hit with increased costs. Im not going to defend Woolworths and Coles, but theyve been hit with increased costs. Those coolrooms and distribution centres they have are incurring increased costs. And it goes further back. Take corn chips as an example. The farmer that grows that corn is being hit with increased cost, and this all gets passed along the line so, when you get to the supermarket, you get groceries at a higher price. Thats the reality. That is why it is so important that you bring energy prices down: because it affects the whole community. Thats not even to talk about the community groups that are impacted: those sporting clubs, charities, food banks that have to pay those higher energy prices. This is what weve seen. The Prime Minister himself admitted at the National Press Club that their policies arent working and they dont have the costofliving crisis under control. Thats why he made the decision to break his word that he committed a hundred times to the Australian people. Thats been the big change. The war in Russia and Ukraine was many years ago. It was there when he made these promises. What has changed is that this government doesnt have any solutions for the Australian people. Everyone knows that. They know it when they put the petrol in their car. They know it when they have to pay for the supplies for their childrens education, when they go to the grocery store, when their rates come in from council, when their rent is higher than last year and when their mortgage has gone up 12 times in the last 18 months.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20232024, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 20232024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[21]","N/A","N/A"

I thank them for their contribution and I sympathise with his confusion. Its very difficult for the member for Casey and all other members of the coalition to grasp the fact that we would deliver a surplus but not deliver coffee cups advertising the surplus! Were more focused on substance than the marketing.  But genuinely Id like to thank all members whove contributed to the debate on the additional estimates appropriation bills 202324. Sometimes lost in the fog of the parliamentary debate is the fact that these bills are actually seeking authority from the parliament for additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the remainder of 202324, an important purpose. Passage of the bills will ensure continuity of government programs, which Im sure is something that all members of this place are concerned about, and provide for the commencement of new activities agreed by the government since the 202324 budget. I outlined those in the introductory speech on these bills in the House. They will also ensure the Commonwealths ability to meet its obligations for the remainder of this financial year as they fall due. In introducing the bills, the government has already highlighted some of the more significant items provided for in these bills. The total appropriation sought through the bills is approximately $11 billion. I once again genuinely thank the honourable members of the House who have contributed to the debate. With those brief concluding comments, I commend the bills to the House.","Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20232024, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20232024, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 20232024","BILLS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JONES (Whitlam—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services) ","(18:57):"

When we look at this years Closing the gap report, we see that only four targets are on track. This does reinforce for all of us how much work still needs to be done.  The Closing the gap report tells us that, when it comes to advancing the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, were not where we should be. Were not where many Australians would want us to be, and our government knows this. We know that, in order to see improvement, we have to work in new ways. Australians do want us to close the gap. They do want Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to lead good lives and to have the same opportunities and life expectancy that the rest of our community has. The reality is that there is much work still to do. As a government we are not daunted by it, but we do recognise that this will require focus and determination from us—and focus and determination on working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who know whats best in their communities. We have seen time and time again that the approach of governments dictating how outcomes should be achieved has not got us the results we should have. Its not always easy for governments—particularly national governments—to take the approach of allowing things to be locally led but, certainly, when it comes to how we close the gap, its an approach that we must take. Yesterday we marked 16 years since the National Apology to the Stolen Generations. I went along with many members to the breakfast that was held here to commemorate that anniversary. It was a privilege to be in the room with many members of the stolen generation as well as many outstanding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders and members of the community—a number of leaders who have held leadership positions for so long and worked so hard for so long but also a number of younger Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who are picking up the baton and working in their communities and across this country for better outcomes. I was so struck by the strength and resilience in that room. There was no despair. There were asks of government. There were people holding government to account. But there was no despair. It was so impressive to see those people, both members of the stolen generation and their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leadership, coming together with those of us here in the parliament to both mark that occasion and talk about what comes next, to make sure we do know and understand the stories of members of the stolen generation and that we are reminded of the failures of governments over many decades and to strengthen our resolve to continue to enact change. As the Prime Minister said, the people there showed that when we have an honest reckoning of the past we give ourselves a better future. It was also a reminder, I think, that that apology wasnt a foregone conclusion. That apology happened because good people made it happen. It was the work of decades of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people calling for that moment of healing. It was the work of a new Labor government led by Prime Minister Rudd and the then minister for Indigenous affairs, my predecessor as the member Jagajaga, Jenny Macklin. That moment changed our nation. It was a moment of healing. Marking the anniversary yesterday felt particularly important given the result of the referendum last year. As the Prime Minister said, our government absolutely accept the result of that referendum, but we know that it has been a very, very difficult result for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the country. In fact, it has been a very, very difficult result for a number of people who voted yes. I know in my community, where we did have a yes vote, people felt great sorrow after that result, and they wanted to know: What comes next? What do we do next to continue that healing in the country, to continue the work that absolutely must be done? I am pleased that yesterday the Prime Minister made two important announcements. The first of these was on the Remote Jobs and Economic Development Program. For too long the failed CDP has not delivered job opportunities for Aboriginal people, so this is a new jobs program providing people in remote communities with real jobs, proper wages and decent conditions. This includes, importantly, superannuation and leave. It has been developed by our government in partnership with First Nations people, funding 3,000 jobs over three years. This program is all about helping people in remote communities to get proper jobs, which will then help their communities grow stronger. Local and community organisations will be employing people across all regions where the Community Development Program had been in place. This is being complemented by our governments new $185 million Community Jobs and Business Fund, helping communities pay for projects that will create jobs under this remote jobs program. So a community could receive funding, for example, to establish or grow its own community controlled horticultural enterprise and employ local people, a winwin helping to support food security, generating economic opportunities and giving people skills and onthejob training and accreditation. You can see how this program can come together to offer so much to communities in a way that is led by them and by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Importantly, our government also announced the introduction of a new role, the National Commissioner for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children and Young People. This role will start later this year. Indigenous children are almost 11 times more likely to be in outofhome care than nonIndigenous children. That is simply not acceptable. It is a tragedy. We know that once a child is on that trajectory of outofhome care it is very hard for them to get their life back on track. So we all have a responsibility to do more about that. Thats why it is important that we will have this new commissioner role that will highlight this really important issue, a problem we have right across our country, and work with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians on evidence based programs and policy to advocate for and amplify the voices of First Nations children, those children in outofhome care who havent had that voice before, who have not been able to talk to policymakers about their experiences and what should happen next for them. This is so important if we want to see the next generation grow up and thrive, and of course we all want to see that. We do not want to see Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children on a trajectory that leads to lower life expectancy, that leads to worse outcomes across their lifetimes. We can do so much better than that in this country. I think this commissioner being in place is going to be very important, helping to address the disadvantage experienced by too many Indigenous children and families. I pay tribute to the national body, SNAICC; it spent a lot of time advocating this. I also pay tribute to the peaks, who have worked so hard on closing the gap and on working with government and community to find a new approach to closing the gap. The peaks and the Aboriginal controlled community organisations demonstrate to us that when we work in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people we get better results. We see it in our health system, where the NACCHOs, the Aboriginal community led health organisations, get the results that other mainstream services could only dream about. We see it in successful programs like the Indigenous Rangers Program—people working on country in a program that is culturally appropriate and that delivers results not just in terms of jobs but in terms of community and the environment. I have been in community and seen those rangers, and seen how respected they are for the work they do that connects them to country and provides that benefit to the community and the whole country. Thats the approach we have to take across the board—that approach of working in partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and finding solutions that work for them, that arent decided here in this place, that arent rolled out by people here in this place or people in Canberra—as excellent as some of those people must be! We need to do more; our government is really clear about that. We are focused on that. I am pleased with the work and the announcements that have come out of this years statement, and I look forward to being part of continuing to close the gap.","National Apology to the Stolen Generations: 16th Anniversary","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms THWAITES (Jagajaga) ","(19:02):"
466,0,0,0,1,2,"Georganas, Steve MP","DZY","Adelaide","ALP","N/A",980," I thank my very good friend the member for Riverina for allowing me to go before him, to accommodate my schedule tonight.  Speaking on closing the gap, I want to take a few moments to remember a remarkable woman, Lowitja ODonoghue, who was a South Australian. As we mourn her passing, we remember everything she stood for. We remember the positive impact she had on Australia, on First Nations people and in fact on the world. Despite a childhood marked by separation from family, culture and even her name, she never lost her belief in her country. Lowitja understood Australia had to do better to be better united and reconciled. I hope Australia will continue to embrace the wisdom that she shared. Not everyone gets the same chances, and its time to change that. I recall clearly that, during Kevin Rudds era, one of the first things he did was give the apology in this parliament. It was the moment that made us all feel proud. I felt extremely proud being in that chamber on the day, looking around in the galleries and seeing all the First Nations people in the chamber. But one particular person was Lowitja ODonoghue, who was in the special guest chair. I recall clearly that, once the apology had been given by the Prime Minister, I went up and shook her hand, and she gave me a great big hug and had tears coming from her eyes. Thats what the apology meant to our First Nations people. As I said, not everyone gets the same chances. Its time to change that, and its time to make some positive changes. Every person, no matter where theyre from, deserves a shot at success. We need real changes in education, jobs, health care—the whole package. Its not just about talk; its about taking some action. Lets think about the national apology from former prime minister Rudd. It acknowledged the struggles of the stolen generation. Former prime minister Rudds sincere address called for unity and a collective commitment to a more compassionate future. Anniversaries are important, such as the Closing the gap report that we debate in this place every year. They are important. But what really counts is what we do now and into the future—the action that we take that will determine the future. We want our First Nations Indigenous brothers and sisters not only to be part of the conversation but to actually lead it, to be inspired and to have opportunities. As a grandfather Im happy my grandchildren will have good chances, but everyone should have equal opportunities, without unfair treatment. Thats why the Prime Minister handed down the Closing the gap annual report, as we see every year—as we saw the previous Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, do, and Mr Turnbull and Mr Abbott before him. The 2024 implementation plan is important. Its not just paperwork; its a road map into the future and a road map for real change, aimed at making life better for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. This government is investing $30.2 million in remote training hubs in seven locations in Central Australia. Were creating opportunities where theyre needed the most. Were delivering an additional $10.7 million to continue the Justice Policy Partnership. And, of course, were working extremely hard, as all governments, politicians, state parliaments et cetera should be working, to reduce the incarceration rates and create a fairer system. There are programs for community wifi for about 20 remote communities. Were also putting $24 million into expanding the junior rangers program to 50 sites, giving more First Nations students the chance to get involved. This is a call for action. There has already been significant progress under the 2023 closing the gap implementation plan. There are 183 people who have joined the health worker traineeship program. Part of the commitment is funding for 500 First Nations health workers. So the improvement is continuing. Were improving access to clean water, for example, in remote Northern Territory communities. Can you believe that, in a First World country such as Australia, were dealing with some of our communities not having clean water? It is something that just baffles me when you think of the wealth of our nation. Yet we have a small segment that does not have the same opportunities we do in every sector, from health right through to education and jobs. Theres the $100 million investment in fixing homes and infrastructure on Northern Territory homelands, with 157 houses currently on track to be delivered earlier, easing overcrowding in remote communities. The justice reinvestment package is helping communities find local solutions, local answers, for safety and for reducing those incarceration rates that I spoke about. Very importantly, over 14,000 First Nations students are taking feefree TAFE courses for better education. We all know education is the key: education, training and skills. If you give those people—or anyone, as a matter of fact—that solid foundation through education, it improves lives. Not only will it improve lives; it will improve their communities as well. Were supporting the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation hiring 260 new workers for cancer treatments and other vital support. Im proud of what this government is achieving. We still have a very long way to go, obviously. Small steps are being made, but these steps represent real change, and together were working towards a more equal and brighter future for all Australians. Heres to a future where our Indigenous communities are not just equal but empowered. Together we can make it happen. By listening to the locals and working with communities, we can make progress on closing the gap.","National Apology to the Stolen Generations: 16th Anniversary","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GEORGANAS (Adelaide) ","(19:12):"
467,0,0,0,1,2,"McCormack, Michael MP",219646,"Riverina","NATS","N/A",981," Eight million dollars—its not a lot of money, particularly when you consider the amount of money spent on last years referendum, which was about $450 million. Eight million dollars is not a lot of money when you consider the amount of money that Treasury handles every year to run this nation. Compared to the sort of money that goes through the infrastructure investment pipeline, $8 million is but loose change. But $8 million is what Mornington Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria needs for a swimming pool—an aquatic centre.  I visited that island as Acting Prime Minister, just before I lost the role as Deputy Prime Minister—it was the last official duty that I did. I gave those people a commitment to get them a swimming pool. As long as I have breath in me, and as long as they dont have a swimming pool, I will fight for them. Its a long way from Riverina, the landlocked electorate in the southwest of New South Wales that I represent. But you have to have purpose if you come to this place. You have to have vision and drive. And you have to do whats right. Whilst all politics is local, this is a cause celebre for me because the mayor there, Kyle Yanner, is a beaut bloke. Ive met a lot of mayors in my time; hes one of the best. He has a young family, and theyve just added a newborn baby boy. Congratulations to his family. He leads that community, which just doesnt have what we have on the mainland. When you look at some of the statistics, they are really alarming. Mornington Island is home to around 1,200 people, 86 per cent of whom identify as being Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. They have up to 25 per cent unemployment. Its a very young community. There is high youth unemployment. The unemployment rate for Queensland is around 7½ per cent, which is all too high, but, when you consider that 40 per cent of families with children under the age of 15 are jobless, and you compare that to the state rate—its in the seat of Kennedy—it is just alarming. The total median family yearly income is less than half the Queensland average. Their disadvantage is so prevalent that 100 per cent of residents are in the most disadvantaged category under the statisticians office Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage: 100 per cent—every one of them. The death rate for Mornington Shire was some 40 per cent higher than for Queensland in 2019. The states Chief Health Officers report of 2018 stated there was a 21year difference in the median age of death between Indigenous Queensland and nonIndigenous Queensland—59 years compared to 80 years in the threeyear period 2013 to 2015. This was similar for males and females. Mornington Island doesnt ask for much. Kyle Yanner doesnt expect much. I have been to see the infrastructure minister, the member for Ballarat, on a number of occasions. I know shes a person of goodwill; I will say that. I think she was a bit surprised when I came to see her for the very first meeting. Being a former infrastructure minister—for threeandathird years—and here I was, capinhand, for the very first meeting; she probably thought I was coming in to talk about my local area. My local area needs things too—I get that—but these people need it more. These people need it—an aquatic centre—more than anywhere else in Australia. It is very hot in any month, let alone the hottest months, on Mornington Island. I implore, I beg, I ask the government: please look beyond some of the big things that you consider are important or a priority, and fund this aquatic centre. I cant state enough how important it is—not just because I promised them that I would deliver it, but because they have gone without for so long. In July 2021, the month after I visited—when I asked for a report it was June; it was in June that I lost the job as Deputy Prime Minister and infrastructure minister—a report said that the cost of the swimming pool would be $6½ million. Obviously, with contingencies and increased construction costs, especially in remote communities, they estimate that now its $7.9 million or a little bit over. Its not a lot of money in the scheme of things; it truly isnt. And that community absolutely deserves it. Its the 16th anniversary for the stolen generations report, the sorry day and the national apology that Prime Minister Rudd gave back in 2008. There are some stark things within that. We havent done well enough as a nation. We didnt do well enough as a coalition government. Labor is falling short now. And we do need to do better; that is the case. I do believe, earnestly and honestly, that we did some very good things in the AbbottTurnbullMorrison years. We made a difference, and thats to be commended. The Albanese government obviously spent a lot of time and effort last year with the referendum. The results in Riverina were very emphatic: 75.08 per cent said no, 24.92 per cent said yes. A hundred out of a hundred booths voted no. The people spoke. That is democracy. But we have to tackle disadvantage together. I know, and I was very proud, that we did some good work with the Wiradjuri Dreaming Centre, and through employment opportunities with Inland Rail, particularly in the first couple of stages that I oversaw. I know that, on Snowy Hydro 2.0, there were a number of Aboriginal people for whom it was their first ever job, and they had a function at the Wagga Wagga beach, where they expressed their delight at being given the training and the opportunity to work on that exciting project. But, now that the referendum has been done and dusted—and I appreciate that, as the member for Jagajaga said, there are people who are hurting; I understand that—its time to tackle disadvantage together, and to say: Yes, we had the national vote. The nation spoke. But what should we, what can we and what must we do now, going forward, to help those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who need it most, through jobs? As the member for Adelaide said—and he shook his head as he said it—he couldnt believe that there are communities where theres not fresh drinking water. I agree with him. Ive seen in Africa how people have eye disease because they dont have fresh, clean water to just wash their faces with. We cant have that in Australia. Were better than that. We must provide those remote communities with the services that they need, they want, they expect and they deserve. They are Australians. They are the First Australians. Across the Riverina, whilst we have done much, I commend the work done by Hewitt Whyman, Stan Grant Sr and so many others to break the cycle of disadvantage. I acknowledge that I do come from Wiradjuri country. I acknowledge that were meeting here on Ngunnawal and Ngambri territory. It is time to tackle the disadvantage together. The speeches given by Prime Minister Albanese and opposition leader Dutton the other day were very good. But we need more than words. We need action. We need particular action in those remote communities. The cashless welfare debit card needs to be reinstated, and very soon, to end the cycle of domestic violence and alcohol and other abuses that Aboriginal communities face all too much.
