He was elected to represent the Division of Dalley in 1901, and held that seat until the general elections of 1910, When he was defeated. Prior to entering the Commonwealth Parliament, he had been a member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales for a period of seven years, so that in total he had a very long and an extremely useful public career. His Commonwealth parliamentary service included the occupancy of the position of Government Whip in 1904-5, of Chairmanship of Committees in 1905-7, and of Chairmanship on the Royal Commission oh Postal Services in 1908.Many years have passed since the late Mr. Wilks held a seat in this Parliament ; therefore, he may be personally unknown to a large number of honorable members. I, of course, did not know him in his capacity as a member of this Parliament, but I had the advantage of some personal acquaintance with him a number of years ago, and I am quite sure that I speak on behalf of all honorable members when I say that very great regret will be felt on both sides of the House at the passing of a man who, for a long period of years, rendered noted service to the State of New South Wales in the Parliament of that State and te the people of Australia in this Commonwealth Parliament. I recall a remark made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) on the occasion of a similar motion last year, when he drew attention to the very special place that was occupied in the parliamentary history of Australia by those who were members of the first Commonwealth Parliament. They were, so to speak, pioneers of the parliamentary institution of the Commonwealth at that time - a. new Commonwealth, with a form that was little understood, and a future that was necessarily hidden. We have great reason to be grateful to the men who worked in this Parliament in its early and formative years. Accordingly, I am quite sure that there will be special regret at the passing of yet one more of those men who held membership of the first Commonwealth Parliament. I desire, on behalf of the Government and of Parliament, to extend our very deep sympathy to the widow and family of the late Mr. Wilks in their bereavement. I move -Unit this House records its sincere regret at the death of the Honorable William Henry Wilks, a former member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Dalley and a member of the First Commonwealth Parliament, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE W.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","1","CURTIN, John","009FQ","Fremantle","N/A","Leader of the Opposition","31",". - I beg to second the motion. Like the right honorable the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies), I had no personal association with the late Mr. Wilks; but all of us in this place are sufficiently well informed regarding the history of the federation to know that a man who, in the first decade of its existence, shared the tremendously difficult task of piloting this Commonwealth through its infant years, was one who not only had a great and an exceedingly important trusteeship for the future of Australia, but also, by reason of his previous membership of the Parliament of New South Wales, and his successive re-elections to this Parliament, must have won a very high place in the. regard of his contemporaries, lt is, I believe, true, that all of the members of the First Commonwealth Parliament, apart from the privilege that they had of being the first members of this National Parliament, were in themselves men of very great capacity. Most of them had served in the Parliaments of the States, and some of them will, I think, remain for all time imperishable figures in our national history. Although every member of the Parliament could not occupy a place in the Government, I think that it must be true that there was a large number of them who were none the less of very great value to the public life and the public service of the day. So far as my reading enables me to form an opinion, I should say that the late Mr. Wilks was far from being the least of those men. Even to be the humblest in such a distinguished gallery was indeed to be a very important figure. I pay tribute to the late honorable gentlemans work, and on behalf of my colleagues and myself offer sympathy to his bereaved family.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE W. H.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","1","ROSEVEAR, John","L08","Dalley","N/A","N/A","31","- I associate myself with the very kindly remarks that have already been made in memory of the late honorable member for Dalley. As lias been indicated, the late Mr. Wilks was one of the pioneers on the unblazed track of Federal government, and played a very important part in the early work of this Parliament. He was a man of considerable political courage, and although his particular shade of politics was not entirely in harmony with that of the electorate that he represented, nevertheless, for nine years, he served faithfully the party to which he belonged in a division which has since transferred its political allegiance to another political party. He played a prominent part in the affairs of both the State of New South Wales and the Commonwealth, and was always a fearless fighter on behalf of those whom he held dear. By reason of my very early recollections of the political struggle in this particular electorate, I can say of him that, whatever his views were, he placed them fearlessly before the people and was at all times a fair fighter in the interests of those whom he represented. It is to his credit, too, that although he has been dissociated from the work of this Parliament for many years, he continued to retain an interest in the politics of this country. The opinions that he expressed to political friends as well as to political opponents were valuable, because of the wide experience he had had in politics. I desire to associate his old friends, as well as his old political opponents in my electorate - who speak well of him - with the remarks that have been made, and on behalf of the present generation in that electorate, convey very sincere sympathy to his relatives, as well as to the country in general, in the loss of one of its most prominent citizens.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE W.

The House is meeting at the time of grave world disturbance, which is becoming exceedingly dangerous for the people of this country, and every other country with our forms of domestic and national life. The gravest . threats are being made against our independence as a free people, and are being accompanied by the vilest propaganda and the most underhand and treacherous activities that one nation could practice upon a friendly neighbouring country. National and individual morality has receded almost to vanishing point in some countries, and innocent people, whose only desire is to live on friendly relations with their neighbors, are being murdered at the slightest provocation and their property and homes are being confiscated. In those countries liberty is practically non-existent. There i.-- indescribable chaos in the world, and scientific discoveries which should be used to promote human happiness are being employed to destroy it and to destroy also the homes and even the lives of the people of those countries. I could go on indefinitely in this way, but there is no need to do so. Everybody must know what is being done. That these things are not abhorred by everybody is a calamity of the first importance, because every ounce of effort that this nation can possibly exert to assist the Allies in their strenuous fight, against these things should be exerted. I say with the utmost deliberation that we are fighting in the defence of civilization. In very truth we are fighting for nothing more and nothing less than civilization itself. Therefore, every effort that we can make in the fight should be made. All right-thinking people will, I am sure, agree with me. Wrong-thinking people, and those who do not agree with this sentiment, should be obliged to submit to the closest investigation of their circumstances, to determine whether they ought to be placed in a position where, if they will not assist the Government, they at least will not be able to hinder it in its war efforts. No praise is too great for the soldiers of this country who have volunteered to fight in its defence and have actually gone, or are preparing to go. overseas to do so. It would be suicidal for us to wait until the battle had to be waged on our own shores. We are fighting for our independence and for civilization, out, if we wait until the battle comes to us, we shall fight a losing battle. Consequently, I desire to pay the highest tribute, to the young men of this country, and of the other Dominions, who have enlisted for overseas service with the. object of endeavouring to localize the fight, if it is at all possible, in the regions where it is now being waged. 1 appeal to all loyal Australians to assist the Government in the strenuous task it has in seeking to assist the Allies in their fight.I appeal also to all honorable members of this House and to all Australian people to drop party politics and fall in behind the Government so that out war effort may be made with our maximum strength. On the front bench on the Government side of the House, we have men of average, and probably more than average, intelligence; if they were men of only average intelligence, they would be able to do the job that has to be done. The members of the Government are not less loyal than other persons in this community, and certainly not less loyal than their critics. We all know that they are industrious. Moreover, they have available much more and much better advice than any other persons in the community, and certainly than their critics. Mistakes, of course, will be made. They will always be made. But I hold the view that such mistakes as have been made by the Government have been mistakes of detail and not of broad national policy. I invite honorable members in particular, and the people of Australia in general, to examine the war effort of the Government. I am sure that if they will do so they will come to the conclusion that the Government has implemented a fair and reasonable policy calculated to give to the Allies the greatest assistance of which we are capable in their very strenuous endeavours to defend our civilization. Helpful criticism, I am sure, will always be welcomed by the Government, but destructive criticism at such a time as this is nothing less than a calamity. I therefore appeal to honorable members to offer constructive criticism and not to engage in criticism of a kind which might be helpful to the enemy.The problems which the Government is facing are tremendous. In addition to the ordinary matters that must face the Administration of this country, there i9 the added problem of devising ways and means to market our primary products in circumstances which are most difficult. I nsk the Government to give very serious consideration to these vital matters, for primary production is of immense importance to Australia, I believe that this is the first Government that has attempted to limit profits in this country in wartime. I hope that it will take within its purview many details in this connexion which, apparently, up to date have escaped notice; for in spite of its activities hitherto, certain people in Australia are taking advantage of the circumstances of the country to make undue profits.I know that the Government is facing a. very difficult problem in its endeavours to conserve the credit of the country, and to make the best possible use of its financial resources in, the prosecution of the war. I commend it for what it has done in this way.I should like to see some additional investigation made into some minor details in connexion with imports and the classification of imports. This subject is causing some irritation. Certain critics of the Government have objected to the classification that has been made of goods, and there is room for additional investigation on this important subject.It is, of course, inevitable that extra taxation must be imposed, but if such new imposts as must be  made are so devised as to ensure that they will fall upon those persons in the community who are best able to bear them, . I am sure that the Australian people will be loyal enough to bear them uncomplainingly, heavy though they may be. The Government will have to go on the money market, and it will encounter some difficulties here.To all of these problems must be added preparations for reconstruction after the war. Unemployment will have to be provided against and we shall also have to make provision for the well-being of the men who return from abroad. I was glad to notice the reference in the Governor-Generals Speech to the intention of the Government to make early preparations for the repatriation of our soldiers. It is not too early to set about the drafting of a comprehensive measure to ensure that the soldiers who come back from this war will receive better treatment than the men who returned from the last war. With the experience that we have had in the last 25 years, it should be possible to evolve legislation which will give much more satisfaction to returned soldiers than was manifested after the last war.Butin the midst of all these difficulties the Government is being confronted with thecalamity-and I use that word advisedly-of the coal strike. This strike is a crime against Australia and its people at a time when Australian soldiers are fighting in distant lands. It is a crime against humanity and against the workers in other countries who have appealed to their fellow workers throughout the world to assist them in the fight against oppresssion. As we look around the world to-day we find that in other lands, particularly in the British Empire, the workers are doing their utmost to help the Allies in this fight In New Zealand, where a Labour Government is in office, a magnificent job is being done. In Great Britain also the Labour party is behind the Government. From the Labour party in Norway an appeal for assistance has been issued to workers throughout the world. Yet in Australia one of the key industries of the country is being sabotaged by people who profess to bo true Australians. There are Communists in this country, and therefore I am pleased to see in the Governor-Generals Speech an intimation that the Government will take steps to curb their activities. Surely, not all of the men who are On strike are Communists ; surely, not even all of their leaders are Communists ? Should it be found that they are Communists, a very dangerous state of affairs indeed would be revealed-a position which should be closely investigated by the Government. If these men to whom I have referred are not all Communists, I want to see their leaders in this House advise them to end their stupid and traitorous activities. If these men are not all Communists, I charge the trade union leaders, and others, with the gravest acts of disloyalty ever perpetrated in this country. No excuse offered on their behalf will convince ana, or the majority of Australia., that such action is not. disloyal. I have not noticed any efforton the part of honorable members opposite to settle the coal strike, and therefore it would appear that they condone the action of the strikers. I repeat that their action at this time is one of the greatest acts of disloyalty that this country has ever witnessed. An appeal has been made to the Government to settle the strike by the exercise of the power vested in it under the National Security Act; but the very people who have issued that appeal would, at some future date, cite such action to support arguments designed to show why such powers should be refused to the Government. The National Security Act should not be invoked to meet the present situation, and I commend the Government for not taking action under its provisions. I am pleased that the Governor-Generals Speech indicates that action will be taken along the lines that I have mentioned.I have appealed for unity in the great struggle in which the country is engaged. I appeal to the Opposition in this chamber to drop party politics for the duration of the war, and to get behind the Government in its efforts on behalf of Australia.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","1","ANTHONY, Hubert","JLZ","Richmond","N/A","N/A","46",".- It is my privilege and honour to second the motion that the Address be agreed to. In times of peace the Address-in-Reply is a political occasion, but in time of war, and especially at such a critical time as the present, it becomes an occasion of great significance. The motion before the House gives vital and personal expression by each of us to the loyalties and high purposes which guide all British peoples. The supreme task that ties before itsto-day may well be defined as the vindication of the freedom ofallpeoples, especially small peoples It is atask into which we Australians, althoughnumericallysmall,should throw everyounceof virility, energyand independencethat wepossess; it is a task to the accomplishment of which it is the dutyof the Government to lead the people with energy and purpose. I am glad, therefore, to note that, since the House last met, the weight ofresponsibility falling upon the Administration has been shared by members of the party to which I belong. Faced, as weare, by one formidable enemy, covertly threatened by others, and -hesitatingly and feebly assistedby still others who should be our activefriends, we have need for all of the singleness of purpose and high resolution which the AddressiniRepIy expresses. We stand together as a parilamentand as a people in common loyalty to the , great fundamental principles of human rights which in British communities are safeguarded by Crown and constitution alike - freedom of speech, thought and action; freedom to Worship, or not to worship-; freedom to elect and control our own governments ; freedom from the violation of our homes; freedom from the fear of the deprivation of our personal liberty, except by the due processes of the law; freedomas a peaceful and law-abiding people to go our own ways and live our own lives. These lberties are in jeopardy to-day. To-night, I had the privilege of hearing an address on international affairs by the distinguished visitor from Great Britain who now occupies a seat on the floor of this House. After telling us that he had visited many countries recently and had seen what was going on in Europe and Asia, he said  If the light of liberty flickers out in England, I do not know where it will again be lighted . Those words made a great impression on my mind, because of the tremendous truth embodied in them. I have mentioned the various liberties which we enjoy, but there is one qualification in respect ofthem. Eight down the ages when the very existence of the State has been threatened it has been the custom for democracy temporarily to surrender its treasured liberties to the executive,andtoconfer upon itextra- ordinary powers in order that the struggle for the preservationof the state might be mosteffectively waged. Throughout the British realm, as wellas in the great democracy of France, the legislature has givento theexecutive powers which, in peace, it would neverdream ofconferring. By the passingof the National Security Act this Parliament with a minimum of opposition has given to the Executive,exceedingly wide powers, which in peace it has reserved exclusively to itself. If the legislature voluntarily restricts its privileges inthenational interest, in myopinion it follows that the liberties ordinarily enjoyed by theindividual must likewise be curtailed ifsuch restriction is in the interest of the security of the State. When therefore, any individual who enjoys civil and political liberty, suchas this country affords, abuses that freedomby engaging in subversive acts of a character likely to assist an enemy and bring about our defeat, a duty devolves upon the Government to step in and protect the state. I therefore welcome that passage in theGovernor-Generals Speech which indicates that a less tolerant attitude towards Communist activity and treachery will be shown in the future. Last Sunday afternoon from the outskirts of the crowd I listened to some Communist speakers in the Sydney Domain. I heard one of them say that not a man, or a gun, or a ship, should leave this country to assist  in this imperialistic war. The man who made that statement-, and those who were with him, were protected by acordoh of police to enable them to do so. I commend the Government for having at last taken steps toend such a state of affairs, and I hope that the measures foreshadowed in the Governor-Generals Speech will be applied vigorously. Our sister dominion of New Zealand has already made some move in that direction. I believe that we can follow its example, and perhaps improve upon it.Before I leave that particular subject; I appeal to our friends on the opposite side of the House to give the Government some assistance when it hasto tackle this very difficult problem of dealing with subversive activities. I am not endeavouring to make party political capital out of the circumstances that exist. I am sorry that I am given no credit by one or two honorable members opposite, but I believe that a number of the members of the Opposition appreciate the penetrative tactics of the Communist section of the community, and have very good reason to resent the activities of those persons in their own organizations. One has only to read the newspapers which sometimes circulate as official organs of the Opposition. party, to appreciate that very many members of the Opposition are waging a desperate battle against Communists to-day.This is the second occasion during the present generation on which we have been called upon to meet from the same quarter a challenge to the elementary principles I have propounded. The threat to-day is graver than it was on the last occasion, because it comes from a dictatorship which avowedly is out to destroy democracy; a dictatorship that is not only ruthless and aggressive but is also as callous and brutal as was any ravaging horde in the dark ages. It may be equipped .with all of the scientific aid which the twentieth century can give to it, but its methods and ideals are those of many hundreds of years ago. Germany says that it wants colonies. God help ns if it ever had the opportunity to colonize us as it is to-day colonizing Poland, by means of extermination and pillage, free men being driven in hundreds of thousands to work as slaves in order that the Nazi might be in a better position to enslave others, women and children being left to starve or freeze to death, and the firing squad being used for any one who is brave enough to stand up in the name of freedom!Behind the programme foreshadowed in His Excellencys Speech to-day, matter of fact and material though such things may be, there looms largely the framework of the gigantic effort which Australia is making. Back of that there i3 a still bigger thing, namely, the indomitable will of Australia. When this war, which was not of our choice or making, burst upon us, we took our stand. All sections of this House and all sections of the Australian people instantly took their stand with Great Britain, and there we shall stand unflinchingly until the end. It will cost us much in men and material, in money and effort, but that is the price which we are called upon to pay for our integrity and our existence, for our right and the right of others to live as a peaceful, civilized, Christian people. We are. fortunately, distant from the flash and thunder of hostilities, but no man with any sense of reality can doubt what would be our fate; we should be trampled upon and plundered, as others have been, were it not for the combined might of the British and French peoples. Great Britain has taken the first shock of the assault, lt has held the Nazi in check in the Kattegat, in the Skager Rak, in the North Sea, with France on the Maginot Line, and with allies and near allies in the south Balkans, where our own troops - the men of Australia, the members of the Australian Imperial Force - are standing ready to lend a hand to drive the Nazi back to his lair when the time to do 30 arrives. The great dominions of Canada,- Australia, New Zealand and South Africa - although we all know that South Africa has its own special and particular problems - count for much in this war, and their combined population of twenty million - Canada with ten million, Australian with seven million, and New Zealand with three million - represent almost half as many people - 45 million - as are contained in Great Britain itself. Between us, we possibly represent much more in resources and materials; therefore, we count for a great deal. What Australia does will either influence other dominions to be lukewarm, or encourage them to give of their utmost. Our heli) may easily prove to be the decisive factor if it is prompt, immense, and thorough, and if it serves to encourage and inspire our sister dominions, and even Great Britain itself. We are immune from the immediate shock of war. We have no imminent fear of seeing our cities bombed, or our coasts ravaged. We have no distractions. Let us, therefore, put forward our maximum effort, and throw our weight where it will most count. Above all, let us fight where the fighting has to be done, and not wait until it is brought to us. We have, unfortunately, seen others make that mistake. Personally, I believe that an overwhelming number ofAustralians is behind the Government which makes that plain.I give this Government the credit that it has never equivocated on that issue. Many of us would like to have seen more done than has been done. We should like to see a greater acceleration on the part of the defence authorities. The Air Department should accept the services of thousands of young men throughout this country who are becoming discouraged by the delay that is taking place. Much, however, has been done. Australia got there instantly in the economic phase of warfare, by joining in agreements long previously planned which cut off supplies from the enemy and assured them for our allies. These arrangements are of incalculable economic and strategic value; they are the basic strategy of modern warfare. On this occasion, arrangements were completed within a few weeks which in the last war took years to complete. Australia is getting there, too, with sea, land and air forces. The Empire air scheme, in particular, will help to hold the ring which will keep the Nazi bush-fire from spreading, which will keep it in check and help to beat it back and, I trust, finally beat it out. Here at home our industrial, commercial and financial systems have rapidly been placed on a war footing. The measures already taken are enabling us gradually to increase the total weight of pressure upon the enemy. But despite all that has been done, our effort lags proportionately far behind that of Great Britain; we are still not carrying an equable share of the load. The programme that the Governor-General has outlined, however, foreshadows much more that is to be done. I welcome that, and feel sure that every true Australian will be glad of it. We shall be asked to sanction expenditure and measures of a magnitude never before attained in our history. To me it is a matter of pride that we are strong enough, that we have attained such national growth and that we can rise to such undertakings. If every Australian plays his personal part as he should, adjusting his personal affairs and expenditures to his individual war effort - as I think, when he properly understands the position, he will be ready and eager to do - we shall all be able to provide sinews of war on a record scale; and nothing less will suffice. We can and we should, in this first year of this war, rise to a financial effort as great as, if not greater than, that attained in the last year of the last war.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I hope that the programme outlined, insofar as it relates to the war, will be entered upon and carried through this Parliament with the support of all sections in this House, with constructive criticism, not only from the Opposition, but also from Government supporters, where argument is needed, and with a full and earnest realization of the duties which Australia expects us to perform.

We from Western Australia can view this question with perfect detachment, because none of us will be able to share in any function, except the one that we shall attend here at the Seat of Government. But I do have regard for honorable members generally, and I feel that, if the rearrangement of next weeks sittings is for the purpose of enabling members to visit their electorates, it should be such an arrangement as will ensure that the majority will be able to do so. An arrangement which will serve only honorable members from Victoria and New South Wales, whilst convenient to them, is inconvenient to members from the other States. The Opposition will be content if, so long as this House remains in session, sitting days are arranged by the Government, having regard to its duty to prepare the necessary measures for our consideration and for the convenience of the Administration. Whether the House sits on. three or two days next week and then adjourns, we are bore to expedite the Government in carrying out the work of the country.Question resolved in the affirmative.","Illnessof Mr. Prowse and Mr. Perkins - Sitting Days","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[3]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"
