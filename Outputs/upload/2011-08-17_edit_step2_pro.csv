This delivers no local environment benefit in Australia. In contrast, the Coalitions approach ensures that all abatement activity supported by the Emissions Reduction Fund to achieve the 5 per cent emissions reduction target will occur in Australia—delivering environmental benefits here rather than overseas.(3). misleading the public about the effective carbon price in China.

15,0,0,0,1,1,"Macklin, Jenny, MP","PG6","Jagajaga","ALP","N/A",8277," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.This bill makes minor amendments to certain governance and business arrangements for portfolio bodies under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005.At present, several statutory positions established under that act are referred to by the term general manager—that is, the heads of Indigenous Business Australia, the Indigenous Land Corporation, Aboriginal Hostels Limited and the Torres Strait Regional Authority.However, the roles undertaken by occupants of those positions have changed in nature since the positions were created. The term general manager will be changed to chief executive officer as a better reflection of the responsibilities and expectations of these agency heads.The change will bring these agencies into line with the majority of other Commonwealth statutory authorities and companies, whose agency heads have the title of chief executive officer. This includes, for instance, the Australia Council for the Arts, Screen Australia, the Australian Film, Television and Radio School and the Australian Sports Commission. The chief executive officer title is a more appropriate term for agencies that have a board of directors—as each of these agencies do—and meets the general expectation that a chief executive officer is more senior than a general manager. We expect that this change will help the boards of these agencies to attract a higher calibre of candidate for agency head positions.A further minor amendment will remove a redundant reference to review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 for two discontinued Aboriginal Hostels Limited schemes—the Community Support Hostel Grant Scheme and the Student Rent Subsidy Scheme. These schemes have not existed for a number of years, so the reference to them is no longer appropriate.The provision for handling of information held by Indigenous Business Australia is also being amended. The narrow focus of this provision has, in the past, prevented information from being disclosed to agencies with responsibility for overseeing Commonwealth administrative practices—such as the Ombudsman and the Privacy Commissioner.It has also prevented information being given to Commonwealth agencies working in joint initiatives with Indigenous Business Australia, and state and territory agencies seeking to work more closely with Indigenous Business Australia to achieve better outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and communities.The amended provision aims to overcome these difficulties—but only with the continued appropriate protection of sensitive information. The relationship of confidence between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the agencies established for their benefit is an important public interest that we need to preserve.The new provision is also consistent with established information-handling arrangements, such as in the family assistance law and the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010, that protect information while still permitting the proper work of the Commonwealth and its agencies.Lastly, the bill amends the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 and the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services Act 2009 in relation to the power to appoint a person to act as the Executive Director of Township Leasing or the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services.At present, the power to make these acting appointments must be exercised by the minister personally, with no capacity to delegate the power. It will now be possible for the minister to delegate the power under each act to the secretary or a deputy secretary of the department, without the need for the minister to make acting appointments personally. Appointments can then be made when there is a vacancy in the office, including any period when the executive director or coordinator-general is absent from duty or from Australia, or when the executive director or coordinator-general is, for any reason, unable to perform the duties of the office. I commend the bill to the House.Debate adjourned.","Indigenous Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga—Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) ","(09:28):"

To meet this request, a change to legislation is required as the act currently caps the NRS component at 4c per kilogram.The deer industry requires the NRS component of the levy to be increased to 6c per kilogram to ensure it generates sufficient levy funds to maintain a viable residue monitoring program. Australia requires a residue monitoring program for European Union market access, and with approximately 85 per cent of all venison produced in Australia principally exported to the European Union, it is a key market for the industry.Decreasing the R&D component of the levy to 2c per kilogram is not expected to have an impact on the industrys future R&D projects. This has been confirmed by the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation.The industry undertook an extensive period of consultation and the decision to reapportion the levy was put to a vote in March 2011, where approximately 97 per cent of valid responses from deer producers supported this change. The government has endorsed this recommendation from industry.The government has decided to increase the NRS levy rate cap in the act from 4c to 10.5c per kilogram at this time to cover the industrys proposal and allow for future increases that the industry may seek without the need to further amend the act.Following the passage of this bill, the government intends to put forward amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (National Residue Survey Levies) Regulations 1998 and the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Regulations 1999 to give effect to the levy reapportionment proposal from industry; that is, to increase the NRS component to 6c and decrease the R&D component to 2c.The measures introduced in this bill and the subsequent amendments to relevant regulations will enable the deer industry to fund a viable residue monitoring program, maintaining access to key export markets—a positive result for both deer producers and their local communities.

17,0,0,0,1,1,"Bradbury, David, MP","HVW","Lindsay","ALP","N/A",8280," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.The Business Names Registration Bill 2011 is part of a package of bills. The package comprises:The Business Names Registration Bill 2011;The Business Names Registration (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2011; andThe Business Names Registration (Fees) Bill 2011.These bills, along with subordinate legislation, will create a national business names registration system.Currently businesses need to register their names in each state and territory in which they trade. Each jurisdiction has its own processes and fees. The proposed national registration system, to be administered by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, ASIC, will mean businesses pay one fee to register nationally, using an online application process.The idea of having uniform national business names registration laws across Australia has been around for a long time. As the result of an agreement among all Attorneys-General, uniform business names registration laws were put in place in all jurisdictions in 1962-63. Unfortunately there was no mechanism put in place to maintain uniformity, nor to prevent multiple registrations of the same name across Australia.In 2008 the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, agreed that the Commonwealth would assume responsibility for the registration of business names. This reform proposal was one of 27 regulatory reforms forming part of the National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy. An Intergovernmental Agreement for Business Names was signed on 2 July 2009 by the Commonwealth, the states and the territories.The national business names registration system, combined with a number of other related initiatives such as the National Australian Business Licence and Information Service and the Australian Business Account, are estimated to provide benefits of $1.5 billion over eight years to business, government and consumers.The Commonwealth has no power to regulate all business names registrations in Australia; therefore the establishment of a national business names registration system and the legislation which underpins it relies on a referral of constitutional powers from the states to the Commonwealth. The states therefore must enact referral legislation to give effect to the national registration system, and the Commonwealth legislation is drafted in such a way that the national system cannot commence if any state does not refer or adopt the legislation.The business names registration legislation package will set up a new national business names register, to be operated by ASIC. Any entity carrying on a business in Australia using a name other than its own will be required to register with ASIC. This will enable the identification of the entity behind a business name.The national registration system will assist new businesses by providing a joint online application for an Australian Business Number, ABN, and national business name, two of the most common registrations undertaken by those starting a new business. Combining these two common start-up registrations in a single online process will make it simpler to start a new business.Under the new system, businesses will only need to complete a single online application, and pay a single fee, to register a business name nationally. This will mean, for most businesses, reduced registration costs and a simpler process, especially for businesses that trade in more than one state or territory.At present, a business operating in every state and territory faces a cost of more than $1,000 to register a business name for three years. Under the national registration system, businesses will only pay one fee, which will be in the order of $70 to register for three years. An optional $30 fee will apply for a one-year registration.To assist with identification of the entity behind a business name, the national registration system mandates an ABN for any new business name registration. Currently all state and territory business name registers allocate a business name number. The allocation of such a number will no longer take place under a national system.The register will enable any party—be they a consumer or another business—to ascertain who the entity is behind a business name.The register will prevent identical business names in the states and territories being registered in the future. It will also prevent the registration of otherwise undesirable names such as names that are misleading to consumers, or offensive. The national register will also provide national rules to apply in relation to the use of business names when a person is disqualified from carrying on business.Consistent with trademark law, registering a business name under this legislation will not give rise to any proprietary rights over that name. Existing businesses will not need to do anything when the national registration system commences. Their existing state and territory business name registrations will automatically be transferred into the new national business name register.People who are thinking of starting new businesses will be able to apply to register their national business names online, at any time, and in most cases will receive confirmation of registration immediately. Applicants will be able to follow a link to Australian trademark and domain name searches, which may be important to them in choosing their business names.The new national registration system will commence after all states refer business names powers to the Commonwealth, or adopt the Commonwealth legislation. It is envisaged that states will have completed this process by March 2012, and the national registration system will commence by the end of May 2012. Extensive consultation was undertaken to reach agreement among the Commonwealth, states and territories on the structure of the proposed national registration system and the legislation which will establish it. Extensive public consultation was also undertaken, including two rounds of public consultation on the draft legislation.Full details are contained in the explanatory memorandum.Debate adjourned.","Business Names Registration Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BRADBURY (Lindsay—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) ","(09:38):"

21,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation","UK6","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr KELVIN THOMSON: I thank the House. Report 118 contains the committees views on two treaties: the Protocol on Investment to the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement and the Resolution MPEC.189(60) Amendments to the Annex of the Protocol of 1978 Relating to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 (MARPOL).Australias economic relationship with New Zealand is conducted within the framework of the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement, colloquially known as ANZCERTA. It covers all trans-Tasman trade in goods and services and is the principal instrument for the elimination of trade barriers between the two nations. The protocol on investment will raise the threshold below which New Zealand investors in Australia require investigation by the Foreign Investment Review Board from a 15 per cent or more share of an Australian entity worth at least $231 million to an investment of $1.005 billion. For Australian investors in New Zealand, the threshold below which they will not be subject to investigation has increased from NZ$100 million to NZ$477 million. Both countries have retained the entitlement to review foreign investment originating in the other signatory and sensitive areas, such as urban residential and commercial property investment; media, telecommunications, transport; defence related industries; uranium investments in Australia; and farming, waterfront or sensitive land investment in New Zealand.The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says that the protocol on investment is in the national interest because it will remove or reduce investment barriers; bring the treatment of New Zealand investors under Australias foreign investment regime, in line with that granted to United States investors under the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement; and maintain Australias capacity to screen New Zealand investment proposals that are large or involve sensitive sectors that raise national interest concerns.While the majority of the committee supported ratification of the protocol on investment, the report contains a dissent in relation to this treaty. The dissenting report from the members for Murray and Mallee is thoughtful, and I hope the government gives it proper consideration in thinking about future foreign investment policy. The truth is that many Australians are concerned about foreign investment, and the evidence to the committee about the Foreign Investment Review Boards handling of foreign investment does not do much to allay those concerns. In 10 years, the FIRB has knocked back just two foreign investment proposals: the Shell bid for Woodside and the Singapore stock exchange bid for the Australian Stock Exchange. The FIRB says that it will reject proposals that are not in the national interest. But, when you ask Treasury whether foreign investment is in the national interest, you are told that it is. If you ask, Are there any circumstances in which it might not be in the national interest? all you get is a shrug of the shoulders. The second treaty considered in this report is the Resolution MEPC 189(60) amendments to MARPOL. This treaty is a multilateral treaty regulating marine pollution. The amendments add a new chapter 9 to MARPOL dealing with the use and transport of heavy fuel oil in Antarctic seas. The new chapter will prohibit the bulk transportation and use as fuel of heavy oils, bitumen and tar and their emulsions unless they are aboard vessels securing the safety of ships or in a search and rescue operation, and ships owned and operated by governments such as naval vessels, auxiliaries and research vessels.The Australian Antarctic Division administers the Australian Antarctic Territory and is the major Australian presence in the Antarctic. The division strongly supports the measures introduced under the resolution. Nevertheless, implementation of the resolution will have some operational and budgetary implications for its work. Given Australias leadership in marine environment protection, it is worth noting that the research vessel chartered by the division, the RSV Aurora Australis, already uses light fuel and is therefore compliant with the treaty. Australias stations in the Antarctic are also compliant.The division also contracts Russian flagged vessels to provide logistic support for its Australian Arctic program. These vessels are large, specialised, ice-strengthened cargo vessels, which, unfortunately, operate on intermediate fuel oil which will be banned under the treaty. However, the division has advised the committee that the fleet of ice-strengthened cargo vessels is nearing 30 years old, which is the usual end of a ships life. The division expects to see a changeover in this fleet to modern, compliant vessels in the next five years.The committee is concerned that a large proportion of vessels operating in Antarctic waters will be exempt from the prohibition on the basis that they are operated by governments. We believe the Australian Maritime Safety Authority should monitor the number of exempt ships carrying heavy oils in the region to see whether the provisions of the exemption need tightening. I commend the report to the House.","Treaties Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"
22,0,0,0,1,1,"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP","EM6","Murray","LP","N/A",8284," by leave—I thank our very able chairman, the member for Wills, for his reference to this dissenting report that I and the member for Forrest have attached to the Protocol on Investment in the Australian-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement—ANZCERTA. This treaty was originally tabled on 11 May 2011. We are not, and certainly I am not, against the business of foreign investment in Australia—not at all. What we are concerned about is anything which further diminishes the transparency or scrutiny of any foreign investment proposal, and we are certainly concerned when this is done, as it appears to be, as a cost-cutting measure.This protocol does not in fact harmonise current anomalies or increase scrutiny of investment proposals by foreign private parties between Australia and New Zealand. As I said, it diminishes scrutiny and increases the disparities which already exist between the investment potentials in Australia and New Zealand for private companies and citizens. While it presumes to be doing more, the new ANZCERTA investment protocol only focuses on significantly increasing the dollar thresholds that trigger screening in either country. The actual business of this protocol is to make sure that New Zealand enjoys the same treatment as our preferred trading partner, the United States of America, when it comes to investment protocols. With this protocol, New Zealand investors would see the threshold for the scrutiny of their proposals raised from 15 per cent of A$231 million for general investment, A$5 million for Australian heritage properties or A$50 million for commercial properties to the one all-encompassing trigger of 15 per cent of A$1.005 billion in assets for any investment by a New Zealand corporation or business.Australians, on the other hand, would see the investment-screening threshold raised from 25 per cent of New Zealands NZ$100 million to 25 per cent of NZ$477 million. The New Zealand Overseas Investment Office would retain its current sensitive assets criteria, so in effect this protocol does not at all give a level playing field to the two countries investment. The argument for that is that New Zealand has a much smaller economy and investment by Australians in New Zealand is, at this point in time, substantially greater than the reverse.I have to say, however, that the protocol does not address different percentages of investment triggering scrutiny or the levels of proposed investment triggering screening. Neither does it deal with the different definitions of so called sensitive assets in New Zealand, which include rural land over five hectares and any waterfront property, or Australias prescribed sensitive areas, which include media, telecommunications, transport, defence related industries and uranium but not rural land or waterfront land. Those disparities would continue under this new so-called harmonising protocol. As well, New Zealand citizen investors are given a special visa category which exempts them from Australias residential property investment conditions. However, the same does not occur for Australian citizen investors in New Zealand. They will continue to be restricted by certain criteria, for example, in regard to water frontage and farmland over five hectares.The New Zealand OIO also charges a significant application fee of some NZ$12,000. Australia does not charge anything at all. This is another anomaly which has not been considered. New Zealand Treasury has calculated the protocol as proposed would substantially reduce the current costs for investment in business assets by around two-thirds. But it would appear that this will largely come from Australian businesses less frequently triggering the New Zealand OIO application fees, and fewer New Zealand investors triggering the Australian thresholds. Therefore, this saving comes at a cost of less scrutiny and transparency for either country. It cannot be seen as a savings carrying a benefit of increased efficiency or effectiveness or ensuring the national interests of both countries are preserved. Australia accepted the conditions of the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement for screening of non-government investment in Australia by US corporations or businesses. This is now the standard to be offered to New Zealand as the equivalent of USA preferred status. However, that Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement hardly had generous conditions for Australia and it was not reciprocated nor harmonised with the United States criteria. The USA, for example, has no formal dollar threshold triggering screening of private investment but instead requires voluntary notification of any proposed investment which may trigger national security sensitivities.It seems we still have not learned much then about equal or reciprocal bilateral trade arrangements or increasing transparency and accountability. In particular, article 8, the senior management and board of directors section of the new protocol, provides that neither party may restrict the nationality or residence of the senior management or board members of an enterprise of that party who plans to invest. We are concerned that such an arrangement could lead to a diminishing of Australias national interest if board members or senior management are not resident in either country and do not have Australian or New Zealand nationality but still get to enjoy the preferential investment-screening treatment.In summary, the only new obligation imposed by this new protocol on investment to the Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement is the requirement that Australia substantially increases the thresholds before screening of New Zealand private sector investment proposals occurs. Fees charged are not harmonised and special considerations are not aligned. Given the growing public disquiet about the lack of transparency and accounting for foreign investment in Australia, especially for farming land and manufacturing, now is not the time to simply raise the bar to save costs by triggering less scrutiny, assessment of national interest and accountability. In fact, I believe we need to urgently review our non-government foreign investment triggers for scrutiny and our definition of national interest, in particular to include consideration of Australian food production capacity. Because of those points, we cannot support this protocol.","Treaties Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr STONE (Murray) ","(09:54):"
23,0,0,0,1,1,"Oakeshott, Robert, MP","IYS","Lyne","Ind.","N/A",8286," I had only 30 seconds last night. I will continue on the substance of the National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011 and the range of amendments that are emerging not only from me but also from the coalition and the government, which has some substantial amendments. I am not opposed to establishing a national health performance authority as a concept. I think it is an important contribution to national health and hospital reform that this House and Australia have been chasing now for at the very least three years. To have in concept form a body to monitor the performance of all aspects of that health and hospital system is a sensible and much needed part of the oversight and scrutiny in regard to the health reform agenda on behalf of Australian taxpayers.However, having said that, we are seeing before our eyes now some changes with regard to what was introduced in this parliament under the guise of the Health Performance Authority and now, with substantial government amendments, some substantial changes to the concept that was introduced, arguably even to the point where we could build a case that it is a separate bill altogether in structure. The amendments are so substantial in the way they change this from what started out as a national performance authority to what is now a gaggle of states authority. The command and control really is residing once again back in the hands of the states and territories. Back in 2008, when we started this journey, really largely the point of the exercise was to find a way for the Commonwealth to directly fund that resource and give the local health district networks or their equivalents around Australia much greater command, control and autonomy on the ground. That was the model when this bill was introduced in the House in the last session. The principle still stood and health and hospital reform generally was looking to still be on track.I urge every member and anyone listening to this debate to focus not necessarily on the bill itself but on the 29 government amendments to their own legislation that they put before the House several months ago. The concern is in those amendments and how much has been given with regard to state clawback and the use of COAG as a Trojan Horse on behalf of the states once again wanting to get command and control of a system that they considered was under threat through what was, and hopefully still is, a very good and important reform for Australia in tidying up and essentially nationalising our health and hospital system in Australia.In relation to the amendments before the House, the coalitions second reading amendment will be the first we will deal with. It states the coalitions desire for the House to decline to give the bill a second reading until:(1) provisions establishing the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, including its functions and responsibilities, are presented to the House for its consideration …I can understand the coalitions desire to want all of the health and hospital reform brought in globo and have us deal with it all at once. I hope that is the desire. From my reading of this, I think the link is tenuous at best to the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. Health and hospital reform in some form is happening in a range of bills and my reading of this second reading amendment is that it is the continuation of the policy of wanting to be slow and difficult on all policy if not in control of the government benches. So I will not be supporting the second reading amendment from the coalition.With regard to the in-detail stage, I will be putting forward an amendment concerning the reporting requirements of the health reform agenda and the National Health Performance Authority. This was put to the House committee that looked at this issue with regard to how the authority reports: does it report directly to the minister or should it also have some obligations to report to parliament? My perspective—and I am pleased that the House committee also supported these considerations—is that the authority should have responsibility to report as soon as practicable to the parliament so that reporting is not part of a game by the executive to release bad news the day before Christmas or to get up to any other tricks that everyone in this place knows can get played when governments are behaving badly. The authority should have some tight time frames for reporting and some clear and specific obligations for reporting to parliament and therefore to all of the 150 members and indirectly to 150 communities around Australia. I am hopeful of support for the amendment. I think that it is a small but important reflection on the role and status that parliament itself plays in the transparency process that delivers better policy outcomes for all of us.There will also be a batch of 29 amendments that the government is introducing to their own legislation. It is here that I have most concern, and I will speak again in the in-detail stage. This is really where the dumbing down of this legislation is taking place, in my view. As I said at the start, whilst we are regarding these amendments as being an inch better than where we were before, we are still a mile short of where we could or should have been with health reform and the agenda that has been going on for the last three years. That is where the disappointment lies, in the lost opportunity of reform and allowing a performance authority, unfettered, with independence, to truly assess data from all states and territories of all hospitals regardless of who the direct authority is, so that we can get some direct benchmarking and some clear direction on who is or is not performing in health and hospital services today. In my view, the amendments that the government is introducing are tying the hands of the performance authority and really making it subservient to the states authority.That has been a big part of the problem to date that I thought the reform agenda was trying to resolve, and in the whole negotiation of trying to get all the states and territories on board there has actually been a compromise too far. I understand that negotiation and compromise have their place but I do not think that the balance has been struck. I think that compromise with the states has really given command and control back to the state and territory authorities to potentially continue to behave in an inefficient and less than value-for-money way than we desire.I think I heard another speaker talk about the performance authority as a consequence being a toothless tiger. I hope that is not the case and that is why I will continue to support the substance of the bill, because we have inched forward slightly. But I do think that it is a neutered tiger. I think that through this process it has lost a lot of its authority to truly assess the performance of health and hospital services across the board in Australia on behalf of Australian people with data that is given to the parliament and to the people without fear or favour, without any washing by any states or territories, without any tricks or political games with talk of various turnarounds of work schedules or how early the documents have to be given to state and territory health ministers so that they can get their guns loaded in response and without the use of COAG as the body to really hide a Trojan Horse for this re-emergence of state and territory command and control. I am very uncomfortable with those government amendments and will not be supporting those when it comes down to the in-detail stage.I hope—and I flag and I warn—that this whole exercise is different from the recently signed health and hospital reform agreement documents and that this is not symptomatic of what is to come through legislation. I hope there is not going to be a range of legislation that sees the states claw back control three years after the beginning of a very good and very important reform agenda.In 2008, in the previous parliament when the government was a majority government, I was still a very strong advocate for the importance of this reform. The then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, sat in the tea room of a local hospital, the Port Macquarie Base Hospital, and talked at length with the medical staff at the hospital and listened closely to discussion on the importance of the principles of the two Es—efficiency and equity. That is all I and communities such as mine have sought through this process, namely, efficiency being rewarded in the system and equity. Those services performing over and above should be rewarded. Currently in the funding models they are not, so that inefficiency, in many ways, gets rewarded. The resource distribution model controlled by the states does not deliver equity, particularly to rural and remote communities and to high-growth areas. Both are traditionally behind equity in the delivery of resources and funding.The National Rural Health Alliance put a figure of $1 billion a year based on a failed model of the states resource distribution formulas not making it to where, on the states own funding formulas, it should. It is a disgrace. It is one of the great failures of Australian public policy at the moment and it is the fundamental reason that reform is so important and that we need to be eyeballing the states rather than being subservient to them.What I am seeing in these amendments that have come through whilst this bill is before the House is in my view too much compromise with those that are too much to blame for the problem—the very reason that we are reforming. So I would hope this is not the first of many. I hope this is a one-off where, for a whole range of reasons that I am probably not aware of, the states got a great big win through the range of amendments that have come in and Australian taxpayers as a consequence in my view got a great big loss.I would hope that in upcoming legislation attached to the health and hospital reform agenda we do see the Commonwealth actually stepping up and sticking true to what the reform agenda was in 2008—that is, to start to have a Commonwealth funding authority working directly with local command and control. It is a sensible concept; lets deliver it.","National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr OAKESHOTT (Lyne) ","(10:02):"

It would be fair to say from listening to the contributions that people feel very strongly about making sure that our hospitals can deliver for local communities. The member for Lyne, the final speaker on the bill, is a very passionate advocate for making sure that his local community is well looked after. I can indicate to the member for Lyne that the government will be supporting his amendment when the opportunity comes for that. However, I do need to indicate to him and to the House that we fundamentally disagree with his assessment of what the amendments mean. I will be addressing that in more detail when I move those amendments.Let me go to the summing-up and deal with those issues first and then for the convenience of the House I might mention that we intend to move the amendments together as a group. The National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011 establishes a key element of the Australian governments health reform agenda. (Quorum formed) I am sure that members are delighted to be here to know that the National Health Performance Authority will act as a watchdog over the performance of both public and private hospitals, local hospital networks and Medicare Locals. It will regularly report comparative information on the performance of these bodies and give the public information in respect of consistently poor performance. Performance monitoring will support the improvement in healthcare delivery, safety and quality by all of these services. Poor performance will be identified to allow for remediation and superior performance will be identified to allow for the dissemination of best practice approaches.The establishment of the authority is a key part of the health reform agreement signed by all states and territories this month. We then introduced the legislation into this House in order to meet the time frames of the February COAG meeting but also were open to consider amendments which might be suggested from the states, the committee inquiry in this place or the Senate committee inquiry. State and territory health ministers agreed to the detail of the legislation and how it will interact with their health systems at a meeting of the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council on 7 June. Amendments to reflect the detail of this agreement were distributed by the government in the last session of parliament.","National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms ROXON (Gellibrand—Minister for Health and Ageing) ","(10:16):"

26,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation","83K","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Ms ROXON: I will be moving amendments in the committee stage of the bill. These also reflect amendments suggested by the Senate committee inquiry. The amendments will bring about a firm partnership between the Commonwealth and the states and territories in their endeavour to deliver better healthcare services to all Australians. The amendments to the bill will enshrine the independence of the authority giving it the ability to appoint its own chief executive officer as well as the power to remove that person in the case of poor performance or misconduct. Amendments will also foster greater cooperation with the states through consultation on the authoritys strategic plan, consultation about reports of poor performance and the designation of local hospital networks. This shows that the government is committed to work with all jurisdictions on health reform and deliver an outcome that will put more information in the hands of Australian patients. I thank those members who have made constructive contributions to this debate. However, unfortunately, a number of members of the opposition have used their time to simply complain and criticise rather than to outline any plans they would use to deliver improvements to the health system. They have been consistently silent on their vision, except for a policy to wreak havoc on and cut health services.It is a fact that this bill delivers on reforms that the Leader of the Opposition once talked about but never had the capacity to deliver. On 9 May 2008 he said the Howard government:… would have empowered the public by requiring the states to publish detailed information about the specific performance of hospitals.… … …In return for continued funding increases, each state would have been required to provide detailed quarterly reports on the precise number and type of services delivered at each public hospital and to provide detailed quarterly reports on adverse events at each hospital.So, while the opposition has an oppose everything strategy, by not supporting this bill they will be opposing something that their leader himself once called for—although did not achieve in 11½ years.We are now seeing the opposition, having no ideas of its own, continuing to play the easy game of trying to frustrate the governments significant reforms. This was highlighted earlier this year when the shadow minister took a similar approach in regard to the bill to establish the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, a body originally established, temporarily, by the Leader of the Opposition. Now we have had a bill before the House for some months, scrutinised and endorsed by committees in both the House and the Senate, and the best the opposition can come up with is saying that we should sit on it and not establish this important watchdog agency.The shadow minister clearly knows that this agency is a key part of the health reform agenda and that this legislation has been endorsed by all the states and territories, including three Liberal states. He also clearly knows that this agency will have a watchdog role in scrutinising the performance of health services, whereas the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority will have a completely different role, an important technical and financial role, in determining the official price for hospital services. Rather than trying to wreck every bill, it might be worth the oppositions time to develop at least one health policy of its own.Our government is determined to pursue the tough reforms, particularly when they involve more transparency for the Australian public. Standing on the shoulders of My School, My Hospitals and the work of the National Health Performance Authority, this agency will deliver for Australians unprecedented levels of nationally comparable information. It will also be a watchdog to detect poor performance in our public and private hospitals and primary care sector. I thank members for their contributions, my officials for their hard work and the states for their cooperation with these reforms. Question put:That the amendment be agreed to.The House divided.

It is very important to note that these amendments give the National Health Performance Authority the power to appoint and dismiss its own CEO; set mechanisms for notification of poor performance to states and territories, local hospital networks and hospitals; deal with the definition of public hospitals and local hospital networks; consult the states on the strategic plan; allow for disclosure of information to state ministers; and deal with the acts functions.It is not right, as the member for Lyne and on occasions the opposition have put it, that these changes give the states power to do what they want in hospitals. Nothing could be further from the truth. This bill, with these amendments, will introduce the most rigorous performance measures that have ever existed in Australias history for our hospital system. That is of course why the states fought hard to make sure that the detail was practical. As systems managers of our hospital system, they would be aware of and responsible for the fixing of problems within our hospital system—something I would think all members would be keen to support.These amendments have, by the nature of the process for getting agreement through a COAG arrangement, been subject to extensive consultation with my state and territory colleagues. They also address issues that were raised through the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee hearing. These amendments will ensure that the act has the support and cooperation of state governments so that the authority can properly undertake its role as a watchdog of public hospital, local hospital network, private hospital and Medicare Locals performance.By addressing these amendments we will achieve what has long been wished for in the Australian health system: independent, hospital-by-hospital reporting of performance. I cannot think of anything that is a better indicator of how we will improve performance year after year after year than making sure that we have an independent system which assesses the performance of each hospital and allows us to make sure that those that are underperforming improve and those that are doing well can be copied around the country. I am very proud of these amendments and the bill as a whole. I think it is a historic part of our agreement, and I think the view that the states and territories might occasionally like to have put in the media that they had a big win on this just is not supported by the evidence of what is in this bill and these amendments. I commend these amendments to the House.","National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"
29,0,0,0,1,1,"Dutton, Peter, MP","00AKI","Dickson","LP","N/A",8296," Since I last contributed to this debate on the National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill, significant developments have taken place. The most significant development is that the states have completely and utterly won out in this debate against the Commonwealth. I want the House to understand—and I am going to ask the Minister for Health and Ageing some questions in a moment but I think the Australian public has seen it for what it is— that what has taken place here is that the Prime Minister was desperate to claim to the public that she had had a win. This Prime Minister was desperate over the break to try and flick the switch away from the carbon tax and she was wanting to say to the Australian people that on health reform the Commonwealth was able to strike a deal.Let us look at the circumstances under which the Commonwealth has been able to strike this deal, and some of it has been discussed in the contribution of the member for Lyne. Essentially, the government has agreed to continue business as usual in Australias 750 public hospitals in return for the agreement of the states—in particular, the states that held out, namely, Western Australia and, to a lesser extent, Victoria. It has meant a huge bucket of money. The states have got a huge amount of money and there are 29 amendments to this legislation to try and accommodate the capitulation of the Commonwealth to the states. So the Commonwealth again has got itself into a financial bind where this incompetent federal government has said to the state premiers, To get a signature on the paper we will do whatever it takes.Could you imagine negotiating any sort of business contract in the real world on this basis? Go to BHP and say, We are desperate to do a deal with you and, whatever condition you put in the contract, know that we will sign it. That is basically what has happened here. This government is desperate and on its knees, and it cannot manage money. In trying to give the public the perception that some sort of grand health deal has been done, the Commonwealth has sold out not only this government but also future governments. Future legislators in this place will be bound to this incompetent and lazy deal. It is not good for parliament, it is not good for the Australian people and, most importantly and it is not good for the doctors and nurses that work in public hospitals or, indeed, the patients who access the services. I think it is right that this minister is condemned yet again for the latest failing in the so-called health reform debate.I might say as part of this contribution that I welcomed some of the words from the member for Lyne, who I think has a genuine interest in the area of health reform. The sincerity stops, I am afraid to say, where the member for Lyne—in spite of having made all of those statements before: that this is bad legislation; that basically the Rudd vision that he was tied up to, quite willingly, has now been abandoned; that the states have won out; and that we are going to have business as usual at a huge cost to the Australian taxpayer—is still going to support this legislation. I think it is disappointing because, as I said, I think he does have a genuine belief in wanting to reform our health system—as we all do.But we are not going to get that if we end up with the governments own legislation being amended 29 times before the bill has even passed the parliament. Just to put that into context: this is a government that has had to amend its own bill in 29 different areas. Basically, it completely undermines the intent of the original bill. The intent of the original bill was to vest certain powers in the Commonwealth so that we could drive efficiency, productivity and changes in the hospitals, which are owned and managed by the state governments. The member for Lyne has said, Im going to oppose these amendments because I think they weaken the original bill. He is not going to oppose them, knowing that the other Independents will support his position so that ultimately the amendments would go down. The member for Lyne has decided ultimately to support the bill, which I think undermines credibility in this debate. I think that it has to be put on the record, because I suspect that the member for Lyne would not oppose these amendments if the member for Lyne knew that he could possibly defeat them.In this debate people should really put their cards on the table, because this is bad legislation. The member for Lyne, who, as I said, does have a genuine interest in health reform, acknowledges that this is just the latest example of a failure to deliver on health reform in this country. I would like to ask the minister: can this minister point to anywhere in this legislation where the Commonwealth has the final say in relation to any aspect of the bill before the House?","National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DUTTON (Dickson) ","(10:42):"

I would not have commented otherwise.With regard to the amendments before the House: I think they are a watering down of where we could be. In fact, I like the substance of the legislation and the bill that was originally put before the House. That is the bill I want to support, not reject, as the member for Dickson seems confused about. I want to support a National Health Performance Authority that is unfettered in its business in the way it works through the various hospital and health providers and reports accordingly for good or for bad.I understand administrative principles of natural justice and procedural fairness, particularly in relation to individuals who work within the public sector—in fact, for all Australian citizens. I think that principle does not stand as much for state bodies that may feel aggrieved if there is a poor performance report around a particular hospital. These amendments seem all about what I consider to be the weak argument of procedural unfairness that has been run by the states in an effort to try to get some buy-in with regard to command and control back within the health and hospital reform agenda.I will quote some examples. Amendment (4) to section 62:(4) If the report indicates poor performance by:(a) a local hospital network in a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory; or(b) a public hospital in a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory;Then there is this process where a copy of the draft of the report has to be given to the state or health minister; there has to be an invitation to the state and to the health minister to give the performance authority written comments about the draft report within 30 days; and there has to be regard to any of these comments.If we are serious about an unfettered performance authority and genuine independence, and with reliable data—and I accept COAG reform, and McClintock and crew have been talking about poor data within many systems and the timeliness of that data—do not buy the argument that there is procedural unfairness, that the states seem to be treated unfairly if under the performance authority rules of engagement a particular hospital is found with poor performance. Based on the unfettered powers that they may have, I do not accept procedural unfairness to the state. Yes, I think we have to protect individuals—hospital managers and any of the health workforce—but as far as the states are concerned, I think they should cop it and they should do what they can to improve whatever the performance authority publicly releases either to the parliament or to any other body.","National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[7]","N/A","N/A"

44,0,0,0,1,1,"Roxon, Nicola, MP","83K","Gellibrand","ALP","N/A",8299," I am happy to take all of the comments. This is consideration in detail. I am happy to take any objections, questions and queries that people have and deal with them all at once. I do not think that it will serve the House that well for us to prolong this if there are not new issues to discuss.I think we need to bring some of the detailed information back to the focus of the House, and I can pick up the points that the member for Lyne is making and some that the shadow minister is making. I think people are confusing things and alleging things about the original bill that was put forward. At the time that it was put forward we clearly stated that there were still to be negotiations with the states and territories and that amendments would be moved; we said that on day one. We also acknowledged that there was a lot of interest and that there would be inquiries in both the House and the Senate, and we understood that that might lead to some changes. That is the sort of open policymaking that people ask for from governments. Yes, you could do it differently—you could have an exposure draft; you could do some negotiations first—but ultimately the parliament enables this process, and we have been pretty up-front about it. So I do not think there is anything peculiar in the way that the member for Dickson seems to be suggesting—that, because there are a lot of amendments, that is somehow a bad reflection on the process. I think it actually shows that the process, as we indicated from the beginning, has worked quite well.But where the confusion seems to come in is that these amendments are being seen as a removal of Commonwealth power when actually what this legislation is establishing is an independent body. It is not a body that is going to be controlled by the Commonwealth. It is not a body where we are asking for final control. It is a body where we are saying that we should remove from the political agenda an assessment of performance hospital by hospital. A vast number of those 29 amendments make clear that it will be more independent from the Commonwealth than the original draft. It is not moving from the Commonwealth to the states but moving from the Commonwealth—for example, the minister having the ability to employ and dismiss the CEO—to giving the board the power to do that. I think that that actually increases the assertion that we have made from the beginning that this is an independent body. It makes it even clearer that we are serious about it being an independent role.The example that the member for Lyne raised, which is a significant one, goes to some practical objections that the states and territories had about when they are the ones that are required to help improve a hospital facility if it is found to be lacking in performance, which is the very thing that the member raised at the end. What I want them to do if there is a performance problem is get on with fixing it. They asked that they have the opportunity, in a very short time, first to check that the data is correct—and unfortunately in health this has been a problem that has dogged the system, so I think it is not an unreasonable request from people who want to make sure data is correct—and second to be able to get on straightaway with fixing a problem while this process of reporting continues. From my perspective, for the patient that is a good thing. It means that the states are asking for that information to be given to them early so that they can respond and fix performance problems early and so that for patients we have things picked up more quickly.I can understand that people might have some scepticism. There has been a fair bit of history in a lot of parts of the country where there is not always confidence that the states have done what they ought to in particular areas. What the Commonwealth is interested in doing with our reforms—and this legislation is a big part of it—is making much clearer the lines of responsibility of who does what, who fixes what, how we know when something needs to be fixed and how we make sure the performance is publicly available to people. And we will be. I know as the health minister that every member in this House, if their hospital is found not to be performing properly by this Health Performance Authority, will be in here asking me about what else can be done to fix it. That is how this sort of reporting drives improvements in the system.So I do not accept the criticisms that are made. I do understand that a number of them are made totally in good faith, but this is a huge leap. It is not an inch further from where we were; it is a huge leap from where we were. I am sure that, over coming years and in the future, people will watch how the performance authority works and may well seek to improve it even further in the future.","National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms ROXON (Gellibrand—Minister for Health and Ageing) ","(10:52):"
45,0,0,0,1,1,"Oakeshott, Robert, MP","IYS","Lyne","Ind.","N/A",8300," I will be brief and will just clarify any perception of confusion. I accept the ministers argument that this is the movement from the Commonwealth to an independent authority and not necessarily an ongoing running battle between the Commonwealth and the states, but I would also put on the record, Minister, that I know independence and this is not independence. That is the concern specifically about the amendments. I refer you to the policy principles of COAG at proposed section 66A, where it is COAG itself that is giving written policy principles to the performance authority about the performance of the performance authoritys functions. COAG, if I read it correctly, will be a gathering of health ministers, state and federal, and therefore it remains a part of the political process. Likewise, with the similar issues around amendment (26) in regard to who decides the work plan of the performance authority, it is by agreement, as I understand it and read it, between the state and federal health ministers. That is arguably much more a political decision than an independent one.So I fully back the concept of an independent performance authority with unfettered powers alongside an audit office, an ombudsman and inspectors-general of defence or taxation. If we are serious about establishing an independent body, it needs to be unfettered and to be genuinely removed from the political process. These 29 amendments are the political process using its claws, and particularly the states, to work against what is a very good concept as part of the health reform agenda. So no confusion, just disappointment. Maybe it is a reality of negotiations in a federated system that once again the Commonwealth takes a bullet as a consequence of having to negotiate with states. But I, as the local member representing my people in the federal parliament, in what I consider the common wealth parliament, should not accept this incursion from the states once again. In 2008, it was finding ways to get around state command and control which was one of the fundamental reasons we were doing what we were doing.","National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr OAKESHOTT (Lyne) ","(10:57):"
46,0,0,0,1,1,"Dutton, Peter, MP","00AKI","Dickson","LP","N/A",8301," I welcome some of the comments in the Minister for Health and Ageings previous contribution, but I think they go further to underscore the fact that this is a terrible deal for the Commonwealth. As we mentioned before, when Kevin Rudd won the 2007 election the promise was that hospitals would be federally funded but locally run. As a principle, that is admirable. As the member for Lyne has commented on a number of occasions, that would have been a better and more desirable outcome. But the more we look in detail at these amendments the more we see the way in which the Commonwealth has capitulated.Far from being a federal takeover or a greater concentration of funding power to try to drive changes, this has been a takeover in reverse. The states have effectively usurped the Commonwealths power in relation to this bill and, I suspect, many others that we will see before the parliament. I asked the minister a very specific question about in what area the Commonwealth might have a final say. The minister tried to fob that off by saying that this was an independent authority, but if you look at the governments original intent in relation to this authority certain appointments were made by the minister, by the Commonwealth, and certain obligations were imposed on the authority by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealths intent was very clearly to try to drive this performance authority so that we could see better outcomes in our public hospitals.It is abundantly clear—and it should be clear to all Australians—that this is yet another demonstration of a bad government in action. This is a government that has locked this nations healthcare future in mediocrity. This is a situation that is of the Prime Ministers own making. In a way I feel for the current health minister because not only was she gazumped by Prime Minister Rudd but also she has been completely sidelined by this Prime Minister. It is humiliating for a minister, particularly for a cabinet minister, when that cabinet minister is put to the side because he or she has no capacity to deliver the outcome that the Prime Minister desires. I think that is part of what has happened here. The minister cannot come before this House with a serious and sincere look on her face and say that this is what she intended out of this process.There is no final say for the Commonwealth, as there was in the original draft of the legislation, because the states have their fingerprints all over this bill. We can have a debate about federalism and the role of the states in the health system. That debate will no doubt take place in coming years, as it has in previous years. But people should be under no illusion that this does anything to end the blame game, to fix public hospitals, to improve standards. You only have to look at the detail. There is no financial penalty. I asked the minister what happens in a situation of proven incompetence or demonstrated poor clinical outcomes in a public hospital continuing under this process. What power does the Commonwealth have, without having to consult the states or territories, to deliver some sort of financial penalty on the states? What sorts of powers does that extend to?I know that sometimes, particularly given 29 amendments have been moved, some of the detail gets brushed over. But there is a benefit in putting on the record what some of these amendments entail. I only have a short time, but I intend to detail a couple which serve to underscore our argument that this is a bad deal. Amendment (2) goes to amend section 5. It provides a definition of public hospitals, which is fine, and adds these words:If a facility is situated in a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory—it is hard to imagine where a facility could otherwise be situated; so a public hospital anywhere in the country—the Minister must not specify the facility in such an instrument without the written agreement of the State/Territory Health Minister of the State or Territory, as the case may be.Ask yourself why the Commonwealth did not see fit to put those words into the original legislation, but does now. As I said, it goes to this federal government having completely given up on any reform. They were desperate to do a deal that they have surrendered everything that was going to provide capacity to improve our public hospitals which is what the Australian public demand. I have some other amendments which I will go to shortly, but I ask the minister to address directly those issues so that I can have a response to that particular question.

52,0,0,0,1,1,"Roxon, Nicola, MP","83K","Gellibrand","ALP","N/A",8302," I am comfortable with providing comment on amendments if members want to raise questions on it. I am not going to allow this parliament to descend into a rambling Q and A from a shadow minister who has not asked me a question in question time for two years and is asking a question about something which is actually not the remit of this bill. He wants to know if there are financial penalties. This bill does not deal with financial arrangements between the states and territories.This bill and the amendments deal with the reporting of poor performance. He might want to ask, if there is that poor performance, what other sorts of financial impacts are there? But he cannot turn this debate into a general Q and A session when he cannot get through his own tactics people a question in question time and has not bothered to ask me a question about health or health reform for two years in question time. He cannot now come in here and try to use this for a rambling discussion about a whole range of other things.What we have before us is a detailed bill which is a fundamental change to the way that performance is going to be reported about our hospitals. It is going to provide much more information to the public and it is going to have a much more rigorous assessment process so that states and territories are not able to have poor data or, in an even worse scenario, have it somehow presented in a way which is fraudulent, as unfortunately we have seen with a couple of reported cases in various hospitals across the country. No state or territory wants that to happen either, so this is now a process, and, with the amendments, is an agreed procedure between the states and the territories.I am very comfortable that it gives the new independent authority far-reaching power to do things that have never been done in our federation before. I accept that there are people in this House, and the member for Lyne is clearly one of them, who think that they are good steps but would like it to go even further. I accept that there are people who have that view, and I would imagine that there are people in that category who—once this bill is passed, if it is passed, and once the authority is set up—will be campaigners who will see what it delivers and will want to argue for further change into the future.But that is different to coming in here, as the federal opposition is doing, and having a general spray about every issue that they are frustrated about not being able to raise elsewhere and expecting me to enter into a debate with them about it. There are other forums of this House. Bring on a matter of public importance. Do some work yourself and move an amendment, rather than interjecting that the member for Lyne should move one if he feels strongly about this. Where are yours on that, if you think this is such an important issue? Let us actually use the parliament for what is intended. We are clearly going to have to agree to disagree. We get an opportunity to vote on these amendments.I understood, when I came into the House and asked the shadow minister if he was voting for these amendments, that he said yes. Now he has a whiff that the member for Lyne is not, so the opposition have changed their minds and now are not voting for the amendments. This is the sort of policymaking that the federal opposition are into. They are not actually reading the bill. They are not making a decision about whether this is good or bad policy. They are looking at the politics. They think that if they have got one Independent they will be able to knock off this bill and that might be an embarrassment to the government, so they will jump on it.None of this is to do with any desire that the shadow minister has for hospitals to improve their services across the country. I am very confident that this bill, if enacted, will deliver fundamental change to the way we report hospital performance across the country. It is on that basis that I commend the bill to the House, and I think that if the shadow minister does not have anything to say that is relevant to this debate then we should put the question that these amendments be agreed to.","National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms ROXON (Gellibrand—Minister for Health and Ageing) ","(11:07):"
53,0,0,0,1,1,"Dutton, Peter, MP","00AKI","Dickson","LP","N/A",8303," Just to clarify a couple of facts in this debate, I have been asking questions on health in this place. I have asked them of the Prime Minister over the course of the last two years because we cannot get a straight answer out of this health minister. We moved an amendment in relation to this bill only a few minutes ago. I am not sure if the minister recalls that debate and, in fact, that vote. If it rings a bell, Minister, we did move an amendment, which the government, of course, did not support.I want the minister to provide in detail some response, as is required in this debate by any standard. The minister put before that essentially I wanted answers but then provided no answer. This is a performance authority, yes, but if there is not performance, what is the penalty? Is there a financial penalty that is imposed? Is money withheld? Can you demand from a state health minister particular outcomes at particular hospitals?What happens, Minister, if we see a tragic situation occur in a public hospital in a months time after this legislation receives royal assent? How does that differ from your response today? What is the purpose of this legislation if you cannot direct change in our public hospitals? What is the purpose, if you have surrendered every aspect of responsibility that the Commonwealth wanted from this piece of legislation and you have provided that to the state and territory ministers? What has all of this debate been about over the course of the last three or four years, where the Labor Party have said that they want to fix public hospitals? That is a promise that has long been abandoned.Can the minister answer the question? If performance does not improve—in fact, if it deteriorates—in a public hospital somewhere in the country, what can she do as a result of this legislation? These are basic questions that the minister continues to refuse to answer. If people can look to this government and see any sincerity in what it is they are proposing by this legislation then I think the minister needs to get to her feet now and answer these reasonable questions so that we can at least have some faith that we are moving forwards and not backwards.","National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DUTTON (Dickson) ","(11:11):"
54,0,0,0,1,1,"Roxon, Nicola, MP","83K","Gellibrand","ALP","N/A",8304," I think we are going to be in for a very long and unedifying toing and froing, because I am answering the shadow ministers question by explaining to him that this piece of legislation does not deal with financial penalties to the states. It did not when we introduced it into the House and it does not with the amendments that are moved today. This is a fundamental misunderstanding by the shadow minister of the purpose of performance reporting. The purpose of performance reporting is not solely to be able to deal with one isolated, tragic incident that might occur in a particular hospital. We all know that the reality of people being unwell and presenting at hospitals can have tragic consequences. This is about moving beyond one isolated, tragic circumstance and looking at how we actually lift the standard across the board, across hospital services and across each and every hospital in the country. This sets up a system that enables us to provide information that is collected at arms length and rigorously checked and therefore can be held up to the states, as systems managers order the local hospital networks to say: This is your performance. Look how it compares to everybody elses. You need to lift your game, and we will give you resources to do this and well do a whole range of other things.The shadow minister for health cannot come in here and ignore every other part of the health reform bill and use this as an opportunity to have a general spray at the government. I know he does not agree with a whole range of things. Frankly, I am a little bit surprised to hear him say that he is now a big advocate of the reforms that were proposed by Prime Minister Rudd, because I seem to remember him and his leader in here ranting and raving, opposing them. Now that an agreement has been struck with every state and territory leader—which is different from but maintains the fundamentals that were put forward by Prime Minister Rudd—they are now actually advocates for that.Those opposite have no idea what sort of health policy they would adopt if they were in government. They did not take any policy to the last election and they are not formulating any that they are making clear here. Whilst I am happy to answer genuine questions about matters that relate to this bill and the amendments, it is not an opportunity to raise each and every other issue. I cannot be clearer in answering the question: this bill and these amendments do not go to any financial arrangements between the states and the Commonwealth.","National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms ROXON (Gellibrand—Minister for Health and Ageing) ","(11:14):"

I think what the Minister for Health and Ageing has just done is bell the cat on what a failure this bill is. If members of the Australian public read this bill, the National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011, they would look at the words National Health Performance Authority and presumably, like me, think it was about the performance of our public hospitals and an authority that would improve that performance. But what the minister has basically just said is that what they are doing—again, in true Labor style—is creating yet another health bureaucracy. This was the great failing of the state Labor premiers: every time they received more money in Health, they did not put it into doctors, nurses or beds; they put it into new bureaucracies. The fact is that this is what is happening at a federal level.This is a new bureaucracy, a toothless tiger. It is going to gather statistics and look at poor performance and, in the end, do nothing about it. That is, I think, the best way to sum up this governments approach not just to health but to the whole running of government. This government has lurched from one policy disaster to the next, and now that dangerous disease has infected the health portfolio. This is a government that promised to increase performance, but at every turn—and we see the evidence in black and white in these 29 amendments—we see that they are not going to do anything more than give additional and overriding powers to the state premiers.I want to take the House to government amendment (7), which abolishes or strikes out the previous section, which had additional provisions about reports. Basically, there is a whole section that has been rewritten. Subsection (6) of the amendment reads:If the report indicates poor performance by:(a) a local hospital network in a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory; or(b) a public hospital in a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory;then, at least 15 days before completing the preparation of the report, the Performance Authority must give a copy of the final draft of the report to the manager of the network or hospital.But listen to this:The manager of the network or hospital is not entitled to give the Performance Authority any comments about the final draft.The government have gone completely insane with their proposed 29 amendments. This amendment takes away any meaningful capacity, once they have identified a poor performance, to do anything about it. That is why even the No. 1 ticket holder for this government, our friend the member for Lyne, says that this is a watering-down, this is bad policy and these amendments make bad policy worse. I think this is an opportunity for the member for Lyne and others to vote against these bad amendments. We will be voting against this bill because we believe that these amendments make a bad bill worse.","National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[12]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DUTTON (Dickson) ","(11:16):"

Specifically under this section it talks about any other body or organisation that provides healthcare services. My question to the minister is: does this encompass primary healthcare services which are delivered by the state governments? Does this cover the ambulance services which are covered by state and territory legislation? Does it cover, for example, the child and adolescent mental health services which are covered at the state level? Does it cover any other primary care services which have been areas of responsibility for states? Most importantly of all, does it cover general practice?The RACGP have been particularly interested in this issue. I am seeking clarification on this because the clarification is not there in the bill. It says in this proposed amendment by the government, which is amendment (7), to clause 62(1)(e), any other body or organisation that provides health care services. I am asking the minister: does it cover any of the organisations which I have mentioned? What is the scope of the reports prepared by the performance authority? Do they cover general practice? Do they cover those primary healthcare services which are currently delivered by state governments and which are enshrined in state and territory legislations?My other question on this is: does the minister require the permission of the state or territory minister for health in those areas which are state primary healthcare services, state-run community healthcare services, state-run community mental health care services and state-run ambulance services and are they covered by the scope of these reports?","National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[13]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) ","(11:25):"

As is set out clearly in the detail of these amendments, the bodies that the Health Performance Authority will report on are public and private hospitals, local hospital networks and Medicare Locals. As the member for Boothby would know, Medicare Locals do have a remit which goes broadly across a particular community and will include the level of services, for example, provided by GPs in the community. It is not a reporting function about individual GPs, if that is the question that you are asking.On the question of the scope to report on other state funded services, for example ambulance services that have never been included as part of the health system although they are obviously a vital part of how the health system works, they are not captured by this reporting. There is a provision, as the member for Lyne mentioned, that COAG can agree to extend the remit of the Health Performance Authority, so it might in its negotiations decide that X, Y and Z in the future should also be reported upon, and that would be something that the performance authority then would be able to do. It has been created by an agreement of COAG. This legislation gives force to that agreement struck by COAG. Its reach and remit does not extend beyond that agreement unless there is a future agreement that extends it.","National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[14]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms ROXON (Gellibrand—Minister for Health and Ageing) ","(11:28):"

Is this just a catch-all paragraph that will allow any future decisions of COAG to include things? Does it include, for example, local government authorities that are offering immunisation services? Does it cover, for example, the Royal District Nursing Service? Does it cover things like home visits by nurses as well? I am seeking clarification from the minister as to the scope of proposed paragraph (e), which states:any other body or organisation that provides health care services.On reading it, it could be extremely broad.

What are the arrangements between the four bodies I mentioned to ensure that that reporting is harmonised so we can make sense of different reports, minimise the overlap and ensure there are not data omissions?

I refer the member for Boothby to amendment (5), which requires COAG agreement to extend the scope. Amendment (7) deals with the way reporting works but not the scope of what else can be reported. I think that should satisfy his request for clarification.The member for Bowman raised a very legitimate question about the range of data that is already collected and also concerns about timely data and comparable data. One of the big changes that have been agreed to by the states and territories as part of this negotiation and the introduction of the performance authority is the streamlining of reporting so it is more timely, comparable across jurisdictions and able to be provided hospital by hospital. The Health Performance Authority will work with those existing datasets and in some areas create new datasets to be able to do its job properly. So a range of things that were not available before will be available when the Health Performance Authority is able to do its work properly. We will have truly comparable and timely data about each hospital across jurisdictions.Health ministers have already agreed to do some work on how we can streamline all of the different existing datasets. We do not have any interest in reporting for reporting sake. We want the reporting to be better in having more indicators and being more comparable across the country. Whilst everyone said we should look at what the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare collects and we should look at what is already provided for reporting in each of the states, we also are moving forward on agreed national reporting measures, for example, on infection rates. In October this year for the first time hospital-by-hospital infection rates will be published on the My Hospitals website.

84,0,0,0,1,1,"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP","TK6","Boothby","LP","N/A",8309," My question relates to the My Hospitals website. The My Hospitals website has information about the sorts of patients that are seen in emergency departments, waiting times and waiting lists in various subspecialties within each hospital. In terms of the scope of the reports that are to be prepared by the performance authority, what consideration has been given to looking at things which relate to quality and safety in the local hospital networks, the public hospitals and the private hospitals? The minister mentioned in her previous answer looking at the infection rates for the first time. It sounds like a good idea to have an idea of the infection rates in an individual hospital. What measures are proposed by the performance authority to look at quality and safety: mortality rates within a certain period in a hospital, mortality rates after discharge, complication rates from surgery and any complications that occur during the admissions?","National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[18]/talk.text/body/p","Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) ","(11:35):"

It seems that while primary healthcare organisations—or, as they have been called, Medicare Locals—have some role in the area of service delivery, in that they are going to be taking responsibility for after-hours care, they will not principally be in the front line of service delivery. The department has assured us that the primary healthcare organisations will not be fund-holding organisations, as we see in similar organisations in the United Kingdom or in New Zealand.So, given that the scope of the primary healthcare organisations is still a little ill-defined, I am seeking clarification as to what would constitute poor performance by a primary health organisation. Would it be that they are not offering enough continuous professional development? Would it be that they are not holding enough seminars? Would it be that they are not liaising well enough with allied health or practice nurses?

92,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation","00AKI","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr DUTTON: I do think that it is a very important parliamentary process to be able to consider in detail amendments moved by the government. These are important questions because they go to the very soul of how our health system will operate into the next generation. This is a government that proclaimed that they wanted to fix public hospitals. They have created all these new bureaucracies. They have now capitulated and weakened even the original process that they put forward. They now have 29 amendments on the books. Yet, remarkably, the government will not go to the detail of the amendments, either because they do not know the detail or because they are embarrassed by the detail.To go to your point, Madam Deputy Speaker, nobody pretends that this is about question time; but what does consideration in detail mean if the coalition cannot ask questions about the detail of the amendments? These are not flippant, tidying-up, clerical error type amendments that you sometimes see in this place. These are substantive amendments, 29 in total, and they completely water down, completely dilute, the original intent of the legislation. In some places whole sections have been struck out and new words have been submitted, and it is quite appropriate for us to ask detailed questions about why that has taken place. But, as importantly, it is incumbent upon the minister to answer in detail those considerations. To sit there silently and not contribute to the debate I think is a poor reflection on the minister and also shows the ministers contempt for you, Madam Deputy Speaker, as the chair in this place, and for the parliamentary process. We have reasonable questions that we want to continue to ask. We are frustrated by the process—there is no question about that—because right from the start the questions that were put have not properly been answered. We asked the minister reasonable questions from the commencement of this consideration in detail. The minister has plucked out a couple of questions and answered those, but the detail has not been forthcoming from the government. As I say, people need to ask the question: why wouldnt reasonable questions be answered by this minister? If this minister had an involvement in the construct of these amendments, why wouldnt this minister be prepared to step up and defend the amendments? If the coalition has questions to ask about why significant changes have been made—necessarily it seems at the hands of the premiers in order to do a deal by a desperate Prime Minister—why wouldnt the health minister in accord with the standing procedures in this place answer those reasonable questions?This is not a process where a minister can come in, with due respect to the minister, and somehow answer the questions that suit the ministers own knowledge but completely ignore those questions for which she has no substantive response. I think it is for the minister to answer the questions that have been put but not yet answered. It is incumbent upon the minister so that there is faith in this process for the doctors and nurses who are waiting to see whether or not this will substantially change their workplace and whether or not this is going to be the reform that people thought they voted for in 2007 and 2010. The ministers accountability is at question here. I think it is absolutely absurd if the minister continues to refuse to partake in this debate because we will continue to contribute and put questions until this minister answers the reasonable questions that have been put. If this process has to continue on until question time, it will.","National Health Reform Amendment (National Health Performance Authority) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[23]/talk.text/body/p[5]","N/A","N/A"

My question to the minister is: is there any requirement for these reports to be made public within a certain period of time? This is especially important in the area of quality and safety—there have been disasters in Australia, for example in the Bundaberg Hospital, and we do not want to see a repeat of what happened at Bundaberg Hospital. We need to know, if reports show poor performance in the local hospital network or in a public hospital, that these reports will ultimately be made public. Amendment (7) talks a lot about the consultation and the periods of consultation that are required but my question here is: what is the requirement on making these reports public? Is there a specific time line here? We would like to know when we will be able to see them and when these reports will be made public.

That is up to the coalition to defend, but the indication from the member for Dickson that he wants to push this through to question time and the indication from the member for Boothby that he is only just reading these amendments clearly demonstrate that this is a tactic over and above a true and genuine parliamentary process of inquiry into amendments before the House.I do not think I have ever supported the gag, I would have to go back and check my record, but I am not far away from actually moving it.

The fact is that we have asked questions, Member for Lyne, and we have not received adequate responses. The member for Lyne may well be satisfied with what the government has put up. He has expressed some concerns and he is going to take a certain course of action. I respect that. It is his right to do that as a member of this parliament. We have not sought to cut short his contribution, and nor would we.But we have serious misgivings about this bill.

The Bills Digest goes on to say:It is not yet clear how the ‘upstream’ National Health Performance Authority proposed in this Bill will connect with ‘downstream’ factors …That goes directly to questions being asked by both of the shadow parliamentary secretaries for health on this issue, so those questions are completely reasonable. The Bills Digest goes on to say:This Bill … does not give the Authority any enforcement powers …That is exactly the point we were trying to make before. What penalties are in place? If the government, having collected all this data, having created this new bureaucracy, having spent all of this money, are not happy with the way in which the data is trending, what can they do? This is a basic question and it has been raised not just by us but by the Parliamentary Library, the member for Lyne and others. The Bills Digest goes on:It is unclear how many primary health care providers will be monitored directly by the National Health Performance Authority.That, again, goes to questions that were reasonably asked before. I do not think that a guillotining in this situation should even be canvassed, frankly, until these questions have been properly answered. For the minister to stay in her seat and refuse to contribute answers to reasonable questions is unacceptable.In conclusion, the Digest makes a number of other points, and I think it goes to the concerns, as I have said before, of many stakeholders—not just those of the coalition and the member for Lyne. Those stakeholders have a real interest, as do many of us, in making sure that these reforms are tangible, are meaningful and achieve the aspirations that many of us in this place, including the member for Lyne, have spoken about both privately and publicly.

I have seen different tactics used in this place to try and thwart debate. I have seen filibustering and attempts to change the dynamic. But it is a bit of an affront, given the history of this legislation and the detailed briefings the shadow minister has received around this legislation, to have him and his colleagues doing this. They are genuinely nice people by and large. We get on okay; we can all be mates. But I think it is worth while for them to ask themselves why they are doing this at this point. What is your attitude to the legislation—do you support the health reform process or not? If you do not, if you plan to vote against the legislation in any event, given that the amendments will have already been voted on, why are we participating in this farce? I think it raises serious questions about the judgments which are being made.I have been in my office engaging in meetings since the last division and I have had on in the background the parliamentary debates. With great respect to the shadow minister, I have not seen the minister demure; I have seen her fully engaged in the discussion. She has chosen, rightfully, to hear you out and to provide the capacity in other places—because this will be dealt with in the Senate as well—to deal with this. If your concerns are genuine you could have raised them in direct dialogue, through the process of briefing. You have not done that, and today we see you, after this legislation has been in place for a number of months, reading from the Bills Digest. It makes one wonder what your game is. I say to the shadow minister—with great respect, Madam Deputy Speaker—that, if he is genuine about a discussion around these issues, this is not the tactic to adopt. We expect that, when these amendments are voted on, they will be opposed by the opposition. So what is this process all about? I suspect that the shadow minister, if he were in our shoes, would be asking the very same question. I say to the shadow minister—and I heard the member for Lyne, whose views I respect—that this is culminating in a filibuster. I say to the shadow minister that it is in our best interests that this debate be concluded. Vote against the amendments if that is your desire. They will be dealt with somewhere else and we will have a further discussion. This is not the end of the debate, as you know. If you were concerned about the content of the Bills Digest, why was it not raised previously? You have had plenty of opportunity to do so. I support the views being expressed by the member for Lyne.

Already, one out of two questions has not been answered, so I focus again on amendment (7), which involves proposed subsections 62(5), (6), (7) and (8). My great concern with 62(5) is that, apart from the obligation upon the performance authority minister to give a copy, invite comments and have regard, after that this legislation and this particular amendment are silent on what occurs next.In 62(6), I am concerned about the reference to the manager of the network, who, having received a report 15 days prior to its completion indicating that there is poor performance, is not entitled to give any comments on that final draft. I think it is a fair question and the public is entitled to expect an answer as to why it is in the public interest for that not to occur.We would like a clear understanding of 62(7) and (8), given that over this four-year process these were only released weeks ago. Before completing a report, the performance authority is at liberty to consult with any persons or bodies it considers appropriate, yet, if that report does indicate poor performance, Minister, the performance authority must not consult and is not otherwise obliged to observe any requirements of procedural fairness.Minister, my third question to you is this: regarding 62(7) and (8), why, in the preparation of a report, is it appropriate for the performance authority to consult with any person or body it wishes but if that report, particularly focused on a local hospital network or a territory hospital, indicates poor performance the performance authority must not consult, having, prior to that report being prepared, been at liberty to consult?

The bill seeks to amend the Social Security Act 1991 to enable parenting payment recipients to transfer temporarily to bereavement allowances following the death of a partner, remove the family member exemption from the two-year newly arrived residents waiting period before special benefit is payable, enable the minister to make legislative instruments determining impairments tables and rules relating to the tables and clarify that payments made by an employer to an employee in lieu of a notice of termination are regarded as redundancy payments for the purposes of social security payments.The Disability Services Act 1986 will also be amended to provide the disability advocacy services. Compliance with the disability advocacy standards will be assessed by an independent certification body over a three-year cycle. The bill also seeks to amend the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986 in relation to certain asset test exempt income streams and the provision of actuarial certificates.Schedule 1 of the bill—bereavement allowance—would provide parenting payment recipients access to bereavement allowance on the death of a partner. The Social Security Act prevents a parenting payment recipient from qualifying for bereavement allowance on the death of his or her partner. The original intent of the legislation was that the surviving member of a couple who had dependent children would continue to receive parenting payment single rather than transferring temporarily to the equivalent of bereavement allowance and then back to parenting payment single. Historically, there was no financial advantage in transferring between these payment types.The introduction of the secure and sustainable pension reform package in September 2009 resulted in an increase to the single rate of certain pension types, including bereavement allowance. Allowing parenting payment recipients to transfer temporarily to bereavement allowance will provide additional assistance. Schedule 2—special benefit—would align access to special benefit for certain visa holders with other migrants by removing the family member exemption from the two-year newly arrived residents waiting period before special benefit is payable. Temporary visa holders may qualify for special benefit if the visa is included in a class of visas set out in a determination made by the minister. Currently, special benefit is payable to these temporary visa holders on arrival in Australia if suffering hardship, whereas other migrants would be subject to the newly arrived residents waiting period and must wait two years before special benefit is payable, unless they can demonstrate both financial hardship and a substantial change in circumstances beyond their control after arrival in Australia. An exemption from the newly arrived residents waiting period is provided to a family member under the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Residents Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Act 1997. The Social Security Act defines a family member as a partner or a dependent child. As a result, unlike other newly arrived migrants, these temporary visa holders can receive special benefit much earlier than migrants entering with permanent visas.As a result of the changes made by this schedule, in respect of claims for special benefit lodged on or after 1 January 2012, the exemption from the newly arrived residents waiting period will no longer apply to a holder of a visa that is in a class of visas determined under unless another exception applies. This change means that provisional partner visa holders will need to demonstrate that they have experienced a substantial change of circumstances beyond their control after arrival in Australia, in addition to financial hardship, in order to access special benefit.Schedule 3—impairment tables for disability support pension—removes the current impairment tables from 1 January 2012 and enables the minister to introduce new impairment tables through a legislative instrument. This schedule also establishes that the minister may make a legislative instrument setting out the new impairment tables and guidelines containing the rules relating to the new impairment tables. The placement of the impairment tables in a legislative instrument will enable the impairment tables to be updated more frequently.Schedule 4—disability advocacy services—provides for the introduction of a third-party certification quality assurance system for disability advocacy services. It is argued that the new quality assurance system will provide greater assurances about the quality of disability advocacy support by introducing mechanisms independent from government to assess the compliance of disability advocacy services against a tailored set of new disability advocacy standards. The current quality assurance system has not changed since 1997 and does not provide assurances about the quality of disability advocacy support being provided. Under the new quality assurance system, the compliance of disability advocacy services with the new disability advocacy standards—which will be set out in a legislative instrument—is assessed by an independent certification body over a three-year cycle. The quality assurance system is based on the Joint Accreditation System of Australian and New Zealand—JAS-ANZ—under which JAS-ANZ is the accreditation body that accredits certification bodies to undertake certification assessments of disability advocacy services. This third-party certification system has been successfully in place for disability employment services since 2002.Schedule 5—asset test exempt income streams—would make a number of amendments relating to the treatment of certain asset test exempt income streams. Under the social security law, lifetime and life expectancy income streams receive concessional treatment for the assets test, provided they meet the requirements under sections 9A and 9B of the Social Security Act. This means that the asset value of the income stream is not taken into account when determining whether a social security payment is payable to a person. Similarly, the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986, in sections 5JA and 5JB, also extends a concessional treatment under its assets test when the equivalent requirements are met. Due to changes in economic and market conditions, the probability that a provider of an income stream will be able to pay the income stream as required under the contract or governing rules could fluctuate quite markedly, even over a short period of time. As a result, some social security customers provide the secretary—and, in similar circumstances, veterans affairs pensioners provide the Repatriation Commission—with actuarial certificates that fail to meet the high probability test, which results in their income stream becoming subject to the assets test, within the 26-week grace period, until they obtain a favourable certificate that meets the high probability test.This schedule also clarifies that the grace period in which a person must provide a new actuarial certificate for an income stream applies from the beginning of the particular financial year—that is, from 1 July—and ends when a new actuarial certificate is given to the secretary or, as the case may be, the Repatriation Commission, in relation to that income stream for that financial year or at the end of the period of 26 weeks beginning on 1 July of that financial year. If a person does not give the secretary or the Repatriation Commission a new actuarial certificate in relation to the income stream by the end of the 26-week period, the income stream will lose its asset test exemption.Schedule 6—termination payments—seeks to clarify that payments made by an employer to an employee in lieu of notice of termination are regarded as redundancy payments for the purposes of the social security law. The Social Security Act provides for an income maintenance period to be applied to people who have claimed, or are in receipt of, certain social security payments and have received a redundancy or leave payment. The income maintenance period is the period in which redundancy payments, or leave payments, are treated as income under the act. Income maintenance periods are applied because people who receive leave or redundancy payments from their employer are expected to use these payments to support themselves for a period before turning to the social security system for assistance. The amendments made by this schedule clarify that a payment made to a person in lieu of notice of the termination of their employment is a redundancy payment for the purposes of the Social Security Act. The effect of this is that a payment in lieu of notice will be included when calculating whether the person has to serve an income maintenance period and the length of that period. The changes made by this schedule ensure that people who receive payments in lieu of notice are treated in the same way as people who receive other types of redundancy or termination payments. The amendments made by this schedule apply to payments in lieu of notice made on or after the commencement of this schedule. The schedule commences on the day after royal assent.As I indicated at the outset, these are sensible amendments that would be made, I suspect, regardless of who is in government, and for that reason the coalition does not oppose them.","Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ANDREWS (Menzies) ","(12:25):"
111,0,0,0,1,1,"Neumann, Shayne, MP","HVO","Blair","ALP","N/A",8321," I speak in support of the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. I will concentrate particularly on schedules (3) and (4). As the previous speaker said, there are a number of sensible amendments that update disability provisions to make sure that we enhance the integrity of the social security and veterans affairs legislation in this country. There are a number of important changes and the first schedule deals with one of these. It makes sure that parenting payment recipients can access bereavement allowance following the death of a partner, giving them a helping hand in circumstances where they are going through the grief and difficulties that arise with the loss of a loved one.Historically, that first schedule has provided no financial advantage in transferring between types of payment. The bill gives parenting payment recipients access to a bereavement allowance, from 1 January 2012, following the death of their partner. It is a degree of compassion that means for a period of 14 weeks they can receive additional financial support, which they would need. It is difficult for people who go through these circumstances. There are added expenses, including funeral expenses, associated with the death of a partner and so this is a sensible, compassionate and charitable way to improve the lot of people in communities across the country.The second schedule deals with the special benefit. This deals with circumstances which make it a sensible arrangement for provisional partner visa holders to have the same requirements as other new migrants who have a more restricted access to a special benefit. This is a matter of aligning the circumstances of different people. Other new migrants not only have a waiting period but also have to demonstrate financial hardship and a change of circumstances outside their control. We are changing the circumstances for provisional partner visa holders to make sure that those two factors are now taken into consideration. It makes sure that the system is consistent across the country. (Quorum formed) The coalition—who said these reforms are necessary and would have been passed if they were on the Treasury benches—are not interested in reform of disability legislation and are not interested in reform to improve the integrity of the system. The member for Cowper should hang his head in shame for calling a quorum in these circumstances. This is important reform. The previous speaker could not get here in time with his notes and it just goes to show the utter contempt and disregard the coalition have for sensible legislative reform.I will talk briefly on the third aspect, the very sensible asset test exemption income stream. It clarifies the period in which a person must provide a new actuarial certificate on lifetime and life expectancy income streams and is a sensible reform as well. There is a termination change in schedule 6 of the social security legislation. We know that this is important because people are made redundant and redundancy payments are taken into consideration with social security payments. That is why this schedule is important.The final two schedules I will briefly focus on deal with issues of impairment tables for disability support pensions and with the disability advocacy services. This bill removes outdated impairment tables for the disability support pension and enables the minister to introduce a new impairment table through a disallowable legislative instrument. This gives effect to the 2009-10 budget Better and Fairer Assessments measure. The reform of disability care and support has been a priority of this government, and I welcome the Productivity Commission report that we saw recently. The national disability insurance scheme, which this government has shown significant commitment to by putting $10 million on the table to support technical policy work in this regard, and the new COAG select council of ministers, which will be established and lead to greater reform in this area, are indications, along with the advisory group to the select council, that this government is committed to repairing the dysfunctional system of disability support in this country.There are changes to the impairment tables, and they were announced in the 2009-10 year. The tables were last reviewed in 1993 and they contain a number of anomalies and inconsistencies—for example, assistance can be provided for hearing aids but that is not included in the assessment for hearing impairment. Visual assessment is assessed with glasses as well. There are a number of disability advocacy groups. The advisory committee recommended a thorough review, and it was found that the impairment tables were right out of date. The report recommended that new impairment tables be used for eligibility for disability support pensions from 1 January 2012. These tables are brought in line with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the World Health Organisations International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health.The final aspect I want to touch on relates to issues concerning disability advocacy service. The bill introduced a third-party certification quality assurance system for disability advocacy services. We have had a long commitment to making sure we look after the most vulnerable sections of our society, and we have made a commitment in this regard. Stronger quality assurance for disability advocacy services is important. Development of a robust quality assurance system is really important for people in the disability support sector. The third-party certification quality assurance system in this bill has been successfully in place since about 2002, and we think this will be improved with this legislative reform.I am very strongly committed to making sure people in my area of Ipswich and West Moreton who have been disabled—and we have had a long history with large numbers of people suffering from disability in our area—are cared for properly. This goes back to the days of the Challinor Centre, which is an institution that in its first guise was an asylum for people who were previously described as lunatics. That place is currently the location of the University of Queensland Ipswich campus. From that time and the de-institutionalisation that took place in the eighties and nineties, the low cost of housing meant that Ipswich and the rural areas outside were areas for a large number of people with disabilities and their carers to live. In fact, Carers Queensland told me not long ago that I had in Blair the largest number of carers in Queensland for any federal electorate.So this is an important reform of the national disability insurance scheme. Anything that deals with disability service is extremely important for my electorate. I am putting on a national disability insurance forum in my electorate for people to come to. For any constituents who are listening, they can contact my office and we will give them the details of that. Later this year I will be running what we call the Blair Disability Links at the Brassall Shopping Centre. It is an expo where all the disability support groups across the electorate of Blair can come. They provide services and information. I congratulate the Brassall Shopping Centre, who have been the supporters of this, and I urge everyone in my electorate to contact me about the important activities of the Blair Disability Links and the national disability insurance scheme forum that we will be having in the next few months.I support this legislation. I think it is good for our system and it is good that we care for those with disabilities.","Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr NEUMANN (Blair) ","(12:37):"
112,0,0,0,1,1,"Simpkins, Luke, MP","HWE","Cowan","LP","N/A",8323," I certainly welcome the opportunity today to speak on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. As my constituents would be aware, I am an absolute supporter of the responsibility of government to provide that hand up to people who need such support. It is through the prism of the hand up and not the handout that we must always see welfare payments in this country. Those entitled to such support must be provided with it, and those who are not entitled to it must not receive it. My last newsletter reflected the common view of my constituents that they support such assistance; but, where anyone who seeks to obtain such assistance does so without entitlement and illegally, I certainly encourage my constituents to report such persons. It has been my experience that Australians dislike someone taking something that they are not entitled to, and that is the case with some welfare payment issues. However, I think Australians should be more willing to become involved and report such issues.But we are not here today for that. Instead we are here today to debate how to make the system more efficient and better for Australians. I know that across the 25 suburbs of Cowan there are people in need of welfare support. There are people who have to work within the confines of their disability. There are people who are in need of the various forms of payments, pensions and allowances that are available for Australians and residents of Australia. Through Girrawheen, Alexander Heights, Marangaroo, Ballajura—basically all the suburbs—there are people who are in need of support, and I welcome that support.There has been a lot said lately on the concept of the national disability insurance scheme. Certainly in the last couple of months I have had more and more contact with people who are involved in the disability area. I would like to thank Ann Wood, one of my constituents, who brought her son to me and made it very clear the life that she has to live with her son and the difficulties that they have had. She also made it clear that there are a lot of breakdowns and systemic problems that need to be addressed. I think we are united as a parliament in the view that a system that is broken needs to be dealt with and dealt with quickly. So I welcome the Productivity Commission report. I know from my discussions with the coalition leadership on this matter that we look forward to be giving the Productivity Commission report generous consideration in the future. We will work through these problems to try to get a better, sustainable, long-term deal for those who are labouring under the issues of disability—both families and the person who has the disability. We certainly welcome that step forward, but as we know it has been estimated that some $6 billion is going to be required to sort out a National Disability Insurance Scheme. That will be challenging, but there must be a way that we can work through it with the states to make sure that we end up with the right result.I will now move through the bill and talk about some of the issues that are involved. This bill deals with a range of income support measures, including those for veterans and for the disabled. It puts forward a range of changes that will better ensure that Australias income support system provides more appropriate assistance to some of the most vulnerable members of our community. These are measures which the coalition supports.The first of these changes is to allow recipients of parenting payments access to bereavement allowance. It goes without saying that the loss of a spouse or a partner has a devastating impact upon individuals and families, and quite apart from the emotional effects that result from bereavement there is invariably a financial aspect to consider as well. I understand from changes that were made in 2009 that the Social Security Act as it currently stands prevents a person receiving a parenting payment from qualifying for bereavement allowance upon the death of their partner. A typical situation is that someone on a parenting payment who is met with the death of their partner is not able to move onto the bereavement allowance. Under the changes in this bill, and rightly so, they will be allowed to do so, and then after that period they may move back to the parenting payment (single). Before 2009, that did not place vulnerable people at a disadvantage, and this bill will remedy the situation of the 2009 changes.This bill also makes changes to correct an anomaly in the operation of special benefit for certain visa holders by removing the family member exemption from the newly arrived residents two-year waiting period for special benefit. As things presently stand, temporary visa holders may gain access to special benefit if their visa falls within a class of visa set out in a determination made by the minister. As a result, special benefit is payable to temporary visa holders upon arrival in Australia if they are suffering hardship, whilst other migrants on other visa types are subject to the usual arrangements. Other migrants must wait for two years before a special benefit is payable, unless they are able to prove that both financial hardship and changes to their circumstances beyond their control have occurred following their arrival in Australia. In other words, temporary visa holders whose visas fall into a certain category can receive a special benefit much earlier than those migrants coming to Australia with permanent visas. The changes contained in this bill will result in a fairer application of requirements for special benefit and will ensure that assistance is genuinely being provided to those in the greatest need.The bill also seeks to update what are known as the impairment tables to ensure that Australias legislation reflects contemporary approaches to medical treatment and rehabilitation. In order to access the disability support pension, an individual must have an impairment that rates at 20 points or more under the impairment tables. As the previous speaker said, the tables currently being used were last subject to a comprehensive review 18 years ago in 1993. Given the advances in technology, changed approaches to medical treatment and greater flexibility in rehabilitation practices that have occurred in the intervening years, a comprehensive review of those tables is appropriate and required.I understand that the government has consulted with medical experts, allied health professionals, medical health workers and those in the rehabilitation field as well as a range of peak bodies and professional associations in reviewing these impairment tables. I understand the updated tables will be introduced at a later time by way of legislative instrument and that the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs is committed to further extensive consultations to ensure that Australia has a system where assistance is better targeted and appropriate to contemporary medical treatment and rehabilitation frameworks. Placing these updated impairment tables in a legislative instrument will mean that they can be more responsive to changing medical and rehabilitation practices.This bill contains initiatives that are designed to improve the integrity of particular asset test exempt income streams. Over time, inequities have arisen between social security recipients and veterans affairs pensioners; inconsistencies in the treatment of these payments have meant that some recipients have received concessions at higher payment rates without meeting their reciprocal responsibilities. The changes put forward here are intended to provide some clarity and to strengthen existing income stream rules. Social security recipients and veterans affairs pensioners who have lifetime or life expectancy income streams are currently required to provide an actuarial certificate stating that there is a high probability that the provider of the income stream will be able to pay the income stream as required under the contract or governing rules for the term of the income stream.Due to changes in economic and market conditions, the probability that a provider of an income stream will be able to pay the income stream as required under the contract or governing rules could fluctuate markedly, even over a short period of time. As a result, some social security and veterans affairs customers are providing certificates that fail to meet the high probability test. This leads to their payments being subject to the assets test, which can create a level of uncertainty and financial problems for some of the most vulnerable in the community. It is good that the changes in this bill are designed to help provide some clarity so that these customers may provide only one certificate for each financial year to show that the fund has sufficient resources to pay the income stream for its term. In the event that someone provides more than one certificate for a particular financial year only the first certificate given will have effect.The bill also provides some clarity in relation to the status of termination payments within social security law. For a variety of reasons some employers will elect to make a payment to an employee in lieu of notice of termination. The provisions of this bill will help ensure that people who receive such payments are treated in the same way as people who receive other types of redundancy or termination payments. Importantly, the bill will provide an enhanced quality assurance system for disability advocacy services to ensure that those Australians who live with disability are afforded the best possible advocacy support.As we know, the current quality assurance system has been in place since 1997 but no longer provides sufficient assurances about the quality of disability advocacy support being provided. Under the system proposed by this bill the compliance of disability advocacy services with the new disability advocacy standards, to be set out in a legislative instrument, is assessed by an independent certification body over a three-year cycle. The quality assurance system is based on the Joint Accreditation System of Australia and New Zealand, which is the accreditation body that accredits certification bodies to undertake certification assessments of disability advocacy services. I understand that the system has been the subject of a successful trial, and was developed following extensive consultation with those working in the sector.This bill makes a number of changes which clarify aspects of social security law, and should make it easier for those who depend on income support to understand the system. Moreover, it addresses a number of inconsistencies in the application of the law that have arisen over time and the changes proposed here should result in an income support system which is fairer across the board.It is right that the parliament do all it can to support those Australians who, because of a disability, are unable to work to support themselves and their families. It is equally important that the services of those who have risked their lives for our national security is recognised through a stable system of veterans affairs income support. The coalition is supporting these initiatives in the hope that they will improve the system for those who depend upon it. As I said at the start, it is right that we have a strong and viable social security system put in place to protect and to provide for those who are labouring under circumstances beyond their control—particularly the victims of circumstances who do not have the same capacity as the rest of society to benefit from the opportunities that this strong society that we have provides.It is without doubt that we support these measures. We look forward to the passing of these when this motion is concluded.","Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SIMPKINS (Cowan) ","(12:49):"
113,0,0,0,1,1,"Macklin, Jenny, MP","PG6","Jagajaga","ALP","N/A",8326," First of all I would like to thank all of the speakers for their contribution to the debate on this bill, because the government is working very hard to support people with disability to fulfil their potential.Just last week the Prime Minister released the Productivity Commissions final report into long-term care and support of people with disability. As members would know, consistent with the Productivity Commissions recommendations we have already started work to transform the way care and support is provided to people with disabilities. We are working to deliver results for people with disability right now, including by improving support for Australians with a disability to help them into work wherever that is possible.The disability support pension is an essential element of Australias safety net, and it is vital that it supports the people who need it: those Australians who, through disability, are unable to work to fully support themselves. In the 2009-10 budget the government committed to update the impairment tables used to assess eligibility for the disability support pension to bring them into line with modern medical and rehabilitation practice. The current impairment tables have not been comprehensively rewritten since they were introduced in 1991. It is essential that the level of someones impairment is assessed using the most up-to-date medical information and with reference to modern rehabilitation practices. This is an important element of the governments reforms to the disability support pension, to make it simpler, fairer and sustainable for those who need it.An advisory committee of medical, allied health and rehabilitation experts, representatives of disability peak bodies, mental health advocates and relevant government agencies was established in 2010 to provide advice on updating the impairment tables. Following a thorough review the advisory committee has provided its final report to the government, which I released publicly last month. The report finds that the current impairment tables are out of date. The advisory committee has developed new impairment tables in close consultation with the medical profession and disability stakeholders. These proposed new tables have also been made public. The advisory committees report recommends the new tables be used to assess eligibility for the disability support pension from 1 January 2012. In line with the advisory committees recommendations the government is consulting with disability stakeholders, mental health advocates and experts to ensure the recommended new tables are implemented fairly and effectively.This bill removes the current outdated tables and enables new tables to be introduced through a disallowable legislative instrument. This change will occur on 1 January 2012. Putting the impairment tables into a disallowable instrument allows them to be updated regularly in response to developments in medical and rehabilitation practice, and will also retain the parliaments role in scrutinising any changes.The bill also introduces a stronger quality assurance system for disability advocacy services to make sure that people with disability receive the best possible advocacy support. The current quality assurance system has not changed since 1997, and the need for improved quality assurance for disability advocacy services has been highlighted in a number of reviews. This bill requires disability advocacy services that receive financial assistance under the Disability Services Act to be reviewed and assessed by independent, accredited certification bodies against disability advocacy standards. This quality assurance system has been in place for disability employment services since 2002. It involves people with disability at all levels in the system, including as members of audit teams. The new system has been successfully trialled and independently evaluated in consultation with the disability advocacy sector. The evaluation recommended formal implementation. These changes will help meet the objectives of the National Disability Strategy and will also help meet Australias obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.This bill also gives effect to a 2011-12 budget measure by enabling parenting payment recipients to access bereavement allowance on the death of a partner. Allowing a parenting payment recipient to transfer to bereavement allowance on the death of their partner will provide additional financial assistance during a very difficult time.The bill also gives effect to another 2011-12 budget measure, to more closely align the rules for accessing special benefit for provisional partner visa holders with the rules for other newly arrived migrants. Under current policy, provisional partner visa holders are able to access special benefit from when they are granted the visa and are in Australia if they can demonstrate that they are suffering from financial hardship. This is not consistent with other newly arrived migrants subject to the newly arrived residents waiting period, who need to demonstrate both financial hardship and change in circumstances outside their control in order to access special benefit. From 1 January 2012, the rules for provisional partner visa holders will be consistent with those for other newly arrived migrants. The new arrangements will continue to ensure adequate protection for vulnerable migrants—for example, where there is domestic violence, death of a partner or an injury or accident after their arrival in Australia.The bill also makes changes to the social security law and veterans entitlements legislation to enhance the integrity of treatment of certain asset-test-exempt income streams. These changes strengthen the existing rules that require lifetime and life expectancy income streams to provide an annual actuarial certificate in order to benefit from concessional treatment and address inconsistencies in the treatment of these income streams that have arisen over time.Finally, the bill also makes amendments to the social security law to clarify that payments made by an employer to an employee in lieu of notice of the termination of his or her employment are redundancy payments for the purposes of social security law. This ensures that, in calculating income maintenance periods under the act, people who receive these payments are treated in the same way as people who receive other types of redundancy payments.

115,0,0,0,1,1,"Smith, Tony, MP","00APG","Casey","LP","N/A",8328," On behalf of the opposition, I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill 2011, which was introduced into this House on 22 June by the Assistant Treasurer, the member for Maribyrnong. This bill has three schedules. I will say at the outset that the coalition will not be opposing this bill. As is often the case and as I have said on many previous occasions, bills such as this correct unintended errors, add to the tax law in other important ways and ensure the ongoing operation of an efficient and fair tax system. This bill is no exception.I will deal with each of the three schedules. The first schedule exempts the outer regional and remote payment made under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative from income tax. The second schedule provides an exemption for fringe benefits tax for transport, specifically with regard to circumstances where an employee is receiving fringe benefits in a remote overseas location—and I will come back to the detail of that. Finally, as is often the case, this bill updates the deductible gift recipients list in a number of important respects.I will deal with the first schedule. The Assistant Treasurer outlined in his tabling speech in some detail the proposed operation of this in schedule 1. As many members will be aware, there are already payments made under the program; I outlined the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative. Those payments are important payments for a range of disabilities, including sight or hearing impairment, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and a number of others. With respect to eligible children with those disabilities in remote and regional areas, there is an additional payment of $2,000 which is being provided to take account of the additional costs resulting from the distance involved in living in those remote and regional areas. The effect of this schedule is simply to ensure that the additional payment is not subject to income tax. That is the sort of schedule we see in these tax laws amendment bills when important benefits of that nature are provided. Without this schedule, the tax law would automatically tax those additional payments, and this schedule sensibly ensures that the $2,000 payment is exempt from income tax calculations.The second schedule deals with overseas fly-in fly-out arrangements with respect to fringe benefits tax. Essentially at the present point in time there is an exemption from fringe benefits tax for transport from an employees usual place of residence to their place of employment, where the employee is employed under what is commonly known as fly-in fly-out arrangements and the usual place of employment is a remote location in Australia or on an oil rig or another installation at sea. The Assistant Treasurer outlined in his second reading speech the intention of this schedule essentially to extend that exemption in the same way where the employee is an Australian resident employed in a remote area overseas under a fly-in fly-out arrangement.That makes sense. The point we on this side of the House would make is this has been necessitated by an earlier change to the taxation law. That was a change announced and legislated by the government back in 2009. It relates to foreign employment income for Australians working overseas. That change meant that Australians in this circumstance who had been exempt from Australian income tax to a level would no longer be. A corollary of that is because they may have been receiving fringe benefits before and they were not subject to income tax now, under the change to that law, there was the potential for them to be double-taxed. I would commend members who are interested in this point to read the explanatory memorandum which outlines in detail this necessity on page 10 at 2.15:Such benefits were previously exempt from FBT because no FBT liability arose in relation to benefits provided to employees whose salary or wages were fully exempt from income tax. Removing the income tax exemption for affected individuals has brought these individuals within the FBT regime.It goes on to outline in great detail how that would occur. At 2.19 on the same page it states:Double taxation may occur because Australia taxes fringe benefits in the hands of employers, whereas most other countries that tax fringe benefits, tax them in the hands of employees.Tax law is a very detailed area of law as you would appreciate, Madam Deputy Speaker. But the point from this side of the House is that this is something that the government themselves should have recognised at the time of that change a couple of years ago. I make the point in the House that it is a technical oversight. This oversight was recognised prior to the introduction of this bill. In fact, the announcement of the change was made back in 2010, I believe, by the then Assistant Treasurer. I understand it has taken until now to make it into the tax laws amendment bill. The explanatory memorandum was in a media release on 18 November 2010, when it was announced that there would be this change in a tax laws amendment bill.As I said at the outset, the final schedule updates the deductible gift recipients list. It adds to that list the New Zealand governments Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust and the Cancer Australia Gift Fund. It makes some other consequential changes, including renaming some recipients already on the list. It also repeals some from the list, but only in cases where those names are now redundant and have been replaced by either new names or, in one case I think, a merger of a couple of organisations with the same purpose. The addition of those two to the list is something that all members of this House and the Australian public would welcome. I commend the bill to the House.","Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) ","(13:12):"
116,0,0,0,1,1,"Rowland, Michelle, MP",159771,"Greenway","ALP","N/A",8329," I am very pleased to rise in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill. This bill delivers a number of different but highly important measures. It will directly assist families dealing with disability. It will ensure certainty for industry regarding the fringe benefits tax. Finally, it adds two new organisations to the deductible gift recipients register for tax purposes. I thank the Assistant Treasurer for all his efforts on these matters and I encourage all members to support this legislation.First, I want to discuss the importance of this bill with specific focus on schedule 1 which amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to ensure that the outer regional and remote payment made under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative is exempt from income tax. This government realises the unfortunate reality that it is harder for families who live in regional and remote parts of Australia and care for a loved one with a disability. It is much harder to visit necessary services in some remote parts of Australia. That is why the government introduced the outer regional and remote areas payment. This means that eligible recipients would receive a one-off payment of $2,000 to help manage the extra logistical difficulties that come with caring for a person with a disability—(Quorum formed) Madam Deputy Speaker, I was talking about the needs of people with disability and the importance of assisting those people and particularly their carers. Under the current law, payments made to recipients under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative may be subject to income tax. This bill will ensure that the outer regional and remote payment made under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative is expressly exempt from income tax.Schedule 2 of the bill will also provide increased certainty to fly-in fly-out employees working overseas and their employers by exempting transport from the fringe benefits tax.Finally, schedule 3 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act to update the list of deductible gift recipients.I would particularly like to spend a bit of time dealing with the issues relevant to schedule 1. On 29 July last year the Prime Minister made a landmark announcement in detailing the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative. As of 1 July this year, eligible children will be able to access a range of early intervention service providers, including speech pathologists, audiologists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists.Early intervention can make a huge difference to the development and lifelong learning of a child with a disability, and access to these services will help better prepare them for school. This initiative will see around 9,000 children of up to seven years of age who have been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome and/or sight or hearing impairments potentially benefit from these measures. Eligible children will have access to a total of $12,000 in flexible funding for early intervention services and will be able to use up to $6,000 in any one financial year.On top of this, those Australians living in outer regional and remote parts of the country will receive a one-off payment of $2,000 to assist with the extra costs of transport and other expenses that are incurred due to living in remote regions. By amending the Income Tax Assessment Act, the bill will ensure that families receiving the additional outer regional and remote payment under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative will be exempt from paying income tax on this one-off payment. This government realises the added pressures, financial and otherwise, that many people who are caring for a young person with disability in regional Australia face, and we are legislating accordingly.Schedule 2 of the bill ensures certainty for employees whose usual place of employment is overseas, specifically where they work at a remote location that is not in a state or internal territory for an Australian employer. This is otherwise referred to as a fly-in fly-out arrangement. In November last year the Assistant Treasurer announced that Australian workers in such arrangements who worked overseas would be treated the same as those in the same arrangement working in Australia. Therefore, the current fringe benefit tax exemption on travel that applies to fly-in fly-out workers in Australia will be extended to Australian workers overseas. This exemption will be backdated to 1 July 2009, when the tax changes to foreign employment income commenced. This exemption provides the certainty sought by industry regarding the fringe benefit tax implications of changes to the taxation of Australian residents employed overseas. This will improve the consistency of treatment and ensure certainty for employees and their employers.Finally, this bill will add the New Zealand governments Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust and Cancer Australia to the list of deductible gift recipients.I would like to mention a number of examples from my own electorate of Greenway that highlight why it is so important to address the issue of disability, as schedule 1 of this bill certainly does. In my first speech in this place, I made a commitment to try and improve the lives of people touched by disability. During my time here as a member I have been truly moved by the stories and experiences of the many people in my electorate who have a disability or who care for people with a disability. Over the winter recess, I visited a number of disability service providers and families who are caring for loved ones with a disability. Time and again, these people sat down and told me how difficult it is to provide care and support for clients and family members who have a disability.In June this year, I met local resident Peter Mortimer and his family during a visit to the disability service provider Ability Options in Seven Hills. Peters 25-year-old daughter, Kate, at the age of six suffered a catastrophic brain injury, causing her profound disability. After living at home with her family, Kate recently moved into a group home and receives support to manage her daily activities through the Ability Options self-managed program. Peter told me how difficult it was for Kate and the rest of his family immediately after Kates accident and during her formative years, telling me:Because of Kates growth and changing posture she has needed six custom-made wheelchairs over her lifetime and these are not something you can just pick off a shelf.For each new chair we have had to wait on average 18 months for the funding to be approved, for moulds to be taken and for the chair to be made. We even partially funded one of Kates wheelchairs as we couldnt wait—Kate really needed it for her posture and so she could engage in activities.Unfortunately, Kates story is not an uncommon one, and it is exactly why we must do all we can to help Australians who have a disability, especially younger Australians during their formative years.The Better Start for Children with Disability initiative directly aims to improve the quality of life of young people with disability. This amendment builds on this legislation by easing the financial burden on families living in remote and regional Australia who are raising children who have a disability.I want to take this opportunity to say that it is crucial we work towards easing the pressures on people with disability and on their carers. In addition to the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative, we must ensure that all Australians with a disability have the care and support they need. That is why I and a number of other members have backed the Productivity Commissions report into long-term disability care and support, and will continue to push for the implementation of a national disability insurance scheme.I also want to thank the Prime Minister and the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs for their support of the Productivity Commissions report. For too long, people living with disability in this country have been treated as second-class citizens. Throughout my electorate, people have contacted me saying we must address these issues.I am advocating for a comprehensive national disability insurance scheme that will deliver lifetime care and support for people with severe and profound disability, a strong income support system to enable people who cannot support themselves through work to live in dignity and a range of measures to facilitate increased private expenditure.Only last week I visited Northcott Disability Services, where I met an extraordinary young women named Gretta Serov—and people may have seen Gretta in the Sydney Morning Herald. Gretta has cerebral palsy. She is confined to a wheelchair and cannot speak. She told me her story by communicating through a tablet computer. Gretta told me that an NDIS would basically mean I could integrate much more smoothly into the community and it will increase my independence and quality of life by providing much needed support and transport. Gretta and the Northcott staff also highlighted how pleased they were with the Prime Ministers response to the Productivity Commissions report. Gretta went on to tell me that she is looking forward to attending university to possibly study creative writing. I have no doubt that Gretta will get to university and achieve her goals, but it is up to us to remove the unfair and unequal barriers that currently stand in her way. That is why I support the implementation of a national disability insurance scheme and encourage all members to do the same.In conclusion, as I said, this bill does three important things. The bill will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to exempt from fringe benefits tax the cost of transport for Australian residents travelling to and from remote overseas places of employment, providing certainty to employees and employers. The bill will also amend the list of deductible gift recipients to make gifts to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust and Cancer Australia tax-deductible. Finally, the bill will ease the financial strain on families in regional and remote parts of Australia who are caring for someone with a disability, by exempting their regional and remote payments made under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative from income tax. These are the right things to do for our community, and I urge all members to support this bill.","Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) ","(13:20):"
117,0,0,0,1,1,"Buchholz, Scott, MP",230531,"Wright","LP","N/A",8332," I rise to lend my support to the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill 2011. The bill is not controversial. It is broken up into three segments. The first schedule amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 in order to ensure that certain payments made under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative are exempt from income tax—and I will expand on the benefits of that later on in my speech. Schedule 2 amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to exempt from fringe benefits tax the cost of transport for Australian residents travelling to and from remote overseas places of employment. Schedule 3 amends the list of deductible gift recipients, DGRs, in the ITAA 1997 to make gifts to the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust and Cancer Australia tax-deductible. According to the explanatory memorandum, the sole financial implication of the bill is a $0.68 million cost to revenue in the 2011-12 financial year.Looking at schedule 1 in more detail, the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative, which we refer to as Better Start, provides funding for early intervention for particular disabled children. The aim of the initiative is to intervene early in the lives of such children because intervention at that stage is considered to be more effective than later treatment. In particular, it is hoped that early intervention will prepare this cohort of children for school. The disabilities covered by the initiative are cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and moderate or greater vision and hearing impairments including deaf-blindness. To be eligible for funding under the initiative, the family must provide evidence of the childs age; a confirmed, written diagnosis of a relevant disability; evidence of residential status; and the childs Centrelink customer number—relatively easy things for parents to comply with. In addition to the general benefits available to all eligible children and their parents and/or carers, those living in remote and regional Australia will also be eligible for a further, one-off payment of $2,000. This is to reflect the additional expenses associated with accessing early intervention services, including travel and home visits. My seat of Wright includes an element of remoteness, so those funds will be well sought after by people in my electorate.I am sure we would all agree that parents of severely disabled children have one of the toughest gigs in the world. Coping with the additional amount of physical and emotional care is a challenge. Children with disabilities may need regular medical attention, time in hospital or regular therapy in addition to extra care at home. These pressures, the sense of isolation and, indeed, desperation that can accompany high levels of care can place a lot of emotional as well as financial stress on a parent. The difficulties of that responsibility are only magnified if they happen to live in a regional or remote area where access to services and support are naturally harder to come by. In those circumstances, a bit of extra assistance will never go astray. To that end, the amendments contained in schedule 1 will ensure that the outer regional and remote payment will be exempt from income tax. I personally believe these amendments are entirely appropriate for families to whom every extra dollar counts.Schedule 2 speaks to the overseas fly-in fly-out FBT exemption. The bill gives an exemption from fringe benefits tax for transport from an employees usual place of residence to their usual place of employment where the employee is an Australian resident employed in a remote area overseas under fly-in fly-out arrangements. Current FBT arrangements expressly exempt transport from an employees usual place of residence to their usual place of employment, where the employee is employed under what is commonly known as a fly-in fly-out arrangement and the usual place of employment is a remote location in Australia, on an oil rig or on another installation at sea.As we reflect on the booming resources sector that Australia is incurring at the moment, we have more people who are choosing to reside on the eastern seaboard while there is a greater demand for their skills either in remote parts of Australia or offshore. Schedule 2 extends the exemption to Australians whose usual place of employment is overseas specifically where they work at a remote location that is not in a state or internal territory of an Australian employer.The extension will apply to fringe benefits provided since 1 July 2009, which is when the foreign employment income of Australian residents became assessable in certain circumstances. Previously, foreign employment income was exempt from income tax paid by the taxpayer if they had been employed overseas for more than 91 days in a continuous period. However, in 2009 the Rudd government tightened the eligibility requirements for the exemption in section 23AG of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 so that only foreign income that is directly attributable to particular activities, such as the delivery of Australias official development assistance or the persons deployment as a member of an Australian disciplined force, is exempt.Since 2009 the foreign employment income of Australians not engaged in any of those specific activities has been subject to Australian income tax. Similarly, any fringe benefits provided by the employer, including fly-in fly-out transport, has also been subject to taxation.Under the proposed amendments, while foreign employment income will still be subject to Australian income tax, the provision of transport will become exempt from FBT. Extending the exemption will ensure that Australian residents working for Australian employers in remote areas on fly-in fly-out arrangements are taxed consistently, regardless of whether they are working in Australia or overseas, as well as eliminate any possible double taxation on such benefits. The extension of the exemption will only apply to Australian resident taxpayers because foreign resident taxpayers are not taxable in Australia on their foreign sourced income.This amendment clears up an oversight from a previous tax law change. This is a fairly obvious technical oversight to previous changes that the government should not have allowed to happen in the first place. However, with the number of Australians working under fly-in fly-out arrangements increasing, it is satisfying to see that we are finally rectifying a loophole which unfairly disadvantaged those Australians who operated under similar circumstances in an overseas location.Schedule 3 speaks to deductible gift recipients. The income tax laws allow income tax deductions for taxpayers who make gifts of $2 or more to organisations registered as deductible gift recipients. To be considered a DGR, an organisation must fall within one of the general categories set out in division 30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 or be specifically listed by name in that division. DGR status assists eligible funds and organisations to garner public support for their activities.The amendments in schedule 3 add the New Zealand governments Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust, established following the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, and Cancer Australia to the list of DGRs and makes other minor changes to the DGR listings. Both charities well deserve a place on that register.In my electorate of Wright, we know a thing or two about natural disasters and we can truly sympathise with the tough time the people of Christchurch have been through over the past six months or so. Recovering from a natural disaster is an ongoing process and no doubt it will be some time yet before the physical and emotional scars have healed. Later this year I look forward to catching up with the mayor of Christchurch to discuss the personal hardship that he went through, similar to that which we went through in the Grantham area. I understand the Earthquake Appeal Trust is doing fantastic work repairing schools, restoring the citys parks and sporting facilities and laying the groundwork for the construction of an interim cardboard cathedral to temporarily replace the iconic Anglican cathedral in the city centre. I know that many Australians have donated generously to their Kiwi cousins and it is only fair that their generosity is acknowledged in this way on this register.Cancer Australia was established in 2006 to provide national leadership in cancer control and to benefit all Australians, their families and carers who are affected by cancer. The organisation works to reduce the impact of cancer and improve the wellbeing of those diagnosed by ensuring that evidence informs cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and supportive care. Everybody knows at least one person who has been tragically touched by cancer and it is the one cause to which almost everyone is happy to donate. For that reason alone, I am happy to see the Cancer Australia gift fund included on the list of DGRs.In conclusion, the coalition believes the amendments contained in the bill are worth while and, for that reason, it carries my full support.","Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BUCHHOLZ (Wright) ","(13:34):"

I am deeply disappointed and concerned about the conduct and competency of Football Queensland in its business dealings, which have been the subject of an ACCC inquiry, particularly in relation to Veto Sports.It is my understanding that the relationship between Football Queensland and Veto Sports has broken down over an allegation that has not been proved or verified. The response from Football Queensland has been unparalleled, unjust and without regard for due process of natural justice.

Rural councils were advised at about 4.35 pm on Thursday that, if sale transactions had not been finished by five oclock that evening, farm debt exit packages would not be honoured. This is a despicable decision. I am hoping with great naivete that it is just a bureaucratic mistake.I have called upon the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig, to rescind the decision. I have written to him and have put a question on the Notice Paper which will appear tomorrow. I have pleaded with him to think about the serious ramifications of this decision. People have made decisions and sold their farms. In the meantime they have had to find somewhere to live and they have entered into contracts of sale to purchase a home, either on a smaller property or in town. They have nowhere to go with this sudden impact upon them. The $150,000 grant in the exit package will not be there. Instead of retiring from farming, they are now in the awkward position where they will have to go to the bank and take out a mortgage to pay for their new home in town.I hope I am not being naive, but I hope the minister can rescind this decision if it is all about money.

124,0,0,0,1,1,"Bandt, Adam, MP","M3C","Melbourne","AG","N/A",8337," Neighbourhood houses in my electorate of Melbourne are likely to close their doors to occasional child care because of a stand-off between the federal Labor government and the Victorian Liberal government. The Take a Break program had a joint-funding arrangement until 2010, when the federal government ceased its contribution. The state government in Victoria has now removed its funding, vowing restoration if the federal component is also restored.Despite both governments claiming to value quality, affordable and flexible care opportunities for children, this political stand-off is delivering the opposite. According to research by the Association of Neighbourhood Houses and Learning Centres, which is located in Melbourne, more than one-third of occasional childcare services in Victoria may close. Areas hardest hit will be low socioeconomic areas, where families will not be able to afford the fee increases.With my Greens colleagues I am calling for the funding to be restored. The governments National Quality Framework for Early Childhood Education and Care provides a framework for such funding. Lifting the existing cap on the number of approved occasional childcare places would also assist centres. The federal minister has written to providers suggesting they may like to convert to long day care, but this ignores the important role played by occasional child care for parents in part-time, job-seeking or training positions.Tomorrow a rally will be held in Melbourne again asking the two governments to end their squabble. Neighbourhood houses in my electorate will then be meeting at my office to discuss further the future of the services that they provide.

Liz Romeo, whose GP husband, Joseph, runs the clinic, has been waiting for a private ruling from the Australian Taxation Office since February. Late last month, Narrandera communitys 6,000-plus people heard it may lose the towns only dentist, Dr Iain Douglas, because no clinic had been made available to him in the first stage of the GP superclinic. This farcical situation with Dr Douglas and now the tax bill is so typical of this government which cannot do anything right. It is a government which gives with one hand yet takes away with the other.The Narrandera clinic which opened recently is one of 64 to be built across the nation using $528 million in grants from the federal health department. By treating the grants as an income, the government can regain millions and millions of dollars, money originally intended to improve and expand on primary health services, particularly in regional areas. The initial idea of the superclinic was so that GPs could provide better facilities to their communities. However, slugging them with this extra tax will just disadvantage the doctors and in turn their patients.

Today I have such a duty. I advise the House of a tragic accident that has devastated a local family from Albion Park within my electorate of Throsby. Karen McGovern and her partner, Fernando Marino, had travelled to Melbourne on the weekend last for a birthday treat to watch the Sydney Swans play Richmond Tigers at the MCG. Karen and Fernando were on a marked pedestrian crossing in central Melbourne when they were hit by a car that is believed to have been running a red light. Sadly, they have both now died as result of their injuries. What compounds this tragedy is that their young children, aged two and five, have now been left without parents, which I am sure we all agree is one of the worst blows which you could experience in your life. It is truly shocking that all in one family could have been destroyed by such a brutal and random accident such as this, and I am sure that all members here will join me in extending our deepest sympathies to both the children and their extended family and friends.Mr Marino worked across the road from my electorate office, at the IMB at Dapto. I did not know him personally but I knew him from around the community and it is a tragedy that has touched everyone. The community is reaching out.

142,0,1,0,0,1,"Gillard, Julia, MP","83L","Lalor","ALP","N/A",8341," I thank the member for Robertson for her question. It is not that long ago, a few decades but not that long ago, that we in this country used to talk about the tyranny of distance and our economic debate was dominated by the fact that we felt remote from the markets that we most wanted to trade with. In response to that we lived behind high tariff walls with all the implications that had for real wages. It reduced the real wages available to working people over time with all the implications that had for suppressing innovation in our economy. Our economy changed as we moved away from such a tyranny of distance model and we opened our economy up to the world. We commenced the economic reforms that were necessary to change a closed insular economy into a great trading economy. Australians can be rightly proud of the economy that we have built together, a great trading economy and an economy that has come out of the global financial crisis strong, not having gone into recession and not having seen the sharply rising unemployment we have seen in other countries around the world, where millions and millions of people have lost their jobs.What was that tyranny of distance is now an opportunity for us, a huge opportunity. We are in the region of the world that is continuing to grow strongly and we are prospering from that growth. Three-quarters of Australias goods exports go to Asia—a quarter of them to China alone. These are important statistics. We continue to have a prosperous future trading with the economies of our region, which are continuing to grow.As we are in the right region of the world, we bring to this task the right economic fundamentals. We have low unemployment. We have strong prospects for growth, with $430 billion of projects in the pipeline in the resources sector alone. We have strong public finances. We have a strong banking system. This is important and is a standout in comparison to the positions of nations overseas that are coming to the economic challenges of today with high unemployment, high debt and institutional weakness.Consequently, we are here with a huge opportunity, a huge opportunity that we can seize by keeping our economy strong today and by engaging today in the reforms that our economy will need to keep it modern and strong tomorrow—that is, we have to bring the same national character and characteristics to todays reform challenges as past generations brought to the reform challenges that confronted them. That is why, to manage todays economy, we are determined to invest in skills, to invest in infrastructure, to better tax our mineral wealth and to spread those benefits through the cutting of company tax, through the growth of our pool of national savings and through special breaks for small business. Over the medium to longer term we are determined to keep investing in our productive capacity and to grow our productivity by investing in education, by investing in skills, by rolling out the NBN, by seizing the opportunities that come from a clean energy future and by bringing our reform tools to health and education.We stand in a country with strong economic fundamentals and a huge opportunity for the future.

We have been determined to look for savings. We did that in the May budget, and of course we did that in the election campaign prior to the May budget.

We have also been explaining to people that our economy has strong fundamentals and that as a nation we should be proud of those strong fundamentals because we built them together. We particularly ensured those strong fundamentals were held during the global financial crisis, where we had the combination of the reforms that this nation has engaged in over a number of decades, the decisive action of the government in providing economic stimulus and attending to banking issues, and the hard work of employers and employees and trade unions in the community.

Yesterday I reported to the House on the changing global economic conditions, and overnight we have seen further broad based weakness in the euro area. There has been some improvement in the US figures overnight but we are still going to face very substantial economic headwinds in the global economy as we go forward.In Australia we do have every reason to be confident about our fundamental economic strength. As the Prime Minister said, we avoided recession. Virtually alone amongst developed economies we avoided recession. We have low unemployment, we have low debt, we have low deficits and we are located, as the Prime Minister said, in the right part of the world at the right time.But we cannot take all of this for granted. What we have to do is put in place the fundamental long-term economic reforms that will ensure our continued economic strength. Where would Australia be today without the far-sighted reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments? I will tell you where we would be: we would have a really high tariff wall, we would have an old, rickety, fixed exchange rate, and of course we would not have the national savings that we have got through national superannuation. What we would have is an economy stuck back in the 1970s. This indicates the importance of putting in place these long-term reforms for the future, the importance of putting in place a price on carbon. You cannot be a First World, first-rate economy in the 21st century unless you are powered substantially by clean energy.We do need to boost productivity, and of course we have the NBN, a very substantial boost to productivity and a very important long-term reform. And of course we need reforms when it comes to the taxation system, bringing down taxes for small business so that they can grow. The patchwork nature of our economy makes these long-term reforms all the more important.Those opposite want to go around the country talking our economy down.

US Senator John McCain has dubbed it a train wreck while you have said the program is rubbing up against Australias cost and schedule limits. Minister, this program is vital to Australias security in light of our retired F111s, ageing FA18s and limited Super Hornets. The 14 JSF we have committed to buy will not fill the gap.

184,0,1,0,0,1,"Smith, Stephen, MP","5V5","Perth","ALP","N/A",8345," I thank the member for Denison for his question and acknowledge his longstanding interest in national security matters. Of course, Australias air combat capability is a vital part of our national security framework. I make this point crystal clear at the outset and I will also make it at the conclusion of my remarks: I will not allow, and the government will not allow, a gap in our air combat capability.Let me refer to some of the facts here. The member referred to the F111, of which we had 24. It served us very well. We now have about 70—71, in fact—classic Hornets. They are subject to an upgrade and maintenance program, and we expect that they will be retired by the end, or at the end, of this decade. We also have 24 Super Hornets—20 have arrived and four are to be delivered by the end of the year.The white paper and the Defence Capability Plan talk in terms of around or up to 100 Joint Strike Fighters at an estimated cost of $16 billion. The government has committed itself to, and announced, 14 Joint Strike Fighters. We expect the first two of those to be delivered to us in the United States for training purposes in the course of 2014-15.There are a number of advantages that Australia has in this project. Firstly, we sensibly chose the conventional variant and not the other two variants, which have been the subject of most difficulties so far as the program is concerned. Secondly, in working out our schedule and cost we put in sufficient padding to make sure that we did not suffer, most importantly, a capability gap. I was recently in the United States. I discussed this matter with Secretary of State for Defense Panetta; with Ash Carter, his assistant secretary on capability, who was recently the nominee for Deputy Secretary; and also with the Joint Strike Fighter program office itself, including Admiral Venlet.I made it clear that our concern was in the risk of rubbing up against our schedule. We are proposing, in conjunction with our Joint Strike Fighter program partners, to do an exhaustive assessment of the delivery schedule by the end of this year. The advice I have from my department is that we are in a position to wait until 2013 to make a judgment about whether alternative arrangements are required to ensure there is no gap in our capability. I am not proposing to wait until the last minute. I am proposing to recommend to the government that we make that decision next year.There is an obvious option, or plan B, which I have stated publicly in the United States and on my return here.","Defence","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[6]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr STEPHEN SMITH (Perth—Minister for Defence and Deputy Leader of the House) ","(14:24):"

190,0,1,0,0,1,"Combet, Greg, MP","YW6","Charlton","ALP","N/A",8346," I would like to thank the member for Petrie for her question. The clean energy future plan that the government announced on 10 July contains very significant support for jobs in key industries. The jobs and competitiveness program in particular provides very significant support for, and assistance to, industries in the trade-exposed and emissions-intensive sectors of the economy. This assistance, just in the first three years of the carbon price mechanism, represents $9.2 billion of assistance for those industries and, of course, it is an ongoing program.This program will be extremely important for the competitiveness of industries such as alumina refining, aluminium smelting, steel making and cement manufacturing. Industries under the Jobs and competitiveness program will be entitled to assistance in the form of free permits at the rates of 94½ per cent for the most emissions-intensive industries and 66 per cent for the moderately emissions-intensive industries. This will underpin the competitiveness of these industries by significantly offsetting their carbon liability. It will support the jobs of those employed in those industries and still, of course, maintain an incentive to reduce pollution and to invest in clean technology.The package also contains a number of other very important measures: an $800 million Clean Technology Investment Program for manufacturing businesses, a $200 million clean technology program for manufacturing businesses specifically in the metal-forging and food-processing industries and a $200 million Clean Technology Innovation Program to support business investment in low-emissions research and development in the areas of renewable energy and energy efficiency. In relation to small business there will be an increased small business instant asset write-off, which has been increased to $6,500 for depreciating assets.These are just some of the important programs announced by the government to support jobs and competitiveness. It is important that they are also appropriately represented in the debate. There are other measures, including approximately $1.3 billion to support jobs in the most methane-intensive coal mines and a $300 million Steel Transformation Plan.But, of course, none of these measures will deter the Leader of the Opposition, it seems, from his campaign of fear and misrepresentation. He has run around the country trying to terrify people in a completely unprincipled, opportunistic and irresponsible manner. He has declared repeatedly that entire industries will be destroyed and that towns and regions will be wiped off the map. It is disreputable to undermine peoples job security in this way, and it is disreputable to damage consumer sentiment in our economy with these claims.","Climate Change","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[7]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr COMBET (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) ","(14:29):"

Will the minister update the House on the significance of Australias coal seam gas industry? Why is investment certainty important for our economy, and what are the risks to that investment?","Coal Seam Gas","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[9]/question/talk.text/body/p","Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) ","(14:38):"
208,0,1,0,0,1,"Ferguson, Martin, MP","LS4","Batman","ALP","N/A",8348," I thank the member for Throsby for the question. In thinking about the coal seam methane industry, let us first be clear: this is not a new industry to Australia. On the east coast of Australia the coal seam methane industry, from a domestic point of view, currently represents 30 per cent of our east coast gas supply. In Brisbane alone it represents 90 per cent of the gas currently used. What is new to Australia is a world first—potentially the first ever world export contracts from the LNG industry. That represents $45 billion in new investment for Australia. Yes, there is some foreign investment, but, importantly, there are two leading Australian companies in partnership with international investors, Santos and Origin—ordinary Australians investing in their future, side by side with international investment.But, importantly, that $45 billion in new investment also represents, for the state of Queensland out of those three projects to date, 15,000 new jobs not only in Gladstone but in a number of regional communities that are struggling to rebuild themselves because of the challenges that have confronted the agricultural sector in recent decades. When I went to Chinchilla last August to open a new local apprenticeship training centre, the young apprentices I met and their parents were absolutely delighted with our investment in support of the industry and new apprenticeship opportunities. The parents spoke about the opportunities now to train locally, to be employed locally and to sustain those local communities. I should also remind the House that, in terms of royalties, they will principally go to the state of Queensland, because they are onshore resource developments. That means a greater opportunity for Queensland to invest in those regional communities in funding health, education and infrastructure, just to name a few of the basic requirements that those local communities expect.What really disappoints the Australian community is the endeavour by the opposition time and time again to talk down the Australian economy. That is what we have seen: rank political opportunism over the last couple of days by the Leader of the Opposition. Members of the gallery should listen: if you walk out of question time today, run into Tony Abbott and say something to him, he will agree with you. He will then walk to the next group of people, they will say the exact opposite and he will agree with them. That is what we have on the other side of the House. This is very serious. We are very fortunate as a nation at the moment, with $45 billion in new investment in the coal seam methane industry and an investment pipeline of $440 billion. We also had the Leader of the Opposition last Friday not only challenging the constitutional capacity of the state and territory governments to regulate this very important industry but also saying to foreign investors, You are not welcome in Australia. It is about time he understood that the history of Australia is that we are a trading nation built on the back of foreign investment. Companies such as Shell, Chevron and BP are investing in Australia and creating real jobs. So it is about time that the Leader of the Opposition fronted up to his responsibilities and stopped going around Australia talking about his so-called policy mix, which is nothing but populism masquerading as policy. He is a rank political opportunist and nothing but an economic vandal who has clearly shown yet again that he has no understanding of the functions of the Australian economy.","Coal Seam Gas","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[9]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (Batman—Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) ","(14:38):"

Here we go again. The question that was asked by the member went to international linking. Let me explain to him: yes, it is a linked scheme because that enables us to reduce carbon pollution at the least possible cost. There was a period when the opposition understood this and I refer them to the words of their spokesperson who said:We have unashamedly tried to source the cheapest abatement because once verified, a tonne of carbon is a tonne of carbon. And that is all that the planet knows.Because of the usual cheap politics we see, when the opposition or one of its spokespersons is in front of an audience where they think that is going to be a good message or they are in front of perhaps a business audience and they want to explain that their policy is about cheap abatement, they will say something about that. But then in a community meeting, when they think they might get away with stoking some fears about the rest of the world, they say something different. For example, the Leader of the Opposition said in complete contradiction of his spokesperson:Our five per cent target is to be achieved entirely within Australia, no taxpayers funds would be spent overseas under the policy we announced.What the Leader of the Opposition did not go on to say is: if you do not have international linking the cost per tonne of abatement is higher. Consequently to reach the bipartisan targets of five per cent, the cost per tonne of abatement paid under the oppositions policy would be greater than under the governments policy.Mr Hunt interjecting —","Carbon Pricing","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[10]/answer/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

218,0,1,0,0,1,"Roxon, Nicola, MP","83K","Gellibrand","ALP","N/A",8351," I thank the member for Banks for his interest in this topic. Members know that two pieces of legislation have been introduced into this House that will deliver the worlds first plain packaging for tobacco products here in Australia. This is likely to be debated in the House next week. Of course, it was with interest that we read reports today that the Liberal Party have made a decision formally within their party room that they will support one of those bills, but they will not support the other bill. I am disappointed to hear this.This reform is about the public health impact of smoking—that is, that we reduce the number of people in this country who smoke as much as we can and we reduce methods for tobacco companies to be able to advertise and promote their products to new smokers—and it has been supported by everybody in the public health community. The health professions across the country have supported us, including the AMA. I understand both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition—as well as others, including me—are attending the AMAs dinner tonight. The Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition might be interested to know that the AMA awarded the government their annual tobacco award this year for this particular initiative. So it is disappointing to hear that the Leader of the Opposition is going to lead his party to a position where they will support part of plain packaging, but cannot quite bring themselves to support all of it.We know that the Leader of the Opposition has never been a true believer in this measure. He had to be dragged kicking and screaming by backbenchers in his own party who understood the importance of this measure. But now we have another example, like the one Minister Combet used, of the Leader of the Opposition saying one thing to one group of people and another thing to another group of people. Today he is actually saying two things at the same time to the same group of people—that is, he supports plain packaging and he does not support plain packaging!We have two bills in place because we need to make sure that the plain packaging restrictions are clearly articulated and we need to make changes to the trademarks legislation. We have seen all sorts of protests in the media that this is an outrage, that the parliament has never seen such a reaction before and that somehow these regulations are going to be different to every other regulation and they are not going to come to parliament. But before the members opposite lock into supporting the Leader of the Oppositions position and voting against one of these bills, I think they might need to do a little bit of research. I am disappointed that the member for Leichhardt is not in the chamber when I say this because he is one of the members who would remember that in 2000 the Howard government, Mr Entsch and others, introduced a piece of legislation amending the Trade Marks Act in exactly the same way to make sure that trademarks legislation could operate effectively in an area where we know industry practice changes very quickly and quick responses by regulation are required.This is a standard procedure. It is an important part of the plain packaging legislation. It is ironic that this would be opposed by those opposite when it is actually about making sure trademark laws are retained. You have to wonder whether the 97 per cent of donations coming through to the Liberal and National parties are actually buying something here. They are going to support part of the plain packaging legislation, but they are not going to support the other part. Is this what big tobacco are getting for their money?","Tobacco Plain Packaging","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[11]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms ROXON (Gellibrand—Minister for Health and Ageing) ","(14:48):"

It is exactly the same type of misrepresentation we saw when the Leader of the Opposition was saying that coal would be out of business—he was wrong—and steel would be out of business—and he was wrong. He said that cost of living increases would be astronomical—and he was wrong. We have seen all of this play out day after day.To the members question, what I would say, of course, is that the scheme has been designed so that it is the generators of the most pollution, the biggest polluters, who pay. It has been designed to do that. If the member who asked the question somehow now has a perspective that the scheme should be more broadly based then that would truly be an eccentric move by the opposition. But, given we have heard different things on different occasions about all aspects of the scheme, I am not surprised. What the calculation about the amount of carbon pollution relates to is the amount of carbon pollution generated at a site. What happens is that, in terms of the carbon pollution, a price is paid, and businesses will adapt, they will innovate and they will reduce the amount of carbon pollution.The member then seems to conclude that all of this somehow adds up to less economic growth.

The decision is subject to a set of strict, science based conditions set at arms-length from government by the Director of Quarantine. New Zealand had taken a dispute against Australia to the World Trade Organisation and the World Trade Organisation ruled in November of last year that Australias quarantine measures were not supported by science. The Gillard government is making the right decision in implementing this science based advice. Any attempt to prevent the implementation of this decision would be extremely damaging to Australian farmers. If Australia does not fully comply with the decision of the World Trade Organisation, Australian farmers will be exposed to retaliation by New Zealand. Australia exported $8 billion worth of goods to New Zealand last year. New Zealand could retaliate against any Australian products, and they would be able to raise their tariffs on Australian goods by up to 100 per cent. For example, New Zealand could choose to target the $110 million worth of sugar that we send to New Zealand every year; New Zealand could target the $10 million worth of citrus fruit we send to New Zealand; New Zealand could target the $19 million worth of pig meat we send to New Zealand; New Zealand could target the $18 million worth of beef we send to New Zealand; or New Zealand could target our exports of stone fruit, wine, grapes or vegetables. New Zealand could target the $39 million worth of chocolate that Tasmania sends to New Zealand. The World Trade Organisation rules matter—they actually matter.I know that the Leader of the National Party does not believe World Trade Organisation rules matter, but they do—and accepted science matters. We must have a quarantine system based on science and not on the whims of politicians. Australia has actually used the WTO rules to defeat import restrictions on Australian beef and sugar. Australia is a major agricultural exporter, with more than 60 per cent of our agricultural production destined for the world export market. By refusing to comply with the global trading rules, Australia would be jeopardising its valuable export markets and the livelihoods of the farmers who depend upon them.

This government is serious about supporting families and has delivered a number of improvements over the last four years to make sure that Australian families are getting more support. We understand just how important it is for families, as they sit down every fortnight to balance their family budgets, that they have some certainty about what is going to happen into the future.One thing that families can be sure about is that this government will deliver next year around $20 billion combined through the family tax benefit, the baby bonus and paid parental leave. Families can also be certain that they will receive a number of improvements that this government has put in place. This government has put in place the 50 per cent childcare rebate; paid parental leave; the education tax refund; and, very importantly for families with older teenagers, from 1 January next year a higher rate of family tax benefit part A for those families with teenagers aged 16 to 19 in full-time secondary study.

During the break the government, through the National Reserve System, was responsible for the largest parcel of land ever purchased through the National Reserve System. Together with RM Williams, we contributed $9.1 million to a $13 million purchase price to convert Henbury Station to what will be the worlds largest carbon farm.On Henbury station, what RM Williams are wanting to do is effectively provide a template, a canvas, where they can, through trial and error, work through the best way to drive business models for carbon farming. What this will provide is an extra line of income and effectively a massive demonstration project that other large pastoralists and other farmers will be able to look at. It is using some of the best accountancy advice available.It was interesting to listen to the earlier exchanges when people were talking about which way investment goes through international linking. Just before question time I received a text message from David Pearse, who has been responsible for the project for RM Williams, who let me know that they have already been approached about international linking by major European insurance companies wanting to invest in carbon in Australia because of the Carbon Farming Initiative—wanting to pay international permits and use them in Australia through the Carbon Farming Initiative.You would have thought that the concept of the Carbon Farming Initiative was something that may have provided some level of bipartisanship across the chamber, but no. Senator Nash, when this was announced, opposed the Henbury purchase. She opposed there on the Finke River Australia being involved in the worlds largest carbon farm on the basis of the principles that had already been put by the Leader of the Opposition. He said we should not go to prime agricultural land and Senator Nash then described Henbury Station as an example of prime agricultural land.Can I make clear Henbury Station is in Central Australia. Henbury Station is in the red earth area, surrounded by desert, in Central Australia. The coalition are looking for where they are going to plant their trees. They are looking for an area five times the size of Tasmania, they are looking for an area roughly the size of Germany but they have ruled out the Darling Downs, they have ruled out New England, they have now ruled out all of the desert and they have now ruled out all of Central Australia. Where will their trees go? Where is the concept of carbon farming? There is a limit to how many trees the Leader of the Opposition can plant at Manly Beach. There is a limit to how well trees will grow if they decide to plant them in the oceans. Once you start describing the entire continent as prime agricultural land you are effectively saying that anything that goes to carbon sequestration is off the agenda. You can also add inside that black hole where sits $70 billion their entire direct action policy.","Carbon Farming Initiative","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[17]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BURKE (Watson—Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) ","(15:09):"

259,0,1,0,0,1,"Shorten, Bill, MP","00ATG","Maribyrnong","ALP","N/A",8357," I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. She is very committed to the mining industry and, indeed, sharing the prosperity of the mining boom throughout Australia. The minerals resource rent tax is about a fair deal for all Australians from Australias non-renewable natural resources. It is a very good idea. We have an unprecedented boom in the mining industry. This is due, of course, to the ongoing rise of Asian economies. We have the highest terms of trade in 140 years. Eventually the penny will drop with the opposition that this mining boom is extraordinary, the likes of which we have never seen before.Whilst this mining boom is bringing great benefits for many within the mining industry, we are also seeing at the same time a patchwork economy. Not all of Australia is going as well as the mining sector. It is important when we have benefits from the mining boom that we share the prosperity across the whole Australian economy. That is why when the Gillard government introduces the mining resource rent tax it is our intention to pass on the benefits of the mining boom to all parts of Australia. That is why we want to lower corporate tax to 29 per cent. That is why we want to raise compulsory superannuation for all Australians from nine per cent to 12 per cent. That is why we want to have better infrastructure across the whole of this continent to make sure that all can benefit. That is why we want simplified taxes for all Australians.The question I was asked also talked about inconsistency. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition thinks that miners are paying too much tax. He said it on his radio station of choice, 2GB, on 26 May. He thinks the miners are paying more than their fair share of tax now. How can he think that when Rio Tinto, Xstrata and BHP have set new records for profits in this most extraordinary mining boom? The Leader of the Opposition also says that the mining resource rent tax will kill off the industry. He said it is guaranteed. He said that in a doorstop on 10 June. Yet in that same period we have seen mining capital expenditure go from $35 billion to $51 billion this year and forecast at over $80 billion next year.The Leader of the Opposition would have you believe that raising this minerals resource rent tax is bad for the economy. On the contrary, we say to 2.7 million small businesses: This is good for you. We want you to share in the prosperity. As much as the opposition do not like hearing about inconsistency, they always take the path of least resistance. When there is the option of lazy economics they are always first to the front of the queue. They would have you believe that, if they were to form the government of this nation, they would cut the mining taxes to the richest companies in Australia, yet sack 12,000 hardworking Commonwealth public servants. They would have you believe that raising superannuation to 12 per cent is a bad idea, but they pay themselves 15 per cent. Furthermore, they would have you believe that lowering corporate tax to 29 per cent is a bad idea, yet they would put a Coles and Woolworths tax on that clanger of an idea that you forecast.In fact, the only time when the opposition are not inconsistent was on the Funniest Home Videosnews clip on Saturday in Perth. The Leader of the Opposition looked everywhere but at the question. He was struck dumb. He was like a man in a round room looking for a corner.

272,0,0,0,1,1,"Hunt, Greg, MP","00AMV","Flinders","LP","N/A",8358," The government is spending $25 million of taxpayers money on advertising its carbon tax, but it is not giving the facts, the details and the impacts and it is not telling the truth about what will happen to Australians, Australian businesses and the Australian economy under this carbon tax, nor is it telling the truth about the alternatives. Let me begin where the Prime Minister left off just a few moments ago. The member for Aston asked about the impact of the carbon tax on Mystique printing. Mystique printing is a carbon neutral business but it will still have electricity bills to pay. Mystique printing is not going to be magically exempt from electricity bills. Mystique printing, like hairdressers, pizza shops, small manufacturing shops around the country and firms of any shape, sort, type or nature that consume electricity or gas, will have higher bills to pay. The Prime Minister would not stand before this House, in the same way that her advertising campaign will not disclose the full facts and the truth to the people of Australia, and give the simple plain truth that Mystique printing will have higher electricity bills—on the governments estimate, 10 per cent alone in the first year. And that is simply on their electricity bills. It is nine per cent alone in the first year on their gas bills and, most significantly, as the New South Wales Treasury modelling has shown, a 15 per cent increase in electricity, debunking the figures provided by the government. That is in the first year, because each year and every year thereafter the cost for firms such as Mystique printing will increase. Each year and every year thereafter the costs for Australian families will increase, but the full scope, scale and nature of the impacts of this tax have not been released, have not been disclosed and have not been given to the Australian people by the government.Let us start with something very simple. This is the governments modelling. At the top of page 18 of the governments summary modelling document, there is a simple proposition. It says:Macroeconomic modelling with an initial domestic carbon price of $20 in 2012-13.Five and a half weeks after the carbon tax was released, this government has yet to release modelling which reflects even the correct carbon price. When your modelling cannot reflect the correct carbon price of $23, which is 15 per cent higher, 5½ weeks after it has been released then you know that something is not right with the government of the day. This government has directly, deliberately and consistently failed to disclose the full detail, the full impact on Australian houses and Australian homes of their system and it has been utterly untruthful in analysing the alternative model available to the Australian people and utterly untruthful in presenting the world as it is today.So let me begin, when we look at the governments failure to adequately explain its carbon tax, with the cost to families. Nowhere have I seen in any of the numerous television advertisements at taxpayers expense, in any of the numerous mainstream newspaper advertisements at taxpayers expense, in any of the local newspaper advertisements at taxpayers expense or in any of the internet advertisements at taxpayers expense the simple fact that the average Australian household will pay $515 per year more for their cost of living as a consequence of the carbon tax. There is no recognition that the New South Wales Treasury says it will have a 15 per cent impact on their electricity prices for households—for mums, for dads, for pensioners, for seniors—in the first year of the carbon tax, before increasing each year every year thereafter.That is the nature and purpose and intent of this tax: to drive down demand by driving up the cost of living in the hope that a sufficiently punitive price will cause people to shiver through winter and swelter through summer. That is the nature and goal of this particular mechanism. That is what it is designed to do. It is designed to hurt those who are least able to afford it so that they will consume less electricity. That is the structure and the intent.On numerous occasions the Prime Minister has talked about people consuming the lower cost product. Unfortunately the lower cost, lower carbon product does not exist. The lower the carbon, the higher the cost. What we see is this government intentionally driving up electricity prices. The fundamental problem with what this government is doing is that electricity is an essential service and if you drive up electricity you drive down the quality of life for Australian families.But you do not drive down the consumption significantly because people substitute not out of electricity consumption but out of the ordinary day-to-day things. Electricity goes up but consumption barely changes. On every analysis it is a largely inelastic good and so, in real human terms, families suffer. As we see in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, higher electricity prices have not made a material difference to electricity consumption but they have made a dramatic difference to the cost of living for ordinary Australian families.It goes on from that, though. These things are not set out in the governments carbon tax advertising. The fact is that we are likely to see, as the member for Bennelong has found, that in the city of Ryde $1.8 million of electricity bills for lighting will go up immediately by $270,000, according to the New South Wales Treasury. That $270,000 will either come off services to local ratepayers in the city of Ryde or it will go onto the cost of council rates. There is nothing about that in the governments carbon tax advertising.Nor is the fact that there will be over $100 million of additional landfill costs to be passed through council rates as a consequence of this tax. There are better ways of doing this that do not involve a massive increase, a $27 billion tax over three years, a $36 billion tax over four years. That is the size and scope and scale of this carbon tax and these are the figures that are missing from the governments carbon tax advertising.Nor is there reference to the fact that for dairy farmers, on some estimates provided by the industry, the average cost will be $7,000 per year more. Some of that will be passed through to consumers, but in many cases where the vast bulk of production is sent to export markets it is the dairy farmer that will face those costs. The dairy farmer on a struggling farm will meet that cost himself or herself, with the cost going straight back to the family budget and the impact on their viability.Nor do we see the extraordinary fact that this carbon tax produces approximately 25 per cent of all of the savings that the government claims will be made in terms of emissions. This is the great lie at the heart of the policy and the advertising. Approximately 100 million tonnes—according to the summary indicators document, 101 million tonnes—will be sourced from overseas. According to the deeper modelling document, 94 million tonnes will be sourced from overseas. Lets call it a rounded figure of 100 million tonnes that will be sourced from overseas and that is using abatement purchasing. That is using the very model which this government has attacked, derided, denounced and ridiculed. At the end of the day they have been forced into an abatement purchasing model.The second thing, though, is that 20 million of their 160 million tonnes comes from an incentive scheme to clean up the power stations. The difference is that we would clean them up and they would close them down. This is the heart of direct action which they have ridiculed, mocked, derided and yet adopted when it comes to the moment. That leaves the carbon tax itself being responsible for about 40 million tonnes of emissions reduction versus business as usual by 2020. What does that mean? It means that the effective cost of carbon for domestic abatement using their tax is well over $160 per tonne. It means that their system, which relies on driving up the price of electricity, is fundamentally economically unsound because it has relied upon either driving down demand by driving up price—but the history of Australian economics in the last 30 years, as Colin Barnett says, is that electricity is an essential service—or changing supply by forcing the closure of coal fired power stations where, unfortunately, their own work shows that a dramatically higher price still would be needed. In other words, their system on their own analysis does not work. Seventy-five per cent of their reduction comes from some form of direct action and 25 per cent of their reduction actually comes from the carbon tax. The carbon tax is entirely superfluous to reducing emissions.These figures are not included in any of the advertising, which is why it is so execrable. More significantly, when you look at the modelling you see that the $20 per tonne carbon price 5½ weeks later still has not been updated. How can it be, Minister Combet, that you have the wrong carbon price in your modelling? How can it be that the government of Australia has the wrong carbon price in its modelling? It is unacceptable, indefensible and incompetent. Nor has the modelling been reflected to update the fact that its assumption of 100 per cent purchase from overseas sources has been overturned by a political decision to leave it at 50 per cent purchasing from overseas sources. Nor does the modelling indicate the fact that the brown coal buyout is entirely unfunded. They already have a $4.3 billion black hole but, other than some vague reference to the contingency reserves beyond the forward estimates, there is no provisioning for the $2 billion plus that is likely to be the cost of the brown coal buyout. While we have a $10 billion program where we are completely upfront, they have a program which over nine years is likely to be well over $80 billion. What we see is a $4.3 billion black hole to start, another $2 billion that is missing and none of these figures are set out in the carbon tax advertising.Then this brings me to the extraordinary element which the Leader of the Opposition made reference to today, $3½ billion each year every year from 2020 onwards—it will start at a lower figure before then but it will climb—will be spent on purchasing foreign carbon credits from foreign carbon traders. That is Australian money going straight offshore each year with a huge impact on our national viability. According to page 72 of the governments own modelling, that figure by 2050 will be 434 million tonnes of certificates at a price in 2010 dollars of $131 at a total cost to the economy of $57 billion or approaching 1½ per cent of GDP, and that is on purchasing foreign carbon credits from foreign carbon traders.The Australian Crime Commission has found that there has been widespread fraud in Europe in relation to these credits. This is not in relation to some emerging economy. In Europe there has been massive fraud using this approach and that is what this government is proposing—1½ per cent of GDP on foreign carbon credits alone, $3½ billion by 2020 on foreign carbon credits from foreign carbon traders alone. We set out in our policy on day one—which the minister has failed to acknowledge, but I see on page 14 of the direct action policy in big blue headlines the words, Direct Action in Australia, not Overseas—that every dollar of our policy would be spent in Australia.Obviously, the minister made a false statement to parliament yesterday. He would not defend himself today. We set up from day one that every dollar would be spent in Australia. If the minister is unable to read the document, there it is in big blue letters, Direct Action in Australia, not Overseas, every dollar to be spent in Australia. The minister might do the honourable thing and apologise to the House for his express, clear and absolute misstatement yesterday because there is no defending that. He knows it, we know it, the Australian press gallery know it and the Australian people will increasingly know that we have seen deception on a grand scale. But at the bottom line at the end of the day what this government has done is that it has systemically misled the Australian people about the costs to households of the carbon tax, the costs to businesses such as Mystique printing, and the cost to the economy of $3½ billion a year straight to foreign carbon traders.

273,0,0,0,1,1,"Combet, Greg, MP","YW6","Charlton","ALP","N/A",8362," I appreciate the opportunity to explain the governments policy, but at the outset can I completely repudiate the assertion that was just made by the shadow minister that I had made a false statement to the House. That is completely incorrect and I repudiate it entirely. It was completely unsubstantiated.On 10 July the government announced a Clean Energy Future package. What we announced was accompanied by a very detailed set of materials outlining a host of the policy issues in detail including Treasury modelling and a number of other materials. At its core were a number of elements. One of them was a carbon pricing mechanism. The carbon price mechanism is an emissions trading scheme that commences with a three-year fixed price period, commencing from 1 July 2012, and from 1 July 2015 it is an internationally linked, fully flexible, emissions trading scheme—that is, it links with international carbon markets. I will return to that issue in time to address some of the comments made by the shadow minister.There were other important elements of the announcement by the government on 10 July. Within that announcement was very strong support for renewable energy and a number of measures to improve energy efficiency in households and in businesses. A very significant element of the package relates to the land sector, carbon farming and the storage of carbon in the landscape. It is a very comprehensive policy package and I do not think anyone could seriously assert that a considerable amount of detail was not provided to the community. I make that point to repudiate the general statement that the shadow minister was endeavouring to make. The policy material is principally contained in the document Securing a clean energy future. Behind it sits a very comprehensive and credible set of Treasury modelling based upon the scenarios that would appropriately underpin a major policy initiative of this nature, representing, as it does, significant economic and environmental reform. All of that material is available to the community and has been published.It is worth recalling for the moment that this is an emissions trading scheme and it has some features in common with the policy that Labor endeavoured to prosecute in the previous term of parliament. That previous proposal was at one point in time the subject of agreement with the coalition. It included important features such as the international linking of the emissions trading scheme with the international carbon markets. It is embarrassing, in fact, to hear the shadow minister repudiate so much that he stood for in the past from a policy standpoint, having completed a thesis on market mechanisms, including, I think, a set of policy propositions that he has completely walked away from. It is a pretty pathetic thing to see.The entire policy position that the government announced is underpinned by the climate science. Of course, this is another matter of contention across both sides of politics. The shadow minister professes to accept and respect the climate science, but his party is led by someone who has had 100 different positions on the science and who sends the signal to those in the community who do not respect the science that he is with them. It is the same way that he walks both sides of the street on many different issues. In a formal forum he will say he accepts and respects the science, but when it is appropriate—particularly when he is on radio in Sydney with Alan Jones, his close colleague—he will send a very clear signal that he has no respect for the science, no respect for scientists and indeed no respect for economists, who support dealing with carbon pollution by a market mechanism.It is always important to come back to the foundation of the science because the opposition has no credible policy to address what scientists are telling us. We always have to bear in mind that the empirical evidence is clear. Last year, 2010, was the warmest year on record, equal with some others. It was the 34th consecutive year with temperatures higher than the 20th century average. The warmest decade on record was 2001 to 2010, and each decade since the 1940s has been warmer than the last. This country, and many others, has a lot to lose from climate change and the warming that we are experiencing. The science is telling us that carbon pollution is contributing to the change that we are experiencing.It is an international problem. The atmosphere is global; it is not confined to any national boundaries. Australia needs to participate in discussions with other countries about how we will address this problem, because, in particular, Australia is one of the top 20 polluters internationally and the highest polluter per person of all of the developed economies. No responsible government receiving this scientific advice and recognising these statistics has any alternative but to address this issue, in partnership with the international community, by reducing its levels of carbon pollution and driving investment in clean energy sources in its own economy in order to play a responsible part internationally in dealing with this issue.It is incumbent on any government receiving this advice to act upon it. The government must take these steps to cut pollution, to contribute to international efforts to address climate change and to drive change in our own economy, but to do so at least cost to our economy, at least cost to businesses and at least cost to households. This is precisely what has driven the development of the policy that the government announced on 10 July. A carbon price mechanism, in partnership with the other elements that I described earlier, will drive cuts in pollution in our economy at least cost to the economy, to businesses and to households.It is a simple proposition, to provide the incentive to cut pollution to the largest emitters of pollution in our economy. Those polluters can reduce their liability under the carbon price mechanism by reducing their pollution. They can do so in particular by improving energy efficiency and investing in lower emissions technologies. It will be particularly important in the years to come to improve the performance of our electricity generating sector with respect to the pollution that is attendant upon electricity generation. The advantage of a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme is that the government can set emissions reduction targets. In fact, there is supposed to be bipartisan support for a set of emissions reduction targets in this parliament, in this House. The unconditional bipartisan emissions reduction targets that both sides have indicated their acceptance of is a five per cent reduction in pollution by 2020 from year 2000 levels. The carbon pollution mechanism that the government announced on 10 July will deliver at least that outcome, and that represents a reduction by the year 2020 of 160 million tonnes of carbon pollution. That is a very important commitment.The government has also indicated its intention to establish the Climate Change Authority. It will be chaired by former Reserve Bank Governor and Treasury secretary Mr Bernie Fraser. The Climate Change Authority will have the responsibility of providing advice and recommendations to government on the pollution caps that will operate under the emissions trading scheme so that from 2015, when we commence emissions trading with international linking, pollution caps will be set by regulation by government. The emissions trading scheme will achieve at least the 160 million tonnes of pollution reduction by 2020, but the Climate Change Authority may recommend further emissions reduction targets by that time. Government has the discretion, of course, to act on those recommendations.The other thing that is important in the development of an approach to tackle climate change and is represented in the policy that the government has announced is, as I mentioned, that we address change within the electricity-generating sector. One of the elements of that that is contained in the policy is the commitment by the government to seek to negotiate the closure of up to 2,000 megawatts of high-emissions, older, pollution-generating capacity in our system. The shadow minister falsely indicates that there has been no provision made for that negotiation in the material that was released; in fact, there is provision. A contingency has been made in the contingency reserve in the budget for that negotiation for the closure of up to 2,000 megawatts of high-emissions capacity. I do not think any responsible government is about to indicate what that quantum that has been provisioned may be. There will be a negotiation should some participants in the energy market wish to discuss that issue with the government, but we are not about to indicate to those players what the government may have provisioned. However, a provision has been made.A number of other important elements of the policy have also been included. The government has indicated a commitment to establish a clean energy finance corporation and make an equity investment of $10 billion. That corporation could provide loans, loan guarantees or make equity investments in an effort to assist participants in the private sector and bring some technologies to the market.","Carbon Pricing","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr COMBET (Charlton—Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) ","(15:35):"

It will have an investment mandate and it will be established in a manner that will ensure that it operates in an appropriate fashion to assist and commercialise low-emissions technologies and renewable technology—notwithstanding all the slur, slander and rubbish that comes from the other side.Importantly, having established all of these mechanisms to cut pollution and drive investment in our economy, naturally the government has also placed a lot of attention on assistance to households and businesses, in particular to households to deal with any price consequences of the establishment of a carbon price in the economy. The Treasury modelling on this is clear. There is projected to be a 0.7 per cent increase in the CPI as a consequence of introducing the carbon price mechanism. The average potential price impact on households averaged across the economy is around $9.90 according to the Treasury modelling. The government, of course, will institute tax cuts, increases in the pension, increases in family tax benefits and a host of other Commonwealth payments to offset for many households that price impact, modest as it may be. In fact, the average level of assistance provided to households across the economy is $10.10.The tax cuts will be delivered by a very important tax reform. The proposition contained in the policy material that the government will implement provides for an increase in the tax-free threshold from $6,000 to $18,200 from 1 July next year and, from 1 July 2015, an increase in the tax-free threshold to $19,400. This will mean that more than one million people will not have to submit an income tax return. It will deliver tax cuts to many households. Coupled with that, pensions and other Commonwealth payments will rise by 1.7 per cent, meaning that, contrary to the assertions falsely made by the shadow minister, nine out of 10 households will receive some assistance to meet the modest price impacts. Six million households will receive assistance to meet their expected average price impact. Four million households will receive assistance of 120 per cent of their expected price impact. Single pensioners will be better off. Coupled pensioners will be better off. Many others in that category of four million households will be better off.On top of this, the government is providing significant assistance to industry to support jobs, in particular in relation to industries that are in the emissions-intensive trade-exposed part of the economy. There is also assistance for small business. There are other measures contained in the policy announcement that are very important that interested members of the community have access to.Up against all of this is a farce of a policy from the coalition. It does not stack up. When the policy was first enunciated by the shadow minister in February 2010, it asserted that about 70 per cent of the emissions reductions it proposed could to achieve an emissions reduction target of a five per cent cut in year-2000 levels of emissions in our economy by 2020 could be achieved from soil carbons. The science is not there, and it does not comply with the international rules. It simply cannot work.

Then they win government and give in to the Greens, not in order to save the planet but to save Ms Gillards job. She is called the great negotiator. What a fool! She should have known there was no way in hell that the Greens would have supported the Liberals over the Labor Party. There was no way they were going to support Tony Abbott.

But when a Prime Minister goes to an election making such an explicit comment, then reneges on it and decides to sell out to Bob Brown and decides to speak to Bob Brown before her own backbenchers, is it any surprise that people do not believe the scant explanation and promises given on the carbon tax and the so-called compensation package? People do not believe that the CPI will increase by only 0.7 per cent—and why should they? None of the governments budget estimates or mid-year updates have been accurate in any way whatsoever. Why would the situation change now?We have seen costs go up and up and up. The carbon tax will go up but compensation will not go up. The minister talks about modest price increases, but people are already hurting. They know that they cannot trust the governments modelling; it has not been fully explained and there are many factors that have not been included. For example, where is the modelling to show the number of SMEs that will close? We know that the SME sector is very important in Australia. We know that it has the least capacity to absorb increased costs of production. We all know that, when small businesses close and larger businesses increase their market power, prices also go up. That has not been factored into the governments projections either.The government says there will be all this compensation, but what is the reality? Everyone knows that a carbon tax is intended to hurt every time you use electricity and every time you use energy. Even on the governments own figures, even if we were trusting and naive enough to believe the figures that it has provided, we see that a couple earning $60,000 each with two children would be worse off. A couple earning $60,000 with no children would be worse off. A single person earning $60,000 would be worse off. This is intended to punish consumers because that is what the Greens want. The Greens want to punish consumers. They think we probably live too affluent a lifestyle, we use too much and we consume too much; so let us just punish people—punish people into submission! If you look at average wages in professions such as teachers, ambulance drivers, accountants, crane operators, manufacturers, park rangers and physiotherapists, all of these people will be worse off.We hear about compensation to industry, but if you do not damage industry you do not need to pretend to compensate it. As Graham Kraehe from BlueScope said, any compensation would be like a bandaid over a bullet wound.","Carbon Pricing","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"

You should go to your electorate of Lindsay and speak to those people who are saying to us: Our member is letting us down. Our member does not understand how hard we are doing it. Our member does not understand how difficult it is to make ends meet. And now, instead of listening to mainstream Australia and Lindsay, our member supports the Prime Minister in sucking up to Bob Brown so she can keep her job. You are a disgrace and you should hang your head in shame.When we look at the steel industry, a very important industry, and those important workers across the country, particularly in Port Kembla, we hear the government proudly say that it is providing additional assistance to the industry. It is supposed to be $300 million in assistance, but guess what? For our two main steel companies, BlueScope and OneSteel, the total value lost on the first day that the carbon tax was announced was almost the equivalent of the package. On the second day the value that these companies lost was over $100 million. So your so-called compensation is inadequate to even make up for the loss in corporate value of our two main steelmakers. So much for compensation!This government is all about churn: punish people, bring in a program, tax it, borrow it, hand it around, move it around—a bit of trickery and a bit of deception. No wonder there is no trust in what is said. This government has not explained to the Australian people that Australian industry and Australian manufacturers are some of the most efficient in the world. Our steel producers are the most efficient in the world. They create fewer emissions and have a more efficient production process than exists in China. The government has not explained that to the Australian people. It has not said to the steelworkers: You do a great job. You are part of an efficient and effective industry. No, it has said: You are big, bad polluters. You naughty people! You make steel—the steel we need for our cars, the steel we need for our houses—you big, bad, naughty people! We would prefer to make the steel you make more expensive, to drive manufacturing offshore to countries that will create more emissions to make the same things we used to make. So we are closing down industry and closing down jobs to—guess what?—increase worldwide emissions because our manufacturing will go to places like China, where they create more emissions making the same stuff that we used to make.You have not explained any of those facts, not to your constituents and not to the Australian people. You have not actually stood up and been proud of Australian manufacturing. In industries like cement, chemicals and plastics; in the steel industry, in the car industry and the car components industry; in food and grocery processing; and in aluminium and glass making, a carbon tax is going to punish these industries and give a leg-up to imports with which they compete.So we will be sending our manufacturing offshore to increase emissions. Many Australian businesses already operate on wafer-thin margins. Does the government listen? No. When the Prime Minister was asked, What do you say to manufacturing?, she giggled, Ha, ha, ha. They will do what theyve always done. Theyll innovate; theyll get on with it. Well, Prime Minister, manufacturing businesses are facing a pretty tough time and your carbon tax will send many of them to the wall and will send many of them offshore.What will it do to households? It will hurt them even more because of the lie you spread during the last election and the lies you continue to spread now.","Carbon Pricing","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[8]","N/A","N/A"

296,0,0,0,1,1,"Dreyfus, Mark, MP","HWG","Isaacs","ALP","N/A",8368," It is a pleasure to rise on this matter of public importance raised by the member for Flinders, because it is a significant achievement for the opposition. In introducing this matter they have had to use the words matter of public importance in the context of the climate change debate.After listening to months and months of the no, no, no, no campaign waged by the opposition—which is all we have heard from the member for Flinders, all we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition and all we have heard from those opposite—I can tell members of the House that this grudging acceptance that this is a matter of public importance is about as close as we are going to get to recognition from the opposition of the importance of this environmental threat to Australia and the whole.I am more than happy to talk about the governments climate change policy, about how we are getting on with the job of legislating a carbon price for Australia and how we are getting on with the job of legislating to tackle climate change by putting a price tag on every tonne of pollution that is produced by around 500 large polluters. That carbon price will commence on 1 July 2012. I am very pleased to talk to the House about how every member of the Labor caucus since we announced the scheme on 10 July has been out there discussing the carbon price package; out there discussing the clean energy future plan that we have for Australia with communities and with businesses around the country, and about our plans to continue that discussion with the Australian people as we move to deliver this major economic and environmental reform.Of course, I will wait, because I do not think that we have yet had all of the speakers from the opposition. I must be patient; we have not heard from all of them. I will wait to hear the lament that they seem to share because they are concerned about the way that the carbon price plan for Australia has been explained by raising this matter; their lament at the impediments that have been put in the way of the government—by the opposition—in adequately explaining the carbon price.I hope that we will hear from some members of the opposition who are yet to speak about some of the misinformation that has made its way into the public debate. I fear we are going to be disappointed, because we have seen two further examples this afternoon—in the speech by the member for Flinders and in the speech by the member for Indi—of the repetition of misinformation; further repetition of false claims about the effect of the carbon price on Australian manufacturing and about the effect of the carbon price on Australian industry.What we should be hearing from those in the opposition, if they were genuinely concerned about properly debating this question with the Australian people, is a complaint about the way the Leader of the Opposition has engaged in a four- or five-month-long bricklaying, petrol-pumping, fish-slicing fear campaign that has done so much to crowd out genuine debate on this issue. They might pause to reflect on the full spectrum of the misinformation that the opposition has been spreading about the carbon price plan, which has now included singing and dancing in the Senate, Shakespearean recitals, made up figures, made up facts, the wall of Weet-Bix, denial of climate change—apparently followed by a reluctant acceptance of climate change—some cameos with Pauline Hanson and also, really, just an exploration of the red-cordial-induced limits of silliness. I know there are a few speakers from the opposition yet to speak. Perhaps we will hear from them and I must wait. In contrast to what can only be described as the completely unprincipled and disgraceful campaign from the Leader of the Opposition, assisted by the member for Indi in particular, where the opposition has sought to misrepresent the governments position across the country and instil in Australians fears about their job security and cost-of-living pressures that are completely unjustified, the government will continue to explain the carbon price package, the clean energy future plan, to the Australian people, and I am looking forward to continuing to do this in the months to come. In the past few weeks I have visited communities in Victoria, in Queensland, in the ACT and in New South Wales, and I have spoken to businesses, to community leaders, to people at retirement villages and to people at bowls clubs about how Australia is going to be implementing this carbon price and about the financial benefits to our country of implementing this carbon price. I have met with people in communities who want to know the details of the assistance that is going to be coming their way under the clean energy future plan, about the assistance that is going to go to nine out of 10 households, about the tax cuts that are going to go to everyone in this country who is earning under $80,000 a year and about the extra benefits that are going to be flowing to everyone in receipt of a pension or a government benefit.This is in contrast to the kind of fantasy land inhabited by the member for Indi, who this afternoon was again repeating—but in a particularly egregious fashion—elements of the oppositions scare campaign about the steel industry. She made a remarkable misattribution of the time at which Graham Kraehe spoke; I have had it checked while I have been waiting to speak, and in fact he spoke on 22 March this year, so it was some months before the carbon price package was announced. Graham Kraehe is, of course, the chair of BlueScope. I think it is more important to look at what the two steel companies of our country, OneSteel and BlueScope, said about the carbon price plan after it was announced. We have Geoff Plummer, the managing director and CEO of OneSteel, saying in his release to the Australian Stock Exchange—a formal document—on 10 July 2011:We believe that on balance, the sectoral approach announced today by the Prime Minister for the steel industry, including the introduction of the—Steel Transformation Plan—is both appropriate and sensible. We are pleased that the Government has responded by adopting this approach.I then go to the BlueScope response, contrary to what was suggested by the member for Indi. This is Paul OMalley, managing director and CEO of BlueScope Steel, speaking on 11 July 2011, the day after we released the clean energy future plan:This is a pragmatic solution to a complex problem.BlueScope said:… the Government’s proposed new Steel Transformation Plan (STP) recognised the Company’s long-standing call for a sectoral approach to a carbon tax in Australia.Mr OMalley said:The STP will provide funds to minimise the impact of the carbon tax on the Australian steel industry for the first four years … And it signals the Government’s intention to limit the potential pass-through of Scope 3 coal emissions costs onto steelmakers … In summary, the STP materially reduces the overall cost of the carbon tax on BlueScope. … The Government has listened to our arguments and our deep concerns about the carbon taxIn the STP it has produced a package—and so on. Those, of course, are not the words that the member for Indi wants to hear, and that is why she did not quote from actual commentary made by Australias two steel companies after the announcement of our clean energy future plan.We have the situation that the oppositions scare campaign is falling apart day by day. As more and more Australians learn the details of the governments clean energy future plan, there will be less and less concern. Because there is less and less concern as Australians learn of the details of the assistance going to nine in 10 Australian households, we are seeing more and more shrillness and nonsense spoken by those opposite and more and more misleading statements—anything rather than actually quoting from what the steel companies are telling Australians, anything rather than actually quoting from our plan and anything rather than explaining to the Australian people that there is in fact assistance coming to nine in 10 households.By the end of next year—I know that is a long time off for the short-term people on the benches opposite to even contemplate—a few months after the introduction of the carbon price on 1 July 2012, which I know is a long time for those opposite to think about, Australians are going to be saying: What on earth were the opposition banging on about? What on earth was the Leader of the Opposition banging on about? What on earth was the member for Indi banging on about as she went around Australia trying to drum up fear by spreading misinformation and misrepresenting the effect of the carbon price? As for the inaction policy of the coalition, it is not capable of meeting the target which the Liberal Party claim to share.

He commented on the fact that the Prime Minister said from on high: Go out and sell the carbon tax. Go out and make your voices heard. Go out and tell the Australian people why higher power prices are going to be so good for them. And do you know what the response was, Mr Deputy Speaker? The response was silence, because I have to say I did not hear too many marginal seat members out there selling the benefits of higher electricity prices and job losses. I did not see too many marginal seat members saying too much at all about the carbon tax. In fact, they were running and hiding. I have to say that, if you wanted to see the definition of someone looking sick, it was a Labor marginal seat holder when the Prime Minister came to visit to sell the carbon tax, because it is a toxic tax that nobody wants and you are deluding yourselves to think any differently. This day, one day after the first anniversary of that notorious statement that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led, the Prime Minister needs to explain why she is so intent on doing so much damage to the Australian economy, on destroying jobs, on driving up the cost of living and on cruelling small business and large business. We have a situation where the world is facing very challenging and very uncertain times. Just yesterday the Treasurer said there had been:… big swings in global share markets, a downgrade to the US governments triple-A rating … and a rapid rise in borrowing costs facing Spain and Italy.He continued:In uncertain times like these, it is more important than ever that we have a mature debate about our economy and where it is heading …Yet at the same time his government is imposing a carbon tax which will increase the cost of doing business, that will cost jobs, that will slow growth and that will damage our economy. This is no time for this negligent Prime Minister to be introducing a carbon tax that is going to do so much damage to Australia.Overnight, Germany announced that their GDP slowed to almost a standstill in the second quarter of 2011, increasing only 0.1 per cent, down from 1.2 per cent in the previous quarter. Markets took a dive again overnight over fears that France is struggling to deal with its debt crisis, which totals 85 per cent of French GDP, some €1.65 trillion. Countries like Greece and Spain are struggling with trillions of dollars of debt brought on by governments spending more than they can afford. There is a crisis of confidence in the world economy. The US government owes US$14.6 trillion. Australia must ensure that our economy remains as stable as possible and not do anything to threaten our growth.Instead, what is this government doing? This government is intent on imposing a tax that is going to reduce our international competitiveness. This government is intent on imposing a tax that is going to make it harder for businesses to generate growth, generate jobs and continue to allow Australia to prosper. In the labour market, Qantas has announced 1,000 job losses—that is before a carbon tax is going to hit; OneSteel has announced 400 job losses; Channel 10 has announced 150 job losses; and Westpac has announced job losses. What is the governments policy response? You are going to impose another great big new tax. Is that good policy? You guys are dreaming if you think that is going to help our economy prosper. If you think that is going to aid this country to grow you are in dreamland. At a time of global uncertainty the government is reducing the ability of Australian businesses to compete, and there is no question that that is going to result in job losses.Australia is dependent on exports to maintain our economic growth. The Treasurer said after the budget in May:With the right policies and decisions, we can convert an unprecedented mining investment boom into an opportunity boom for more of our people.The carbon tax is the wrong policy at the wrong time to capitalise on Australias competitive advantages. We are dependent on China for much of our exports. In 2010, Australias exports to China totalled $58 billion or around five per cent of our GDP. If demand in China for Australian resources were to collapse, it would greatly impact our economic growth. But our threats are not limited to a potential slowing of growth in China. Australia exports $18 billion to the European Union each year and a further $9 billion to the United States. Both the EU and the US are certainly encountering huge economic challenges, and this tax is not going to do anything to assist Australia in combating the potential impacts of those challenges.The fallout from the problems overseas could have major impacts on our exports and major impacts on Australian companies. We already have this government planning to impose a mineral resource rent tax on our mining exports. This Prime Minister really does have to come into this House and explain why she is doing that. The Prime Minister promised she was going to wear out her shoe leather to tell the story, but I can report to this House that her shoes are in perfect condition.

What a ridiculous situation to put our very fine industries in, a position where for the foreseeable future they are dependent on government largesse—largesse that can be taken away with the stroke of a pen. She would be making our very important industries dependent on government subsidies to survive. It is an absolutely ridiculous situation. It is an absolutely ridiculous policy. The Prime Minister also needs to explain the untruths that she is peddling about the rest of the world allegedly running lemming-like to throw themselves over a cliff, just like she is trying to do to the Australian economy. She is trying to claim that the US is making great strides in relation to an emissions trading scheme. The reality is that is false; that is untrue. We saw the 10 western American states abandon their plans for an ETS. We saw the eastern state of New Jersey withdraw from a carbon trading scheme. We saw the closure of the carbon exchange in Chicago.I see the Labor members shaking their heads. Their constituents are shaking their heads that their local members would be imposing such a tax on them. We see the US retreating from a carbon regime. The New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, said that the scheme:… does nothing more than tax electricity, tax our citizens and tax our businesses with no discernible or measurable impact upon our environment.I think he has captured the situation in Australia perfectly.We have a government that has attempted to mislead the Australian people. We have a Prime Minister who refuses to say why she is imposing this tax. We have a Prime Minister who promised to wear out her shoe leather, but she did nothing of the sort. After a few days out in the field she saw the response the Australian people were giving and she ran for cover—and she has got a lot more running to do before the next election.","Carbon Pricing","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[13]","N/A","N/A"

303,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation","HVN","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mrs DATH: I have to acknowledge a well-known and very talented actor, Noni Hazlehurst, who was recently on Q&A. She made the comment that she has worked with a lot of children and has dealt with the terrible twos, where two-year-olds just say, No, no, no to everything. I think what has been proven today is that you do not have to be two years old to chuck a tantrum. The member for Indi was very good at chucking a tantrum today, so I think Nonis comment on Q&A the other week was certainly appropriate in relation to the way that the opposition is dealing with policy in this country; it is about opposing everything.The reality for the Leader of the Opposition, if you want to talk about explanations, is that the people in my electorate are eager to learn more about the clean energy future plan, and we should not treat these people as fools. They do understand. When you go out, when you talk to them and when you provide them with information, they understand why it is important we act, why it is important that we put in place an interim fixed carbon price for three years and why it is important in 2015 that we move to a market based mechanism for a carbon price. They understand this. They understand also that that will come with some cost. They also understand that it is the federal Labor government that is stepping up and providing assistance to households and also supporting industry and jobs and investing in clean energy and renewables.What the people in my electorate do not understand and are wanting an explanation for is where the opposition think they are going to get the money to support their climate change policy—for what it is worth—to meet what they claim are the same targets that have been set by this government. Today in question time the Prime Minister said that both parties are committed to the same targets. The Leader of the Opposition sat there and shook his head. He shook his head, saying, No, no, no; we havent got the same targets. So each day we do not know whether they are committed or not to dealing with climate change.To give the Australian people some insight as to the oppositions commitment to dealing with climate change, we only need to go back to the recent comments by the shadow Treasurer when being interviewed on Lateline by Tony Jones. He was asked: You say that if you get into government you are going to scrap 12,000 Public Service jobs. Where would you cut these 12,000 Public Service jobs from? What about the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency? The shadow Treasurer said that he does not believe any of their modelling. When asked the question, Would you consider disbanding the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency? there were no ifs and no buts—the shadow Treasurer said yes.It is not just all the jobs that would go—and they are worried about the economy and they are talking about actually taking away jobs—but it is the fact that they say they have a climate change policy at the same time as the shadow Treasurer is saying, Oh, if we get into government, there goes the whole department. We dont need a department to look into climate change, clean energy or renewables.These are the explanations that need to go out to the Australian people. This is what the Australian people want to hear. If the Leader of the Opposition is going to go out there and run a scare campaign—we heard it from the member for Indi today; we heard it from the member for Cowper—talking about closing industries, loss of jobs, cost-of-living increases and damage to the economy, where is their alternative policy? How is it being costed? Where are all these trees covering the size of Tasmania and Victoria combined going to be planted? We heard the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency talking about that in question time today.The opposition talk about alleged increases in the cost of living. Modelling by Treasury has estimated a 0.7 per cent increase on the CPI for our country to take the historic step of addressing climate change and implementing a carbon price. What you do not hear from the other side when they criticise the modelling done by the same department and the same people who did the modelling for the GST is that when the GST was introduced it actually created an increase of more than three per cent on the CPI. But we do not hear them going out and telling everyone that. They would not want to go out and actually compare the Howard governments policies and actions to what this government has done since it came in during 2007, because if they did that they would be embarrassed and shown for what they are: a party that just believes in opposing for the sake of opposing and who want to engage in popular politics—and they do not care what that means. If it means saying one thing one day and something else the other, that is what they will do. The Prime Minister, the cabinet—every member of this government—has been out explaining to people across Australia what this clean energy future plan is all about.The Leader of the Opposition has been trying to do that, going out talking about Labors policy, talking about their policy a little bit. He is starting to have a bit of a problem there.","Carbon Pricing","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[5]","N/A","N/A"

Just a little bit of a problem there—he couldnt get into a butchers. He lined up all of the media to do another stunt. We have done the Weet-Bix and everything else. The Leader of the Opposition tried to set up his little media stunt with a local butcher, but it all came apart because the butcher didnt want a bar of it.The reality is, despite all the huff and puff from those on the other side—a lot of allegations thrown around—there is very little statistics, very little fact. Why? Because they would rather go out into businesses and run scare campaigns. They would rather go out there, get attention and say that whole industries are going to shut and jobs are going to disappear. But in fact we know that that is not true. Members of the opposition again stood there today making all these allegations—talking about steel, talking about manufacturing, talking about mining but definitely not quoting anyone. Of course they would not want to quote David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, who on 31 July 2011 wrote to the Prime Minister of Australia saying:I was delighted to hear of the ambitious package of climate change policy measures you announced on July 10 and wanted to congratulate you on taking this bold step.You would not want to quote Cameron Clyne, the NAB CEO, saying:“If you’re asking for an economic assessment of the two, the carbon price followed by an ETS is economically superior to the direct action policy,” he said.“It will drive certainty, it will drive investment, so as a straight comparison between the two, that’s the choice.”We had comments from the bank chief economist supporting that. We have OneSteel CEO saying:We believe that on balance, the sectoral approach announced today by the Prime Minister for the steel industry, including the introduction of the STP is both appropriate and sensible. We are pleased that the Government has responded by adopting this approach.BlueScope managing director and CEO on 10 July said:This is a pragmatic solution to a complex problem.None of those quotes were made today by the member for Indi, the member for Flinders or the member for Cowper when they stood here and claimed that jobs would be lost in steel manufacturing, that industries would close down, that there would be cost of living increases.

308,0,0,0,1,1,"Macklin, Jenny, MP","PG6","Jagajaga","ALP","N/A",8375," by leave—Last week I visited Rod and Janette Mattingley, and their 25 year old son, Thomas, who live in my electorate of Jagajaga in the north-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Thomas has been severely disabled since birth. He has cerebral palsy, epilepsy and scoliosis. Rod and Janette have provided almost constant care for him since birth. Rod and Janette kindly opened their home to me and talked me through their days with Thomas and their experiences of the disability service system.The Productivity Commissions final report into the long-term care and support of Australians with disability, which the Prime Minister released last Wednesday, judged the disability service system to be unfair, underfunded and fragmented. It is a judgment that sums up the daily frustrations and inconsistencies that the Mattingleys—and thousands like them—face each day. The system of disability services in Australia today is letting people down. This government asked the Productivity Commission to examine reform of disability support services because we believe that the system we have today is not delivering the kind of care and support Australians expect for people with disability.The Productivity Commission has recommended a national disability insurance scheme that would entitle all Australians to support in the event of significant disability. The scheme would provide individually tailored care and support to around 410,000 people with significant disabilities. It would be accompanied by a national injury insurance scheme to provide no fault insurance for anyone who suffers a catastrophic injury.The Australian government shares the vision of the Productivity Commission for a system that provides people with disability with the care and support they need over the course of their lifetime. We understand that the system needs more funding, and people with disability need more services and support. We also understand that the system needs a complete transformation to deliver the kind of care and support the community expects for people with disability. We are acting on both fronts, right away. We are already doubling Commonwealth funding to the states and territories, who deliver disability support services. We have more than tripled the rate of indexation from 1.8 per cent under the previous government to 6.3 per cent today so that our investment in services grows faster. We are investing in people with disabilities and those who care for them, by delivering record pension increases to people on the disability support pension and the carer payment. We have increased the maximum rate by around $128 a fortnight for single pensioners and $116 a fortnight for couples since September 2009. To improve access to services for people with disability and to drive reform, including in access to mainstream services like health and education, we have launched a National Disability Strategy, and to support carers and to shine a light on their work, we have recently released a National Carer Strategy.We are making headway in overhauling key aspects of the disability support pension to better support people with disability into work wherever possible, because we know that many people with disability do want to do more. We are investing $3 billion over the next four years in uncapping access to Disability Employment Services, so people with disability know they can get help to give work a go. Under the previous government, people with disability could wait up to a year for help to get back into work.We are helping parents of children with disabilities to access early intervention services through the Better Start for Children with Disability program. Under this program, around 9,000 children with cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome, and sight or hearing impairments will be eligible for up to $12,000 of services under the program over four years. Since 1 July this year, when the Better Start program began, 725 Australian families have registered for funding for early intervention services for their children. Since 2008, more than 12,000 children with autism spectrum disorders have accessed early intervention services through the Helping Children with Autism package.To meet the need for community based supported accommodation places for Australians with disability, we have established a new $60 million fund to build up to 150 innovative supported accommodation places. This builds on the $100 million capital injection we delivered in 2008 to build more than 300 places for people with disability. These are important investments, and they are being delivered to people with disabilities, their families and carers right now. But we know we need to do more. That is why this government asked the Productivity Commission to undertake this major inquiry. We know the disability service system will not be repaired by increases in funding or more services alone. Both are necessary, but not sufficient. People with disability, their families and carers have argued that the system needs a complete overhaul. The Productivity Commission has agreed. And so do we, the Australian government.The disability service system needs a complete overhaul so that it, first and foremost, meets the needs of the individual. It needs to take an insurance approach that meets the care and support needs of a person with disability over their lifetime—and not the crisis-driven approach of the past. The Productivity Commission has set out a clear vision for change. The commission recommend work start right away, with the launch of a scheme in selected sites around the country in mid-2014 and they also recommend the progressive rollout of a national disability insurance scheme to full operation by 2018-19.The report from the Productivity Commission demonstrates that we do have a lot of work ahead of us. Under the recently signed National Health Reform Agreement, the states and territories have primary responsibility for the funding and delivery of disability support services. Reform of the disability service system must therefore be done with the states and territories. This Friday, the Prime Minister will ask the Council of Australian Governments to establish a select council of ministers from the Commonwealth, states and territories to drive disability reform. We are starting work right away, to lay the foundations for reform and get disability services, as we like to call it, NDIS-ready—ready for a national disability insurance scheme. This means working with the states and territories to develop common assessment tools, so that peoples eligibility for support can be assessed fairly and consistently, based on their level of need. It means putting in place service and quality standards, so that people with disability can expect high quality support irrespective of what disability they have or how they acquired it. It means building workforce capacity so we have more trained staff to support people with disabilities. And it will also include developing rigorous timelines, milestones and benchmarks to support the delivery of these and other essential foundation reforms, and to hold governments accountable for progress.Much of this work has commenced through the National Disability Agreement. But this work must now be accelerated and extended because these, and other matters, are essential foundations for a national disability insurance scheme. Consistent with the recommendations of the Productivity Commission, we have announced an immediate $10 million to support this technical work. This is in addition to our increased funding for the states and territories to deliver disability services through the National Disability Agreement. We have also announced an advisory group to work with the new select council on the design and oversight of activities to build the foundations for reform. This work will be led by Dr Jeff Harmer AO, supported by Mr Bruce Bonyhady AM and Dr Rhonda Galbally AO. Others will be added once further consultations have taken place.And in response to the Productivity Commissions recommendations for the states and territories to harmonise their approach to catastrophic injury, the government will convene a working group led by the Assistant Treasurer to work with state and territory governments, lawyers and other stakeholders to progress this element of reform. Work is already underway. And it will continue as we lay those foundations which are essential for reform, and are necessary precursors to the launch of a national disability insurance scheme. Future reform of disability services will require investment from all levels of government and it will require our shared commitment to fundamental reform, a complete overhaul, so that it delivers the kind of care and support we expect for people with disability. The Australian government is committed to this reform. We believe that people like Thomas Mattingley deserve quality care and support and that people like his parents, Rod and Janette Mattingley, should be supported and have certainty in Thomass continuing care.I ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Menzies to speak for 11½ minutes.Leave granted.","Disability Services","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga—Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) ","(16:33):"

310,0,0,0,1,1,"Andrews, Kevin, MP","HK5","Menzies","LP","N/A",8378," Approximately 20 per cent of the Australian population have a disability—that is, some four million people have a disability—and there are some 2.6 million carers. The coalition believe that continuing support for these Australians is important. It is in this context that we have already indicated our in-principle support for the establishment of a national disability insurance scheme. The reality is that the current system is broken. It is inconsistent and lacks coordination. Support is determined not by need but by how a disability was acquired. Indeed, the Productivity Commission has found that the current system is underfunded, unfair, fragmented and inefficient and gives people with disability little choice and no certainty of access to appropriate supports. Currently support depends on a number of factors: what state you live in, whether the disability is congenital or was acquired, and, if acquired, whether it was acquired in the workplace, a motor vehicle accident or some other context.There is a level of care which families and informal carers want to provide and should provide for their loved ones with a disability, but there is also a level of care which it is unreasonable to expect to be undertaken without some support, and in some cases some very considerable support, from the wider community. Importantly, any response to disabilities must be a combined federal, state and territory response. At present, total government expenditure is around $7 billion per annum. The Commonwealth contributes about $2.3 billion and the states and territories contribute around $4.7 billion.The reality is that the status quo is no longer an option. Australians with disability and their families deserve a better deal. Good economic management of course is key to providing a better deal, to providing real reform and real support. Expressions of goodwill and statements of good intent are no longer good enough. Every Australian should feel disappointed by what is initially a weak response on the part of the government to the Productivity Commissions report. This Labor-Green alliance has a history of overpromising and underdelivering. This government has a history of making announcements that are empty and tokenistic, announcements that are never actually acted upon. Expressions of goodwill and statements of good intent are simply no longer good enough. The government should provide a clear timetable for change and a clear and definite funding envelope. They cannot have it both ways. They cannot be keen to push the envelope on their great big new tax on everything but not push the envelope to repair a system that impacts on some of the most vulnerable members of our society.The coalition remain concerned, with good cause, about the governments ability to deliver the complex reform needed in this critical area, so we will monitor its implementation closely because we have seen time and time again the disasters that the Labor-Green alliance has presided over. Anyone who has seen the detail of the governments announcement, seen the paltry $10 million commitment, knows that Labor could have done better. Imagine how much more they could have done without the waste and mismanagement—with no pink batts, no school hall rip-offs, no program failures and no NBN. Australians might not know that the Productivity Commissions final report found that the current unmet need for support for Australians with disability is some $6.5 billion. That is roughly equivalent to the Gillard governments current annual debt interest repayments.Australians with disability, their carers and their families are not focused on funding options. They just want the system fixed. The government has raised the hopes of these families, so it is now up to the government to outline how it will deliver. That is why it is so disappointing that the governments response has not identified at this stage any funding envelope.The government are, I fear, incapable of reforming anything. Their strength lies in waste, mismanagement, bungling programs and doing nothing. I suppose there is some hope that they at least have put $10 million up.","Disability Services","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ANDREWS (Menzies) ","(16:45):"

313,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation","HK5","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr ANDREWS: I will respond to the interjection. People with disabilities have said to me over the last week that they are concerned that this government, given its history of mismanagement and incompetence, is not in a position to be able to deliver. If it were, then we might have seen more.You cannot talk about reform without also talking about the disability support pension. About 800,000 people are on the DSP, at a cost of $10 billion to $13 billion per year. This represents about five per cent of all Australians of working age. The Prime Minister says she wants to tackle the issue; however, again you see Labor with a poor record on welfare reform. In the early years of the last decade attempts by the Howard government to reform welfare were stymied by the Labor Party. It was not until the coalition gained a majority in the Senate in 2004 that welfare reform actually occurred, in the face of Labor resistance.Australians wish to be secure in the knowledge that a safety net and social support system will always be available to them if it is genuinely needed. However, at a time of strong jobs growth and emerging labour and skill shortages during the late 1990s and early 2000s the number of working age people in receipt of income support grew to over 20 per cent of all working age Australians, or more than 2.7 million people. Only a small percentage of this number had participation requirements tied to their income support. Seven hundred thousand were on disability support pension and 618,000 received at that stage the parenting payment. Both of these payments were more generous than Newstart allowance, which is received by the unemployed. There were more people receiving the DSP than there were on unemployment benefits.This highlighted that people with disabilities in particular had a very low rate of participation in the workforce. Less than 10 per cent of people receiving DSP undertook any work, including many people who had significant work capacity. Approximately one-quarter of all DSP recipients in Australia suffer from psychological and psychiatric conditions. Such conditions are often episodic, and due regard has to be given to how we could more appropriately deal with the situations that many of these people find themselves in when they have an episode which leaves them unfit for work.There are substantial barriers which prevent people with disabilities from participating both in the workforce and in everyday life. They include physical barriers, such as access to transport, and mental and psychological challenges. Whatever shape or form they come in, these barriers have been unfortunately reinforced by negative community attitudes and a low expectation of people with disabilities, and this has contributed to many people with disabilities feeling a sense of disempowerment. Governments, business and the disabled themselves must work together and set about removing these barriers and negative stereotypes. People with disabilities acknowledge that they want to be more economically active. The disability support pension should not be a dead-end payment, as unfortunately so many see it today.The principal object of reform, therefore, should be to encourage and assist more and more people to contribute and participate positively. The Henry report, for example, laid out one approach to welfare reform. If the government deals only with funding a scheme and does not tackle the more important issue of getting people back into the workforce where that is appropriate and able to be achieved, then it will not resolve the problem. The Prime Minister talks about addressing the issue, just like she said in 2009 that getting people into work was her priority. It remains to be seen whether this is just another empty promise from the Labor government.The coalition remain committed to supporting Australians with disability. We can only hope this government can actually deliver some of what it has promised.","Disability Services","MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[9]","N/A","N/A"

The motion before us passed the Senate on the voices and has been sent to the House for concurrence.Parliament House easily has the capacity to meet this challenge and the Department of Parliamentary Services has the capacity to facilitate these reduction targets. Other organisations that have signed up to the 10 Per Cent challenge include Bunnings, Visy, Unilever, Toyota, Sensis, the University of Canberra and, notably, News Limited. I for one would hate to see a situation where this Parliament House was trailing News Limited when it came to energy innovation initiatives.One of the practical consequences will be to provide some real leadership from this parliament to Australians about the benefits of cutting their electricity bills through energy efficiency. It is clear that one of the greatest steps we can take to reduce energy use is also the one that is going to reduce peoples power bills. That is true in the home. It is estimated that somewhere between 30 and 40 per cent savings can be made on energy bills simply through energy efficiency measures. And that is true here. By reducing our reliance on energy here in Parliament House we will of course be saving a significant amount of taxpayer dollars.

319,0,0,0,1,1,"ONeill, Deb, MP",140651,"Robertson","ALP","N/A",8381," I rise to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill 2011. This bill makes three changes to Australian tax laws further modernising our taxation system and ensuring that our taxation system takes account of the most disadvantaged in our society. I strongly support the first initiative in this bill which is aimed at promoting early intervention for children with disabilities. Under the system known as the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative, which the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has just outlined and that was announced as part of the governments election commitments on 29 July 2010, I am proud to be a member of a government that has fulfilled a commitment to improve the long-term outcomes for children with disabilities. I have long believed that we must not consider children with a disability as necessarily placing a significant burden on the state. Indeed, as a teacher and now as a parliamentarian I have long observed the incredibly positive contribution that people with disabilities play in our community at all ages and stages of their lives. It is always important to reaffirm the vast variety of disabilities of differing degrees that people are affected by and to identify within that incredible talents and abilities as well.Early intervention initiatives have proven immensely successful in improving the lives of children with a variety of disabilities. Indeed, intervention at the early childhood stage of development is now considered to be much more effective than later treatment. The Better Start for Children with Disability initiative funds early intervention for children with certain developmental disabilities which the minister recently outlined. This amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 ensures that the outer regional and remote payment made under the Better Start for Children with Disability initiative is exempt from income tax. I find this reform very encouraging because it will ensure that financial assistance is available and secure. Funding under this initiative is available to families after evidence is provided of confirmed written diagnosis of disability. Whilst this eligibility regime is a necessity, as a community I say again we must always remember that people, including particularly children with disabilities, are never to be defined by those disabilities. While definitions of disability are a necessity in relation to the administration of these tax and social security benefits, we have to be mindful of the inherent limitation of labels, to see the abilities of all, and to celebrate the gifts that kids with disabilities bring to their families, to their school communities and to their broader communities.The provision I mentioned here provides a further one-off payment of $2,000 to parents and carers who are living in rural and regional communities in Australia who require assistance to get their young child with a disability to the type of care and support that they deserve and they need. This element is a vital component to the scheme because parents and carers living in remote and regional areas experience far greater difficulty in accessing services than we would like to be the case. I believe that the additional $2,000 will help remedy this by enabling additional expenses such as travel for doctors appointments and transport to be able to be covered. This social program represents a very smart investment by government.By investing in early intervention we not only improve real life outcomes, we also save on health costs. By intervening early we are increasing the likelihood that individual children with disabilities will lead happy, independent and fulfilling lives. By establishing support services early in life, it is likely that children with disabilities will grow up much more engaged with and active in their communities. I am proud to support a government committed to improving the life circumstances for people with disabilities. It is a core Labor value to support the most disadvantaged in society. Our record shows that our policy decisions are not just geared to ensuring the greatest good for the greatest number but always retain within our legislative program compassion, empathy and a belief in supporting those who might be less advantaged. I believe that this legislation is complemented by our plan to introduce a national disability insurance scheme, a once in a generation reform that will directly improve and transform the lives of people with disabilities and those of their families.Another important reform contained in this bill is the amendments to the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 in particular in relation to transport from an employees usual place of residence to their usual place of employment. This bill will provide an exemption from the fringe benefits tax for transport from an employees usual place of residence to their usual place of employment. This amendment operates in the circumstances where the employee is an Australian resident employed in a remote area overseas under what is commonly known as a fly-in fly-out arrangement. Our taxation system should not act as a disincentive for people to work under a fly-in fly-out arrangement.Also as stated by the minister in his second reading speech, this measure ensures that any possible double taxation is eliminated. Taxing transport provided under these arrangements may also result in economic double taxation, with an Australian employer paying FBT on transport provided to an employee employed under a fly-in fly-out situation. Our taxation system needs to take into account the fact that Australians work and engage in a global economy, and working overseas is necessarily a component of this. The amendments improve the fairness and integrity of Australias tax system by better targeting the tax exemption for income earned by Australians overseas. As a result, most Australian residents earning employment income are now treated more consistently.The third important change that this legislation brings is one to our recognition of charitable donations and adds a new fund to the list of deductible gift recipients. DGR status will assist the listed organisations to attract public support for their activities. It will allow those who wish to donate more than $2 to deduct the amount from their tax for that year. The Charities Aid Foundation, a body representing charities in the United Kingdom, has recognised Australia as the most giving nation in their annual World Giving Index.The giving index aggregates three key factors: money given to charities by a nations citizens, time spent volunteering, and how willing a nations citizens are to help strangers. Australia and New Zealand were shown to be the most giving nations. It is a testament to the Australian character that we are so willing to give. We are willing to give our time to friends and family, to give support to strangers, and to give money to help our fellow Australians and our friends across the Tasman.This schedule adds an organisation to the act, namely, the New Zealand governments Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust, and also the Cancer Australia Gift Fund. The New Zealand governments Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust was established to help the families and communities affected by the devastating earthquake of 22 February 2011. Listing the New Zealand governments Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust will allow Australians to donate to the appeal and claim a tax deduction for the donation.These changes reward Australians who give to our closest neighbours and friends. New Zealand suffered greatly through the earthquakes earlier this year, and since then has suffered many tremors and frightening shocks. Nearly 200 New Zealanders lost their lives, and the resulting damage bill is in the tens of billions. The natural response from Australians is to act. Immediately, the Prime Minister pledged Australian assistance to New Zealand and gave $5 million to the Red Cross. This was accompanied by direct assistance from the people of Australia. As the Prime Minister said in her address to the parliament of New Zealand earlier this year:That is why I say Australia has many alliances and friendships around the world. Economic and defence partnerships of every kind. But New Zealand alone is family.This schedule does not only deal with aid to New Zealand, however; it also makes some procedural changes related to the amalgamation of the National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre, the NBOCC, and Cancer Australia on 15 June 2010.The National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre and Cancer Australia merged to create a one-stop shop to provide improved leadership to and outcomes for Australians living with cancer and their families. The new Cancer Australia will combine the experience and successes of both organisations to further strengthen the Australian governments strategic focus on cancer and create a solid platform for the coordination of cancer initiatives at a national level. Breast cancer and ovarian cancer will remain a priority for Cancer Australia as it delivers the governments broader cancer programs and research priorities. Following the listing of the Cancer Australia Gift Fund, donations made to this new organisation will be used to improve breast cancer outcomes for women, reduce mortalities from breast cancer and improve the wellbeing of women diagnosed with the disease.This is an important bill that will ensure greater equality in our taxation system. It will support early identification and intervention for children with disabilities who live in families in remote and rural areas. They will get the assistance they need. The bill will support Australian workers that are employed in fly-in fly-out industries by ensuring they will not be taxed twice. It will also support charitable donations to new and vital organisations to ensure that Australians can contribute to, and great outcomes can be achieved for, the health of the nation. I commend the minister for his work and I commend the bill to the House.","Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 6) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms ONEILL (Robertson) ","(16:59):"

This is an important amendment to ensure families with children with disabilities will not have to pay tax on the outer regional and remote payments they receive.Schedule 2 extends the fringe benefits tax exemption for Australian residents working in remote locations on a fly-in fly-out basis to Australian residents working on a fly-in fly-out basis in similar remote locations overseas. Extending the exemption will ensure that Australian residents working for Australian employers in remote areas in fly-in fly-out arrangements will be taxed consistently, regardless of whether they are working in Australia or overseas. This measure will apply to fringe benefits provided after 1 July 2009, when Australian residents working in remote areas overseas became potentially assessable on their foreign employment income.Schedule 3 amends the deductible gift recipient, DGR, provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Taxpayers can claim an income tax deduction for gifts to organisations that are DGRs. This schedule adds two new organisations to the act, namely: the New Zealand governments Christchurch Earthquake Appeal Trust and the Cancer Australia Gift Fund. Making these organisations deductible gift recipients will assist them in attracting public support for their activities.

322,0,0,0,1,1,"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP","00AMM","Cowper","Nats","N/A",8385," I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011 because it is a particularly important industry reform. It is vitally important that we protect our manufacturing industries from unfair competition. This legislation makes some meaningful improvements to our antidumping regime. We should be aiming towards a regime that allows our manufacturers to access good protections without undue cost or undue delays. Under the present regime, where it is very cumbersome and very untimely to counter the effects of dumping, our manufacturers are being greatly disadvantaged.In my electorate, our many manufacturers are concerned with the issue of dumping—and I do welcome the reforms in this legislation. On 8 August, I welcomed the member for Indi, the shadow minister for innovation, industry and science, to my electorate. We met with a range of manufacturers and discussed a range of issues of importance to them. That visit was held at the premises of WE Smith Hudson, an innovative manufacturer of pressure vessels in my electorate. They employ some 90 employees. They have reduced staff fairly recently due to a downturn in orders, but they still maintain a staff of around 90. They produce world-class equipment, particularly in the area of heat exchangers, and they raised a number of important issues with the shadow minister and me.One of the main issues that they raised was the ineffectiveness of our current local content laws, where a range of projects are required to have a certain set percentage of local content, but unfortunately it is possible for those laws to be circumvented by certain operators, who incorporate parts of the structure which are groundworks and are actually considered to be part of the local content. They raised with us the very important issue that, where you had local content requirements, they had to relate to the equipment itself and not to the preparatory work and groundworks that might be a necessary accompaniment to the equipment but really could not be imported anyway. If you have a local content requirement, it is vitally important that it is effective, and WE Smith Hudson raised the very important point that the current local content rules certainly did not pass that effectiveness test because purchases of equipment were able to incorporate the groundworks as part of the local content. Clearly that was not the intent of the legislation, but it has been the practical effect.Another issue that WE Smith Hudson raised with us during that visit was the fact that many overseas countries are subsidising their manufacturers in competing with Australian manufacturers. Countries in Europe, for instance, are subsidising the cost of transport of their equipment to Australia for the purposes of incorporation in resource projects. I think that is a very important issue; it is not a level playing field for our local manufacturers. We are losing manufacturing jobs at the rate of around 620 every week and we need to look to ensure that our world-class manufacturing industry is not being disadvantaged by unfair competition, either through the failure of the effectiveness of the local content laws or through our industries having to compete with unfair subsidies being provided by countries in Asia and Europe.Also the issue was raised with us of the fact that many countries preclude our manufacturers from competing in their markets. It is a source of great concern and it is costing us jobs. A firm like WE Smith Hudson has incredible skills—the match of anywhere in the world and better than most countries in the world—and incredible intellectual property, but in many cases it is disadvantaged in the markets that it wishes to compete in.During that visit by the shadow minister, we spoke to a range of other manufacturers and the story was the same. Dealing with unfair competition, rising costs and government induced overheads was making it more difficult for them to compete in markets where imports are benefiting from a strong Australian dollar and cheaper labour costs. It is making it very difficult for those manufacturers to compete and to continue to employ people. I commend the shadow minister on coming to my electorate and sharing her time and discussing with my local manufacturers their concerns.I commend the work that she did in discussing with WE Smith Hudson their specific concerns in relation to the very specialised pressure vessel markets and the challenges they faced with regard to the ineffectiveness of the local content laws and dealing with subsidised overseas competitors. They also raised the issue of infrastructure. The pressure vessels which they produce are massive in size and in many cases they are limited in transporting them on the current road infrastructure because of load limits on bridges. Another important factor that we need to incorporate in our transport policy is measures in relation to load limits so that we can transport large objects that are manufactured locally along our roads and get those goods to market.I commend this legislation for the improvements that it makes to the antidumping regime. I know that much more needs to be done in this area. I commend the bill to the House.","Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HARTSUYKER (Cowper) ","(17:16):"
323,0,0,0,1,1,"Neumann, Shayne, MP","HVO","Blair","ALP","N/A",8386," I speak in support of the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Improvements) Bill 2011. To start, I want to commend a number of organisations and individuals for the work they have done in relation to this: my good friend the member for Oxley, the Hon. Bernie Ripoll; the Hon. Brendan OConnor, the Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Justice; the Australian Aluminium Extrusions Association for their advocacy; and the Australian Workers Union, particularly Paul Howes. Locally, out my way, I would like to thank Sven Gade, the business manager of Capral Ltd, and Phil Jobe, the managing director of Capral; and G James Glass for their advocacy in relation to this issue. This is a national issue that has big resonance in my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland where Capral is located. Capral is a major manufacturer of aluminium products. The legislation here will make a big difference that will protect the jobs of hundreds of people living in the western corridor between Ipswich and Brisbane and the rural areas outside. I want to thank those people and those organisations for their wonderful advocacy in relation to this bill.Dumping is a particularly iniquitous practice that affects Australian jobs. Dumping occurs when an overseas supplier exports goods to Australia at a price below their normal value. The normal value is usually based on the domestic price of the goods in the exporting country. Tragically for Australian jobs, this has happened all too often. It is not a matter of free trade versus fair trade. We believe in free trade; as an exporting country we believe that it is in the best interests of Australia to export to countries like China, South Korea, the United States, Japan and Europe. But we also believe that trade between countries needs to be based on a degree of justice and fairness. When a company engages in dumping, it really seeks to have an unfair advantage compared to local Australian companies, and it will materially impact on local Australian jobs.The improvements summarised in this legislation are the result of extensive stakeholder consultation, and some of the organisations and individuals I mentioned here have been major players in that consultation. There has been consideration of the Productivity Commission Inquiry Report No. 48 of 18 December 2009, Australias anti-dumping and countervailing system. The consideration of this legislation comes very much out of that. The changes, we believe, will improve access to the antidumping system across the country. It will improve the timeliness of decisions in relation to this. We believe it will improve decision making over the whole process. We do not believe these are protectionist measures. We believe they are in line with our obligations, particularly our obligations under World Trade Organisation arrangements. We think also that we are doing what other countries comparable to us, the United States, Canada and other countries in the EU, are doing to protect local jobs and to make sure that there is a level playing field in relation to this particular measure.There is a raft of improvements. I welcome the package of 29 improvements to the system. They will have a big impact on not only employment but also the social fabric of our community. There will be better support to industries in our area. The AWU supports this. We have had companies like Capral supporting this. We have even had the National Farmers Federation coming out in support of the measures we are undertaking here. David Crombie, the chair of the National Farmers Federation Trade Committee had this to say:Agriculture is one industry that is particularly susceptible to dumping, where foreign products are exported to Australia at a price below cost price.The NFF believes it is very important that industries like agriculture, that have legitimate claims against dumped exports, have the opportunity to seek a remedy for this through Australia’s anti-dumping system, ensuring unfair trading practices can be challenged.He went on to say:This means that the emphasis remains on whether goods were exported to Australia at a price below the normal value of the goods, thus making it harder for our farmers to complete, rather than on any perceived short-term consumer benefit.When you have a situation where the National Farmers Federation, the AWU and business are in support of these changes, I think we have got it right.In my electorate of Blair in South-East Queensland, which has a very large farming community and a very big manufacturing base in Ipswich, this will be particularly important—also for smaller businesses as well because they have found the cost, the expense and the complexity of antidumping action prohibitive in taking actions. So these amendments, which will make an impact nationally, will make an impact locally in my electorate. There are a number of improvements. The minister said in his second reading speech on 6 July 2011:These improvements will improve the way we administer global anti-dumping rules in Australia and better align our laws and practices with those of other countries.I agree. This will make a difference locally.I will go through the amendments which will have an impact in my electorate and in communities across the country. Improvements include the following. There is an improved timeliness in relation to this issue. We will have a 45 per cent increase in Customs staff working on antidumping issues over the next 12 months to ensure cases are dealt with more efficiently and effectively. I think the 30-day time limit for ministerial decisions on antidumping cases will make a difference, for a start.I think one of the biggest problems in this area is that it is extraordinarily complex. It is very difficult for the average person to get their head around. It is difficult for small companies to take on these types of cases. One only has to read anything prepared in relation to this issue, including reports, advice from QCs given to me, reports from companies involved in these types of cases, and analyses by Access Economics, to see this. It is extraordinarily difficult for the layperson to get their head around. This is very complex law. The whole practice and procedures here make it very difficult to identify whether a company overseas is dumping. We have not had the expertise, in my view. We have not had the staff in Customs to take this on. I think the commitment to boost the monitoring measures to ensure compliance will be very important. With companies from overseas, particularly in the case of Capral, the competition and the dumping have been from Chinese companies. For too long we have found it difficult to identify that dumping has actually occurred. The indexes, the criteria, the factors and the circumstances make it very difficult, particularly when companies overseas are often state-owned companies, which are heavily subsidised in countries like China. We need stronger compliance. The idea that we can combat these measures is really important. I think we need improved decision making. (Quorum formed)Obviously we on this side of the House are concerned about protecting jobs and helping farmers, but those opposite are not listening to those sorts of speeches. They are not interested in protecting jobs, protecting workers or protecting farmers in our economies across the country. I mentioned before the complexity of this issue. For example, on 22 March 2011 Deloitte Access Economics undertook an analysis of antidumping measures in aluminium markets in 2008-09 for Capral. It is extraordinarily complex analysing the approach of Customs and Border Protection to substituting the London Metal Exchange prices with Shanghai Futures Exchange prices over 2008-09. Capral have been involved in a number of pieces of litigation, including an application they made on 11 May 2009 for the publication of dumping duty and countervailing duty notices in respect of aluminium extrusions exported to Australia from China. That is just one of many measures that the company and other companies in the country have been involved in. As at 30 June 2011, there were 24 measures in place against 18 products and 12 countries in relation to antidumping.This is not some academic exercise. This is about protecting jobs and making sure that we have got a fair system across the country. We want to make sure that, while our local economies are strong and our national economies are strong, workers are protected, and that is what we believe in the Labor Party. We are not the party of Work Choices; we are the party that protects jobs and makes sure that we stand up for the living standards of people across the country. The reforms here ensure quicker and better dumping decisions and greater consistency with other countries. This is doing what the Americans and the Canadians are doing, in large part. There is stronger compliance with antidumping measures. We have accepted 15 of the 20 recommendations in the Productivity Commission report I referred to. Some of the Productivity Commission report recommendations make it more costly and more difficult, and we did not adopt those.We have made a big difference here. As I say, there is improved decision making through greater use of trade and industry experts in investigating complaints. There is a more rigorous appeals process supported by more resources from government, providing flexibility in allowing extensions of time to complete the complex cases, which makes it easier to expedite, and there is better access to the antidumping system. I think increasing the standing of individuals, companies, unions and other people to take these cases on will improve the capacity to stand up for local jobs, local companies and local farmers. That is important. We need to clarify who can participate in these investigations. It has been difficult in the past. A lot of small businesses and small farmers could not do it. I can imagine industry associations, large trade unions and downstream industry standing up for workers and farmers in this country.I think it is important that we have these measures. It is important nationally and it is important for local jobs. Once again, it is a federal Labor government that stands up for workers rights, as it has been in the past and always will be in the future. I commend the legislation to the House.","Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr NEUMANN (Blair) ","(17:22):"
324,0,0,0,1,1,"Mirabella, Sophie, MP","00AMU","Indi","LP","N/A",8389," I rise to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011. This is a day that Australian industry and the coalition has been waiting for for a long time—around three years, in fact. It was genuinely as long ago as that that the Labor Party flagged that the government would be taking action to improve Australias antidumping system.Finally, after all that time and following almost endless and ongoing efforts at buck-passing in recent years, the day has arrived when we have the opportunity to debate a piece of legislation on this issue. Of course, as every stakeholder in this area appreciates, the government has only acted now because it was shamed into it. Such a cross-section of critics had coalesced and so many storm clouds had gathered around its inaction that the government was rendered powerless to resist the inevitable any longer, especially after it became clear that even its own brethren in the union movement—and the faceless man who installed Ms Gillard as Prime Minister—were unhappy with its impotence on this issue. They told the government in no uncertain terms that something had to be done. I only wish this debate had come on sooner.We all know that the Labor Party does not have its heart in legislation like the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill. You only had to watch the awkward, cringe-worthy body language and answers of the trade minister at the press conference on this issue on 22 June if you were not aware of this point already.This legislation is being introduced under sufferance and it is born not from a desire to support, encourage and improve the fate of Australian industry and Australian agriculture but out of what the government see as a need to appease Mr Howes and to shut down public criticism of their misunderstanding of the problem of dumping and its ramifications for the Australian economy. It is the result of Minister OConnor and Minister Emerson being panicked into doing and saying something—so much so that, even at the time they were staging their rushed press conference, some of the key documents outlining the changes were, quite remarkably, still being hastily cobbled together, to the point that, for a number of days after the announcement, they were not even ready on the ALP website, the Prime Ministers website, the customs ministers website, the trade ministers website or in any other kind of public distribution, even though they had had three years to get the details ready.And then we found out that that was not even adequate in any case. What has subsequently been revealed is that this turned out to be yet another occasion when a policy was not even taken to cabinet, let alone to caucus, for its consideration. On one hand you had two ministers spinning a line for public consumption that the changes in this bill are revolutionary and apparently—if you swallow what was in their media alert—the most ground-breaking changes to Australias antidumping framework in more than a decade. Yet, on the other hand, it turns out that this issue, in practice, is so trivial to the Labor Party that it has not even been listed as an agenda item for its caucus to discuss.The succession of Labor backbenchers who will be trotted out in this debate have had absolutely no say in their partys policy on this issue of antidumping and are now, far from the first time in their careers, being ordered to blindly support a policy that has come their way. Nor have Labor powerbrokers even bothered to make any serious explanatory information available to key industry stakeholders or to the Australian public at large. It just shows, yet again, how loose is their grip on proper government and democratic processes, how feigned is their interest in the future of Australian industry, especially local manufacturing, and how skewed their priorities are.Nonetheless—I will make an important concession here—given how reluctant they always are to admit error and defeat, even when it is blindingly obvious how bad their decisions and policies are and how devastating the impacts are for the Australian community, I suppose we should be grateful for small mercies like this piece of legislation. In that context the coalition will be supporting the passage of the bill because at least it legislates for some basic improvements, and that is a start. But, as the AWU says, it is a first step. It is also quite a come-down—and an important one at that—for the trade minister and the customs minister. So some change in this area is definitely preferable to none.We are glad that, dragged kicking and screaming though they may have been, the government have eventually reacted to the combined pressure of the coalition, Senator Xenophon, industry groups, individual businesses and trade unions to make changes such as imposing a time limit of 30 days on ministerial decision making, widening the range of factors available for consideration in the determination of material damage and expanding the list of subsidies against which Australian industries can apply for countervailing duties. Those are sensible and practical changes for which key stakeholders have been calling for some time and it is good that something is being done about these problems.The coalition will also support the move to grant interested-party status to unions, industry associations and other downstream users through part 10B of the Customs Act. This change will allow these parties to gain direct participative rights in dumping investigations and the capacity to initiate appeals and reviews of decisions. It embeds in legislation recognition of the obvious point that the dumping of goods in Australia impacts on a wide range of parties. It also recognises that there are sometimes commercial limitations on the ability of a business or businesses to engage in antidumping applications.Indeed, some of the trade unionists who have been at the core of this debate in Australia over recent months should be congratulated for their commitment to placing pressure on the government when it comes to antidumping policy. More broadly, we also welcome the custom ministers statement, in his second reading speech, that changes to improve Australias antidumping system are vital, and we welcome his accompanying comment that local industries here are vulnerable to dumping. These are long-overdue acknowledgements from the government. There have been considerable and growing frustrations over recent years in Australia with the lack of a timely and effective investigation process undertaken by Customs and the significant costs imposed on businesses that wish to raise possible cases for consideration under the current antidumping regime. The system is widely regarded as being too expensive to access and is largely unworkable in its present form. The current structure of the system typically works against the best interests of Australian manufacturers. It represents another burden on them at a time when they are already encountering a range of unwanted costs and pressures and a series of poor and clumsy policies from a government that simply has no empathy for their plight. They want a system that works for them, not one that thwarts them, especially at a time when they are already confronted by a range of government imposed costs and compliance burdens and a series of clumsy policies from the government.Against this background, anything that can be done to strengthen the integrity and quality of the administration of our antidumping system should be supported. We need to recognise that, for as much as Australia and other nations have embraced the ethos and operation of free trade over recent decades, it does not mean that there are not instances of unfair restrictive trade, nor that such instances may even be on the rise. After all, it is for entirely these reasons that antidumping systems exist in the first place and it is why their use is fully sanctioned and supported by the WTO. Far from serving as some sort of abominable subversion of free trade or as the last form of refuge for the closet protectionists, as some observers like the trade minister would often imply, they actually enshrine and serve to underpin free trade principles.If they are effectively implemented, antidumping systems can go a long way to remove cases of market distortion and ensure that trade is conducted on a genuinely even playing field. If there is unfair trade, if goods are being dumped on the Australian market at below their comparable price at home or in some cases even below the cost of production, then these practices should be identified and dealt with. To simply cite the pre-eminence of market forces in this kind of debate and stand idly by while industry is held hostage to unfair practices that threaten their very existence is frankly nowhere near good enough anymore.Hopefully the changes that the government is making in this bill will mark a turning point in helping to reverse any increases in dumping in Australia. They are certainly among the kinds of changes to which the coalition was giving voice when we committed in our 2010 election policy statement to review Australias antidumping scheme to effectively ensure that Australian manufacturers products are not undercut by imported subsidised products or products that do not comply with appropriate quality standards. In early 2011 we reinforced that commitment by establishing our dedicated coalition antidumping task force to specifically examine problems with the current regime and advocate for a more workable, accessible and effective model. They also tap into—albeit in an understated way—the reality that a number of other countries have increasingly recognised the importance of antidumping measures when encountering market-distorting trade activities, especially countries like the US and a number of EU member states, and more recently nations like Brazil, Argentina and India, where there has been a rapid escalation in the uptake of antidumping actions. Australia will find itself increasingly exposed and in an increasingly dangerous position if it does not remain mindful of these realities.That said, the government here still has considerable work to do. Not only is it apparent that this bill legislates for only four of the policy changes announced on 22 June—and it is anyones guess when we might expect to see further legislative changes that have been promised—but it is also clear that, even taking all of the flagged changes as a whole, the government has still not gone far enough. It is again indulging in another of its landmark hollowmen style games by selling some of its changes as things they are plainly not, especially when it comes to the absurd boast that it is allegedly boosting the resources of Customs—a point to which I will return shortly.Fundamentally, this is yet another exercise in spin, in which the government is being too cute by half. In characteristic style, it is demonstrating that it is more obsessed with controlling public reporting of this issue than with putting in the hard yards and legislating for a full suite of changes that will actually have teeth and will genuinely deliver the kinds of reforms that will work to the full benefit of the Australian economy.The spectacle of Minister Emerson breathlessly invoking the acronym WTO in almost every question he is asked on this issue and essentially railing against everyone and everything that argues for enhancements to Australians antidumping system represents not only a public slap in the face for at least two senators on his own side of the parliament who have identified grave concerns with recent approaches to this policy area but also a misreading of the national interest—and it is a slap in the face for Australian industry, which is heartily sick and tired of being treated so poorly by this government. It is a shame he clearly does not come to this debate realising that antidumping systems and free trade are not mutually exclusive and that our obligations to the World Trade Organisation do not preclude us from implementing a more effective and robust framework. If he recognised that to be the case, then we might have had a more serious and proactive effort from the government.For once, just once, it would be nice if Minister Emerson actually stood up for Australian industry and for all those millions of workers who used to be the lifeblood of the Australian Labor Party—the Australian Labor Party that is now simply an axis of weasels. As one of their own senators drubs them, they are a group of lobotomised zombies whose passive acquiescence, as Australian industry gets battered from pillar to post, is a national disgrace.Let me turn to one of the many obvious holes in Labors spin on this issue: the implication in its glossy promotional documents that its alleged extra resourcing of Customs represents a boost. There is Minister OConnors statement on 22 June that the government is looking to increase Customs resources by nearly 50 per cent. The coalitions suspicion at the time that this was nothing more than sneaky rhetoric has subsequently proved to be extremely well founded because it has now emerged that there is going to be no extra funding of Customs at all. Rather than recruiting 14 new staff, it turns out that there will be no net increase in the overall staff numbers of Customs, only that 14 positions will be taken from elsewhere within the agency. So the overblown claim that there is an increase at all, let alone one of nearly 50 per cent, is exactly that—overblown. Even if they do ultimately shift another 14 staff to the relevant branch, other areas of Customs will obviously need to be cut to compensate.All of this is at a time when there is already unprecedented strain and pressure on Customs staff in a number of areas, especially passenger processing, as the government continues to try in vain to patch up its dogs breakfast on border protection, following year after year of budget reductions that have already been forced upon the agency under this government—and to think that the Labor Party has the hide to criticise the coalition for its statements about the Public Service.Something has to give and it is clear that Labor does not particularly care where or what it is. There is no commitment to improving the lot, the culture, the morale or the practical effectiveness of Customs. There is only a determination to try to make up for some of its excessive spending and appalling waste of government by now starving funds to areas that are already on life support anyway. Simply shuffling resources and giving the relevant branch the appearance of a lick of fresh paint by changing its name and relocating back to a diffuse staff that it probably had shifted out of there during its first few years in office is not going to achieve anything. What is to say that when it is required to extinguish another spot fire in another area of Customs at some point in the future the government will not just engage in the same kind of cost shifting again—only this time removing resources from the anti-dumping area itself?This government is on the run. It is not considered policymaking or careful deployment of resources. I also note that the second reading speech of the Minister for Home Affairs on this bill featured references to the utopian prospect that this bill will provide greater certainty. Unfortunately, he is clearly a long way from providing certainty on at least two of the key other measures, namely, the appointment of an SME support officer and the creation of a working group of the International Trade Remedies Forum, because it is not clear how these will function in practice other than that the SME support officer will be appointed purely on a trial basis and—surprise, surprise!—only until just after the time that the next federal election is due.One of the other critical points of contention, confusion and uncertainty around dumping is that there is growing suspicion of increased use of subsidies by foreign governments to help lower the costs of production borne by exporters from within their own countries. It is true that through this legislation Labor is taking the rather obvious step of expanding the list of subsidies against which Australians can take action, and that is a good thing. But there has been nothing in the way of serious debate, discussion or information from the Labor Party about how it practically plans to strengthen the application of measures such as preliminary affirmative determinations or how it takes account, through article 2.4 of the WTOs anti-dumping agreement for instance, of the comparative advantage that will be conferred on overseas producers as a result of the introduction of Australias go-it-alone carbon tax or how it intends, if at all, to make changes to the way in which the WTOs agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures is interpreted and applied.Labors changes do represent an improvement, but you could also be forgiven for being worried that the pursuit of this so-called package of improvements will, at the end of the day, just be another chapter in the long tale of Labor inaction and impotence when it comes to anti-dumping—just as was the case in 2008 when Labor, as part of the COAG process, formally agreed that anti-dumping was a priority area for reform but then nothing whatsoever was even uttered about it until the following year, just like in 2009 when the Labor Party commissioned and then received a Productivity Commission review of anti-dumping policy but then stuffed the report in the bottom drawer and did not bother to dust it off until after the 2010 election and just like earlier this year when the Minister for Home Affairs faithfully promised that Labor would commit to a new approach to anti-dumping—and presumably to new financial investments in the system as well—as part of the budget but then was forced to give in to the Treasurer who presumably told him that Labors serial squandering had ensured there was simply no money left to fund this new approach and the announcement would need to be postponed and reworked yet again.If the Labor Party were genuinely serious about anti-dumping reform, it would not merely introduce this so-called first tranche of anti-dumping legislation or even the second, third and however many more tranches it has in mind to implement what has been announced. Indeed, it would go further. Rather than gilding the lily about the modest reach and impact of its changes, it would practically and genuinely commit to more far-reaching cultural and practical reforms that are required. Nonetheless, these modest improvements are welcomed and I commend the bill.","Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) ","(17:37):"
325,0,0,0,1,1,"Secker, Patrick, MP",848,"Barker","LP","N/A",8394," From the outset, when speaking on the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011, I will give the House a little bit about my background, because it was actually an anti-tariffs message that got me really interested in politics as a teenager. I pay homage to Bert Kelly, who was a lone voice in the Australian parliament for a couple of decades. He kept on fighting the anti-tariff issue on the basis that it made our economy worse off by trying to protect certain industries, because whenever you protected one industry you invariably hurt another industry and, of course, you hurt the consumer. So I come here on the basis of being still a free marketer. I am sure there are many on the other side who are of the same opinion and believe in free trade—but it has to be fair. That is why we have the World Trade Organisation and the rules on the basis that, where a product is proved to be dumped and harming a local industry, you can then use tariffs to fight against that unfair trade. I come from a free-trade basis, but I also believe it has to be fair, and that is what this issue is all about.The issue of dumping in Australia is not just about competition. It is about unfair competition, and there is a substantial difference. Australian businesses are generally resilient and tough and have become so from reforms over the last 30 or so years, so there is no doubt that if they are given a fair go they will withstand, innovate and produce. However, it is very difficult for Australian businesses to move forward in the current climate when they come up against forces such as a cheap product being dumped into the country at up to 60 per cent below production cost. This is where Australia needs to support businesses with responsible policy. It can be a hard decision for businesses to launch a case against dumping; if they go ahead, the process needs to be made much fairer than it is. Certainly the feedback I hear currently is that time and money invested just in putting a case together is hugely consuming. I am not saying it should be dead easy, but I think everyone recognises it is way too hard, is way too expensive and takes too long, and by that time the industry can be in such a situation that it will not survive.Recently I met with a business in the south-east of my electorate of Barker along with my colleague the member for Indi. I think it should be noted that the member for Indi visited 20 electorates during the five-week break from parliament. That shows a huge amount of commitment to this goal, and I think we are all the better for it. This company could clearly point out where dumping had occurred and the devastating effects it was having on their operations. When weighing up their next course of action, the company is faced with the arduous task of proceeding with putting forward a case for dumping. A large amount of resources is needed to prove a dumping case. The process has many flaws, and for small to medium sized businesses it is simply not possible for them to see out the process. Consider the obstacles faced by industry in Australia: the looming price on carbon that will drive up costs and drive investments offshore; the dangerous two-speed economy that is making it increasingly difficult for businesses to remain profitable; and now the prospect of a product being dumped unfairly against their business.With responsible policy, the pressure of dumping could be alleviated somewhat. With appropriate measures, businesses would feel confident that they had the backing of a government that understands the issues they face and is willing to support them. But they have no such feeling of this government. It is simply not happening under the Gillard government. I know this because I have met with businesses and heard it straight from the horses mouth. The government should be well informed about this issue, considering they commissioned the report into dumping. I was certainly floored that, even after the governments own report saying that product was in fact being dumped in Australia at up to 60 per cent below cost of production, Labor chose to take no action. Here we are, over 12 months down the track, and this government has made some changes to their anti-dumping policy, but it is nowhere near enough.An example I can give the House—and have on numerous occasions already—is that of Kimberly-Clarks mill in the township of Millicent. Millicent is a town with a little over 5,000 people, about 700 of whom are employed in the Kimberly-Clark factory. Many more, of course, are in related industries. So you can understand how important the Kimberly-Clark mill is to the people of Millicent. The factory uses a lot of our wood products, which we also grow in the local area, and it is a very strong part of our whole economy down there. In fact, the forestry industry alone is worth more than $3 billion a year to the local economy. It is not just a very substantial part of the direct local economy around Millicent; it is also important to the area for another 100 kilometres around it, where there is a lot of forestry.This factory uses those products and makes tissues, toilet paper and those sorts of things. The Productivity Commission report showed that there were other countries dumping tissue and toilet paper in Australia, to quite an extensive degree, at up to 60 per cent below the cost of production. It was not five or 10 per cent—in fact, I think most companies in Australia could still compete with that—but up to 60 per cent below the cost of production. Kimberly-Clark is a prime example of a business that was harmed by dumping, and I brought the plight of the Kimberly-Clark mill to the attention of the House over 12 months ago. It is only now that the government is taking some steps to rectify the issue.It is interesting that the government established a $17 million fund in the south-east for innovation and investment. This was in part to help Kimberly-Clark workers who were made redundant to find new jobs and up-skill. It is hard not to wonder if this was a patch-up job by this government. Perhaps, if Labor had acted responsibly in the first place and made certain businesses were protected from this unfair dumping, there would have been no need for this fund in the first place. I note the governments improvement to this anti-dumping policy, and it is a step in the right direction, but it does not go anywhere near far enough. Businesses need to be protected and the processes need to be such that businesses have the resources to complete the process. I am talking about the time and the money, because, in speaking with several local businesses, it has been made clear to me that there are significant faults in the current process. The government has indicated that this legislation is the first instalment, with more to come. We will wait with bated breath on that one. I am aware that these improvements have been well received by stakeholders, but a lot more has to be done. This legislation is not tight enough and not structured well enough.The coalition has really pushed the government into making these improvements. If not for the pressure from the coalition I very much doubt that this Gillard government would have bothered to make these improvements. There were some contrasting views within the Labor Party itself about this issue. A few Labor members took it upon themselves to write their own report on anti-dumping, which they felt quite strongly about, and this was quite a bit more involved than the changes proposed here in this legislation. As I understand it, the Minister for Home Affairs, Brendan OConnor, was not very happy about that, but at least some members on the other side were prepared to stand up for their constituents.This legislation was not taken to cabinet or the caucus, something we are seeing more and more often from this government. It is just a select few making the decisions and the rest are expected to follow quietly. I wonder what the members with manufacturing in their electorates think about this legislation. Do they think it has made the appropriate measures to protect businesses? I doubt very much that they would agree that this is anywhere near enough.I am sure that there would be members of the other side pushing for further improvements because if, like me, they spend any time out in their electorates visiting businesses then I am confident they would know of the issues that have been plaguing the anti-dumping campaign. The government must take further steps to protect businesses from the burden that dumping brings to their operations and profits, because without profits you will not have employment. Businesses are the backbone of this nation and should be treated as such, not crippled as they are under this government. For instance, the government has promised to increase resources within Customs, adding extra staff to deal with anti-dumping. It sounds like a great idea in theory, except it has allocated no new money for it. Minister for Home Affairs Brendan OConnor said a few weeks ago that the government was promising a 45 per cent increase in Customs staff working on anti-dumping issues over the next 12 months. If there is no new money, then how can this be achieved without cuts from other areas? This is going to add pressure to an already underresourced sector. Customs has plenty to worry about with keeping the country safe from terrorism and the like, and then the Labor government comes along and cuts their resources even further. This government has cut resources from Customs in every budget it has delivered. Now it is making more promises that will equate to more cuts. This is a real shame.Another improvement the government is making is to include a few new groups to the list of interested parties who investigate the complaints and are generally involved in the process. These groups include industry associations, downstream groups and trade unions. The involvement of trade unions can be concerning, but in this instance it seems that they are on board with helping businesses overcome dumping. It really is in the best interests of the workers to see the business recover fully and move on with business as usual. Certainly, in the dealings I have had with local businesses that have been harmed by dumping, their unions have assisted with the process and acted in the businesses best interests, and I welcome that action.The Minister for Home Affairs was quick to criticise the opposition during his press release on the government improvements and he called on Tony Abbott to declare where he stands on dumping. I think it is quite obvious where the coalition and Mr Abbott stand on dumping, given we stand in this place time and time again asking the government to take action and run campaigns in our electorates. On top of that, Mr Abbott created the anti-dumping taskforce in February this year so the coalition could develop responsible and practical policy. Yet this government jumped on the band wagon only a month ago, even though these problems have been very clear for a long time. I think the minister should pull his head out of the sand.Confidence is down amongst the business community, and who can blame them in light of the uncertainty that this government brings to the nation? Labor cannot be trusted. The Prime Minister cannot be trusted. She has misled the Australian public with her intentions, and this legislation is no different. Here is the first instalment but trust us to deliver more, says the government. We will promise more resources but there is no new money. This government was backed into a corner on anti-dumping by the coalition and that is why this legislation has come about. What will we have to do to get the rest fixed up? How many more businesses will have to be brought under by unfair dumping before this government makes responsible changes to ensure that they are protected?The coalition has been serious about this issue since it arose as a potential problem. I have stood in this place and raised my concerns on several occasions. We have a task force that is specifically working on our policy so that it is well structured and responsible—not a last minute, poorly thought through decision like we see all too often from this government. Members from the coalition task force are out there visiting businesses like the member for Indi did in my electorate. Where is the governments task force and where are their members sticking up for local business?The improvements outlined in this legislation are a step forward in protecting businesses from dumping, but they are not enough. Labor needs to tighten up this legislation and the minister must divulge how the extra Customs staff will be funded and reveal all the details. I would hope that this government is sincere about protecting businesses and does not just stop at this bill. It would be helpful if the minister revealed the governments plans about more improvements and it would be helpful if this happened soon—not another 12 months down the track. This is another example of the devil in the detail, another example of delays and of acting only after significant pressure from stakeholders and the coalition.

326,0,0,0,1,1,"Robert, Stuart, MP","HWT","Fadden","LP","N/A",8398," I rise to make a few brief comments on the changes being proposed in the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Improvements) Bill 2011. I make these comments in the hope that the bill will indeed seek to improve the current regime. I make these comments with the knowledge that on one hand the Labor administration is hoping to improve business through strengthening provisions within anti-dumping and in providing some safeguards and some actions on the minister. Yet at the same time and, indeed, in the same breath, the government is seeking to make it instrumentally difficult for business through implementing a carbon tax; the only economy-wide carbon tax in the world being considered and implemented—the words of the Productivity Commission in its latest report.You would have thought that if a government comes to the dispatch box to look at issues that affect business—in this case to stop illegal dumping at a lower price—that there would be a degree of consistency in the values and principles by which they present legislation, and that that consistency would concern what makes it easier for business. But the only consistency we have seen so far is the impost on business. Even the Australian Industry Group is now looking at Labors so-called Fair Work Bill and saying, You know what? Its neither fair nor leading to work.The carbon tax is now being universally described as a disaster right across the nation in terms of its antibusiness stance and how it affects the basic economics as well as business confidence in manufacturing. So many things this government does are harming business that it is hard to see a narrative about how they seek to help. So it is my hope that this bill will seek to make some improvements, and we shall be watching with great interest over the coming months and years to ensure that occurs.A company in my electorate called JELD-WEN Australia is a company that has been through the mill twice on anti-dumping. The first time it was found to be unwarranted and the second time, I believe, the same will be found. It is hoped that these improvements will ensure that companies like JELD-WEN can face fairly and squarely the issues and that they can get the ministerial representation they need.But it is also instructive that a company like JELD-WEN, which owns brands like Corinthian Doors and Stegbar, is experiencing a downturn in some areas of their business by as much as 20 per cent. Something like 80 per cent of our homes, offices and buildings contain at least something that JELD-WEN produces. If a company like JELD-WEN is experiencing such a dramatic downturn, it speaks volumes about what is happening in our economy.If I look at the Gold Coast, at my electorate, there are three key things—three concerns—on peoples minds. Number 1 is the carbon tax—the betrayal by the government—and the fact that the government will not listen to them. Number 2 is jobs and the loss of jobs, and number 3 is the increasing cost of living. That a company like JELD-WEN is showing such a downturn in this time of corporate downturn reinforces that people are hurting. The cost of living is increasing, people are not spending and people are worried about their jobs. The carbon tax is simply exacerbating a difficult situation.All I ask for in this place—all we want from this government—is consistency, and the carbon tax shows there is none of that. I think we all agree that the basic purpose of anti-dumping is to allow countries to take action against foreign manufacturers who seek to export a product into Australia at a price which is lower than the price it charges in its home market and/or its costs of production. Whilst there are more technicalities involved in that, including shipping and the averaging of the cost of production if production is across multiple sites, the intent is to stop a major company coming through and exporting into Australia with a loss leader or dumping products that they cannot move and that fundamentally affect Australias manufacturing or local industry. I think we all accept that that makes sense.However, there is a range of issues with the current arrangements and the way they are implemented and administered. I think it is fair to say that there has been considerable frustration at the lack of timeliness and the effectiveness of the processes undertaken within Customs and the costs imposed on businesses where they are raising cases or seeking to address cases because of the multinational aspect of their business. Our system is widely regarded as being costly and for the most part reasonably unworkable. Perversely, it imposes a greater burden of proof on local industries. Again, it is hoped that these amendments will seek to change that.The introduction of this amendment is certainly a response from Labor to the concerns being raised. Like all things it takes a long time—ironical, as opposed to the carbon tax. Six or seven days after becoming the government—once the final numbers were in—the Prime Minister broke her word, There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead. But when it comes to Australian business and Australian manufacturing apparently it takes years. Can I say to the government: the irony is not lost on the bulk of Australias businesses. It is good to see that the coalition—and I acknowledge Senator Xenophon—industrial bodies, individual businesses and trade unions have said to the government that there needs to be a range of responses to deal with the issues.These reforms will seek to bring in a range of amendments, including a time limit of 30 days on ministerial decision making—which is nice—widening the range of factors available for consideration in the determination of material injury and, of course, expanding the list of subsidies against which Australian industries can apply for countervailing duties. On the whole, these changes would appear to be sensible and practical, but like all things time will tell whether they are workable and time will tell whether the ministerial intervention is done appropriately, logically and sensibly.Most seem to interpret the bill as a reasonably positive move that may help to address some of the inherent flaws in the way that business is currently done and the way that anti-dumping is currently looked at. The members of the coalitions anti-dumping task force—I acknowledge the Hon. John Cobb MP, Senator the Hon. Richard Colbeck, my good friend Michael Keenan MP, who is sitting at the desk now, and of course the shadow minister, Sophie Mirabella MP—have done a great job in consistently engaging with stakeholders and getting advice from business and industry associations. The general feel is for tacit support. We believe these moves are in the interest of the nation; let us wait and see how they go. It is our hope that these moves will improve the situation for business—hence the wide-ranging support we are giving to them. I personally hope that these moves will assist companies like JELD-WEN in my electorate, who have been at the receiving end of a range of cases that will assist them to defend themselves appropriately, properly and judiciously. I welcome the bills introduction to the House.Debate adjourned.","Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ROBERT (Fadden) ","(18:14):"

334,0,0,0,1,1,"Kelly, Craig, MP",99931,"Hughes","LP","N/A",8407," I rise tonight to speak on the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011 and to support the comments of my coalition colleagues. I would also like to note that it is very disappointing that tonight the government has pulled all its speakers and seems not to have one single speaker to speak on this important bill.The coalition supports in principle these modest changes to Australias anti-dumping system. However, we have substantial concerns about the lack of public announcement and detail for this bill. Also, there is a lot of misinformation in the community about this bill. It has been publicised as an attempt by the federal government to stop foreign manufacturers dumping cheap imports in Australia. We need to be very clear about this bill: it is not about stopping cheap imports. The definition of dumping is the act of charging a lower price for a good in a foreign market than is charged for the same good in the domestic market. This is often referred to as selling at less than fair value. Under World Trade Organisation agreements, dumping is condemned but not prohibited if it causes or threatens to cause material injury to a domestic industry in the importing country.These definitions are, unfortunately, both arbitrary and obscure. What is the normal value of a good? How is this calculated? Is it the price last week; is it the price last month or last year; or, with other commodities, is it the price it will be in the future? How do you calculate the price in the domestic market? What is the definition of a domestic market? With China, for instance, is it the price the good is sold for in Hong Kong, is it the price it is sold for in Shenzhen or is it the price it is sold for in Shanghai? Both normal value and material injury are slippery concepts, and little effort is made to define them precisely.Yet another problem that arises with anti-dumping legislation in determining when goods are dumped by foreign firms is when they do not sell the same product in their domestic market as they do in Australia. Today this happens often. Many products that are exported from overseas to Australia are simply not sold on the domestic market. This makes it very difficult for Customs to determine whether the good is sold at a price that is different to the local market. When this cannot be used, there are two alternatives available to Customs: they can look at the price charged by an exporter in another country or make a calculation based on a combination of the exporters production costs, other expenses and normal profit margins. The agreement under the WTO rules also specifies how a fair comparison can be made between the export price and what would be the normal price. The problems in calculating anti-dumping legislation are huge. It is simply impossible to know what the price of a good would be if it were theoretically available on the market; thus, any estimated price used by Customs is purely an arbitrary concoction. These are the difficulties that Customs face in implementing these regulations. If we were to have an effective anti-dumping regime, we would need to give Customs adequate resources to investigate claims of dumping, but we have no explanation from the government of how these measures will be funded and we have no explanation of where these resources will come from. Unfortunately, this is another example of a policy that has simply not been thought through.We must remember that a strict anti-dumping regime, although very important, is not a complete panacea for the difficulties facing our manufacturing industry. Recent examples from the US show this to be true. One example is what happened when the US imposed anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese bedroom furniture. In October 2003, the American Furniture Manufacturers Committee for Legal Trade assembled a group of US manufacturers of wooden bedroom furniture and six labour unions and filed an anti-dumping petition concerning imports of wooden bedroom furniture from China. In December 2004, American customs officials determined that the US bedroom furniture industry was materially injured by sales of imports below their actual value, and the Department of Commerce issued an anti-dumping order on 4 January 2005. The tariffs on Chinese bedroom furniture ranged from 0.83 per cent to 198 per cent. They were enacted in January 2005 to apply to all bedroom furniture imported from China into the US.However, these anti-dumping duties did little to protect domestic jobs in the US. They did little to improve the economic health of hardwood producers during the years 2005 to 2009. In fact, despite these anti-dumping measures being implemented, 36 US wooden bedroom furniture plants closed from 2004 to 2009. In 2001, 44 per cent of all wooden bedroom furniture sold in the United States was imported. By 2004, 68 per cent was imported. But, despite these anti-dumping duties being implemented, imports still grew to 78 per cent of all wooden bedroom furniture sold in the United States by 2009.In reviewing the effects of the anti-dumping tariffs implemented, Commissioner Daniel Pearson stated that the anti-dumping duties had probably created more legal activity than actually benefitted anyone. He said:In this particular investigation, additional costs and distortions have been added by the use of the administrative review and settlement process, with little evidence that these distortions have yielded any benefits to the industry overall, the U.S. consumer, or the U.S. taxpayer. The industry continued to suffer ongoing losses in capacity and employment after the funds were gathered and distributed.The anti-dumping duties placed on Chinese manufacturers of wooden bedroom furniture simply did not stem the tide of imports, but the tariffs, along with rising manufacturing costs in China, caused a rapid shift of production to Vietnam. In fact, the anti-dumping tariffs helped ignite Vietnams recent boom as a wood-products producer. In 2004, Vietnam shipped $190 million worth of wooden bedroom furniture to the US. However, when the anti-dumping duties were introduced for Chinese production in 2005, shipments from Vietnam to the US increased by 143 per cent.Nearly overnight Vietnam became a major player in wooden bedroom furniture as Chinese companies shifted production to avoid the tariffs, and US distributors changed their sourcing for the same reason. Now even the introduction of anti-dumping tariffs on Vietnamese furniture would simply shift production to other Asian countries. This is already beginning to occur because of rising wages in Vietnam. At the end of the day, even with the imposition of anti-dumping duties, furniture production and the jobs it used to support in the US has not undergone a renaissance. Yet this was the rallying cry used by domestic producers who first brought the case in 2004.There are valuable lessons to be learnt from this case study. It demonstrates that our industries must continue to work to leverage any competitive advantage that they have against overseas manufacturers. This is why I have great concerns about the campaign being waged by the leaders of the Australian Workers Union with their Dont Dump on Australia campaign. Certainly we need effective legislation to prevent dumping, but the unions website states:The fate of AWU members rests with the creation and enforcement in Australia of a strong anti-dumping regime.But the truth is that the fate of AWU members rests with Australian industries remaining internationally competitive. If the Australian Workers Union were truly concerned about the fate of their members, they would be making sure that Australian industries do remain internationally competitive and they would be voicing their opposition to a carbon tax.We can have the strongest anti-dumping provisions in the world, but if we have a government that introduces policies such as carbon taxing 500, 1,000 or whatever the number of companies is that operate in Australia but does not apply the same tax to companies that operate outside Australia it will simply place Australian businesses at a competitive disadvantage—and this will cost jobs. Yet we have officials of the Australian Workers Union backing the government and not their union members.More work needs to be done on our anti-dumping legislation. It is important that we have this for the sake of our manufacturers. The coalition is serious about anti-competitive and predatory dumping. That is why we established the anti-dumping task force earlier this year. We pledge that under the next coalition government we will take real action against this predatory practice to ensure the long-term viability of the Australian manufacturing sector.","Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) ","(18:26):"
335,0,0,0,1,1,"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP","EM6","Murray","LP","N/A",8410," This whole business about anti-dumping is nothing to do with trying to substitute tariffs for an anti-dumping regime. It is nothing to do with trying to protect industry in Australia. It is all about trying to give all of our manufacturers—our food suppliers, our growers of fine foods, grains and fibre—a fair go, because, of course, small and large manufacturing businesses are a major creator of jobs in this country. A definition of dumping is where you have a product imported below the comparable price at home or below the costs of production.As our previous speaker said, and made the point very well, it is often an extraordinarily difficult thing for an Australian manufacturer to prove exactly what the price of the product is at home, especially if there is not a comparable product being offered in, say, China or Greece. Also, how do you demonstrate and research the actual costs of production in a country which has a managed economy—for example, a country like China? A company is expected to have the resources to go out, research and prove that they have had material damage occur and that the cost of production of the product that is being dumped, they allege, is in fact a real below-the-cost-of-production situation.This legislation being debated today, tries to go a little further in the battle against the problem of dumped product in Australia, but it is a work in progress. As each of the speakers on the coalition side have said, we need to make sure that it is a properly resourced program, and we need to understand that this still does not go far enough in giving us world best practice in terms of an anti-dumping regime which is easily administered, fair, totally transparent, has appropriate time frames and makes sure that there cannot be vexatious activity on the part of someone who simply wants to reduce competition in their market.In this bill there are four key areas of change. The first is to time limits set for the minister to make a decision after receiving a recommendation, reducing the overall time frame to conclude an investigation. That is good, as long as the company bringing the action has sufficient support and resources to do the detailed work of proving the action. It is intended that the time limit will provide, subject to extenuating circumstances, for the minister to make a decision within 30 days of receiving a recommendation.The second major change amends the legislation to reflect that the minister may consider any impact on jobs or any impact on investment in the domestic industry producing like goods. This is an important change. In determining whether the Australian industry has suffered material injury, the minister may have regard to any impact on jobs, including new changes to the terms and conditions of employment of the workforce of the relevant manufacturers producing like goods, such as the number of hours worked, the incidence of part-time employment and any impact on investment in the industry producing the like goods.The third major area of change is updating subsidies provisions. There is an amendment updating and reflecting the full range of actionable subsidies provided by the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. These are typically called the WTO agreements. The WTO agreements limit the kinds of subsidies that can be the subject of countervailing measures, and the coalition also supports that change.The fourth area of amendment is to clarify that the definition of interested party includes industry associations, trade unions and downstream industry members, whether or not they are the importer. It is intended that section 269T of the Customs Act will include industry associations directly concerned with the production or manufacture of like goods in Australia. Unlike the existing inclusion of trade organisations, the industry associations would not need to have a majority of members directly concerned with the production or manufacture of like goods. The section will also include trade unions directly concerned with the production or manufacture of like goods in Australia. Unlike the existing inclusion of trade organisations, the trade unions would not need to have a majority of its members directly concerned with the production or manufacture of like goods.Finally, this amendment includes the downstream industry members, being manufacturers or producers that use the goods, the subject of the application or like goods as inputs to the production or manufacture of downstream products. This is an important recognition that dumping does not just injure the party whose products are in direct competition with the dumped goods but that damage is also done to like goods in what is always in Australia a highly competitive market.Lest we think that dumping is not a major problem in Australia, let me remind people that 34 per cent of fruit and 19 per cent of manufactured vegetables consumed in Australia are imported. Australia imports a greater value of processed fruit and vegetables than it exports. We have an enormous volume of imported product. This anti-dumping legislation is not about knocking out competition. It is about making sure that when product comes into Australia it comes in at a fair price and is not priced in a predatory way which is likely to do serious damage or even knock out of existence an Australian product which is priced absolutely according to Australian labour and input costs.Dumping is of course a serious problem. It is not the only problem confronting us in Australia. One of our problems is this governments contraction of the resources available for Customs and for biosecurity and quarantine services. Where we have been told that with this anti-dumping legislation there will be extra resources for Customs—that there will be 14 new staff—it is very disappointing to find that, no, there will not be 14 additional staff; there will be the redeployment of 14 positions somewhere else in the agency to be put into this anti-dumping area. That is a concern because just today we saw the apple fire blight protocol finally presented as a fait accompli by this government and we see there an incredible diminution of biosecurity activity when it comes to making sure that there is a very limited possibility of fire blight getting into Australia on fresh apples. It is the case that the New Zealand government and New Zealand pome fruit industry will be responsible for monitoring and managing the quarantine requirements that this government has put on them—and they are very limited indeed—in exporting fresh apples from New Zealand to Australia.In this area of anti-dumping, one of the greatest difficulties our often very small companies have is how to find the time and resources to go into a country—for example, an economy such as China—and prove that the product that is wiping them out domestically is priced in a certain way in that country. Customs will have some additional staff to assist them, apparently, but I have great concern that this is not going to translate into real extra support.A lot of the manufacturers in my electorate are struggling to survive right now and they tell me that a number of things are making it difficult for them. These include the pressures of the supermarket duopoly, where they are pressured to supply house brands in direct competition with their own branded product, which causes enormous difficulty. Their own branded product has to compete with the premium, middle or cheap end of that home-brand product category. They invariably also mention the problems of bringing about a successful anti-dumping case. My food manufacturers have tried with products as diverse as canned peaches from Greece and tomatoes from Italy. The problems they have had in trying to prove those cases, while all the time experiencing the unfair competition in their market, have often led them to think twice and conclude it is just not worth the effort. This is a serious problem for a country like Australia, particularly at present when the dollar is so attractive when it comes to importing product.If you take this inadequate anti-dumping legislation and add the amendments in front of us, which will be passed with coalition support, this country still has an inadequate anti-dumping regime. As I said before, we also have the problem of too much unconscionable behaviour and market power exercised by our supermarket duopoly concerning their suppliers in Australia. Next we will have the carbon tax imposts. These will make the costs of production of all of our manufactures, whether in the food or other sectors, higher compared to imports, which will not have the carbon tax imposts even though they will have produced emissions during their manufacture in other countries. Of course, we have the ongoing problem in this country of less flexible workplace regulations brought about by this government, which make it very difficult to manufacture product which has to respond to seasonality.It is a very difficult time for our manufacturers in Australia. I had hoped that we would have had with this government a worlds best practice anti-dumping regime. I had hoped that we would look at the European, American, Canadian or even New Zealand legislation, picked the eyes out of all of that and produced a system that was transparent, was not open to abuse, was quick and timely and came at minimum cost to those who were aggrieved and bringing anti-dumping action. Unfortunately, what we have is a little bit of tweaking of the legislation. There is a promise of extra resourcing, but I am afraid that promise is not likely to really deliver any great support to vexed parties. We still have not addressed the issue of a reversal of the onus of proof. I would very much like to see that investigated. Instead of our companies, without any real hope of achieving a good outcome, somehow having to demonstrate the cost in the home country of a like item or the cost of production, why shouldnt the party importing the product into Australia have to prove the value of the product or the cost of the production of the product under consideration?We really have not got this right yet. We will have to wait for the coalition to come into government. I just hope that not too many companies are damaged in the meantime, because this is not about protection—it is not about trying to substitute anti-dumping tariffs for subsidies or other tariffs—this is about fair trade and fair practice. It is about trying to produce a level playing field.","Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr STONE (Murray) ","(18:37):"
336,0,0,0,1,1,"Marino, Nola, MP","HWP","Forrest","LP","N/A",8413," As we know, Australia is a nation that relies by majority on exports for its economic wellbeing, but it also needs adequate anti-dumping legislation. As the member for Murray said, the Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011 really is a work in progress. There is a lot more to be done.We have a small domestic economy compared to our ability to produce commodities and goods, so we rely heavily on trade. In 2009, during the global financial crisis, our exports were worth $250 billion—or one-quarter of a trillion dollars. This was 10 per cent down on the previous year but still a formidable figure. Of this, 41 per cent came from the resources sector, especially iron ore and coal, but the parliament would do well to note the contribution made by Western Australia to the nations resource exports, especially in oil and gas as well as iron ore. According to the Western Australian Department of Mines and Petroleum, WA produced 68 per cent of the countrys mineral and energy exports. Given that the same report identifies that Western Australia holds 70 per cent of the nations resource exploration and 62 per cent of its private new capital investment, the importance of the west to the nations economy should not be underestimated, but neither should it be only seen as a cash cow for the Labor government. In addition to the resource sector, $27 billion, or 11 per cent, of Australian exports come from the rural sector, especially in wheat and meat.This bill is one small part of the trade picture in Australia and the ambitions appear to be modest. It is definitely a work in progress, but I do wonder where the members of the Labor government are if they are genuinely committed to anti-dumping legislation. I note that there are a group of 20 Labor backbenchers from manufacturing electorates who are calling for additional assistance for the manufacturing sector. I would ask where they are while we are debating this bill here tonight. Anti-dumping is a very real issue for manufacturing right across the board. Where is the member for Throsby? Where are the members for Newcastle and Deakin? Where is the member for Wakefield and the member for Werriwa? I would have thought this anti-dumping legislation was critical in their electorates. If they are calling for manufacturing assistance, I would have thought speaking on anti-dumping should be very much a part of that.This bill aims to put a 30-day time limit on the minister making a decision after receiving a report, which is a positive step. It also allows the minister to examine more fully the impact of imports on jobs and on domestic industry. I really think this is an important step to examine the impact on jobs and on domestic industry. It expands the definition of interested parties to a decision on trade dumping to include, amongst others, unions—something that we certainly would expect from the Labor government.The bill also addresses issues relating to the WTO anti-dumping agreement and agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures. As we know, dumping is defined by Australian Customs as a form of price differentiation where goods are exported to Australia at a price below their normal value, which of course is to the detriment of the locally produced goods. It includes the use of export subsidies paid to the benefit of a foreign exporter of goods into Australia, be those subsidies direct or indirect. That gives a price advantage to the foreign entity causing or threatening material injury to an Australian industry, and we see this repeatedly.Put simply, anti-dumping measures apply a temporary import duty. It is not about protection; it is about fair process. It is called an interim dumping duty on products that are sold below the cost of production and a countervailing duty for subsidised products in order to eliminate that cost advantage that would give the foreign supplier an unfair advantage and damage local production and manufacturing.Many countries around the world provide a form of advantage for their industry and that can include, as I have said, subsidies and tariffs. It can include some low input and labour costs and low levels of necessary government compliance and regulation, which does have an impact on cost of production. These, in turn, provide cost and price advantages to their products in mature overseas markets where local producers often are inundated with compliance and cost issues. In this international marketplace, Australia produces, in spite of that, some of the worlds best agricultural, food and manufactured products and extremely high quality manufactured goods.The price disadvantage is unfortunately exacerbated by the Labor government consistently making compliance more onerous and more expensive for Australian businesses. In competing with cheaper foreign products, which are underpinned and underwritten by cheap labour, subsidies or even lower quality control, our producers and manufacturers have to rely on productivity, on efficiency, on quality, on safety and on a perception as well as genuine reputation to that effect. This reputation of quality in Australian products should not be put at risk or underestimated.It should also be noted by the parliament that the Labor government has a poor record of defending Australias borders and maintaining our customs, quarantine and biosecurity. Australian farmers and food producers rely on our clean and green image and the capacity to deliver top-quality products to find and maintain markets around the world. Agricultural production in this country drives $155 billion a year in economic production, over 12 per cent of GDP, generating around 1.6 million Australian jobs and $32 billion a year in farm exports.Around the world Australian produced food is safe, clean and green, and it is essential that we maintain that reputation. A lot of that food comes from my electorate. However, this reputation is put at risk by the neglect of our biosecurity by Labor. The clean, disease-free status of Australian food and produce is paramount. That is why we cannot believe the way that this government is continually undermining border security and biosecurity.It is incredible that the government would slash $35.8 million from the quarantine and biosecurity budget and $58 million from the Customs budget, leading to 4.7 million less air cargo consignments being inspected each year and 2,150 fewer vessels being boarded on arrival. Unfortunately, that neglect has set a trend that is continuing in the current budget, with another $32.8 million cut from the operational budget of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, which reduces the capacity of the department to deliver services to Australian agriculture.The Beale quarantine and biosecurity review, commissioned by Labor, called for hundreds of millions of dollars to be spent on AQIS and quarantine annually to provide proper real protection to our nations borders. Instead of heeding this report, the government has failed to act, except to basically spend the last 2½ years and the last two budgets running down and stripping assets. This is particularly important in this debate because, without price advantage, Australian producers and manufacturers have to rely on quality, safety, productivity and efficiency to compete effectively in the marketplace, be it domestically or internationally, as reflected in this bill.We saw only today the announcement by the government following on from the Prime Ministers personal decision to make an announcement in the New Zealand parliament that she would allow the importation of New Zealand apples into Australia. This means that Biosecurity Australia has been forced by the Prime Ministers statement to abandon the need for adequate protocols to prevent the incursion of serious diseases like fire blight with the importation of New Zealand apples. We saw the result of that today. Let us not be in any doubt: these proposals by Biosecurity Australia are an abandonment of the quarantine principles that have made us amongst the cleanest producers of high-quality food in the world.As we know when we look at the anti-dumping measures in this bill, dumping affects like goods as well as those it affects directly. Consistently we have seen the minister hide behind Doha in dealing with these matters instead of producing the type of legislation that would make a difference. We heard previously from the member for Murray about the amount of fruit that is imported and that there is more fruit imported than exported. There are very real issues when we talk about anti-dumping and anti-dumping measures and how the government should be responding. There has been no greater acknowledgement of the lack of equity in trade than the failure of the government to deliver through any of the Doha talks.Debate interrupted.","Customs Amendment (Anti-dumping Improvements) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MARINO (Forrest—Opposition Whip) ","(18:50):"

338,0,0,0,1,1,"Markus, Louise, MP","E07","Macquarie","LP","N/A",8415," I rise to speak about the Labor governments decision in the last federal budget to close the chronic disease dental scheme by December this year. This, like many Labor decisions, has not been thought out and will leave a lot of residents in Macquarie without access to much needed dental care. The coalition government introduced the chronic disease dental scheme in 2007. Since then nearly 13 million dental services have been provided to over half a million Australians. Now the Gillard Labor government wants to close it down. The scheme provides $4,250 worth of dental assistance over two years for patients who are diagnosed with a chronic illness, whose dental condition is exacerbating that illness and who are managed under a general practitioner care plan.To close this scheme would have disastrous health impacts on the residents of Macquarie. The chronic disease dental scheme has been very beneficial. It has aided many Australians to access dental care in a timely fashion. Dental care can be very costly, and waiting lists are often longer than those in need can afford to wait. Under the scheme a lot of these challenges have been alleviated.The Labor government have tried on two separate occasions to stop this popular scheme and both times the Senate has disallowed its closure. Labor are now trying to close the scheme for a third time. This is another example of the Labor government thinking they know better than the Australian people.The need for this scheme cannot be disputed. In its first year, 400,235 New South Wales services accessed this scheme. In the 2010-11 financial year this had surged over 700 per cent to 2,859,175 services. This very effective scheme is being shut down by a Labor government desperate to recover some of the billions of dollars they have wasted in their suite of mismanaged policies, whether it be pink batts, the five-for-one people swap or the carbon tax—and, of course, the list goes on.Across my electorate I have found strong support for the chronic disease dental scheme. I have spoken to dentists and patients from suburbs such as Blaxland, Bligh Park and Katoomba and the message has always been the same. The chronic disease dental scheme has allowed many people who otherwise could not have gained access to dental health care the opportunity to do so in a timely manner without the cost affecting their ability to receive treatment.Many local dentists are sceptical of Labors ability to deliver a viable alternative and have grave concerns about the number of people who, if the scheme is removed, will be sent to the back of a very long public waiting list. Local dentists have highlighted to me how troubling bad teeth can be for your health. To offer a patient a vital life-saving device or operation and not ensure that their teeth are healthy could potentially undo all of that work. Bacteria and other diseases that are on your teeth and gums can spread throughout your body. Healthy teeth are an important part of a healthy life.I was told stories of how this scheme had affected the lives of Macquarie residents in positive ways. I was told the story of a woman from the Blue Mountains who had lived with no teeth for the past 20 years due to losing them in a shocking case of domestic violence. She had never been able to afford new teeth. Thanks to the chronic disease dental scheme she received the much needed surgery. When she saw herself in the mirror with her brand-new teeth she burst into tears and said it was one of the happiest moments of her life.Another story was of a young person battling to break the cycle of drug addiction. Due to her challenges with this addiction she had, unfortunately, lost all of her teeth. She qualified for new teeth under the chronic disease dental scheme. Thanks to this and her new lease on life she has been able to break the cycle and turn her life around and obtain work. She now works in a local fruit shop. She is back on track with a healthy lifestyle. Being able to access the workforce has made a real difference in her rehabilitation.The dentists I spoke to made one thing very clear to me. Dental assistance is valuable not only for a persons physical health but also for their self-esteem and mental health. The chronic disease dental scheme has helped to improve the health and morale of Australians who otherwise could not have afforded to receive this assistance. We live in a time of economic uncertainty. The cost of living is continuing to rise and more members of my electorate are struggling to make ends meet. This Labor government is now proposing to close access to dental health care that has made, and will continue to make, a difference to the lives of my constituents.","Dental Health","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs MARKUS (Macquarie) ","(19:00):"
339,0,0,0,1,1,"Byrne, Anthony, MP","008K0","Holt","ALP","N/A",8417," I rise in this House tonight to proudly extend my best wishes to the many members of the Australian community of proud Indian heritage and those from my electorate of Holt who, on Monday, 15 August 2011, celebrated the 64th anniversary of Indias independence from British rule. On that day in 1947 India became a sovereign nation. When India achieved independence, Indias first Prime Minister, Mr Nehru, spoke to the nation. He asked the nation one important question on the first day India became a free country. He asked: are we brave enough and wise enough to grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future? From any objective assessment, India has grasped the opportunity and claimed its birthright.Indias economic development, along with its emergence in key institutions like the G20 and other elements of the global political and economic architecture, is testament to the spirit of the people of India, their vibrant optimism, their desire for social prosperity and economic development and for opportunity for their country and their children. The Indian economy is growing at approximately eight per cent. The economic boom has translated into opportunities for its citizens in the way of new infrastructure and industries and has improved the lives of many Indian citizens. India has been one of the fastest-growing large economies since 1994. Indian economic engagement with the rest of the world has increased, particularly in the services sector. It is apparent that the spirit of the people of India still moves people within the country to fight for change, changes that they want to see in their country and in the world. And at this time of profound change and hope for millions of people, Indias story stands as a powerful example of what people can achieve through the peaceful pursuit of human, political and social rights.Australia has a very broad and deep relationship with India based on our common interests and shared commitment to democracy, pluralism, human rights and the rule of law. The relationship that exists between our countries is one characterised not only by flourishing trade but profound cultural and social exchange. In 2009, for example, the then Prime Minister Rudd announced a major boost in funding over five years for joint science and technology research projects. This included $50 million that will be matched by India for the Australia-India Strategic Research Fund to support joint research in some of the grand challenges facing the two countries, like energy, food and water security.It is no secret—and I proudly say this—that Australia welcomes a growing number of migrants, students and visitors from India. They are part of the past, present and future of this nation. In our past, Indian crews from the Bay of Bengal are believed to have come to Australia on trading ships soon after 1788 and others came later, in the 1800s. These members of the Indian community were vital in the early exploration of inland Australia and in the establishment of service and communication links. Today well over 300,000 people of Indian heritage are making an invaluable contribution to Australias economic and social prosperity.I am continually amazed at the vibrant culture that the Indian community has brought to Australia. In particular it has been heartening to see how the Indian community has enriched the local community in my electorate. They have left an indelible mark on areas in and around my electorate like the Carrum Downs Temple and the Indian Quarter in Dandenong, home of many Indian restaurants and Indian cultural organisations. I visited the Hindu Shri Shiva Vishnu temple in Carrum Downs earlier this year for the Holi Festival. This temple was built by Hindu community members from India, Sri Lanka, Fiji and South Africa. The building itself is a monumental piece of architecture, a credit to the community.One of the great triumphs of the Australian experience is to allow people from every corner of the earth to make this place their home and to share their cultures with their fellow Australians in this country in an atmosphere of mutual respect, tolerance and shared understanding. This was made very clear to me during the Week of Nations that took place at the Courtenay Gardens Primary School on Friday, 29 July 2011. That is where they had a parade of nations, and the acceptance that members of the Indian community had from that particular community was very clear.I wish to end my speech by saying happy Independence Day in celebration of Indias achievements. We honour its past and look with hope to what certainly will be a great future.

340,0,0,0,1,1,"Scott, Bruce, MP","YT4","Maranoa","Nats","N/A",8418," I rise this evening to discuss a constituents recent experience with a federal government agency, the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Perhaps it has long outlived its usefulness in a modern age, and I will describe what has happened to one of my constituents.Recently, an elderly constituent living in one of the Maranoa electorates smaller rural communities contacted my office regarding the Australian Health Survey 2011-13 which is currently being conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. She had been randomly selected to participate in the survey, which forces her to answer personal questions about her health and her lifestyle to government bureaucrats.According to the government, this survey is expected to be the most comprehensive research on health that Australians have ever had undertaken. Participants will be weighed and measured and also asked detailed questions on what they eat and drink and their physical activity. Answering these questions is compulsory and, whilst providing a blood and urine sample is voluntary, 50,000 adults and children from around Australia will be randomly sampled to give a snapshot of the nations health. Those 50,000 people will be compelled to take part in the survey. If they refuse to divulge information on their health and lifestyle to the ABS, they will face a hefty fine.The resident who was randomly selected in one of the communities in the electorate of Maranoa is an 89-year-old woman. After finding an unknown vehicle parked outside her house, she was handed a leaflet about the survey and was informed she was one of the lucky ones to be selected. She told the person that she was not interested in the survey as she was too old and suggested they find someone else. She thought that the ABS person would then go away.Not so. A few days later the lady, my constituent, on returning to her home found that a letter from the ABS had been placed under her door. The letter advised her that the ABS had the power to direct unwilling participants to provide personal information. Operating under the Census and Statistics Act 1905, the ABS can impose a fine of up to $110 a day if the participant refuses to comply after being directed to do so in writing. Can you believe it? Is this a soviet state we live in these days? I hope not.The tone used in the letter—which I have—was both arrogant and confronting. An elderly lady is justifiably concerned about letting strangers into her house and divulging confidential information about her health. These standover tactics are completely unacceptable, particularly from a federal government agency, when it involves an 89-year-old woman.The federal government has just conducted the 2011 Census and will now be spending some $48 million on this survey. Surely that $48 million that is going to be used obviously to make work for the ABS and health department could have been wisely invested in rural communities crying out for better health services, for instance. Queensland is home to one-third of the nations regional population and my electorate is 42 per cent of the landmass of Queensland, and yet Queensland received only $164 million of the federal governments $1.8 billion for regional health and hospital funding announced in the federal budget. Now, $48 million would go a long way in the electorate of Maranoa or many regional areas, for that matter, across Australia towards better health services rather than conducting ABS statistical surveys which I think are of doubtful value in this day and age.I know my constituents in the town of Mitchell are looking for some funds for an aged-care facility. Half a million dollars out of that $48 million would go an awfully long way there. I know in Kingaroy they are looking for better palliative care services. These are much needed and yet my electorate received some $4 million from that $1.8 billion health fund that was announced in the budget.I am extremely disappointed with the conduct of the ABS in regard to this sensitive and private information. I will be writing to the minister and I will also be writing to the ABS. They can do better. This is a statistical service that is no longer required in this day and age, given modern technology.

341,0,0,0,1,1,"Leigh, Andrew, MP","BU8","Fraser","ALP","N/A",8419," In 1994 the genocide in Rwanda shook the worlds collective conscience. A mixture of international unwillingness and poor procedure meant that effective action was not taken to prevent the killings. The next year, in what became the largest mass murder in Europe since World War II, United Nations forces in Srebrenica failed to protect those who had sought refuge in a so-called UN safe zone. In 1999, fear of a veto in the Security Council prevented UN forces from intervening in atrocities in Kosovo. All of these failures revealed structural defects in the way the international community responds to mass atrocities.Almost since its inception, reform has been on the agenda of the UN. In helping me better understand the various proposals for UN Security Council reform, I am grateful to William Isdale, who interned in my office and worked on this issue.The UN Security Council plays a vital role in world affairs. Except in cases of self-defence, the Security Council is the only international body legally entitled to authorise the use of force. Yet the council currently has two major challenges: membership and procedural effectiveness.The fact that the councils five permanent members are essentially the victors in World War II has riled developing countries, whose member states are often those most affected by UN peacekeeping operations. There is a strong push for greater geographical representation in the council and an emerging consensus that we should boost the number of permanent members and make the deliberations of the council more transparent. Among the countries most often mentioned are Japan, Germany, Brazil and India. Others suggest that the permanent members should include representatives from Africa and from majority Muslim nations. Australia is among the many countries that support Indias current bid for a permanent seat, which Indias first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, reportedly declined when it was offered in 1955.A major issue in Security Council reform is the veto. The veto power of the permanent members has always been contentious—Australia opposed its introduction in the council from the start—and at one stage the conflict on this question threatened to break up the 1945 San Francisco conference at which the UN Charter was drafted. The threat of veto has prevented effective intervention in atrocities as recently as Darfur in 2005. Yet a resolution to remove the veto power would almost certainly itself be vetoed. Bodies like the African Union are aggrieved by the potential that their members will be offered second-class permanency, but additional vetoes in the council could make the body even less effective.If we add permanent members, they should participate without a veto. Indeed, it would be better if the existing permanent members did not veto intervention to prevent mass atrocities. Thanks in part to the tireless efforts of former Australian foreign minister Gareth Evans, the council unanimously affirmed its Responsibility to Protect in 2006 and again in 2009. Where intervention is approved, it should be done swiftly and with minimal casualties. One challenge is that the UN currently lacks its own standing army and instead relies on member nations willing to commit forces. At present, a large number of such forces are provided by developing countries who hope that their soldiers will be trained up in the process. The UN must ensure that it has the best people for the job.The UN also has a way to go in ensuring that the procedures for authorising action on the ground are clear and transparent, as they were not in Srebrenica or Rwanda, and that it builds upon the infrastructure required for such operations. Progress has been made, such as the creation of a UN situation room in 1993, but more could be done to strengthen the UNs capacity to monitor the security situation of countries and predict the likelihood of an outbreak of ethnic violence.In a world of problems without passports, multilateralism is no longer a second option, especially when it comes to issues like genocide and other mass atrocities. Strengthening the ability of the United Nations to deal with such crises is in everyones interests. Martin Luther King once said:Over the bleached bones and jumbled residues of numerous civilisations are written the pathetic words: Too late.Let us hope that reform of the UN Security Council can help avert another Rwanda, Srebrenica, Kosovo or Darfur.","United Nations Security Council","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr LEIGH (Fraser) ","(19:15):"
342,0,0,0,1,1,"Andrews, Karen, MP",230886,"McPherson","LP","N/A",8420," I rise to speak in general about education and specifically about the Australian Industry Trade College. The AITC is a college dedicated to preparing year 11 and year 12 students for a career in industry and it is based in my electorate of McPherson on the Gold Coast. Their unique modelling differs from conventional schooling allowing students to complete their senior education and gain significant work experience along with various additional qualifications and skills. This gives students the essential foundations necessary to secure an apprenticeship placement.Over 530 school based apprenticeships have been achieved by the college in over 50 different trade qualifications and around 95 per cent of students graduate with the Queensland Certificate of Education each year. These numbers are impressive when compared to the conventional schooling senior certificate rate of only 75 per cent. Around 92 per cent of year 12 graduates from the college were employed as apprentices in 2010. At any one time there are around 300 students at the college working towards the same goal of an apprenticeship in their chosen field. The AITC takes on 150 year-11 students each year. Currently there are 300 students enrolled at the AITC. However, at any one time, half of them are off campus completing on-the-job training though their work experience program. The remaining students are on campus completing a four-week block of in-class study.The team of educators at the AITC have been selected for their commitment to the unique program and a flexible learning pathway. Together these academics have developed an innovative and creative curriculum model that complies with the Queensland Studies Authority. The core curriculum at the AITC includes English communication, mathematics A or pre-vocational mathematics, business, information technology and physical wellness, which includes yoga and martial arts. Other fields of study include a certificate III Australian School-based Apprenticeship, delivered off site at a registered training organisation. The AITC also offers the option of additional certificate courses, and all students must engage in community service. The curriculum is delivered in units during the four-week block, and the work component is a separate unit which also contributes points to the Queensland Certificate of Education.The unique learning structure at the AITC gives students the opportunity to graduate not just with a Queensland Certificate of Education but also with significant work experience, a Certificate II in Information Technology, significant networks within the industry of their choice, a first-aid certificate and the completion of up to 30 per cent of a certificate III in their trade qualification.But it is not only the learning structure that is unique at the college. The AITC also has a unique style of teaching and working with students. Each student at the AITC has assigned to them a case manager who provides them with support and advice as they prepare themselves for entry into the workforce. Making the transition out into the real world can be very daunting for young people. Having a mentor on hand makes the transition less stressful for them.One of the tasks students are given to increase their confidence in looking for work is to make their own phone calls in class to prospective work-experience employers. This is a very emotional task for these students as rejection becomes a reality that they must face. Young people sometimes do not realise how difficult it can be to get a job, and this exercise empowers them and strengthens their ability and confidence in arranging their own work experience, teaching them a valuable lesson not usually taught in more traditional models. The college has established relationships with over 1,200 employers from North Queensland through to Tasmania to assist the students in finding work once they have completed their qualifications.The AITC CEO, Mark Hands, and the staff are doing a wonderful job in ensuring young people have access to flexible education and practical experience, particularly for students who would normally leave school before completing years 11 and 12. The flexible model of the AITC works for individuals wanting to pursue a career in industry without missing out on or forgoing the final years of their schooling. I would like to see more educational institutions offering flexible learning options like the AITC to encourage a future skilled workforce— (Time expired)","Australian Industry Trade College","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ANDREWS (McPherson) ","(19:20):"

To commemorate the occasion, services will be held in my electorate of Makin at Henderson Square at Pooraka and at the Tea Tree Gully RSL Memorial Garden. Being in Canberra, I will be unable to attend those services, but I will be represented at both of them by members of my staff. On Sunday, 21 August, I will, however, attend the annual service organised by the Vietnam Veterans Day Council of South Australia at the Torrens Parade Ground in Adelaide, as I have done for several years.The Battle of Long Tan was fought between the Australian Army and Viet Cong forces in a rubber plantation near the village of Long Tan in South Vietnam. During the battle, 108 soldiers from D Company of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, fought off an assault by an estimated 2,500 Vietnamese troops. The battle claimed the lives of 18 Australians, whilst 27 other soldiers were wounded. At least 245 Vietnamese were also killed.In Henderson Square, located in the Montague Farm Estate within Pooraka, a special Vietnam War memorial was established several years ago. On the initiative of Fred Pritchard, himself a Vietnam veteran, who project managed the development of the estate in the 1990s, Montague Farm has been dedicated to Australians who served and died in the Vietnam War. Of the 501 Australian servicemen killed in the Ten Thousand Day War, 62 were from South Australia, and the majority of them have been recognised in the naming of the streets and reserves in the Montague Farm Estate. Henderson Square is named in memory of Warrant Officer Malcolm Henderson, who passed away on 16 December 1967.I note that in this weeks edition of the Leader Messenger, the local newspaper, the vice-president of the Tea Tree Gully RSL and Vietnam veteran, Malcolm Love, who I am sure will not mind me referring to him as a mate, was quoted:No one does say much about Vietnam … but I saw enough for it to have a pretty big impact on my life.We might not talk about it but we all know what it was like and we take comfort from that.We support one another and look after one another.The bond that these Vietnam veterans share is uniquely strong. It is easy to forget today that there was considerable opposition in the 1960s to the Vietnam War and, indeed, to the notion of conscription. Many of those Australians who served in Vietnam were national servicemen. In March 1966 the government announced that national servicemen would be sent to Vietnam to fight in units of the Australian Regular Army and for secondment to American forces. Despite this, many former national servicemen I have come to know now see their national service as a positive phase in their lives.Just as our remembrance of World War I centres on the Gallipoli landing on 25 April, for the Vietnam War it has become centred on the Battle of Long Tan. Not only is this battle significant because of the courage the 100-plus young Australian men displayed fighting off a regimental assault; it also had a considerable impact on the war as it allowed the Australian Army to gain dominance over Phuoc Tuy Province.This week, 45 years after the Battle of Long Tan, former members of D Company, 6RAR, will receive a Unit Citation for Gallantry. The current generation of 6RAR are continuing a proud tradition and have recently returned from serving the nation in Afghanistan. Several 6RAR solders will receive individual medals for their efforts during their recent eight-month deployment. When you consider that the late American President Lyndon Baines Johnson awarded D Company 6RAR the US Presidential Unit Citation in 1968, one could argue that the official recognition within Australia is long overdue. The words contained in the late presidents citation conjure up a strong image of what the young Australian soldiers endured 45 years ago. I quote from the citation:The enemy maintained a continuous, intense volume of fire and attacked repeatedly from all directions. Each successive assault was repulsed by the courageous Australians. Heavy rainfall and a low ceiling prevented any friendly close air support during the battle.After three hours of savage attacks, having failed to penetrate the Australian lines, the enemy withdrew from the battlefield carrying many dead and wounded, and leaving 245 Viet Cong dead forward of the defence position of D Company.Last year the last two Australian missing personnel from the Vietnam War, Pilot Officer Robert Carver and Flying Officer Michael Herbert, were brought home. It was an important closure to the war, which ended nearly 40 years ago but which has not been forgotten by those who served there. To quote a Vietnam veteran, I left Vietnam in 1970, but Vietnam never left me. Tonight I take this opportunity to recognise our Vietnam veterans.

344,0,0,0,1,1,"Gash, Joanna, MP","AK6","Gilmore","LP","N/A",8423," There is a certain irony in comparing two recent Illawarra Mercury articles relating to BlueScope Steel. If it were not so serious, it would be laughable. The first was reported on 19 July, just gone. The headline says Simon Crean likes what he sees at Port Kembla. The minister is quoted as saying:… after adjustments under the recent Federal Government package to help it cope with carbon pricing, BlueScope is still well and truly in the game.That may well be right in one sense, but it is especially ironic in another. In an article in the same newspaper less than one month later, on 15 August, another headline read Carbon tax money may fund BlueScope cuts. The opening line read:Much of the $180 million in taxpayers money promised to BlueScope Steel in the carbon tax package could end up funding the companys job cuts, which are expected to start within weeks.BlueScope Steel has also announced that it would be likely to cease production at one of its two Port Kembla blast furnaces. Aside from the direct job losses, there will be considerable flow-on effects impacting on contractors and other small businesses that are organic to the steelworks. The Illawarra Mercury ventured that this could well be the tip of the iceberg.The House would recall earlier this year a motion by the member for Throsby ardently lending his support to a carbon tax on our steel industry. This is what he said:We are taking action to create new job opportunities in a clean energy generation and taking action to help Australia’s trade-exposed emission-intensive industries.The reality is that jobs are going to be lost despite the delusional thinking of the member for Throsby, as events are revealing. He thought it was a great thing, but those closer to the working class have a different view. He also said:It is beyond question that the Gillard government is not prepared to see jobs go offshore as a result of our transition to a low-carbon economy. Nor do we want to see the emissions that come with those jobs go overseas.That is exactly what is happening. My former colleague and former member for Throsby, Jennie George, now retired, did a splendid job representing the working class voters of Throsby. We may not have agreed on a number of issues, but she had my respect in the way that she stood up for the welfare of those she was elected to represent, especially BlueScope Steel. I just wish I could say the same thing about her successor, who is ignoring the need of those he was elected by simply to curry favour with his political masters.Bob Harrison is the former state member for Kiama, who served in the New South Wales parliament for over 13 years and is a life member of the Australian Labor Party. He was also former Mayor of the City of Shellharbour. Earlier this year Bob contributed an article to the Illawarra Mercury whose banner read, Carbon tax will burn Illawarra. It was a rejection of what the Labor member for Throsby was advocating. Bobs theme was that this carbon tax would have a significant and adverse effect on the employment prospects for the greater Illawarra region. How prophetic were his words?BlueScope is a major steel product manufacturer in the Illawarra, employing hundreds of workers, including those from the suburbs I represent in and around Shellharbour. Many of those workers are now going to lose their jobs. It is not as if the Gillard government and its supporters were not warned. BlueScope Steels CEO, Paul OMalley, said that they could live with the tax provided tariffs are imposed on their overseas competitors who will not have to pay a carbon tax. This was never going to happen, and some manufacturers were already saying they could move their operations overseas. This is bringing that scenario closer to reality. BlueScope and OneSteel have said:Its a direct threat to this NSW regional economy and the 12,000 workers and their families …How true. There is plenty of evidence to back up those concerns, but despite all the evidence Labors cheer squad chooses to remain in denial. The people who allegedly seek to represent the views of the workers in the Illawarra, the Australian Workers Union, have dismissed these concerns as scaremongering, yet the concluding remarks of its head, Mr Andrew Gillespie, as reported in the Illawarra Mercury, acknowledge that many workers were concerned about the talk of BlueScope potentially shifting operations offshore. He said:I keep telling them I cant give you answers on carbon price, or carbon relief, because it hasnt been done yet.It is done, and this is the result. The motion by the member for Throsby exhorted this House to agree that governments must work with the manufacturing industry and communities to assist their transformation to meet the challenge of a carbon constrained future. The only transformation is the migration of our local manufacturing industries and their jobs to the Asian economy.I will certainly be doing all I can to protect jobs, and if that means crossing swords with the member for Throsby and the unions, so be it. Unlike them, I take seriously my responsibilities and the interests of the people I represent. I despair and say: what a foolish government this country has been cursed with.","Carbon Pricing","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[7]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs GASH (Gilmore) ","(19:31):"
345,0,0,0,1,1,"Husic, Ed, MP",91219,"Chifley","ALP","N/A",8425," In March I spoke about the price differentials that exist in relation to products sold in Australia compared to overseas. I did not imagine at the time it would trigger the response it did. I received a wide range of emails and calls complaining about the way Australian consumers and businesses have been, frankly, ripped off. Back then I put the spotlight on a particular company: Apple. I will not go into detail about the differences now, because I did at the time. It was clear that the products they were manufacturing and retailing had a significant difference in price. Even the products of other manufacturers sold by Apple via its website had some massive differences.So I wrote to them in March. Amazingly, at the time I was quietly warned by IT journalists and consumers not to expect a response. Chase them up I did; my office followed them up a number of times. They promised that by 16 July Apple Australias Managing Director, Tony King, would personally respond to the concerns raised in March once he returned from leave. In the meantime, Apple began to reduce the prices of the apps it sells via iTunes. I congratulated them for it at the time but indicated I wanted to see where they would head with hardware costs. Yet only a week later it became clear that Apple was not going to move on this issue. Tech website Delimiter reported that Apple was set to hit consumers again. Its new MacBook Air was estimated to cost up to $300 more than US consumers would have to pay and the new Apple Thunderbolt display would cost up to $270 more. July 16 came and went. Apple refused to respond and I am staggered by their behaviour: theyve snubbed consumer, media and parliamentary interest in this matter.But they are not the only ones with a case to answer for in relation to glaring price differentials. Some other culprits are PC manufacturer Lenovo, which released their ThinkPad X1 laptop in May and which costs $1,959 here, despite the same model selling in the US for as little as $1,399; Microsofts flagship cloud productivity suite Office 365 costs 76 per cent more here than in the US; and Adobes Creative Suite—and this is incredible—which costs US$699 but nearly A$1,200. Gamers pay up to 60 per cent more here for products compared to those in the UK or US. Consumers have noticed this, the media has noticed this and now it appears even the Productivity Commission has noticed this. Here is what it said in its recently released report into Australias retail sector:The Commission is aware of the longstanding practice by which some international suppliers set differential regional prices. This effectively treats consumers in one region as willing, or able, to tolerate significantly higher prices than those in other countries.It goes on to say:Some international suppliers have attempted to defend such price discrimination as due to the cost of supplying a remote and relatively small market like Australia, which in some cases has its own unique requirements. These arguments in most cases are not persuasive, especially in the case of downloaded music, software and videos, for example, where the costs of delivery to the customer are practically zero and uniform around the world.The commission summed it up neatly: the arguments are, in its words, simply not persuasive.It is well known that as a nation we are early adopters of technology, but being early adopters has definitely come with a price. If you are a small business needing the latest software to help keep pace with changes in your business or industry, or to be more productive, you should not be hammered by these price differences. Younger people, with less spending power but with a demand for these products, should not be hit with these variations either. Families that also want access to technology, whose impact has been far reaching in our homes and lives, should not be fleeced for the sake of Silicon Valleys bottom line. These companies would simply not do this to consumers in their home countries. Why do it in ours?I have raised this matter within government and certainly believe that the Productivity Commissions views are compelling. If IT companies are not prepared to be transparent about their pricing decisions, then perhaps it is time for our pricing watchdog, the ACCC, to take up the case for long-suffering consumers and carry out a formal inquiry into why these prices differ so wildly.","Economy","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[8]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HUSIC (Chifley—Government Whip) ","(19:35):"
346,0,0,0,1,1,"Roy, Wyatt, MP","M2X","Longman","LP","N/A",8426," I would like to thank the shadow Treasurer, the Hon. Joe Hockey, for visiting Longman last week. Joe and I toured the electorate, visited several small businesses and held a community lunch with over 150 local small businesses. I would like to outline to the House some of the realities that are facing the locals in my community.Across my electorate of Longman we have six per cent unemployment. In Caboolture, the largest population base in the electorate, we have 10 per cent unemployment. When you walk down the main street in Caboolture one in ten of the people you meet do not have a job. We have a local economy that is completely dependent on what we on this side of the House think of as the power house and the engine room of the economy—small business. We have a local economy that is dependent on tourism, retail and light industry. The greatest resources in my local community are the work ethic and the willingness of countless locals to get out there and have a go. These locals are willing to get out there and go into business, often in the face of adversity and a difficult economic climate, and to have a go, to say that they want to get ahead in life, to provide for their families and, importantly, to employ people.The concern that was certainly raised when Joe visited, and that is raised with me every single day when I make my way around the electorate talking to small businesses and to these people who are getting out there and having a go, is that life is getting more difficult. Something that the Labor Party and the members opposite have forgotten—or, worse yet, attacked—is this notion of having a go. I challenge the members opposite—there are not a lot of members opposite, but I would certainly challenge any interjecting members—to go out into their communities, talk to these local small businesses and come back to this place and tell me when you have found one small business that says, What my business needs to thrive, to employ people, to prosper and to give back to the local economy is higher operating costs. There is now deathly silence on the other side, but I can tell you, Mr Speaker, that with higher operating costs, greater regulation and a greater burden on the local small businesses in my community they will find it harder to do what they naturally do, and what they naturally do is to prosper and employ people. The natural setting of small business in this country is based on opportunity. I worry when we attack opportunity by making it harder for people to get out there and have a go.I might share with the House a story from the shadow Treasurers visit to my electorate. We went out and saw a local worker in a manufacturing firm in my electorate. He said: If I work overtime, all that ends up happening is that I get taxed more. I have to work harder to then try to pay back that greater tax burden, and there is no incentive for me to get out there and try to get ahead in life. I stress that I cannot find one business that says, A tax makes my business thrive.I worry sometimes because the members opposite in the Labor Party have this belief that the government has the solution to everybodys problems. I can tell you, Mr Speaker, that the government is the problem. The fundamental truth that we seem to have forgotten in this nation is that, instead of looking to the government for the solutions to our problems, sometimes we should let the government get out of our way so that we can get on with our lives and thrive, prosper and do what we naturally do, which is employ people and provide for our local community. I think it is quite worrying that our country is going down this path where we attack hope, where we attack reward for hard work and where we attack the notion of a society based on opportunity. On this side of the House we understand that the essential ingredients for Australia to prosper once again are to have hope that tomorrow will be better than today, that we will have reward for hard work and that we will have equality of opportunity—that we will provide all Australians with an opportunity to get ahead in life.In conclusion, I would like to say that on this side of the House, in order to deliver on those three essential ingredients we will deliver two promises: under a coalition government you will have less tax and you will have less government spending. The government will get out of the way so that you can get on and get ahead in life.","Longman Electorate","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[9]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","WYATT ROY (Longman) ","(19:40):"
347,0,0,0,1,1,"Burke, Anna, MP","83S","Chisholm","ALP","N/A",8427," I rise tonight to speak on the governments initiative in the area of supported services for people with disability, in particular its plan to introduce a National Disability Insurance Scheme. I want to speak out in full support of this initiative.I also want to take the time to thank the many wonderful disability groups in my electorate who have been behind the push for this development. Yes, the government asked the Productivity Commission to look at this; but this has been a scheme that many community groups, disability groups and individuals have been pushing for for some time.I will just name a few that are housed in my electorate and who have been very quietly advocating behind the scenes: Brainlink Services Limited, the MS Society, Scope, the Oakleigh Centre, Melbourne East Disability Advocacy, Alkira and numerous others in my electorate. They have been behind the scenes supporting this and they have applauded the governments and the Productivity Commissions announcement to finally end this system of chasing money endlessly, and to develop this scheme.The system of disability services is, as we all know, stretched, and has often failed to meet the needs of the disabled in our community, their families and their carers. As the Productivity Commission report said, It is unfair, unfunded and fragmented, and it is certainly overdue for major reform. As the campaign that is currently running says, Every Aussie counts, and we should have a system that does not say that how you got your disability determines your funding level; it is that you are disabled, and we will have a national scheme to ensure that people are covered.The government did ask the Productivity Commission to look into long-term care and support of people with disabilities. One of the growing issues amongst many in my community, and I know this is across the board, is ageing parents who have children with disability in their care. They are terrified of what will happen to that child when the parent dies. Mine is an ageing community and so these are parents who look at their child, who is 40 or 50 and who is still their full responsibility. They are traumatised about what will happen to them. This report says that one of the big funding gaps is in that area of housing and support when parents and carers have gone and that we need to fund that into the future.The Productivity Commission has recommended that, like Medicare, Australians should be insured against significant disability. It means that those Australians with significant disability will get the kind of care and support Australians expect for them. It also means that any Australian who acquires a disability, or whose child is born with a disability, can have confidence that they will get helping hands when they need it. The government agrees that transformational reform of disability services is desperately needed to provide the kind of care and support that people need.To give Australians who might acquire a disability the confidence that they will be given a helping hand when they need it most the government will be working with states and territories, and that will begin this Friday at the COAG meeting to ensure that we have a nationally coordinated scheme. The scheme will provide individually tailored care and support to around 410,000 people with significant disabilities.Many people think that people with disabilities in our community are diminishing. Actually, people with disability in our communities are increasing, and we need to ensure that we have the means to ensure that they are cared for now and into the future. It will be accompanied by a national injury insurance scheme to provide no-fault insurance for anyone who suffers a catastrophic injury. The government acknowledges the importance of taking an insurance approach to provide people with disability with the care and support they need over the course of their lifetime, and is starting the process of reform by establishing an advisory group to assist the task force to provide expert advice on delivering the foundations for reform and preparing for launch and by seeking to establish a select committee on disability reform that would bring together Commonwealth, states, territories and disability ministers to do the work needed to lay the foundations for change.The government is committing an additional $10 million immediately in line with Productivity Commission recommendations to support this work and to lay the foundation for reforms. This is on top of the increased funding this government has provided already in the disability space.I have spoken often in this place of the wonderful organisations in my electorate that do great work, but I had the joy of visiting many over the break—the break from Canberra, not from work, can I just emphasise! Waverley Industries was one that I got to, and where I opened a new kitchen. Waverley Industries is a not-for-profit organisation that provides work for people with disabilities. This is a fantastic new kitchen that has been fully funded by charitable donations. It will now provide a new outlet for disability employment, providing catering and support services in the area. I really want to commend Waverley Industries, and if anybody in Melbourne is looking for a good catering service—please use them.I also had the joy again of visiting IMPACT Support Services. IMPACT Support Services is a great organisation which is trying to help socialise people with disability in the community so we know that they are not different.

348,0,0,0,1,1,"Alexander, John, MP","M3M","Bennelong","LP","N/A",8429," Bennelong is a region of Sydney that seems to be the beneficiary of all that is desirable in a modern metropolis, but with all of the challenges. There are state-of-the-art shopping centres—the latest and greatest being Top Ryde City; business parks that are spectacular in scope and size, boasting the Optus headquarters—which is a world in itself; Macquarie Hospital, with medical technologies to amaze, enthral and, most importantly, heal; and Macquarie University, which has just this week been recognised as producing some of Australias most successful graduates. Many of these graduates begin as overseas students and I have spoken repeatedly of the need for a much greater level of support for these students, who play such an important role in our national and local economy.The boarding houses that have materialised all over Marsfield, leading to the community action group, Marsfield Against Residential Suffocation, have led to a radical change in the nature of this quiet suburb, as well as the mistreatment of students by unscrupulous landlords. Housing developments are aplenty, with something for everyone, but that sometimes seems to be the problem; so many moving into Bennelong and yet so many more funnelling through to the CBD from the fast-growing Hills district. The biggest single issue for some time has been concern regarding overdevelopment, which generates the first symptom of traffic congestion that impacts on our everyday life. This situation is magnified by the lack of public transport development, resulting in the import of more traffic congestion. This is the motivation to push for the well-overdue investment in infrastructure—namely, the North West rail link and the Epping to Parramatta rail link. These two pieces of infrastructure are absolutely vital to take the pressure off and regain acceptable levels of traffic rather than the levels that so drain our productivity and quality of life.I have argued recently for appropriate development that will not destroy our leafy suburban amenity. When located at the junction of these proposed upgraded rail hubs, as I have promoted for the proposed development of the Epping town centre, it would appear that no additional traffic will result. Through an acceptance of the inevitability of population increases throughout our nations largest city, the high-rise nature of the proposed development will stymie any lateral spread and therefore protect the nature and quality of life in the surrounding suburbs.Involvement in the redevelopment of the Ryde rehabilitation centre has also produced an improved result through the cooperative nature of the developer, Frasers Property. Macquarie Park also sits there waiting patiently for the promised infrastructure that will not only reduce its peoples biggest challenge of simply getting to work in reasonable time but also open up further opportunities to fulfil its vast potential. The City of Ryde has predicted that Macquarie Park will be Australias fourth largest CBD by 2030, alongside the booming Parramatta.With this knowledge, it is our duty as community leaders at all levels of government to invest in the infrastructure necessary to facilitate this growth. We must ensure that we do not repeat the same mistake made by successive Labor governments, promising infrastructure to get a good headline but rarely turning a sod of dirt or laying a metre of track. The 13-year delay of the North West rail link has seen the project blow out in cost from $360 million to $8 billion. The Chatswood to Parramatta rail link was set to cost $1 billion; half of it was built 10 years later at a cost of $2.4 billion.The crucial connection from Epping which would link the two burgeoning CBDs of Macquarie Park and Parramatta was announced by a desperate Gillard government in the dying days of the election campaign, with a promise of a further $2.1 billion. Bennelongs voters did not believe this promise, and I am here as a result of that today. Their insight seems well founded following successive broken promises on everything from a carbon tax to asylum seekers and now the surplus. The people of Bennelong would certainly appreciate it if the government kept this one promise. It is interesting to note that the Epping to Parramatta rail link failed to rate a single mention in the thousands of pages of budget documents, despite every other nation-building project that was announced in the MYEFO being confirmed in this years budget. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport gave me a verbal reassurance that this promise stands. The people of Bennelong are watching closely to see if his word is worth more than that of his Prime Minister.","Bennelong Electorate: Infrastructure","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[11]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALEXANDER (Bennelong) ","(19:50):"
349,0,0,0,1,1,"Katter, Bob, MP","HX4","Kennedy","AUS","N/A",8430," I rise to say a few words this evening. I will just paint a quick picture of what might be. In Australia, for a long time now, we have not been able to grasp a vision of what might be for our country. There was a very great man who built a bridge in Sydney called the Sydney Harbour Bridge; Dr Bradfield was his name. He won an international prize for engineering—not for the bridge, actually, but for the underground railway system, which was considered to be the most superior underground railway system in the world at the time. He also built the Story Bridge in Brisbane, the University of Queenslands sandstone buildings, Burrinjuck Dam and Hume Weir. An electorate of the House of Representatives is named after him. The highways over the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the Story Bridge in Brisbane are named after him as well.Dr Bradfield conceived the scheme of taking a tiny bit of the vast waters of the superwet belt of North Queensland and turning them back into Lake Eyre. The revised Bradfield scheme conceives not of taking that water and turning it into Lake Eyre but using it on the great inland plains of Queensland. He proposed an alternative of digging a ditch up from Spencer Gulf, which has been costed recently at about $4½ thousand million. It would fill Lake Eyre and would put 30 million megalitres of evaporation water over the Murray-Darling system. The Murray-Darling system has 22 million megalitres of run-off. It is blown up against the inside of the Great Dividing Range, and I think it is reasonable to accept that it would be precipitation. Modelling has been done which indicates that that would not occur. These scientists have to explain to me where the water is going to go! If it blows from the ocean up against the Great Dividing Range on one side, it rains. If it blows from this side, surely it should rain as well.I am not talking about the Bradfield scheme now. I will just switch to three water development schemes in North Queensland. There is the Pentland scheme, and we thank the federal government and also the opposition very much and very sincerely for their enthusiasm for the Pentland scheme, which will produce 1,000 megalitres of ethanol a year to replace our dwindling oil supplies and produce petrol at an affordable rate, as is done in the United States and Brazil. It will also produce 400 megawatts of baseload power. For those who are not familiar with the figures, we have capacity to produce about 40,000 megawatts in Australia, and this would produce 400 megawatts of power. So it is a marvellous scheme. That scheme can be doubled on the Gilbert River, which is nine million megalitres of water all running into the ocean each year in a quick flood. People sometimes envisage that when we put a dam across we somehow stop our rivers from running in North Queensland. You will never stop the rivers from running no matter how many dams you put down; and later in the year, no matter how many dams you put down, you will not be able to make them run either. So we really do not change the ecology much at all with these proposals. Three times the size of the Pentland scheme is the Burdekin River scheme. There is also the Mitchell River, Australias biggest river, now bigger than the Murray-Darling.Those three schemes together will provide six million megalitres and 600,000 hectares of irrigation, which will take only two per cent of Northern Australias water, and only one per cent of North Queenslands land will be taken up by these schemes. Yet they will yield $8,000 million for the Australian economy each and every year forever. I might add that I am not an advocate of clean power, but the schemes would produce very, very clean power indeed. Eight thousand million dollars, of course, translates into 80,000 jobs for regional Australia and the desperately needed lift that will turn around so much of agriculture in our country and rescue the sugar, cattle and grains industries.","Water","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[12]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KATTER (Kennedy) ","(19:55):"

In last Saturdays Gladstone Observer, the Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Lilley and Treasurer, referred to me as the hopeless LNP member for Flynn because I refused to support the failed rollout of the NBN in Gladstone, Australias industrial powerhouse. I would like to inform him that I fully support the coalitions fast broadband plan, which could be provided sooner and at much less cost to Gladstone and rural and regional centres throughout Australia, as detailed recently by coalition communications spokesman, Mr Malcolm Turnbull.I am wondering how the Deputy Prime Minister defines hopelessness. Does hopelessness mean his inability to deliver on a Labor promise, one of a series to the people of Gladstone? Does hopelessness mean a person who has to petition his own government and Prime Minister to deliver something he promised a year ago? Or does hopelessness mean failure by the Treasurer to understand basic economics like how to calculate a companys cost of capital, let alone the nations spiralling debt?

Next time the Deputy Prime Minister comes to town, give me a chance to take him to talk to small business who are doing it tough in my area. Let him talk to the families that Labor policies are hurting. Let me show him what the majority of workers in Central Queensland think of the carbon tax.

The Mayor of the City of Whitehorse, Ben Stennett, and the club president, Debra Fairy, joined me for the official opening at the clubrooms along with many members of the committee, media and obviously other interested observers. There were many players out on the courts at night either practising or being coached. It was great to see so many people involved.The Koonung tennis club has nine en-tous-cas courts that have a porous surface which needs watering for both dust suppression and maintenance of the subsurface, particularly in summer. A vast amount of water can be used just keeping those services in a playing condition. The courts at Koonung tennis club are used for competitions and coaching and are open for hire by school and community groups. The club currently has 246 adult members and 121 child members. It is a very popular facility.The two water tanks will receive funding of $30,000 from the federal Labor government under round 2 of the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, along with $5,200 from the tennis club and $3,000 of in-kind funding from the City of Whitehorse. With a 92,000-litre storage capacity, the clubs tanks were nearly full when I visited. The water is pumped to any location on the courts that is required. They have not only a pump but also piping to take water out around the nine courts so that no court needs to miss out. This project will reduce the amount of drinking water that was previously used to water the courts and will also result in savings on the quarterly water bills for the facility.To date, more than $3 million of community infrastructure has been delivered under the RLCIP to the City of Whitehorse, creating jobs along the way and providing great local infrastructure for the long term. It is programs such as the RLCIP that have enlivened many councils to go out and look beyond what they might have done in the past and actually co-fund many of the applications they put in to the federal government. It has been great to see the results.I commend this excellent federal government program. It is yet another example of how the Gillard Labor government is supporting local communities by working directly with local councils not only in Deakin but across every electorate in Australia. I would also like to congratulate everyone at the Koonung tennis club and the Whitehorse council involved in the project. I know that this water-saving investment will be highly valued for many years to come.","Koonung Park Tennis Club","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SYMON (Deakin) ","(09:34):"

The Blackwood community hospital was established in 1954. It was part of the community hospital movement in South Australia that was sponsored by Premier Tom Playford, where the community would help raise money for a hospital and have some co-sponsorship from the state government. Blackwood community hospital had been part of the community I represent since 1954. In October 2010 the Blackwood community hospital went into administration and was forced to close its doors on 24 December 2010.Through the liquidators, the Blackwood community hospital now has new owners—the International Musculoskeletal Research Institute. The IMRI has reopened an after-hours GP clinic on site, but last month with the shadow minister for health, the member for Dickson, I was able to announce that a coalition government would provide $500,000 towards reconfiguring the hospital to allow more services to be offered in a community setting.This would achieve several things. Firstly, it would help take pressure off the outpatients of public hospitals in my electorate, such as the Flinders Medical Centre and the Repatriation General Hospital. Secondly, it will provide a health use for this site. The reopening of the after-hours GP clinic is to be welcomed, but this is a big site and it does have the potential to offer a lot more services. Thirdly, as we see more people training as medical students and nursing students, we will need to have more training not just in the teaching hospital setting, as has been traditional, but in a community setting. This proposal at a local level will help facilitate that. I call on the government to match our commitment. This is very important for the community I represent and will allow a greater choice of health services in the area. I call on the government to match that commitment.","Blackwood Hospital","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) ","(09:37):"

Since we last met, I have had the great privilege of visiting many, many centres in my electorate to share in the announcement of funding and/or new facilities. For example, on 12 July, I went to Ridgley Primary School. They received $2.375 million for their award-winning multipurpose centre. On the same day I went to a southern Prospect specialist fibreglass manufacturer to celebrate the grant of $1.5 million for a major extension to their works. On 14 July, for the Personal Helpers and Mentors program, Mission Australia in Devonport were awarded $1.3 million to extend their fantastic service. On 15 July, I went to Romaine Park Primary with Minister Garrett to celebrate funding of $6.4 million from the federal government for the amalgam of Brooklyn, Acton and Upper Burnie primary schools—a fantastic new school at Romaine. On 19 July I was at Greenhams, the home of Cape Grim premium beef, who received $1.1 million for the extension of their abattoir. On 20 July, I went to Hivotech. Their grant was for $235,000. They are a specialist high-voltage testing service—a pioneering and world-leading tester of high-voltage materials. On 22 July I went to Boat Harbour Primary School. It is in the most magnificent setting, I reckon, anywhere in the world. It received $2.1 million. On 25 July Home and Community Care services received $564,000 to carry on their good work. And on 27 July, Anvers, the home of chocolate, was awarded a TQUAL grant of $100,000. On 2 August, I attended the opening at Stella Maris Primary School in Burnie for their extensions, for which they received $2.7 million. On 11 August, I went to Sacred Heart Primary School which had received $1.875 million for an award winning extension to their primary school.Again, only recently, I was at the North West Regional Hospital, for the opening of patient accommodation, for which funding of $3 million had been granted, to help those people from outlying areas who need to come for services to the North West Regional Hospital. This will take a lot of the burden and pressure off patients and their families because they will not have to worry about accommodation. Most recently, I went to the magnificent Circular Head, in the far north-west of my region, where Greenhams have Cape Grim premium beef products, to Smithton Primary School, which had had a grant of $2.65 million. To see how the BER in particular has been extended in Tasmania is nothing short of fantastic, and every school I have been to regards this as one of the finest investments that this Commonwealth could have in education and infrastructure.","Braddon Electorate: New Funding","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SIDEBOTTOM (Braddon) ","(09:40):"
358,0,0,0,1,2,"Jones, Ewen, MP",96430,"Herbert","LP","N/A",8434," Last night in the adjournment debate I spoke about the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the need for everyone to take it seriously. Today I would like to talk about some important things that Townsville people are doing. In Townsville we have a man by the name of Garth Brimelow, who was seriously injured in a workplace accident—he fell off the roof of a house—and lost the use of his legs. He has been wheelchair-bound since then. He is a husband. He is a father. He has one of the worlds longest white beards. Those people walking into the gates at the Cowboys games will see him sitting there selling the doubles, and being generally a pain in the backside to everyone who goes past!He wants to raise awareness of the National Disability Insurance Scheme by rolling around Australia. To do that, he needs to get a special wheelchair. It is called a Trekinetic. It costs $6½ thousand. He came to me the other day to speak about it at a clinic we had on Saturday morning. Without wanting to belittle Garth, every time you see him, he talks about disability. Every time he sees me, he says, How is that support for the National Disability Insurance Scheme going? He will not let up. So when the opportunity to raise $6½ thousand came along, and for him to be out of the city of Townsville for at least two months, I jumped at it! Garth is a tremendous bloke but, by jingo, when he gets hold of something, he just will not let it go. I am only hoping that Scott Stidson and a couple of the other boys will go along with him as support, and I am prepared to raise extra money to ensure that happens. The Trekinetic wheelchair will allow him to cross terrain of all sorts. He intends to roll completely around Australia to raise support for the National Disability Insurance Scheme.I say again that the problem I have with disabilities is that too often we target those people who are born with a disability; we are all just one bad accident away from needing care for the rest of our lives. Those who are lucky enough for it to happen in a workplace accident will get some sort of cover from WorkCover. Those people who are unlucky enough for it to happen on their own time in a car accident, just going home from the football, are left in limbo.That is what Garth wants to do. He has moved on with his life. He is a valuable member of the community. He is really pushing forward with this, and he wants it all to happen. I would just like to finish up by saying to the people of Townsville that when I call on them I will be asking them for their support and I will be asking them to join me in waving goodbye to Garth out of Townsville for at least two months—and we hope that, if we can deflate the tyres, it might take him a little bit longer than that. He is a tremendous bloke and this is a tremendous initiative and a very, very worthy cause.

360,0,0,0,1,2,"Crook, Tony, MP","M3K","OConnor","NatsWA","N/A",8435," Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I echo those comments. I rise today to highlight to the House how my state of Western Australia is being unfairly penalised for its disproportionate contribution to our national economy through GST. As Western Australia has grown and prospered, it has proudly contributed more and more to our federal economy. However, Western Australia has received less and less of the GST pool in return. In the last financial year, Western Australia received just 68 per cent of what it would have received if GST revenue were distributed across Australia on an equal per capita basis. This is the lowest level of relativity applied to any state or territory since the GST was introduced some 12 years ago. In contrast, every other state and territory received not less than 91 per cent of what it would have received if the GST revenue were distributed evenly across Australia. The future outlook for Western Australias GST revenue share is even more dire. Western Australian Department of Treasury and Finance modelling indicates that by 2014-15 WA will receive just one-third of the GST it would be receiving if GST were distributed on a per capita basis. This would result in WA receiving $4 billion less than its equal per capita share.While I am prepared to see Western Australia continue to contribute to the GST distribution to other states and territories, there has to be some limit to this rip-off. As such, I have tabled a motion in this parliament that proposes the introduction of a reasonable 75 per cent floor in GST relativities. A 75 per cent floor would preserve the principles of horizontal fiscal equalisation and would preserve the formula used by the Commonwealth Grants Commission without unfairly penalising any state for its disproportionate contribution to our national economic prosperity. This GST is forecast to add $1.8 billion to WAs GST grant in 2013-14 and an estimated $2.5 billion the following year. To put this in perspective, the savings in 2014-15 alone would be enough to fund our states biggest public country hospital development, the Albany Health Campus, 14 times over.As an elected representative of the people of OConnor, it is my duty to stand up for the rights of my constituents, and I intend to do this by spearheading the move to reverse the GST rip-off for Western Australia. The leader of the WA Nationals, the Hon. Brendon Grylls MLA, and the WA Premier, the Hon. Colin Barnett MLA, have already indicated their support for establishing a floor on the GST relativities. The opposition leader in Western Australia, the Hon. Eric Ripper MLA, also expressed his concerns relating to the GST distribution. I call on all Western Australian members of this place to properly represent their constituents and their state by supporting the reform to the GST distribution.","Goods and Services Tax","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CROOK (OConnor) ","(09:46):"

This is set to have its greatest effect in Victoria in just a small number of weeks. Victoria is a state where 9,000 families rely on this vital short-term care option at 220 occasional care centres across the state. Let me say from the outset that, unlike Labor, the federal coalition accepts the role of the federal government in funding affordable, reliable and accessible child care for Australian families, and this includes occasional care. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for reaffirming our commitment to restore the $12 million that Labor has wiped from this service when we are returned to government. Compare that assurance from someone that understands occasional care providing a vital role for real Australian families to this from the federal Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare. When called on to review her governments decision, Minister Ellis trots out the same old lines: The Australian government is ceasing funding for neighbourhood model occasional care in Victoria of $1.1 million. But in its place, in Victoria, we are investing an extra $116 million each and every year in increased childcare rebate. No, Minister Ellis, come back down to the real world, because that is where you are not. You are taking a childcare option away from thousands of parents, who neither need nor can afford full-time childcare, to receive your so-called generous rebate—a rebate parents cannot even receive for occasional care anyway.The concern in Victoria is so great that a protest rally is being staged by parents and service providers in Melbourne tomorrow. This is the second protest rally in a month. The minister should note that many of the people coming to the rally tomorrow will be from regional and remote communities where occasional care is often the only centre based care in town. Just as I can assure you that the federal coalition is committed to restoring occasional care funding when we are re-elected, so, too, is Victorias Liberal government, which has committed to continue its 30 per cent share of funding when this occurs. Hundreds more people will put their name to the petition tomorrow, on top of the thousands who already have, in the hope that this short-sighted, penny-pinching exercise from the Gillard government will be reversed.I look forward to bringing the petition before the House at a later date. Of course I would also welcome the minister reversing her decision prior to this to ease the desperate concern of thousands of mums and dads that she pretends to represent. We should save take-a-break funding for occasional care in Victoria.

362,0,0,0,1,2,"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",30540,"Canberra","ALP","N/A",8437," It is once again my privilege to rise today to speak about some more legends in the Canberra community. Today I wish to speak about a group of people in my community who call themselves the Jennings Germans, a group of tradesmen who this year will be celebrating 60 years of being in Australia.I was contacted recently by Patricia Kloos to tell me the interesting story of this group. Patricias husband, Karl, was one of 150 German tradesmen recruited between November 1951 and March 1952 by the construction company AV Jennings. They came here to build 1,800 houses in Canberra over a two-year period. This was not a migration program but a temporary employment contract to bring out much needed skills in a time of great growth for this country and indeed for this city. Many of these people returned to Germany, but some hundred migrated permanently at the invitation of the Australian government, with some 75 deciding to settle in Canberra, the community they had just helped to build. They came to a country that I think is fair to say was very isolated. They came from a country that just a few years beforehand had been at war with us, and many did not speak the language. It was a brave choice, but I am glad they made it.In Karls book on his migration story—and I was fortunate recently to be given a copy of that—he tells of the isolation he felt at coming to the new country. He talks about the immense heat, which was very different from his experience in his native Germany, and the difference in the size of the flies and, of course, the inevitable language problems. But he also settled in well. As he says:The town somehow began to look more pleasant and the landscape more inviting. In the hostel our rooms were spartan. I spent my early wages on material for curtains for my room, two table cloths, and erected a shelf for my books.Karl also talks about how he bought a radio for the princely sum of £47, which he notes was a lot of money, but it was company. Another of Karls stories I found particularly touching was his desire to continue and connect with his Catholic faith in this country. He found great unity with the Catholic community, and it made his move here a lot easier. He talks about how, in finding a local church, he needed to find an English prayer book because the only one he had was in German. He, along with a friend, spent quality time with the shopkeepers of Canberra and a German-English phrasebook before finding one at a local chemists.I wish to pay tribute to Karl Kloos and his colleagues from the Jennings Germans. They are people who literally built this city. We can still see them around Canberra today. Their children and grandchildren are still very, very active in the Canberra community. Some of them are friends of ours. Some of them are very active in the Catholic community. They are a great tribute. I thank Patricia for bringing this amazing group to my attention, and I would like to congratulate them on 60 years in the country and wish them well for their celebrations.

363,0,0,0,1,2,"Andrews, Karen, MP",230886,"McPherson","LP","N/A",8438," I rise to speak about the development of a geriatric evaluation and management unit, a GEM unit, on the southern Gold Coast, which will assist patients who require specialised care; in particular, those who are diagnosed with dementia. The proposed facility will be built at the John Flynn Private Hospital, which is a 323-bed private hospital located in the McPherson electorate in Tugun, on the southern Gold Coast. Because of its location close to the border, it attracts around 50 per cent of its patients from New South Wales, with the remainder coming from the southern Gold Coast.The hospital provides a broad range of medical and surgical services and excels in its cardiac services. The hospital currently has two cardiac catheter laboratories in addition to nine main theatres, two day-theatre procedure rooms and an emergency care centre. The surgical profile provides for all surgical disciplines except neurosurgery and includes oncology, haematology, renal dialysis and rehabilitation.I recently visited the rehabilitation unit, which is in the same building that will house the GEM unit. This building, Fred McKay House, is adjacent to and connected to the main hospital via a covered walkway on the first floor. This building was initially planned to be a hotel for patients and their families who may be travelling distances either from within the state or within Australia or even from overseas. However, it has been converted into a series of specialist suites and a rehabilitation ward. The rehabilitation ward caters for the elderly, in particular offering them assistance to return to home life and everyday activity. It has a range of exercise equipment to build strength as well as a fully operational kitchen that patients are encouraged to use as part of their rehabilitation in readiness to return home.A GEM unit will provide specialised care designed to assist with the management of elderly patients, particularly those with dementia, as I indicated earlier. It will provide them with a dedicated environment for their care rather than trying to care for their specialised needs in the context of a general surgical or medical ward. I am very supportive of the concept of the GEM unit, as I am concerned about the increase in our elderly patients diagnosed with dementia and Alzheimers and also those struggling with the very different set of issues associated with early onset dementia.In conclusion I would like to thank and congratulate the John Flynn Private Hospital for developing their specialised care to meet our growing ageing population. The GEM unit will be a welcome addition to the community, along with the completion of the new ophthalmology service that has also been developed as part of the hospital recognising the need to ensure our ageing population has access to the best quality of life.

I particularly want to record the condolences of Mathew Jose and Rick Youssef, who have both contributed to the remarks I want to make today. Karen really was a remarkable person and was, I think, very much larger than life. She lived her life throughout very much helping others. She came from a fairly tough background and brought all of those experiences into her civic life. Ballarat is very, very much a richer place for her decision to participate in civic life. She certainly knew political success, which we were very pleased about. She spent 16 years in local government in the borough of Sebastopol, including as mayor, and the city of Ballarat. The people of Sebastopol returned her to local government at every opportunity—she was very much a champion of that community. She also spent 11 years in state government as the member for Ballarat West. She was elected and re-elected at three elections and served for the duration of the Bracks and Brumby Labor government, but unfortunately had to retire due to her ill health. She spent a great deal of time listening to local residents and working with them to ensure that Ballarat was a better place to live, raise a family and work.She also knew political failure. She failed in her first attempt in state politics and experienced the abolition of the borough of Sebastopol, something she was very opposed to, at the hands of the Kennett government. She played a central role in the party in Ballarat during the wilderness years from 1992 to 1999, before taking the seat from the Liberal Party and building a healthy electorate majority. She did not seek election just for the sake of it; she took all her responsibilities to the community very seriously. She will be remembered very much by me for some of the achievements that never made it into the newspapers: her quiet dignity in looking after people and standing up for people in the community who were often very disenfranchised.We did not always agree. Karen was a fierce arguer, and there were times when we would have fierce disputes over issues. My own political upbringing is all the better for that, for having those arguments with her and learning my craft from her. She certainly delivered on basic services that mattered. She was very fierce, not having had the educational opportunities herself, in making sure that working-class people in her district did have them. Ballarat is very much a better place for having had Karen as our member and for having had her engaged in civic life. I certainly will celebrate her life at her funeral on Friday.

While this comment from Justice French was not binding, and he did not express a view at the time as to his opinion on the outcome, it certainly highlights the possibility that, at some point in the future, the ACCC or a court could take this definition. In doing so, it would be very difficult to show that any one merger or acquisition had limited sustainability competition. This could potentially have a number of grave consequences, particularly in relation to creeping acquisitions.Creeping acquisitions are those acquisitions which in and of themselves do not lessen competition but, taken as a collective, may have a greater effect over time. One area in particular that has been noted is grocery prices. Indeed, this bill is a direct result of the ACCCs inquiry into grocery prices and the governments subsequent public consultation on the matter. In the ACCCs report it stated that it considered that:… the supermarket industry, because of the particular structural features of the market, is one where creeping acquisitions are a potential area of concern.Further, I imagine that most Australians buy their groceries from local supermarkets, in most cases only a few kilometres from their home. Given that, the issues raised by Justice French in his comments over the definition of the market are problematic to say the least. It is important to note that, while these issues have not impacted on grocery prices, this is not an excuse for inaction.We have identified two areas where action is needed and the imperative now is to take adequate action to address these concerns. In doing so, the government is responding with specific remedies to specific problems, rather than with general remedies that could well have unforeseen and detrimental consequences on competition and on the economy as a whole. The government action today is one of the measures I highlighted earlier. It is a measured and appropriate response to the long-term interests of competition, economic growth and the country. In this light, I commend the bill to the House.","Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) ","(11:02):"
367,0,0,0,1,2,"Kelly, Craig, MP",99931,"Hughes","LP","N/A",8440," I rise to speak on the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. There are four main parts to this bill. Chapter 1 deals with mergers and acquisitions, chapter 2 deals with unconscionable conduct, chapter 3 is merely a few minor technical amendments and chapter 4 deals with what is known as creeping acquisitions. In the time permitted I would like to discuss each part separately. However, firstly, sadly, in totality this bill is nothing other than window-dressing—a meaningless nothing. It demonstrates that Labor, after all the sound bites when in opposition, have given up on competition policy. They have simply hoisted the white flag.Competition policy is arguably one of the most crucial portfolios for any government. But, sadly, after the failed tenures of the current Minister for Trade and the current Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, when the single highlight was the farce of GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch, this Labor-Greens government has, appallingly, downgraded the competition portfolio to that of a parliamentary secretary. So it is of little surprise that we end up with a bill like this.The first chapter of the bill is on the subject of mergers and acquisitions. Our current merger law provides:A corporation shall not acquire, directly or indirectly, any shares in the capital, or any assets, of a body corporate where the acquisition is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market for goods or services.Let us be clear: when two firms merge, what happens is that firms that have previously been in competition with each other get together to coordinate and fix prices and divide markets. What mergers actually do is take conduct that we find so detrimental to competition and consumers—and our laws make such conduct illegal, with penalties including jail—and make that same conduct legal. The first change proposed by this bill in affecting mergers is purely academic. It changes the words substantially lessening competition in a market for goods or services to the words substantially lessening competition in any market for goods or services. It simply replaces the words a market for the words any market—a change that creates the impression of doing something without doing anything.The second change is to remove the word substantial as it applies to restrict the application for section 50 to substantial markets. The problem with this bill is that it takes out the wrong substantial. The substantial that should be deleted from the act is in respect of the word substantial as it relates to substantially lessening of competition. Under our current laws we have the absurdity that a merger that results in a mere lessening of competition to the detriment of consumers and to the detriment of our national interest is acceptable provided that such lessening of competition is not deemed as substantial. We are productivity-growth stalled, with problems throughout our economy and hyper-concentration in many of our markets. How can we permit any further concentration occurring through mergers that result in further lessening of competition? If we have the proviso, we can only prevent it if that lessening of competition is substantial.Considering why this bill proposes to take out the wrong substantial it is important to consider the historical context of the current wording of the bill. The text of Australias merger laws were inherited from Americas antitrust laws—the Clayton act of 1914, a law written almost a century ago. Americas Clayton act makes various anticompetitive practices illegal when they might substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce. The problem with the word substantial is that it is capable of meaning many different things and is open to wide interpretation. By way of example, is 25 per cent a substantial proportion? Twenty-five per cent of our nations exports are sold to China, and I am sure everyone would agree with the statement that a substantial proportion of Australias exports are sold to China. In that context, 25 per cent is a substantial number. Yet, at the last New South Wales state election, the flyblown New South Wales Labor government achieved a primary vote of 25.5 per cent. So the statement: A substantial number of electors voted for the New South Wales Labor Party at the last New South Wales state election is a complete absurdity. In that context, 25 per cent is not a substantial number.Further, for the majority of the last century during Americas golden years Americas antitrust laws were interpreted as meaning that competition was a process that required numerous participants and a deconcentration of market power and that any lessening of competition was equated with a decrease in the number of participants. However, in the 1970s and 1980s the long-held view that increased concentration means less competition was challenged by a group known as the Chicago school. If you want to mark the time when America started its decline you can circle the time when a small minority who theorised that a lessening of competition is not equated with a decrease in the number of participants in a market took control of the economic leaders of American policy.One of the greatest supporters of the theories of the Chicago school was Alan Greenspan. But, in 2008, following the collapse of the US economy, Greenspan gave the mea culpa when he said of this theory:I have found a flaw … I don’t know how significant or permanent it is. But I’ve been very distressed by that fact.Pressed to clarify his words, Greenspan was asked, In other words, you have found that your view of the world—your ideology—was not right; it was not working. Absolutely, precisely, Greenspan replied.If anyone wants an example of how these misguided theories of market concentration mean less competition and higher prices for consumers, they only need to study what has happened in the Australian supermarket sector. Over the last 30 years we have seen an ever-increasing concentration in the Australian supermarket sector, where the market share of our two largest retailers has increased from around 30 per cent of the market to where it stands today at around 80 per cent, leaving Australia with one of the most concentrated markets in world economic history outside that of former Eastern Bloc countries.The so-called experts have theorised that this period of ever-increasing market concentration would lead to efficiencies and greater synergies to the benefit of consumers. But if you look at the empirical evidence and not the computer generated models you will see the exact opposite has happened. The evidence, as clearly demonstrated by OECD figures, shows that during this period of increasing market concentration Australia consumers have been punished with the fastest accelerating supermarket prices in the developed world. Therefore, what we need to look at is removing the other substantial in our merger laws and returning our laws to the original intent that a merger that results in a lessening of competition should not be permitted.The second part of this bill deals with unconscionable conduct. Before addressing the provisions of the bill, it is worth noting why we need a statutory prohibition on unconscionable conduct rather than just relying on the common law. The history of our common law traces back to the legal principles that we inherited from decisions reaching back to the aftermath of the Norman invasion of the British Isles. Our common law developed in the age of the village market where both parties to a contract were of approximately equal power and were members of a keenly competitive society. They therefore were able to negotiate freely the terms of their contracts and, importantly, had equal access to the law. However, with todays growth of oligopolies and duopolies, with the special privileges handed out to many of our large corporations today to protect themselves from competition and with small business denied equal access to the courts due to the outrageous cost of litigation today, the conditions of a level playing field that existed when our common laws on unconscionable conduct were developed are simply not present today—especially in contractual relations between big and small business in todays economy. Therefore, to level the playing field it has been necessary to advance the existing common law on unconscionable conduct by having specific statutory provisions.Sadly, the proposed amendments to this bill give the impression of doing something without doing anything. The insertion of a statement of interpretive principles into the unconscionable conduct provisions of Australian consumer law simply add nothing. They merely regurgitate what the courts have already stated. Let us look at these changes. The first provides that:It is the intention of the Parliament that:(a) this section is not limited by the unwritten law relating to unconscionable conduct …This simply adds nothing. The courts have already made it very clear that existing statutory provisions are not limited by the unwritten law relating to unconscionable conduct. The problem which is not addressed by this bill is that without a statutory interpretation the courts have given a very narrow interpretation of what unconscionable conduct is. In doing so, they have hardly moved the law beyond the existing common law interpretation. The first part adds nothing; it simply regurgitates what the courts have already stated.The other changes in this bill are, again, meaningless and add nothing. The existing statutory provisions under section 22 of the Australian Consumer Law state:(1) A person must not, in trade or commerce, in connection with:(a) the supply or possible supply of financial services to a person … engage in conduct that is, in all the circumstances, unconscionable.The existing section continues:(1) Without limiting the matters to which the court may have regard for the purpose of determining whether a person (the supplier) has contravened section 21 in connection with the supply or possible supply of goods or services to a person (the customer), the court may have regard to …The section then goes on to list a long list of non-exhaustive factors which the court may have regard to. So our courts are already able to look at all the circumstances and the proposed amendments, again, are simply meaningless.There is an alternative way to address the inadequacies of our statutory provisions on unconscionable conduct. Firstly, to move the law on from the narrow provisions of interpretation given by the courts we need a statutory definition of unconscionable conduct in the act. We need to look at the reasonableness of the conduct and whether it is harsh or oppressive.Secondly, we need the existing provisions of the unfair contract terms in the Australian Consumer Law extended to small business. If you want an example of the anti-small business agenda of this current Labor government you need look no further than their shameful removal of small business from the unfair contract provisions of the Australian Consumer Law done by the current Minister for Trade during his term as Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy. Initially Labor proposed that the unfair contract terms legislation would apply to small business in their dealings with big business, and that they should have been congratulated on. But, instead, cuddling up to their mates at the big end of town, this government have shamefully sold small business down the river by excluding them from the unfair contract provisions. It is an absolute disgrace which every small business person in this country should never ever forget.The third part of this bill merely makes a few minor technical amendments which are of no significance. The fourth part of the bill involves so-called creeping acquisitions. The theory behind the need for this legislation is that in a series of small acquisitions each individual acquisition when looked at separately may not result in a substantial lessening of competition. But when these single acquisitions are looked at together as a group they may lead to a substantial lessening of competition. This law would be an illusion. It would not have any effect. Just look at the Westpac takeover of St George Bank. St George has over 400 branches. If the ACCC considered that Westpac taking over more than 400 St George Bank branches in one single hit did not substantially reduce competition, how would changing the law to enable Westpac taking over a few at a time through creeping acquisitions make any difference? Again, this is a meaningless nothing.In conclusion, this bill is a meaningless nothing. It creates the appearance of making changes. It creates the appearance of doing something to address problems with our nations competition laws while doing absolutely nothing. We have real problems with competition policy in this country. Our productivity growth has stalled. Many of our markets have degenerated into states of hyperconcentration. Consumers are being punished by higher rates of inflation. We need a lot more than what this bill offers.","Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) ","(10:04):"
368,0,0,0,1,2,"Leigh, Andrew, MP","BU8","Fraser","ALP","N/A",8444," The philosophy of those of us on this side of the House is that free markets are the mechanism best developed to generate wealth in society, to raise living standards and to ensure that Australians have the opportunity of work and leisure that is part of a fulfilling life. We on this side of the House recognise that free markets work best when accompanied by appropriate regulation—such as the Trade Practicesw Act 1974 originally brought in under the Whitlam government in 1975. Appropriate regulation such as the Fair Work Act 2009, brought in under this government; legislation that realises that it is critical to strike the right balance between employers and employees. This is a balance which those opposite apparently supported in the last election but which, by now taking the lead from the member for Bennelong, they have begun to abandon, with a new attack on penalty rates and an attack on the overall notion that free markets work best under proper regulation.The bill before the House today, the Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2011, began its life as a bill under the now Minister for Trade, Dr Emerson. It was a product of extensive consultations. The bill does three things: it provides greater clarity to the provisions of the CCA regarding mergers and acquisitions; it streamlines and clarifies the unconscionable conduct provisions; and it corrects some minor drafting errors.Public consultations, conducted in 2008 and 2009 by the member for Rankin, identified the importance of getting the term market appropriately defined. This bill will replace references to a market with references to any market. That will clarify that a court or the ACCC can consider the competitive effect of a merger or acquisition on multiple markets in any one investigation. This amending legislation will ensure that a court or the ACCC looks beyond the primary market in which the merger or acquisition would occur.The second area is in relation to the definition of market in section 50(6) of the CCA. The bill will delete the word substantial in the definition of market. That will clarify that the competitive effects of a merger or an acquisition on a local market can be considered under section 50. That will ensure that a court or the ACCC can examine a merger or acquisition in any market, regardless of its size or its geography.The bill also makes changes in relation to the unconscionable conduct provisions, which will streamline and clarify the operation of the provisions. It will unify the consumer and business related provisions of the ACL and the ASIC Act, replacing sections 21 and 22 of the ACL with a single provision that will apply to both consumers and businesses. The bill will amend the mirrored provisions in sections 12CB and 12CC of the ASIC Act, which will reflect these changes to the Australian consumer law.The bill will clarify the unconscionable conduct provisions by inserting interpretive principles into the acts that will assist courts in applying the prohibition, as well as improving stakeholder understanding of the meaning and scope of the prohibition. There have been substantial improvements in legislative drafting over recent decades, partly to ensure that courts have as much information as possible to help them interpret statute laws. These interpretive principles are derived from existing case law, so they will be clarifying rather than altering the effect of the statutory prohibition against unconscionable conduct. Those principles will include, for example, that unconscionable conduct is not limited by unwritten law; that the prohibition applies to systems of conduct or patterns of behaviour; and that a court can examine the terms and progress of contract in considering whether conduct to which the contract relates is unconscionable.Finally, as I have mentioned, the bill corrects a number of minor drafting errors in the CCA that were the result of the passage of legislation by this House in 2010. Overall, the measures in the bill will improve the operation of Australias competition and consumer laws. They will clarify the breadth of matters to be examined by a court or the ACCC in considering whether a proposed merger or acquisition would substantially lessen competition in the market. They will unify the prohibition against unconscionable conduct and provide the courts with greater guidance in its application. Overall, this is legislation which is part of Labors commitment to free and effective markets, but markets which are appropriately regulated.I was very proud recently to speak to students in Marist College. Mary-Lou Minty, their economics teacher, brought me in and we had a wide-ranging conversation with the boys about the major principles involved in economic reform. They understood—perhaps even better than some of those opposite—the importance of getting the balance right with regulation. Letting the market rip can often produce outcomes which give less growth, less improvement in living standards and less productivity. Getting the balance right in competition law, as in industrial relations, is critical to improving the living standards of all Australians. I commend the bill to the House.","Competition and Consumer Legislation Amendment Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr LEIGH (Fraser) ","(10:19):"

Firstly, the bill will enact laws to deal with creeping acquisitions, by amending the mergers and acquisitions provisions in section 50 of the Competition and Consumer Act. This bill will remove the requirement that a market in which the competition effects of a merger are assessed must be a substantial market. The amendments will also ensure that the courts and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission can consider the totality of the competitive effects resulting from an acquisition, including those where creeping acquisition concerns may be raised in the community.Secondly, the bill enhances and simplifies the unconscionable conduct provisions of the Australian Consumer Law and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act. The bill will assist consumers, businesses, regulators and the courts by inserting interpretive principles to clarify the meaning of unconscionable conduct in those laws and by unifying their business and consumer related provisions. These amendments clarify the parliaments intention as to how the unconscionable conduct law should apply. They will place the ACCC and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission in a better position to take more effective enforcement action.Finally, the bill makes minor technical amendments to correct a small number of drafting errors in the Trade Practices Amendment (Australian Consumer Law) Act (No. 2) 2010.

It was an excellent group of colleagues from right across the political spectrum, who were intimately involved with the basin because it affects their communities. It was a very constructive and positive exercise, and there was a contribution from everyone. To have arrived at a consensus on what is nothing short of a very contentious environment for this report speaks volumes for the character and quality of the people on the committee. I am very honoured and privileged to have served with them. The chair, Tony Windsor, did a fantastic job; I was very pleased to be his deputy chair.The report of which we are taking consideration, Of drought and flooding rains—an excellent title if I say so myself—is the result of the committees inquiry into the impact of the guide to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan—I will come to it in a moment. What is really worth reiterating for the record is the importance of the Murray-Darling Basin to Australia. That will point towards why people were and are significantly affected by the earlier draft plan and why they reacted as they did in many ways. This reaction to the basin plan has contributed to lessons that have been learnt on the absolute importance of the intermix between communities, the product of those communities and the environment. It has contributed to the appreciation that one without the others has very serious consequences for this nation, not just for the happiness and wellbeing of communities, but also, very importantly, for the gross domestic product of this nation. For example, the gross value of agricultural production as determined between 2008 and 2009 was $42 billion, or two per cent of GDP—32 per cent of this contributed $14.6 billion to the basin economy itself. The gross regional product of the basin was approximately $59 billion, or about eight per cent of Australias GDP.The basin itself is home to some 2.1 million people, and a further 1.3 million people depend on its water supply. That is a significant proportion of Australias population and, most significantly, of the productive capacity of the region in terms of its primary industry—of its growing, processing and further value adding. For instance, 90 per cent of Australias cotton is grown in the area, 56 per cent of its grapes, 42 per cent of its nuts, and 32 per cent of the nations dairy produce. The vast majority of the land use in the basin—84 per cent—is dedicated to agriculture yet the majority of the population live in urban centres. The basin covers something like one million square kilometres of south-east Australia and contains 23 river valleys. That gives you some idea of the extent of the geography, the importance of the economic impact and the significance of the social impact in the context of the inquiry. I have to say that the inquirys essential terms of reference were to look at the triple bottom line in terms of the draft plan—that is, the environment, the society and its communities, and the economic impact.Our travels were vast. I have to acknowledge the member for Riverina; I think he attended every meeting in every river valley. He did a fantastic job and it speaks volumes for his dedication and willingness to arrive at some form of solution. I congratulate him, as I congratulate you, Deputy Speaker Livermore, for the extensive contribution that you made.We saw very disturbing pictures on the television of people burning books; I hate seeing the burning of books. It conjures up terrible things. But that expressed an absolute anger in communities who felt that they were not listened to. I do not need to tell you, colleagues, that one of the major criticisms that is directed at us—sometimes pretty unfairly—and at bureaucracies and agencies is that we go about processes and do not really listen actively and try to take on board what people are saying. Although what they are saying might not fit the current economic modelling and whatever, we need to listen to people who have an extensive anchorage in the community and who know about the issues that they are dealing withWherever we went in the basin we found that people wanted a basin plan. They wanted it to work. They wanted it to be comprehensive. They wanted certainty, both for their communities and for their environment. So, for instance, we had Matt Linnegar of the National Farmers Federation expressing a view—it is on page 441 of our report—Do we need a basin plan as such? …Yes, we do, but not the one that was delivered in the guide. I think that that was a common message that came from the communities where we went.This inquiry did listen. Not everything in this report meets the absolute wishes of my government nor, indeed, I reckon, the wishes of some of the policy makers on the other side. But we did listen, and our recommendations were crafted on what we heard by listening—not just to people who may have disregarded the guide or did not want to know about it but to people who were intimately involved in their communities, knew their areas and knew the relationship between the river, their communities and what they produced there. This inquiry listened to those people and crafted the recommendations in the report based on what we regarded as the commonsense logic and rationale of the comments that were made to us. I do not think I am being unfair in summing it up as such.It is great to have here the member for Makin, who was another significant contributor to this committee, particularly with his insights into South Australia. So I thank him very much for his commentary.The report manifests what we heard and gives recommendations based on that. I know that we are going to have controversy over some of our recommendations in regard to governance but what we are really trying to achieve with our recommendations about governance is the ability to significantly monitor the data that is available so that it can be used in a way that it is relevant—it is not lost in bureaucracy and people can make decisions based on firm and confirmed data. One of the other major recommendations of this report is a re-engagement of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority with its stakeholders, and that includes not just the communities but also the state governments involved. One of the major criticisms received from the state governments was that in actual fact their contribution and their data were either interpreted in strange ways which they were not able to get an intelligible response to or ignored.I am pleased to say that this report has received a positive response both from the communities we visited and also our own government. But also, and importantly, the Murray-Darling Authority itself has gone through a major restructuring, particularly under its chair, Craig Knowles. I note both with pleasure and interest that the authority, although it has extended its report—and I know that creates angst amongst communities, because they are still not sure of the certainty that they require—has had a much more consultative process and that the stakeholders themselves, particularly state governments, are having much more of an input in this. I congratulate everyone involved on the committee. I congratulate the authority for now taking on board many of the things recommended here and certainly the sentiment of this report. Thank you.","Regional Australia Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SIDEBOTTOM (Braddon) ","(10:45):"
373,0,0,0,1,2,"McCormack, Michael, MP",219646,"Riverina","Nats","N/A",8448," The comprehensive bipartisan report Of drought and flooding rains: inquiry into the impact of the Guide to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was welcomed, understandably so, by all those who want Australian farmers to continue to grow the food to feed, and fibre to clothe, our nation and its people. The key word in my opening sentence was bipartisan. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia comprises eight members of parliament; four supplementary members were added for the purposes of this inquiry. The inquiry committee comprised six Labor MPs, four Liberals, the Independent member for New England as chair and me, a National.Given that the 253-page report was unanimously agreed to by committee members, it is now crucial, essential and obligatory that the federal government adopt the 21 recommendations contained therein. Anything less would be an insult to the bipartisan outcome of eight months of hard work by committee members, who drove and flew many thousands of kilometres, up hill and down dale, through four states to listen to people who shared their views on how to achieve healthy rivers while at the same time preserving regional communities. The people have spoken. People from all walks of life—irrigation farmers, business people, mayors, environmentalists, scientists, clergy—you name a profession and we heard from someone in that occupation. We heard heartfelt words from a brave little girl and we heard from those in the twilight of their lives—those who have seen more than the average numbers of droughts and flooding rains. We listened, and Hansard dutifully recorded, what they all had to say. The committees dedicated secretariat then drilled down into all the detail provided and, with considerable input from members, came up with a draft document which was then, meeting after meeting, line by line, finetuned into this report. It was not easy to reach consensus. It took hours of robust debate, argument and sometimes nitpicking to reach agreement. But at the end it was agreed to. It was accepted by all committee members. Bipartisanship was achieved.I mentioned earlier that the committee had a multiparty membership. Members came from electorates representing the eastern mainland states, with four from New South Wales, four from Victoria, one from Queensland; and the deputy chair hails from Tasmania. Significantly, the committee also included two MPs from South Australia—appropriately, one from each side of the political divide. Therefore, communities from the top of the basin to the Murray mouth were represented. Therefore, the views of all concerned were invited, listened to, heeded and reported. Therefore, the government now has a duty to accept the peoples verdict, the regional Australia committees findings and implement the recommendations. The government needs to do this forthwith—no deliberating, no delay, no stalling. Do it now. Put in place the 21 recommendations. This is too important to put off.Chief among the recommendations is the immediate halt to the governments non-strategic, haphazard buybacks and the necessity to take a more targeted approach to water buybacks which prioritises the lowest possible impact. This government has generated so much uncertainty by continuing to buy water from desperate sellers rather than willing sellers.Another important recommendation focuses on greater investment in on- and off-farm water savings projects. There was $5.8 billion set aside by the former coalition government in the 2007 Water Act for infrastructure projects, but up until now only $68 million of this has been spent which has actually delivered water—21 gigalitres—into the basin, whereas federal Labor has disgracefully and unjustly spent $1.5 billion on water buybacks. The Prime Minister talks of a patchwork economy. Non-strategic water buybacks lead to a patchwork irrigation community—the dreaded so-called Swiss cheese effect.It is a true test of this government, which simply has to follow the advice so carefully and diligently constructed for it by a committee headed by an MP whose vote is integral to Labor retaining power. If federal Labor ignores the recommendations of the committee headed by the Independent member for New England then how could he possibly continue to support this minority government? He keeps the Prime Minister in the Lodge. She now needs to provide regional communities within the Murray-Darling Basin with certainty by agreeing to what is being called the Windsor report. If the Prime Minister fails to do so, she will be failing regional Australia. She will be failing everyone who testified at the 12 regional hearings. She will be failing all those who contributed the 643 submissions and 85 supplementary submissions, and she will be failing the man who shored up her tenuous and illegitimate hold on the top job after the hung parliament last year. I hope the Prime Minister realises this. The consequences of doing nothing will be dire. They will be dire for people in the Murray-Darling Basin and they ought to be dire for the Prime Minister if she lets down the member for New England, whose reputation is at stake with what happens to this report.I commend the committee members for the effort and knowledge they contributed to bring about this report. It was not an easy task. I especially compliment the member for New England for his professionalism in leading the committee, particularly since he came into the role at a heated and difficult time.Had it not been for the passion and pride shown by those who live and work in the Coleambally and Murrumbidgee irrigation areas in my electorate, the water debate would certainly, I have no doubt, have headed in a different direction. More than 7,000 locals turned up at the 14 October Murray-Darling Basin Authority public rally at Griffiths Yoogali Club. They shouted, they protested and they burned copies of the guide. They were angry, frustrated and demanded answers. They had every reason to feel the way they did. There had been no consultation by the government or the MDBA prior to the 8 October release of the original guide—a flawed document if ever there was one. Riverina people told the MDBA, then headed by Mike Taylor, who ran the meeting, that they were not going to sit back and watch an independent authority, the government or anyone else destroy their communities with an ill-conceived guide which returned too much water to the environment without proper scientific validation or justification. They were not going to let it happen then and they will not let it happen in the future either, let me assure you. If the government lets the opportunity of the Windsor report slip from its grasp, if the MDBAs again delayed draft does not measure up to what its new chairman, Craig Knowles, has promised and if this government legislates a final plan which in any way compromises Australias ability to feed itself then the protest rally which will result at this place will make the Griffith MDBA rally look like a parish picnic in the park.Be warned: people in regional Australia are fed up with being told what to do and how to live their lives by a Labor government beholden to the unrepresentative swill that is the Greens. The Greens stood for 150 lower house seats at the 21 August election and won just one. That does not give them a mandate to dictate to this parliament what should and should not happen in any water reform. The Greens hold nine out of 76 Senate seats. They do not, as their leader, Bob Brown, would like to have us all think, have control of this country. The coalition is often accused by those on the other side of trying to wreck everything. If ever a party had an agenda to do that, it is the Greens.The first and most important job this nation has is to feed its people. You cannot do that by taking away the ability, requirement and right of farmers to grow food. You cannot do that by sending all the water down the river in volumes as demanded by the Greens and their loopy environmental friends, including the Wentworth group, such that regional towns would be permanently underwater and such that the flora and fauna in precious iconic sites would be drowned. People need to be reasonable, sensible, fair dinkum, pro-Australian.The Australian Farm Institute says that every Griffith farmer feeds 150 Australians and 450 foreigners every year. How on earth will they be able to fulfil that role if they do not have the water to grow food? Within hours of the fiery Griffith meeting ending, the government had tasked the new regional Australia committee with conducting an inquiry into the impact of the guide to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. If the government does the right thing and accepts the Windsor report, then the people of the Riverina can rightly take much of the credit for saving this nations water situation.The Riverina is the food basket of this great nation. Next year my region will celebrate a centenary of irrigation. What a wonderful milestone—a hundred years of service to Australia; 10 decades of producing the worlds finest food.During the many hours of evidence heard by our committee, one of the most compelling statements came from Coleambally Irrigation Co-operative Chief Executive Officer, John Culleton. He quoted a local farmer who said:Im not here to survive; I came here 30 years ago to thrive.Mr Culleton continued:So all this talk about survival is to essentially say to us that the best we can look forward to is to struggle to survive, and that is an unacceptable prospect for the people of this region.Indeed, it is. The Riverinas future, facing considerable uncertainty in recent months, may be saved by this parliamentary inquiry and the Windsor report, which has urged the federal government to put regional communities first in any decision about water management. The report received widespread support. This is what some of key players in my area had to say. Griffith Mayor, Councillor Mike Neville:The report provides a triple bottom line approach. The Government now has to show it is serious about Australias foodbowl—Australias heart and lungs—and declare that growing food is a priority.Leeton Mayor, Councillor Paul Maytom:I am extremely happy with the outcome of the report. It is an excellent report and the committee has taken the commonsense approach taking on initiatives that the original guide did not.I feel that the committee has given an excellent outcome and hopefully the minister and the MDBA look at the report seriously and this will give the people of the MIA a more prosperous future.Murrumbidgee Irrigation Chairman, Gillian Kirkup:The recommendations made by the committee demonstrate that they have heard our concerns and those of Basin communities.The MI welcomes the committees key recommendations.We stand committed to working with the MDBA to develop a balanced plan that delivers good environmental outcomes without compromising regional Australia.New South Wales Farmers Association President, Charles Armstrong:We have welcomed the recommendations resulting from the House of Representatives inquiry into the impacts of the Guide to the proposed MDBA plan.A number of the 21 recommendations echo concerns outlined in the Associations submission.The report is critical in the development of the Basin Plan. Its essential the MDBA carefully review the recommendations before releasing the Draft Plan.Murray Irrigation General Manager, Anthony Couroupis:The report contains sensible recommendations that would see better outcomes for community and regional economies without compromising reasonable ecological objectives.It is clear the committee has listened and concluded that the concerns of communities expressed after the launch of the guide were significant and genuine.Southern Irrigators Chairman, Ted Hatty:On face value, if the recommendations in the Windsor report are followed, there is a better chance to achieve a balanced outcome for irrigators, Basin communities and the environment.National Irrigators Council Chief Executive Officer, Danny OBrien:Tony Windsor and his bipartisan committee have struck the right balance here.They have clearly listened to communities; a far cry from what the MDBA went through last year and theyve delivered a good set of recommendations.New South Wales Irrigators Council CEO, Andrew Gregson:I welcome the report and I am pleased to see some of the ideas put forward by irrigators have been embraced.It will certainly have a calming effect because people will see that the concerns that theyve raised have been listened to. The real proof, however, comes when the draft basin plan is released, to see if the MDBA has listened, has had time to listen and has had time to incorporate what it is that the Windsor inquiry has said.I will conclude with the remarks of the youngest person to give evidence. This was testimony from a schoolgirl who at the original Griffith rally sat near the front holding a sign which read: Keep my family on our farm. She became, I believe, the face of the regions fight for a fair future. This is what Teneeka Andreazza courageously said at the regional Australia committees 25 January hearing:I am nine years old and I live on a farm with my family. I have lived on the farm my whole life and cannot imagine what we would do or where we would go if we had to move away, so please help us and do not let them take our water. Thank you.Prime Minister, please heed Teneekas heartfelt words.","Regional Australia Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr McCORMACK (Riverina) ","(10:56):"
374,0,0,0,1,2,"Zappia, Tony, MP","HWB","Makin","ALP","N/A",8452," I welcome the opportunity to briefly speak on the committees report titled Of drought and flooding rains. I say from the outset that I agree with other members who have already spoken, that this was a bipartisan committee report. I believe that all members of the committee genuinely worked together in good spirit to try to find solutions which would be acceptable to people right across the Murray-Darling Basin area. In particular I acknowledge the work of the chairperson, the member for New England, and also the deputy chairperson, the member for Braddon, who spoke earlier today. Both of them played a leadership role in ensuring that the committee went about its work methodically and in a very measured way. I thank them for that leadership.This was an important committee inquiry. It was important because, as everyone in this House would know and as people in most parts of Australia know, the management of the Murray-Darling Basin waters has become a critical issue for the future of this country. It is a matter that has caused grief for over 100 years, ever since 1915, I believe, when the first River Murray Waters Agreement was struck. There have been ongoing negotiations, discussions and disputes along the entire lengths of both the Murray River and the Darling River. It is a matter that, particularly in the period of the long drought we had beginning in the late 1990s through to 2006-07, caused a lot of grief to communities throughout the basin. I suspect it is because of the drought that we have come to the point that we are at today, where we are trying to find sustainable solutions for the ongoing management of the waters in the basin.The committees work was initiated by the guide that was put out by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. There has been a lot of criticism of the guide. This was the guide to a plan that would ultimately be presented to the government. Whilst the criticism may well be justified, I say from the outset that it is my view that the guide served an incredibly useful purpose. It triggered the most intensive scrutiny of the Murray-Darling Basin to date that I am aware of—scrutiny by government departments, right across federal, state and local government jurisdictions; scrutiny by irrigators, environmentalists and basin communities in each of the catchments throughout the basin. For the first time ever, the views of every interest sector were put on the table and, in doing so, flaws in previously held views and beliefs were exposed and far more accurate assessments resulted.The guide also highlighted a lack of communication and coordination by all the sectors that had responsibility for river water management. Additionally, many previously held beliefs or assumptions were seriously challenged by credible analysts or people with lifelong hands-on experience and understanding of the basin. In essence, the guide exposed just how badly the basin waters had been managed until more recent years when the drought made the situation critical and good management of waters by government authorities and irrigators began to take place.The reforms implemented during the drought will have lasting positive benefits that will serve the basin communities well into the future and, importantly, serve the communities well in the event of another long drought. What is also clear is that the river system no longer operates as a natural system. Lochs and weirs which were originally installed between 1922 and 1935 and the barrages built around 1914 have changed the nature of the Murray-Darling Basin river system. Since the lochs and barrages were installed, the system has been regulated to the point that an unnatural river system has been created. From the evidence presented, much of the science on which decisions were based has been questioned. Estimates made about evaporation losses, seepage and extractions are just that—estimates—and may be considerably underestimated or overestimated. The problem is that these estimates are then relied upon for other calculations that in turn magnify the possible errors. Indeed, the system is complex. The relationship between the 23 catchments is not clear—for example, reducing extractions from one catchment does not necessarily add an equal amount of water in another catchment area. What is indisputable, however, is that since the mid-sixties extraction rates have increased. Extractions have increased by 100 per cent since the early 1960s from around 6,000 gigalitres then to about 12,000 gigalitres today. In New South Wales, extractions have increased by 100 per cent from about 3,000 gigalitres around 1960 to 6,000 gigalitres today. In Victoria, extractions have also increased by about 100 per cent from about 2,000 gigalitres in the 1960s to around 4,000 gigalitres today. And Queensland, where there was little water extracted in 1960, today draws some 600 or 700 gigalitres. Interestingly, in South Australia licences were capped in 1969 and extractions have hardly changed since that time.The volume and impact of diversions is also not well quantified or understood because since the 1960s the diversion of waters away from rivers into dams has impacted on inflows into the Murray-Darling system. Returning water to the system is critical to its sustainability. How that is achieved is dependent on who you speak to because there have been a number of proposals and options put on the table by communities right across the basin. Of course, the volume of water that needs to be returned depends on annual rainfall and, in turn, inflows. In high rainfall years current extraction rates are sustainable; in low rainfall years that is not the case. Complicating the issue is that inflows vary between catchment valleys, and nor do inflows in one valley necessarily flow on to the next, as I have said earlier. Therefore, extractions are best managed on a valley-by-valley basis.The science around volumes of water that should be returned to the system is also not clear. Not surprisingly, we have had figures mooted of anywhere between 3,000 and 7,600 gigalitres of water that should be returned to the system. Figures are also based on average inflows. Again, not only do average inflows vary across the basin but, importantly, average inflows are of very little value or of very little use unless all the water is able to be stored. Since that is not possible, extraction rates will need to be closely monitored on a year-by-year basis across each of the catchments. The alternative is to impose ultraconservative extraction reductions and that would unnecessarily constrain productivity and cause hardship to basin communities. The use of adjustable allocations, as has been the case in recent years, is likely to be necessary into the future. The use of allocations could be used to further regulate the system on a year-by-year basis with relatively little impact on agricultural communities and food production.For the basin to remain sustainable we must have a healthy river system. If the rivers die the basin communities will also die. Now that the reform process has begun, we must see it through and we must get it right. In fact, it is my view that Australians are counting on us to do that. We must commit to what is required and not fall into a false sense of security because of the recent rains. With a growing world population, any reduction in food production should also be of concern. The Murray-Darling Basin is not only Australias food bowl but offers huge potential for growth. A growing world population will need to be fed and the Murray-Darling Basin presents Australia with substantial economic opportunities. We should not dismiss those opportunities. As a member of the committee I have seen examples, as we moved through communities, of that occurring today, where on-farm efficiency is producing greater volumes of produce by using lesser amounts of water. It is that kind of innovation that we should be supporting, encouraging and investing in.One of the important issues relating to all of the committees work was to try to come up with a proposal and recommendations that would be embraced firstly by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and then by the government. The committee worked through the inquiry in a very intense way. In fact, I am not aware that any committee has worked as intensely as this committee—certainly not in my time in this parliament. We did so because we set ourselves a deadline to try and report by the middle of this year. The authority has now extended its reporting time frame out by several months, and it will be interesting to see just what the authority reports to the government.It was interesting, though, and relevant to the point I am making, that one of the very clear messages reflected in most of the communities we went to was that there was a sense of urgency about resolving a plan for the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and that uncertainty within the basin communities as to what would be in the plan was contributing to insecurity within the plan. So it is my view that the sooner the authority reports, the sooner there is a plan on the table, the better it will be for communities throughout the basin because they will have certainty, and with that certainty they will be able to manage their future operations. I certainly do not want to see the good work of this committee—which to some extent you could say was rushed, but it was rushed for good reason—now left sitting for months on end whilst others report back to the government.I want to briefly talk about the situation with respect to South Australia, because South Australia has some unique issues. I said earlier that South Australia capped its issuing of licences in the 1960s. Effectively no new licences have been issued since then, and the amount of water that has been extracted from the system has remained pretty stable. In addition there has been a huge amount of investment in irrigation systems in the Riverland of South Australia. South Australia did not cause the overuse, nor was it responsible for any mismanagement of the Murray-Darling Basin waters. South Australia will also draw on very little of the federal governments $12.9 billion water-funding allocation.One of the issues that was clearly raised was the management of the Lower Lakes, and that was raised more by communities in the eastern states. I accept that the management of the Lower Lakes is a contentious issue. There is, again, a divergence of views about how they should best be managed. I do not accept, however, that the Lower Lakes are the cause of all the problems with respect to water allocations upstream. I do not accept the argument that the system could be managed simply by tearing down the barrages at the Lower Lakes or something similar. The reality is, as I said earlier, that the whole system is no longer a natural system, and since the installation of the locks between, I think, 1922 and 1935 the whole system has dramatically changed.There was a submission, however, from Mr Ian Mott, which talked about connecting the southern lagoon of the Coorong directly to the sea. It is a submission that I believe has merit and ought to be looked at. I also believe that for South Australia the issue is not so much how much water is returned to the river system but rather how much water crosses the South Australian border and ultimately reaches the Murray mouth. That is the real question for South Australians. Quite frankly, I wait with interest to see what the authority recommends in that respect.This is a matter that I have spoken about in this parliament on other occasions. I will continue to do so and I am sure I will speak on the matter again when the authoritys report is presented. In the last few seconds left, I not only thank the members of the committee whom I worked with in the preparation of this report—the member for New England is in the chamber this morning, as are the member for Riverina, the member for Barker and the member for Braddon—for the cooperative way that we worked together but also particularly thank the staff who supported the committee in what we did, every step of the way, and who organised the inquiry for us.","Regional Australia Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ZAPPIA (Makin) ","(11:09):"
375,0,0,0,1,2,"Secker, Patrick, MP",848,"Barker","LP","N/A",8455," First off, let me say that I totally agree with the member for Makin on a couple of issues. I think the submission by Ian Mott as an alternative way of fixing up the problems of the Coorong and the Murray mouth should be seriously looked at and assessed by this government. Anyone who has looked at that submission, and I have pointed out this submission to the chair of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, Craig Knowles, as well, will see that it does warrant as a possible cost effective way to fix up a lot of those problems. One has only to look at what has been done at West Lakes in the western suburbs of Adelaide to see that, on a smaller scale, it has worked quite well. I plead with the government: at least spend the money to make an assessment of whether this could work, because it creates big possibilities for fixing up some of those problems.I also support the observation by member for Makin about how hard this committee worked. In my time, and I have been here twice as long as the member for Makin, I have never been involved with a committee—and I been involved with a lot—that has worked so hard on a report. We actually met in December, which is virtually unheard of for a committee. For obvious reasons it is a very busy time for members of parliament, with schools breaking up and different functions that you need to attend in that period. On top of that, having a 10-day tour of the basin in January is also unheard of in my experience. That all members of the committee were prepared to make time to be part of this committees deliberations is an indication of how important they felt this inquiry to be. For example, in December we went up to look at the Menindee Lakes. Six months earlier they were dry, but when we were there we saw that they had filled up. An enormous change had been brought about not by government or communities but by Mother Nature—I think Mother Nature is a lot cleverer than any of us. To see the enormous change there and to speak with the people of Broken Hill, who rely on the lakes for their water supply and their irrigation, was an important start.We started our tour in my electorate, at the bottom of the system. We went over the barrages at the Lower Lakes, which gave every member of the committee a hands-on approach to the effects the barrages have had and how important they are. Again, I agree with the member for Makin: ripping down those barrages is not the answer. It is one of the fallacies that have been put out that all would be fixed if we just let the sea into the lakes. I think it would actually destroy the lakes. The Lower Lakes have never been naturally saline except for very small periods in our time. Like most estuaries they are mostly freshwater but occasionally, during droughts, they become saline for perhaps weeks at a time—certainly not for centuries, years or months. It is very much a very minor thing.I remember one Melbourne Cup day, I think it was in 2006, when the federal government had just set up a water bureaucracy. We suddenly found that there was a real concern with how the states were reacting to the drought. I remember the Premier of South Australia coming back, almost like Neville Chamberlain with peace in our time, saying, Were going to build a weir at Wellington. We have spent millions at the proposed site, but no weir has been built. They had to do up all the roads so they could eventually, perhaps, build a weir. I do not think the weir was ever going to be the right answer. Perhaps a lock of some sort might have been the answer, but certainly not the weir as proposed by the government. I am very thankful that Mother Nature, again, stepped in and stopped the pressure to build the weir at Wellington.I represent all of the Murray River in South Australia, all of Lake Albert and half of Lake Alexandrina. In fact, the boundary of my electorate basically goes through the middle of Lake Alexandrina and through the Murray mouth, so I suppose you could say that one side of the Murray mouth is represented by the member for Mayo and the other side is represented by me, as the member for Barker. I remember in the last election campaign that the candidates were often asked by the media or by people what we thought the biggest issues were. I always replied that the three biggest issues were water, water and water. That is very much a South Australian thing. It is an iconic issue.Having the honour of representing the Murray in South Australia is an iconic issue for me and will continue to be. Water supply is so important, not only for our communities but for our capital city Adelaide and for our industries that rely on the Murray. It is a very important part of our community, but the fact is that South Australia only takes six per cent of the allocations of the water that is diverted from the Murray-Darling Basin. I think Queensland takes about six per cent and the rest is basically taken by New South Wales and Victoria.I have never taken the parochial view that you should only look after your own dung heap, because the Murray-Darling does not recognise electoral boundaries. It does not recognise states. So, if you are ever going to fix up this whole problem, you will have to take an overview of the whole basin and not just your own dung heap. It always concerned me that wherever you went in the basin there was always a view that you blamed everyone upstream and said, Blow those downstream! Looking after your own dung heap is not the way to fix the Murray-Darling Basin; you have to look at the basin as a whole. That is why I have always believed that we need an independent Murray-Darling Basin authority, as John Howard proposed on Australia Day 2007. That did not come to pass because all the states bar Victoria would not sign up to referring their constitutional powers for seven or eight years to this national body. Unfortunately, we still have a bit of that problem but we should not ignore the wealth of knowledge that the state bureaucracies have when it comes to the Murray-Darling Basin.I also thank the secretariat, who I think did a great job. They worked as hard as us—probably harder in many ways. As a supplementary member for the purposes of this inquiry I was able to provide a voice for the constituents of Barker and also the whole Murray-Darling Basin. I think it is very interesting, if you look at our history, to see that the member for Braddon, the member for Farrer, and the member for New England and I were on a similar inquiry during 2003 and 2004. Not a lot changed except that I became even better informed as a result of being part of this committee, and I hope the other members did as well. We created a bit of controversy with that report, but the fact is that I think most of the recommendations that we made then were borne out. History often has a way of proving people right or wrong and I think in this situation we were pretty right. So, interestingly, we had the corporate knowledge of people who had previously been on an inquiry into water resources in Australia generally, because most of those seemed to be around the Murray-Darling Basin. I think it was important that we had that corporate knowledge and I think it was very useful to the committee that we did. In my electorate, water and the Murray-Darling is pretty big—I think that goes without saying. We have had some problems. On the one hand there are the irrigators that are struggling to keep their crops alive and the families and wider communities that are affected by the flow-on effects of, especially, the drought we have gone through. Some people have said it is the worst drought in our history. I think the records will show that the Federation drought from 1895 to 1903 was very similar in its effect. Of course, in those days we did not have the locks and we did not have the extraction from the Murray-Darling Basin that we have now. So I think the effects of the drought were exacerbated by what humans have done over the last 100 years. I am not saying we should get rid of the locks. Please do not get me wrong on that—because I think we have a pretty good regulated system that works pretty well—but we were found wanting when it came to the drought and it showed that we needed to take some serious action if we wanted to keep this a sustainable river system.Part of this inquiry was purely to get out there and listen to all those people up and down the system. They wanted their opinion and the situation to be known and what decisions are made. I think people should realise our committee did not have the power to say, The Murray-Darling Basin Authority should take this action; we were there to listen to how the guide to the plan would have affected the communities if it had been taken holus-bolus. I think we all agree that the PR that went out with that was not particularly good and it caused a lot of anger in the communities. So a large part of our job was to listen to those concerns and make some recommendations as a result. To be fair—Im not blowing my own trumpet—I think the committee did a very good job. I think we helped the communities get their message across but also feel that they had been listened to and that we were prepared to make some pretty strong recommendations about the way ahead.I certainly attended both public meetings in my electorate. In fact, I remember the member for Makin being at one of those meetings. Yes, there was a bit of heat. It was probably not as bad as we saw in Griffith, but there was a bit of heat. It was packed out. They had to use two rooms and try and set up a video and audio display so that people could show their concerns and needs.It gave a voice to people. We made a list of recommendations to the government—21 in total—and it would be a real shame if the government did not take notice of these because they are as a result of the consultation with the communities and that is where it counts, I believe. Any member of parliament worth their salt would always recognise that you have got to listen to your community and take the respective actions that come from talking to those people.I want to speak about a couple of those recommendations. The most important one, I believe, is recommendation No. 7—an immediate end to non-strategic buybacks. That had widespread support across the committee but I think also through the whole community. It needed to be listened to and I do hope that government take note of that.As Mr Rel Heckendorf put it, for people to sell their water at the price the government is offering, they would be desperate sellers, not willing sellers. If you do not have a strategic buyback you also have the problem of the Swiss cheese effect. I think everyone on the committee understands that. There is another thing we should be looking at—this is my suggestion—that every community, every irrigator take a 10 per cent cut. The government say that they will not do it could do it compulsorily, but there could be a 10 per cent cut stretched out over 10 years, one per cent a year, and fully compensated. I think that would return 1,200 gigs to the river and be quite successful.

I certainly associate myself with the remarks the Prime Minister made yesterday about such an extraordinary life and such an extraordinary contribution to this place and the parliamentary life of Australia generally.As an alumnus of Holding Redlich, I would like to record in this place the regard in which he was held by members of the firm past and present. The firm was founded in 1976 by Clyde together with Peter Redlich. Since its earliest days, it has supported the labour movement, the arts and human rights and has engaged in public discussion about corporate social responsibility. Clyde Holding will certainly be best remembered for his contributions as a parliamentarian, but I think it important to reflect also on his contribution to the legal profession, of which I am certainly a beneficiary.I know that my colleagues at the firm have publicly expressed their appreciation and pride at having been associated with a great Victorian and a great Australian, a man who supported the underdog and had a deep and lifelong commitment to supporting and advancing the causes of human rights and the rights and welfare of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, a man who worked tirelessly to advance the interests of ordinary Australians.

377,0,0,0,1,2,"Danby, Michael, MP","WF6","Melbourne Ports","ALP","N/A",8459," As the member for Melbourne Ports, I am very pleased to be speaking on this resolution about my predecessor, Clyde Holding, who died on 31 July aged 80. I join the member from La Trobe, in her remarks today, and the Prime Minister, in her remarks yesterday in the House, in saying that we express the appreciation of the Australian people and people in Victoria for his life and work in politics.Yesterday at the National Gallery of Victoria many people across the political spectrum made very generous comments. The beautiful singing of Deborah Cheetham was an appropriate response to his life and work in politics. The speeches of former Prime Minister Paul Keating, whom Holding served as Aboriginal affairs minister and immigration minister, and former Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, now Chancellor of the Australian National University, were particularly memorable. I congratulated former Senator Evans on particularly picking up the larrikin element that Clyde had, in a very affectionate kind of way.Clyde represented Melbourne Ports for 21 years from 1977 to 1998 and is remembered with great respect by Labor people, by his many supporters in my electorate and by people of goodwill. He belonged to that generation of Labor men and women whose political careers were formed in the fires of the great Labor split of 1955. He was the son of a police officer, and both of his parents were from Northern Ireland. He was president of the Melbourne University ALP Club while he was a law student. He was president of Victorian Young Labor at the height of the split, from 1955 to 1957.Clyde grew up in a very tough political school, fighting with both the DLP on the Right and the Communists on the Left in the inner suburbs of Melbourne. In the 1955 election he was the campaign director for Jim Cairns in the then seat of Yarra, which covered Richmond and Collingwood. The campaign is regarded as probably the most violent single election in Australian history, and I am sure it was, from everything that I have read, with both groupers and wharfies brawling in the streets of Richmond and Collingwood—the Collingwood Football Club does not have its reputation and its supporters for no reason—prior to that election, because of course the seat prior to the split was held by the Labor anti-Communist, later DLP, Stan Keon, and the contest was between Jim Cairns, with Clyde as his campaign manager, and Stan Keon. From that point, Clyde Holding was recognised as a person on the way up in the then devastated Victorian Labor Party. His chance came with the by-election for the Victorian state seat of Richmond in 1962. In the meantime he had been co-founding with Mr Ryan and Peter Redlich—who has played such a prominent role in Victorian public life both in running various companies and in setting up his own law firm and nurturing so many people in politics, human rights and the law—an industrial law firm. They set up this industrial law firm which nurtured many generations of Labor talent—the member for La Trobe being a very recent example.Clyde became a prominent civil libertarian, campaigning against censorship, White Australia and the death penalty. Senator Evans described a most amusing incident where, as Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Richmond, Clyde Holding, was actually there are on the front line protesting against the hanging of the last man who was hanged in Victoria, Ronald Ryan. Clyde was actually arrested. Can you believe that? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition in Victoria was at the demonstration against hanging in Victoria and was asked by a policeman for his occupation, according to Senator Evans, which he reported as parliamentarian and lawyer and then was asked by the copper if he could read or write. Obviously the two things were not connected in the policemans imagination.In 1967, aged only 36, Clyde Holding became leader of the Labor opposition in the Victorian parliament. He modernised the partys platform and made a good impression on voters who were emerging from the oppressions of the split. In 1970 the Bolte Liberal government had become very tired and arrogant and Labor was set to make big gains. Unfortunately, however, their campaign was sabotaged on the eve of the state election by the extreme Left faction in the then Victorian central executive, led by Bill Hartley. They issued a statement in blatant and obvious opposition to federal Labor policy and to Mr Holdings announced public policy. They said that the Victorian Labor government would cut off funding to Catholic schools. As a result, a furious federal Labor leader, Gough Whitlam, refused to campaign in Victoria and the Bolte government was re-elected and Clyde denied his chance to become Premier of Victoria.This was the last straw for many people in Victoria. The Button-Duffy group participants, including Michael Duffy—a very famous federal minister who was there at the ceremony yesterday at the National Gallery—and Bob Hawke and Clyde Holding, together with Gough Whitlam, engineered probably the most important event in the modern history of the Labor Party—the 1971 federal intervention in the Victorian and New South Wales branches. This ended the factional dictatorship of the hard Left in Victoria. It got rid of the influences of Crawford and Hartley, and it laid the foundations for Labors subsequent successes in Victoria and federally. In fact, former Prime Minister Keating made the point to Premier Baillieu that ever since those days Victoria has been the jewel in the Labor crown. He said, We have lent it to you, Ted, and we will get it back soon. I thought that was a very affable way of handling political differences.Unfortunately for Clyde he was not the beneficiary of the long-term revival of Labors position post the split in Victoria as state leader. The appeal to Melbourne voters of a modernised Liberal Party of Dick Hamer was too strong for Clyde to overcome and he was defeated in the 1973 and 1976 elections. So when Frank Crean, one of five members who had been the member for Melbourne Ports, retired as the member for Melbourne Ports in 1977, Clyde was ready to switch to federal politics.Clyde was an early and strong believer that Bob Hawke was the man to lead Labor back to office after the heavy defeat of 1975. Clyde was a tough operator and played the dual roles of parliamentary headkicker and numbers man for Bob Hawke with great skill. Together with my dear friend and mentor Barry Cohen, he was one of Bob Hawkes numbers men. It was a tough decision that the Labor caucus had to make in those days, but I think the 1983 election result was proof of the wisdom of their undertaking.No less an authority than Graham Richardson described Clyde Holding as tough, resourceful and utterly ruthless. He was the main organiser of Hawkes challenge to Bill Hayden in 1982 and of Hawkes rise to leadership on the eve of the 1983 election. His reward, a strange reward—in fact it was something that was made very clear yesterday in the National Gallery of Victoria—that was requested by him was the Aboriginal affairs portfolio in the Hawke government. This is to his great credit. This choice surprised some people because it was, and still is, a difficult and thankless portfolio. You would not have thought it was the choice of an ambitious, hard-headed factional warrior. It was not the choice you would expect him to make. But Clyde was not just a political operator; he was an idealist and he wanted to make a difference for Indigenous people. As he expected, he found the portfolio frustrating. He had some great achievements. We all remember the appointment of probably the most prominent Aboriginal Indigenous leader of the time, Charles Perkins, as the first head of the federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and the return of that great Australian landmark, Uluru, to its traditional owners.The member for Brand, the Special Minister of State, pointed out to me that these great decisions, including the resumption of Uluru to Aboriginal ownership, had political consequences; nonetheless Clyde was indomitable and it was the right thing to do. He also provided personally the funding that allowed Eddie Mabo to take his historic case to the High Court. All of us who have seen the film The Castle know about the vibe around Mabo, but it actually began with private funding of a case that wended its way through the High Court and ended up with a decision that authorised some of the things that Clyde had been thwarted on earlier. His great ambition was a uniform national Indigenous land rights act. That had been thwarted by the mining lobby and the WA government and, some people would say, the unwillingness of the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, to stand up to them. I notice that Bob Hawke has since expressed his regret about that episode and I think that his judgment is correct. Clydes reward came in the support, as I said, of the Mabo case, leading to the landmark 1992 ruling by the High Court, which has revolutionised Indigenous land claims in Australia.From 1987 to 1990 Clyde held several other portfolios in which he made an important contribution, particularly in the arts and immigration. We heard about both of them yesterday in great detail, particularly about his contribution to the arts and the purchase of homes of very important Australian painters, including Arthur Boyd, for the National Estate. I must note also Clydes staunch and unswerving support for the Australian Jewish community, which began long before he was the member for Melbourne Ports. He was the founder of Labor Friends of Israel, an organisation which is still going strong. He has a forest in Israel named in his honour, and deservedly so.It is less than three years since we in Melbourne Ports farewelled the member for Hothams father, Frank Crean, our federal member from 1951 to 1977, and we are now farewelling his successor, Clyde Holding. They were both great Labor men. What they had in common was a deep and lifelong commitment to the values of the labour movement: fairness, social justice and the rights of workers and the disadvantaged. Melbourne Ports has changed a lot since their day, but I think they are still the values that are supported by voters in my electorate. On behalf all Labor members and supporters in Melbourne Ports, I extend my sympathies to Margaret Holding, his first wife; to Judy Holding; to their children, Peter, Jenny, Danny and Isabella; and to Clydes four grandchildren who, from the pictures at the National Gallery of Victoria, obviously held him in great affection. It was a wonderful video presentation of his life from the great state conferences of the late 1960s and early 1970s, which I can remember as a teenager, in the black and white films, right through to his last days in a nursing home in Castlemaine.","Holding, Hon.

I want to do something of that, too, and to acknowledge at the outset that Clyde made a great contribution to this country in the world of politics.He was the member for Richmond from 62 to 77 and member for Melbourne Ports from 77 to 98, so that is a long stint in a representative collection of parliaments. He was the leader of the Labor Party in Victoria from 67 to 77, and he was also, as has been noted, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. But some of the issues I want to touch on today go to those areas that he always also had ministerial responsibility for that overlap with some of my responsibilities—those of local government, the arts and the territories. But he was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs from 83 to 87 and subsequently minister for local government and then Minister for the Arts and Territories.I first became aware of Clyde Holding and his passion for social justice and for taking action in terms of causes and seeking to change things around the demonstrations associated with the hanging of Ronald Ryan, the last man hanged in Victoria. Clyde was leader of the Labor Party at the time. He was passionately against capital punishment, and there were many demonstrations around those issues. In one, which was referred to in a humorous way yesterday by another former colleague, Gareth Evans, Clyde actually got himself arrested. But I first really met Clyde during 1970, and that, again, was associated with other causes for social change driven by activism, and they were the Vietnam War moratoriums. In many ways, these were the first awakening for me of the importance of activism and determination in fighting for change. Clyde was up there at the front of the marchers with Jim Cairns and others. I was a university student in the day, but actively involved, and I got to know Clyde from that day onwards.It was, of course, a different circumstance, not long after that, where the party, led by people, including Clyde Holding, understood the need for fundamental reform in the Victorian branch of the Labor Party. This came about on the back of the bandwagon of Gough Whitlams rise to popularity and support within the community, and the winning of the Geelong by-election in 67 and the Bendigo by-election in 68. But what we did not do was to win the swing to Labor election in 69 and, fundamentally, what dragged us back was our failure in Victoria. In many ways, our problem as a Labor Party in winning support translated to both the federal and state level: our disasters at the state level when Clyde Holding, who was a supporter of support for schools, not just state schools—this was the state aid debate—had his position changed by the then party secretary, Bill Hartley. This was a fundamental challenge in terms of the relationships between party administrations and parliamentary representation. Clyde, as a democrat, was not only furious at the circumstances he was put in around the issue, but also at the circumstances. That, amongst other things—like the loss in 1969—led to federal intervention in the state of Victoria. It did not stop Bill Hartley as party secretary making pronouncements completely contrary to whatever the Labor Party was pursuing at the time. We had many important rallies and mass meetings of party membership, incensed with where the party was going, including at Festival Hall in Victoria. There were some 3,000 people at conferences, talking about the reconstitution of the branch and the way forward.Clyde was a determined leader in that, and he did it not just because of his anger at the circumstances he found himself in but also because of the realisation that, if Labor was to have a chance, it needed to reform itself. That said a lot about his determination to pursue issues that were unpopular. Clyde did not make many friends within the Victorian branch of the Labor Party in the day, backing Whitlam on the one hand and ousting the state secretary on the other, but he was prepared to do it because he understood it was the right thing to do.I also note that that really was the turning point for Labor in Victoria, both federally and at the state level. Not only did it pave the way for John Cains victory in 1982—and Labor has dominated government in Victoria since that time, something that eluded Clyde as opposition leader; he could not take the party to victory for a whole lot of internal reasons—but it also laid the foundations for what was the jewel in the Liberal crown, Victoria, becoming a Labor stronghold at the federal level as well. Not only did the party continue to win in the Victorian parliament; it also provided huge ballast in terms of the numbers that constitute this parliament. At the last election, for example, the strength of Labors vote in Victoria was instrumental to our winning government.Since that intervention, there have not been many periods in which, at the federal level, Labor has not held the majority of federal seats in Victoria. I think that attests to the importance of the need for reform and the importance of the party fundamentally understanding its democratic roots and engaging more actively with the broader community.At the end of 1977, my father resigned from Melbourne Ports, which the current member for Melbourne Ports has referred to. I remember it well because I contested the preselection! I contested it against Clyde. We both came from the same faction. The faction in those days was incapable of making the call because, obviously, we were both excellent candidates! So we went to a rank-and-file ballot, and Clyde won—but he won by one vote.A division having been called in the House of Representatives—Sitting suspended from 12:04 to 12:27","Holding, Hon.

Whilst I was disappointed with the result, I was the FEA secretary and it was my duty to run his campaign. We became very close in terms of the local area, because it was the area in which I lived and an area that I knew well, and he represented the area with distinction from 1977 through to 1998. He was an asset to this parliament and I served in the parliament with him when I was elected in 1990 to the seat of Hotham. He was a great orator. He obviously had a store of corporate knowledge around a whole series of issues.As the current member for Melbourne Ports previously said, Clyde was also instrumental in agitating for and getting the numbers for Bob Hawke to become Labors leader and go on to victory in 1983. Clyde went into the ministry after that as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and in that portfolio showed his strong commitment to social conscience and social justice. He sought the portfolio and approached it with intensity. He appointed Charlie Perkins as Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and together they did important work, including protecting much of Kakadu as a national park, handing over Uluru to the traditional owners and also, importantly, laying the foundations for land rights and the Mabo judgment. He also oversaw the importance and significance of the repatriation of Indigenous remains from overseas museums.Clyde was also Minister for the Arts and had a number of major achievements in this field. Yesterday I had the honour to attend his memorial service, along with the member for Melbourne Ports, the Prime Minister and a number of former and present colleagues. We held it in the National Gallery of Victoria, in the Great Hall under the Leonard French ceiling. It was an appropriate circumstance to farewell and recognise his important contribution. He was Minister for the Arts and Territories from 1989 to 90 and he fought for the national cultural institutions at a time in which the arts were under severe pressure for cutbacks. He argued the value of the arts, particularly the national collecting institutions, and he was also instrumental in seeing the National Film and Sound Archive established on a much sounder footing. I will be doing a function in relation to that this afternoon, Sounds of Australia, but Clyde was important in securing their base, because he understood the importance of recording in film and audio the great works of this nation.He was also a champion of the then new Australian Film Finance Corporation, which invested in a new wave of production of major film and TV projects, and he was active in supporting leadership change for our national institutions, including the appointment of Betty Churcher at the National Gallery of Australia. He was also a champion of Arthur Boyds gift of his property on the Shoalhaven, the Bundanon Trust, to the Australian people. He helped Arthur Boyd and his wife approach the government in 1992 and supported the proposal with cabinet ministers. He was one of the founding members of that Bundanon Trust in 1993. In terms of cross-fertilisation—joining the dots, so to speak, given the nature of Indigenous art—he was also really important in understanding the significance of Indigenous art in the power of its message and its creativity. When he was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, he was instrumental in making the country more aware of the significance and power of this art form.It is a sad occasion when we speak on this motion, but it is a rich and proud history and a great contribution that Clyde Holding made. I will just conclude by saying he was a person of courage, a person of compassion and certainly a person of determination. He made a massive contribution not just to the life of the Labor Party but also to the betterment of the nation. My condolences again are expressed to Judy, his wife; his former wife, Margaret; and their children, Peter, Danny, Jenny and Isabella.","Holding, Hon.

She once said:I hate wars and violence, but if they come I dont see why we women should just wave our men a proud goodbye and then knit them balaclavas.It was a philosophy she most definitely lived by.At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Wellington-New Zealand-born Ms Wake was a newlywed living in France and working as a journalist. However, instead of thinking that she could most help by staying at home, she felt she could do most by joining the fight. She hid downed allied servicemen at her home and led them over the Pyrenees to shelter in Spain and, throughout the war, she helped save and shelter many more men and women. Exact figures are hard to establish, but she was reported to have helped save many hundreds of lives.As the war progressed, Ms Wake helped organise thousands of French Resistance fighters by helping train 7,000 partisans in preparation for the Normandy invasion. She also distributed weapons and met allied arms drops.As her involvement in the war deepened, Ms Wake was trained by the British to kill with her bare hands, parachute into enemy-held territory and work a machine gun—what a fighter; what a woman. By joining the fight, she made such a contribution to the allied effort that she topped the Gestapos most wanted list. She had a five million franc price on her head.Her life was in constant danger. The resistance network was betrayed in 1943. Ms Wake fled Marseille. Her husband, Henri Fiocca, remained behind where he was later captured, tortured and executed by the Gestapo.Ms Wake always put herself in the midst of the action. She was dauntless. When a German counterattack against the Resistance movement disrupted lines of communication, she covered 200 kilometres by bike over hostile ground to receive crucial messages. To her, this was not a heroines mission; this was a necessity and she took to the responsibility because a woman was deemed to have more chance.After the war, she received numerous international honours, including the George Medal, the Croix de Guerre, the Medaille de la Resistance, the Chevalier de Legion dHonneur and the US Medal of Freedom and became a Companion of the Order of Australia.She chomped on cigars, drank with the best of them and lived in horrendous conditions; however, she travelled nowhere without her Chanel lipstick, face cream and a favourite red satin cushion.She was once described by one of her colleagues as the most feminine woman I know until the fighting starts—then she is like five men. Another, Vera Atkins, who also worked in the British Special Operations Executive said Wake was a real Australian bombshell, tremendous vitality, flashing eyes; everything she did, she did well.Training records report that Wake was a very good and fast shot and had excellent field craft. It was noted that she put the men to shame by her cheerful spirit and strength of character.In 1949, Nancy returned to Australia and stood as a Liberal Party candidate in the Sydney seat of Barton. What a tremendous contribution she would have made to this place, but unfortunately it was not to be. Despite a strong swing in her favour, Nancy did not win the seat, and so she returned to Britain in 1958 when she was appointed in the Womens Royal Air Force as an officer in the British Air Ministry.Nancy Wake was one of the bravest Australians who has ever lived. She was known by those in the Gestapo as the White Mouse for the way she deftly avoided their traps. To Australians and New Zealanders she is known as a true heroine. She lived the Anzac spirit.

384,0,0,0,1,2,"Oakeshott, Robert, MP","IYS","Lyne","Ind.","N/A",8466," I thank everyone for their contributions to the debate on the condolence motion concerning the passing of Nancy Wake. I wish to add some views from the perspective of the mid-North Coast and convey the thoughts of many people who knew Nancy Wake well during the 14 years that she lived in Port Macquarie, when she was in her early 80s through to her early 90s, before she moved to France and London to live her final days.Many people have spoken about Nancy Wake recently and books have been written about her by the likes of Peter FitzSimons. Many people have expressed enormous respect and regard for her efforts throughout World War II on behalf of the French Resistance. In France, her name is held in as high regard as that of Cadel Evans. Many within Australia probably do not recognise the absolute regard with which Nancy is held in both France and England. She is a true hero in a time when the term hero is thrown around all too easily. She is and was the real deal.I had the pleasure of knowing Nancy personally throughout her 80s and early 90s. She lived in a third-storey unit on William Street in Port Macquarie, very close to the town centre. She lived independently and would shop on her own. She negotiated the stairs and got herself downtown with very little assistance for as long as possible. I heard the term feisty used to describe her on many occasions and I can confirm that that was absolutely true. She would show respect to and expect it from all comers, regardless of their authority, position or, in military terms, rank. For those who knew her well it was good fun at times to watch her pull up people who did not observe the common courtesies of life. She would certainly not let those moments pass but would remind people that those common courtesies matter, regardless of who you are.As previous speakers have mentioned, she was a woman with a great interest in all things military and all things political. Despite not being successful in her bid for election as an MP, as we see so often in Australian life, she held some very strong views and found many ways to very effectively express those views. On the subject of immigration, she was strong in her view that Australia needs to make sure it supports and protects Australians first. It might not be a view that is widely regarded amongst politicians today as we deal with the very difficult issue of immigration, but Nancy was certainly very eager to say that we should not leave anyone behind when it comes to skills and education. She felt we should do everything we can to support and enhance the lives of Australians first.There are many locals in Port Macquarie who will miss Nancy Wake. Many stayed in touch with her when she went to what she considered her spiritual homeland, in France, for her final days. I know there are a lot of people grieving as they recall some very fond memories of a great woman.On behalf of the whole mid-North Coast community, I say a very big thankyou to Nancy Wake. She is a true hero, as I said before. I hope she is not someone who comes to be seen as being of a bygone era that we will never see again. I hope that we celebrate her passing and that there are lessons learnt about things such as common courtesies and being fearless in your defence of and bearing witness to the things that matter. Her spirit is one to behold. Whilst many place great emphasis on her efforts as the White Mouse in the French Resistance, at a deeper level what I hope we really celebrate are the spirit of Nancy Wake and the values that she carried. She talked quite proudly about how she loved killing Germans, and while on the surface it might have seemed hate-filled what in fact was at the heart of it was love. Her true love of her fellow man was that if she saw injustice she was willing to go into battle and fight on their behalf against the injustice. I hope that is the celebration of her life and the lesson learnt for future Australians.We mark the passing of Nancy Wake. Hopefully, she will be regularly remembered both within military circles and in broader Australian life. Like others, I say Vale to Nancy Wake. Your time on earth was well spent. It was certainly a crowded hour. Her spirit is one that I hope all of us try and live up to. Well done on a life well lived.","Wake, Mrs Nancy Grace Augusta, AC, GM","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr OAKESHOTT (Lyne) ","(12:39):"

I, along with many others, was saddened to hear of her passing on 7 August 2011 at the age of 98. Nancy grew up in Sydney on a quarter-acre block during the Depression. She became a nurse and later a journalist. As a war correspondent she covered Hitlers rallies in Berlin and witnessed firsthand the Nazi violence. She joined the French Resistance and worked to help British airmen shot down over France to escape back to Britain. Her ability to evade capture lead to her being known as the white mouse by the Gestapo.By all accounts, Nancy Wake was a truly remarkable and courageous woman. She was clearly a woman with confidence in her own ability and who was prepared to fight for what she believed in. She was on record as saying:I dont see why we women should just wave our men a proud goodbye and then knit them balaclavas.Her story was told at the Currumbin RSL on Monday of this week by its President, Mr Ron Workman OAM, when a service was held to mark the 66th year since the end of World War II. Ron Workman and the Currumbin RSL are well known throughout Australia as it is this club, and Mr Workman in his capacity as president, which officiates at the very special Anzac Day dawn service that is held at Elephant Rock on Currumbin Beach and broadcast live across Australia. Approximately 10,000 people attended the service this year alone.I consider it an honour to have been able to attend the service and luncheon on Monday to mark the end of World War II. It gave me the opportunity to meet many of our veterans who have served in the Korean and Vietnam wars. I had the privilege to speak with Warrant Officer Keith Payne VC, OAM, who is a most humble man who performed an incredible act of gallantry during the Vietnam War on the night of 24 May 1969 when he instigated a daring rescue of more than 40 men, many of them wounded, and led them back to the battalion base. In his own words, he got those soldiers out because:It was my responsibility to get as many soldiers out of that battlefield area as possible, right? And thats what a commanders all about. I just did it because it was my responsibility. Somebody had to do something.Looking around the room at the Currumbin RSL and seeing so many veterans gathered there I felt honoured to be with them. They have all done remarkable things for our country and I thank them all.As the daughter, grand-daughter and great grand-daughter of World War I and World War II veterans I am tremendously proud of the legacy left by Nancy Wake and our veterans.

386,0,0,0,1,2,"Kelly, Mike, MP","HRI","Eden-Monaro","ALP","N/A",8468," I commend the previous speakers for their comments in relation to this wonderful Australian, Nancy Wake. It is one of those bittersweet moments in this place, when we obviously feel sad about the passing of a great Australian but also have the chance and a rare privilege to comment on a great life such as this and to celebrate that life. For me personally in these situations, I always attempt to draw lessons from the lives of these great Australians. There is no other person in our lexicon, in our galaxy of great Australians, than Nancy Wake to bring home so many relevant lessons to this country and so many lessons that are actually relevant right now. I will talk a bit more about that in a second. What an Australian, what a woman, this person was. It is also symbolic of our military tradition and heritage that she was actually born in New Zealand; she is the embodiment of that Anzac tradition itself. It is quite an interesting fact of her early upbringing.I think we need to take one step back about what led her to perform the amazing feats that she did to demonstrate the courage to take on the forces of Nazism in Europe. It really all stemmed from her experience as a journalist in the 1930s. She was working in Paris at that time for Hearst Newspapers as a European correspondent. In that role she travelled to Vienna and Germany and had firsthand experience of observing the brutality of the Nazi regime, in particular towards the Jewish population of Germany. She witnessed the beatings, the humiliations and the degradations of the Jewish community. She saw the boycotts of Jewish businesses. She saw the daubing on the windows of those businesses. She saw the rabid crowds who gathered outside those businesses and broke their windows and intimidated decent citizens going about their normal business. How important it is to reflect on that. That led her of course to the great motivation to take on this evil regime.Really, she is a timely reminder of the great generation who stood up to be counted, to take on those challenges and to pay sacrifices and live with those sacrifices. In her own case, that was a very personal sacrifice because, as we have heard, her own husband, Henri Flocci, was captured, tortured and executed by the Gestapo. She did suffer that personal loss immediately in that context. We are obviously these days called upon to shoulder those sorts of sacrifices in our ongoing efforts in Afghanistan, for example, against a no less evil opponent.Her record was a tremendous one as a soldier, effectively. The training that she would have gone through alone to be an SUE operator was incredibly hazardous. There were no OHMS rules going through that training. Just surviving that training was a real credit to her. It involved jumping out of perfectly serviceable aircraft, which in itself is often declared by some people to be an act of insanity but certainly requires great courage and great skill. In her training she was, as we heard the member for Riverina state, categorised and reported on as being a very good and fast shot and possessing excellent field craft. As was also said, she put a lot of men to shame by her spirit and strength of character. I really commend the Leader of the Opposition yesterday for drawing attention to the fact that this was a woman, in the context of debates we have had recently about women in combat. If there is any better example we could cite than Nancy Wake over some of the more sillier aspects of that argument, then this is a perfect case study. I commend the Leader of the Opposition for drawing that particular lesson out of the life of Nancy Wake.It was not just that she was good in training. She put that training into effect. One of the things that she had to do of course was kill, in the service of this great cause of defeating fascism in Europe. She killed an SS sentry with her bare hands to prevent him raising the alarm. She conducted many operations where she was responsible for directing actual contact, directing actual combat activity, directing covering fire with exceptional coolness and facilitating the operations of the maquis that she was involved with. Many times she was under fire and many times she was called upon to exercise her military skills in every possible way that you can.She was a real character. Obviously she had a lot of strong opinions, not all of which some of us would agree with, but she certainly earned the right to exercise and voice those opinions if anybody did. Once when she was parachuted into France she was discovered by Captain Tardivat hanging in a tree. Captain Tardivat, being the gallant Frenchman, said to her, I hope that all the trees in France bear such beautiful fruit this year, to which Nancy replied, Dont give me that French shit—a typical Australian response. But she did love France and the French people; it was not reflective of that but more of her particular Australian spirit. Certainly she was also heard to make some comments about our nations recognition of her—which was very tardy, we have to admit. She refused offers of decorations from Australia that came later by saying, The last time there was a suggestion of that I told the government they could stick their medals where the monkey stuck his nuts. She was a character and in the finest tradition of this country.I would like to come back again before I finish to talk about the lessons she brings home to me today and why they are so relevant today. She stood up in the face of the brutality that was being exhibited towards the Jewish population of Germany, the boycotts of their businesses et cetera. In this country today we are facing similar actions in this insidious—let me call it what it is—anti-Semitic boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign being run by certain sections of our community and supported by certain sections of certain political parties. This is the most disgusting, despicable campaign I think I have witnessed in recent times. It has been brought to the height of ridiculousness by the campaign against Max Brenners chocolate shop in Melbourne, and more protests along the same lines are planned for Brisbane on 27 August and Melbourne on 9 September. I commend all of those who have united in their voice to condemn these boycotts.Lest anyone be in any doubt about what these people are on about: campaigns like Let Palestine be free from the Jordan to the sea are not on about the two-state solution; they are on about eliminating the state of Israel, another six million Jews on whose behalf we need to exercise due diligence and campaign for their survival against this insidious campaign. What are we going to see next? Will these people be daubing windows and breaking windows again? Is that what we are going to see next? There were 15 people arrested at that boycott of Max Brenners shop—a peaceful, decent citizen of this country, doing his business honestly. I vigorously condemn not only the engagement in these activities but also the hypocrisy of these people. Where have these people been in relation to what is going on in Syria? Hundreds of people are being massacred, tortured and brutalised daily. What about Libya? What about Egypt? What about Tunisia? What about Somalia, Iran—where those people cry out for support and recognition—or North Korea, with massive daily violations of human rights? Where are these people? Where is their BDS campaign in relation to these issues? When we are talking about Israel, we are talking about the only democracy in the Middle East with a strong civil society, with separation of powers, with a Supreme Court that regularly rules in equity and fairness on the issues of the day in that country. Where are they in campaigning against these massive violations of human rights and loss of life? And where are they in campaigning on the rights of women in the Middle East and Central Asia? Are these people the sort of people who would be the first to suffer from these fundamentalist and mediaeval attitudes that they are actually supporting and fellow travelling with? What about Gilad Shalit, for whom on 25 June this year we observed the passing of five years of captivity, where Hamas has not admitted the ICRC to even observe his condition? Where are the human rights voices in support of Gilad Shalit amongst these people who are conducting this BDS campaign?Finally, I would call upon Senator Brown to exercise some control or intervention now, particularly in relation to the New South Wales branch of his party, which is running off on this agenda dictated by elements of the Socialist Alliance and moving well away from their environmental concerns of the past by supporting this disgusting anti-Semitic campaign. I would call on Senator Brown to intervene in the New South Wales branch and bring that party back to its priority concerns in relation to legitimate issues on the environment.In tribute to Nancy Wake today, I hope that this generation of Australians will be as forthright in standing up to be counted against the forces of evil as she was.Pr oceedings suspended from 12:59 to 16:00","Wake, Mrs Nancy Grace Augusta, AC, GM","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro—Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) ","(11:24):"

388,0,0,0,1,2,"Macfarlane, Ian, MP","WN6","Groom","LP","N/A",8471," I rise today to speak on the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011 and to indicate that the coalition will support the amendment. The bill amends legislation to apply to the National Energy Retail Law, the National Energy Retail Rules and the National Energy Retail Regulations as Commonwealth law and thereby facilitates its nationally consistent and effective application. It provides for the conferral of functions and powers of the Commonwealth bodies acting within the framework, including the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Competition Tribunal. It also provides for judicial review of decisions of the AER under the NERL.It is a procedural bill but, nonetheless, an important bill. The NERL is the final major component of the National Energy Market Reform program agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments in response to the 2002 COAG energy market review entitled Towards a truly national and efficient energy market and as set out in the Australian Energy Market Agreement. I am advised that participating jurisdictions have committed to commencing legislation applying to the NERL by 1 July 2012. The amendments to the Commonwealth legislation in this bill will ensure that the relevant Commonwealth bodies, which are conferred with functions, powers and duties under the NERL, including the AER, are able to perform those functions and duties and to exercise those powers from the commencement date.I am particularly glad to take this opportunity to speak on this bill today, given that it puts in place the final pieces of a comprehensive program of national energy market reform which began under the COAG process in 2002 and took major steps during my time as the responsible minister. This has not always been an easy process. At times, dare I say, it has been an entertaining but fruitless process. However, in the long run we have succeeded. In the end, energy market reform is literally the driving force behind our economy and it is therefore important that we maintain the momentum on this reform and complete it. As I say, it was a difficult process. I saw state energy ministers come and go, particularly from New South Wales, with monotonous regularity—names that are simply blasts from the past. Whatever happened to Kim Yeadon? We know what happened to Carl Scully. There were ministers who saw energy market reform as something that should not happen because their state treasurers were opposed to changes that may endanger their income supply from the energy assets that those states have. Of course, we know what has continued to happen with regard to those energy assets and the impact that they are having on electricity prices.","Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom) ","(16:00):"

393,0,0,0,1,2,"MemberContinuation","WN6","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr IAN MACFARLANE: Mr Deputy Speaker, I thought there was only one speaker allowed at a time. As I was saying, in the end, there were some ministers who actually understood how important this process was. The ministers from Queensland, in the main, did just that. Minister Conlon, from South Australia, continued to push ahead, despite occasionally being buffeted by his colleagues. I have to say that, when Minister Batchelor, from Victoria, under the then Labor government, arrived on the scene, a breath of fresh air came with him. As a result of that, we are where we are now—almost at the end of this process.I congratulate all those ministers who took a positive attitude to this, all those ministers who assisted in processes undertaken by both me and my successor, the current Minister for Resources and Energy and Tourism, because in the end this is an incredibly important set of reforms. Energy market reform, if you get it right, will help your economy grow. If you get it wrong and if you allow the instances of parochialism and state Treasury interference to derail the process, then what you do is cut your economys growth. So it is pleasing to see this has finally arrived at this point.The reform of the national energy market, though, is an ongoing process. In this instance, I am glad that the government is continuing the work of its coalition predecessor in moving forward with these reforms, albeit at a significantly slower place. Energy reform is a necessary process, despite the fact that in most instances it has been completed with little or no fanfare. It is only a shame that this government is so badly failing to uphold its reform responsibilities in other areas and failing to build on the previous work that had been so painstakingly completed. In particular, I am thinking of the governments repeated failure to deliver on the energy white paper and I will have more to say about that later in my speech.This is an important bill because, as I have noted in this place and before many other groups in the community, questions about Australias energy supply and energy security have greater prominence now than they ever had in the past. If you were to ask Australians about the most pressing issues facing their households and their budgets, in most cases you would find the mention of electricity prices very close to the top of any list. While it is important that this final piece of reform, which started in 2002, is put in place, Australians cannot afford to become complacent. Unfortunately, there is every sign from this government that it intends to undo all the hard work that has been completed in the area of energy market reform with the disastrous policies that it is inflicting on other parts of the energy sector. In the 3½ years since this government has come to power, Australians have been forced to fork out more and more to pay for their electricity and other energy bills. Since 2007, electricity prices across Australia have increased on average by 50 per cent and gas prices have increased on average by 30 per cent. It is forecast that electricity prices will double by 2020, and that is before you take into account any of this governments policies that are guaranteed to cause further spikes in the price of electricity. In every state and territory of Australia, energy prices are putting greater stresses on household and business budgets.A few weeks ago, I spoke in this place about the disastrous consequences of the South Australian governments decision to slash support for its remote area energy scheme, which subsidises off-grid generation for isolated communities. It is almost incomprehensible that, against this backdrop, we have a federal government that is so doggedly pursuing a policy that is squarely aimed at forcing up the price of electricity and eroding the benefits Australians have enjoyed as a result of access to affordable and reliable electricity. Because that is exactly what this governments carbon tax will do: it will force the price of electricity up by another 20 per cent, over and above the increases that are already in the pipeline. Over and above the predicted doubling of electricity prices, we will see a further 20 per cent added on top by this governments carbon tax. The problem with the carbon tax in Australia which other countries do not have to face is that this tax puts our industries at a greater competitive disadvantage, whether it is the steel industry, the motor industry, the aluminium industry, the coal industry—the list goes on. In fact, this tax will impact on individual Australians at a rate 400 times greater than that of the next comparable scheme, which is in Europe. The most significant way in which it creates this disadvantage is that it forces such a dramatic increase in the price of electricity. I know some raise their eyebrows when we mention the 20 per cent figure, but of course it is not our figure. It is the governments figure. Their direct goal is to lift the price of electricity by 20 per cent.I have spent a great deal of time in the community of late, talking to householders, small business and the largest and smallest of Australias companies, from the big miners to the corner shop. One thread that brings all of these groups together is that they are already doing everything they can to reduce their energy usage and thus their electricity costs. It is therefore patronising in the extreme for this government to suggest that the way to avoid this punitive tax is to be more energy efficient; these companies already are. At least that is a more sensible suggestion relative to others that have been made, such as not having a shower before bed, or sleeping with a pet. That is some of the information currently available from the government on how to cut your household electricity bill! I really do wonder where we are getting to with this. Yes, we have been able to prosper because of our ready access to affordable and reliable energy, but I can assure the House that this is not an advantage that most Australians take for granted.The other enormous problem with the Gillard governments carbon tax is that it launches an assault on the very industry that provides the majority of Australias baseload electricity, the coal industry. The governments carbon tax will dramatically downgrade the value of Queenslands and New South Waless electricity assets, without providing any compensation. The vast majority of the governments $5.5 billion compensation package for electricity generators will go to the high-emitting brown coal generators in Victoria and South Australia. An ACIL Tasman report released by the Baillieu government put the figure for the Victorian based generators at 97 per cent of the compensation package. This leaves Queensland and New South Wales out in the cold when it comes to their black coal fired generators, despite the fact that they are facing multibillion dollar write-downs in the value of their electricity assets because of the tax. The OFarrell government in New South Wales has made it clear that its black coal fired power stations will suffer a loss of value of at least $5 billion because of the Gillard governments carbon tax.Even in Queensland, Anna Bligh has made some strong statements about the lack of compensation for Queensland assets, which she claims will be written down by $1.7 billion. But I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, as anyone who knows anything about the industry knows—and I know a little, but others I have spoken to know a great deal more—$1.7 billion will not be the write-down figure; it will be significantly higher than that, double that or perhaps even more. We know from the past that Labor leaders tend to get their numbers wrong and make statements that they are not able to back up.Given this is the only thing that the Queensland Labor government has had to say about the carbon tax, it is certainly not for us to come out and applaud it. We can discern the truth of just how unpopular this tax is with members of the public and state governments across the political spectrum.The significant losses in value for generators have important ramifications for energy security and will also drive up electricity prices for consumers. A drastic reduction in the value of an asset or a reduction in the viability of an asset makes it very difficult, given that the owners of the power stations are now or soon will be looking to refinance their loans. I am sorry to say that the Gillard governments destructive carbon tax casts a long shadow over the subject matter of this bill before the House today. What good is an ongoing energy market reform when the government is simultaneously engaged in energy market sabotage?Earlier I mentioned the failure of this government to deliver the long overdue energy white paper. This is an astounding failure of government responsibilities given that, under the normal five yearly cycle, an updated energy white paper was due two years ago, in 2009. I know this all too well because I was the minister who actually delivered the last white paper, on time, in 2004. It is important not to underestimate the significance of the failure of the Labor Party to deliver in this area. While we all know the Labor Party loves a good review and cannot resist the temptation to set up another committee to compile another report, the energy white paper is a profoundly significant document. It is not just a piece of paper and it is not just a review; it is a framework for the direction of Australias entire suite of energy policies.Given how reliant our economy is on the energy industry and how fundamental questions of energy security are for every single home and business in Australia, the significance of the energy white paper cannot be overstated. At the moment, this government is forcing energy companies, investors, generators and suppliers to make long-term investment decisions in the absence of any updated guiding principles.What the Labor Party has not been short on is excuses as to why the white paper has yet to materialise. We have had claims that the CPRS process had to be completed, then there was the uncertainty created by the previous Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, aided and abetted by the current Prime Minister, to back down on the then ETS proposal. That was followed by the current Prime Ministers ironclad assertion that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads. Now we have an increasingly desperate sales pitch for a toxic carbon tax, which I understand from members opposite is creating some real nightmares for them in their constituencies.The energy industry cannot wait for the Labor Party to get its policy chaos in order. We need an energy white paper now. I know the Minister for Resources and Energy will have heard this time and time again from industry representatives but, that said, I implore him once again to do all in his power to get the governments house in order and to release the energy white paper.In conclusion, the coalition supports this largely procedural bill to complete the process of energy market reform, which began in 2002. It is now the Labor governments clear responsibility to continue to take this policy area seriously.The Rudd and Gillard governments have a very chequered history when it comes to dealing with the energy and resources sector. The carbon tax, the mineral tax, the lack of a white paper, their comprehensive list of policy missteps and letdowns, new taxes and changes of direction have shaken investor confidence to the absolute core.The energy industry needs two things. It needs the confidence of knowing where the reforms are going and the confidence of knowing that its investments are safe. At the moment, it has neither. All it sees, almost at every turn, is policy chaos and new taxes which affect parts of the sector. In 2008, it saw changes to the condensate rules in Western Australia, then the CPRS, then the MRRT, then not the CPRS and now the carbon tax. All these send a message to overseas investors that Australia is not the investment place it used to be. That will have one consequence: despite these reforms, which the coalition are supporting, there will be a reluctance to make the big, long-term investments in Australia which we need to ensure that not only do we have reliable electricity and a supply that industry can rely on but we have a long-term prospect of lower than world average electricity prices, because that has been our competitive edge. That has been the reason that we have seen so many high-energy investments in Australia.Whether it is the smelter in Bell Bay—close to Deputy Speaker Sidebottoms electorate—nickel refineries, aluminium refineries, copper refineries, the heavy industry that backs up the resource sector or the manufacturing sector, they all rely on one thing: an internationally competitive energy price. These reforms are there to try to provide that. The carbon tax, in particular, will destroy it. It will catapult our electricity prices into a region that simply makes us uncompetitive.The reason the coalition are keen to support these reforms is that we want to do everything we can—in the face of the disaster, chaos and policy coming from the government—to keep energy prices down for industry. We want to keep energy prices down for households. We want people to be able to afford basic energy needs. We will wait and see what will happen as a result of these reforms and whether this government has the courage to commit itself to a white paper and continue the process. We hope so.We hope in that haze that the government can give a modicum of confidence not only for to the refinancing process that the energy sector has to go through, particularly in the next two years, but also for the investment in the energy sector that we all need. Until that chaos ends and until that confidence is restored, we will not have significant confidence in Australias future economic growth—and the energy sector with it. Until that chaos ends the true gains of energy market reform will not be realised.","Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[8]","N/A","N/A"

395,0,0,0,1,2,"Rowland, Michelle, MP",159771,"Greenway","ALP","N/A",8476," I rise to speak in support of the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011. This bill represents the final major step in the national energy market reform program agreed by the Council of Australian Governments in response to their 2002 energy market review.In my former life I was a legal practitioner in network industries Primarily I was in telecommunications, but I must say that I found few aspects of competition and regulation in network industries more complex than in the gas and electricity segments. I want to take this opportunity to thank and acknowledge Gilbert and Tobin, my former employers, for everything I learnt and their continuing expertise on a group level and as individuals. Their practice is indeed without peer in this area.In June 2001, the Council of Australian Governments recognised that the effective operation of an open and competitive national energy market would contribute to improved economic performance and would deliver benefits to households, small business and industry, including in regional areas. Very significant and important reform around the economic regulation of energy markets covering electricity and gas transmission and distribution has taken place since that time.The reform that has occurred includes the establishment of the Ministerial Council on Energy to provide national oversight and coordination of energy policy development and a national energy policy framework to guide future energy policy decision making by jurisdictions and to provide increased policy certainty of energy users and for the energy sector itself. The Australian Energy Market Commission has been established as the maker and administrator of the rules under which electricity and gas distribution and transmission businesses operate. The Australian Energy Regulator, a division of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, investigates potential breaches of the rules and is otherwise responsible for the enforcement of the rules.The focus of earlier reforms has been on the economic regulation of gas and electricity networks in the states and territories participating in the national market. These networks now operate in a national regime, administered by national bodies. This approach has facilitated consistent decision making, and the detailed rules that govern the economic regulation of the energy networks have provided greater certainty to stakeholders in relation to both the regulatory processes and the likely outcomes of those processes. In particular, for businesses operating in more than one jurisdiction, the move to a single rule administrator and rule enforcer responsible for the economic regulation of energy networks has significantly reduced the regulatory burden that was previously faced with dealing with multiple regulators applying sometimes very different regulatory regimes. The reforms with respect to the establishment of a national framework for the economic regulation of the gas and electricity markets in the participating jurisdictions are now complete. The final step that is necessary to realise the vision of a truly national approach to energy regulation is to elevate the non-economic regulation of energy services to the national level, and it is the shift from the jurisdictional based approach to our national approach to the non-economic regulation of energy that is the focus of this bill.Earlier this year the South Australian parliament passed legislation that establishes the framework for the national regulation of the non-price aspects of gas and electricity retail and distribution activities. Important elements of this framework include the Australian Energy Market Commission as the rule maker with respect to these non-price aspects and the Australian Energy Regulator as the relevant regulator and enforcement body. This government has a central role in facilitating the conferral of relevant powers and functions on these national bodies.The regulatory package that is created by the South Australian legislation includes the national energy retail law, which provides for rules and regulations to be made under that law which are referred to as the national energy retail rules and the national energy retail regulations. The objective of the national energy retail law is to promote efficient investment in and efficient operation and use of energy services for the long-term interests of consumers of energy with respect to price, quality, safety, reliability and security of supply of energy. These issues are of critical importance to all consumers of energy. The national energy retail law, together with the national energy retail rules, will deliver important outcomes for residential and business consumers alike.Specifically in relation to residential customers, the national energy retail law and the national energy retail rules provide for standard retail contracts to be established by designated retailers. The designated retailer is obliged to make a standing offer applicable to the customer. The prices associated with a standard offer must be published on the retailers website. The national energy retail law also sets out the manner in which the standard offer prices may be varied. The national energy retail rules set out model terms and conditions for standard retail contracts, and retailers are required to adopt those model terms and conditions with only those alterations that are permitted or required under law or the rules.The national energy retail law and rules provide greater scope for the negotiation of contracts between retailers and business customers. For business customers that consume energy at business premises below the upper consumption threshold, the customer and the retailer may negotiate and enter into a market retail contract for the provision of energy to the customer as well as the provision of other services. The rules set out some minimum requirements that the market retail contracts are required to meet to ensure the protection of this particular class of customers. These requirements include that a market retail contract must set out all the tariffs and charges payable by the customers and the circumstances in which the contract will terminate. In order to provide guidance to retailers as to the presentation of standard offer prices and market offer prices, the Australian Energy Regulator is also given the powers under the national energy retail law to make and amend retail pricing information guidelines. The guidelines may specify the manner and form in which details of standing offer prices and market offer prices are to be presented when publishing or advertising those prices. The disclosure regime around prices set up under the national energy retail law is designed to assist small customers to consider and compare standing offer prices and market offer prices offered by retailers.The national energy retail law also sets out important safeguards for consumers in terms of customer hardship policies. The national energy retail law requires retailers to develop these policies and submit them to the Australian Energy Regulator for approval. The Australian Energy Regulator has the power to direct the retailer to review the policy and make variations in accordance with the requirements it sets out. A retailer is required to vary the policy in accordance with those requirements and to submit it for approval and to publish the policy after it has been approved by the regulator, and it must also maintain and implement their customer hardship policy. The national energy retail law sets out minimum requirements for such a policy, including processes to identify residential customers experiencing payment difficulties as a consequence of hardship, flexible payment options and processes to identify appropriate government concession programs and financial counselling services and to notify hardship customers of their availability. Pursuant to the rules, a retailer will be required to inform a hardship customer of the retailers customer hardship policy.The National Energy Retail Law and rules also deal with the important subject of energy marketing. The law provides for the development of rules for, or with respect to, the carrying out of energy marketing activities. The rules set out the minimum information that a retail marketer is required to provide to small customers, such as information that includes all applicable prices, charges, early termination payments and penalties. The rules also provide for the establishment by retailers of a no-contact list, being a list of customers who have indicated they do not wish to be contacted by mail or in person by the retailer.The relationship between distributors and end users of energy is usefully clarified under the National Energy Retail Law and rules and will become the subject of a consistent regime across the participating jurisdictions. The rules provide certainty to customers in terms of connection to the electricity and gas distribution networks. The rules also contain model terms and conditions that, with permitted variations, will form the deemed standard connection contracts between distributors and customers.Of relevance to the important issue of security of supply are the provisions in the National Energy Retail Law and rules which establish the retailer-of-last-resort scheme. The approach to dealing with the circumstance in which a retailer is unable to continue to supply energy to its customers is currently the subject of varied approaches across the jurisdictions. The National Energy Retail Law and the rules also set up a retailer-of-last-resort scheme, which will require the Australian Energy Regulator to ensure that at all times there is one default retailer of last resort for each connection point in the case of electricity and for each distribution system in the case of gas. Additional retailers of last resort may also be registered in respect of connection points and distribution systems. The law gives the Australian Energy Regulator important powers to enable appropriate action where the regulator receives notice or otherwise becomes aware of any event, circumstance or matter that it has reason to believe may or will affect the continuity of supply to the customers of a retailer.To the extent that the relevant jurisdictions enact relevant legislation, the Australian Energy Regulator will have the power under the National Energy Retail Law to develop and make available on the internet a price comparator. The purpose of the price comparator is to assist a small customer to compare the standing offer prices available to that customer and the market offer prices that are generally available to classes of small customers in the relevant jurisdiction.In relation to large customers, the National Energy Retail Law recognises that it is appropriate to be less prescriptive and to provide more scope for commercial negotiations between large customers and retailers and distributors. However, the framework still provides for adequate oversight of these arrangements. For example, the law provides that a distributor may prepare and submit to the Australian Energy Regulator for approval one or more proposed forms of standing connection contracts applicable to one or more classes of large customers. The Australian Energy Regulator is required to approve a proposed form of standing connection contract if it is satisfied that the terms and conditions of the contract are fair and reasonable and comply with any applicable requirements of the energy laws. On approval, the proposed standard form connection contract becomes the deemed energy regulator approved standard connection contract for the relevant class of large customer or the distributor.It will be clear from the matters that I have mentioned that the National Energy Retail Law deals with issues that are of importance to all consumers of energy, particularly individual households and small business, including certainty around the supply of energy, the transparency around prices and the terms and conditions of supply by retailers. It will also be apparent that bodies such as the Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Energy Market Commission are absolutely central to the implementation of a national approach to the retail regulation of energy service providers.The National Energy Retail Law gives the Australian Energy Regulator an important role in protecting the interests of consumers, particularly in relation to standing offers required to be made available to small customers, including residential customers, approving customer hardship policies and ensuring continuity of supply through the retailer-of-last-resort scheme.The Australian Energy Market Commission is also given important functions and powers under the National Energy Retail Law, primarily those relating to the making of rules regulating the provision of energy services to customers and the activities of persons involved in the sale and supply of energy to customers. Bringing the price and non-price regulation of all parts of the energy supply chain within the purview of the rules administered by the Australian Energy Market Commission and enforced by the Australian Energy Regulator will reduce regulatory complexity, particularly for service providers operating in multiple jurisdictions in our national energy market. Reducing the regulatory burden and providing greater certainty around the circumstances in which distributors are required to deal with retailers will facilitate heightened levels of competition in the retail market and provide consumers with greater choice.The Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill is an important part of the realisation of a national framework for energy regulation. The oversight of energy regulation by national bodies, in particular the Australian Energy Regulator, whose powers and functions are to be supported by appropriate investigative and enforcement powers, is crucial to the stability and overall performance of the national energy market. I am therefore a strong supporter of this bill.","Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) ","(16:22):"
396,0,0,0,1,2,"Baldwin, Bob, MP","LL6","Paterson","LP","N/A",8479," I rise to speak on the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011. It has been a long decade since June 2001 when COAG met and established the Ministerial Council on Energy. The whole purpose of establishing a ministerial council on energy was to reach this point. It has taken a decade. In 2002, the energy market review released its report entitled Towards a truly national and efficient energy market. The review proposed the establishment of:A statutory National Energy Regulator should be established under a legislative approach agreed by COAG to be the independent energy regulator in all jurisdictions, interconnected or otherwise, and to encompass the energy-related regulatory roles of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the National Electricity Code Administrator and state and territory regulations.It has taken a decade, because it was only on 9 March this year that the South Australian government finally passed its National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Bill 2010. That bill received royal assent on 17 March, which was the enabling process for this bill to go ahead. The effect of this bill will require a transition period until 1 July 2012.Why is this bill so important? As stated by the shadow minister for energy and resources, the member for Groom, having a competitive energy sector is key and critical to growing an economy. We need reliable, efficient, affordable, energy to grow our economy. We need security also. The one thing that is being undermined in the energy sector at the moment is confidence in investment. That is affecting the long-term security of the energy sector in Australia. There is nothing in Australia, no person and no business, that does not rely in one way, shape or form on energy. Each and every person could be positively benefited by this legislation, because the purpose of this legislation is to cut the red tape for retailers who operate across state borders, and who therefore have to operate under different sets of legislation and regulation. The ambition and the purpose behind this bill are to make sure that more retailers will enter the market and increase competition. Hopefully, as proven by experience, increased competition will reduce the cost of energy.By way of background, while talking about electricity prices, since December 2007, just after the Rudd government was elected, electricity prices across Australia have increased by an average of 50 per cent and gas prices have increased by an average of 30 per cent. In addition to that, water and sewerage rates have increased by an average of 46 per cent; health costs, such as hospital, dental and pharmaceutical costs, have increased by an average of 20 per cent; education costs, such as school fees, have increased by an average of 24 per cent; and rent by an average of 21 per cent. The thing that flies in the face and makes it hypocritical in pursuing this bill, which the government supports, is the fact that the Gillard Labor government wants to introduce a carbon tax and a carbon tax will increase power bills by a minimum of 10 per cent in the first year alone, rising to over 20 per cent.Competition in the energy sector is what will drive and develop our economy. Putting cost burdens on and setting prices through a carbon tax will actually reduce competition. One of the key aspects in relation to our energy market in Australia is that most of the electrical generation is owned by state governments. As the shadow minister said, state governments have taken a hit on their bottom line with the devaluation of their assets and will find it increasingly difficult, as indeed will private existing energy generation, to seek further loans to upgrade. This is not good for the security of energy. In fact, competition will not be addressed by the imposition of a carbon tax.I agree with what the shadow minister said, that as of now, having the effect of this national energy retail law and the other bills associated with it, what we need to truly understand the energy requirements and needs in Australia is an energy white paper. It has been long talked about but it is much needed. If we want to give those in the private sector or indeed state government instruments any level of security in their investment, they need to have a clear understanding across a national market, national grid work, of what is required, what are the impediments, what are the opportunities. So I would encourage the government to take up the opportunity and spend taxpayers money on an energy white paper, which would probably cost a lot less than the glossy coloured brochure that was distributed on the need for a carbon tax, after the Prime Minister promised that they would not spend taxpayers funds on political advertising. But the need for the energy white paper is paramount to understand planning and investment and long-term energy security for our nation.Price, as I have said, is a driver to our economy. You would think that by just driving up the price of electricity, which is the whole matrix of evaluation that has been incorporated in the establishment of this carbon tax, by increasing the cost of energy you would drive down consumption and therefore provide this great environmental benefit. I regret to inform you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that between 2000 and 2008 the cost of electricity in Australia across the board rose by 55.9 per cent. Yet over the same period consumption rose by 10 per cent, from 10,194 kilowatt hours per capita to 11,217 kilowatt hours per capita. So with the great ambition of this Labor government to jack up energy prices to reduce consumption and save the world, I have got to say that the record over the past decade has not delivered that, so I fail to see where putting a price on carbon will deliver the outcomes.The coalition and Labor have the same targeted goal: five per cent by 2020. The problem is that the Labor government believes, along with the Greens, probably driven by the Greens, that the only way you can do it is by taxing and putting a price on things, instead of providing leadership example and direct investment, which would achieve the same outcome without cruelling Australian energy and cruelling the industry factor. In fact, there has been some benefit by investing in programs such as solar hot water systems and the like. I would like to quote from an article on 15 August by Brian Robins, who said:An energy efficiency specialist with Ausgrid, Paul Myors, said: We have seen consumption falling by around 2 per cent a year for average household electricity use over the past four years. That goes against the long-term trend of a steady rise.It could be the global financial crisis - and rising tariffs is a factor. We are seeing the impact of energy efficiency, he said, pointing to the move away from electric hot water systems, previously the main user of electricity in the home.It is critical that investment in programs like that, carefully managed and financially viable, occurs. It is a pity that the minister is not here for this. I have just read a media release about the government having replaced solar hot water systems in the Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory with electric hot water systems, which shows the hypocrisy in their argument.A lot of industries will be hurt by the introduction of a carbon tax. Industries require a competitive energy price, which is the purpose of this bill. Prior to the deregulation of the dairy industry I had one of the strongest dairy belts in New South Wales. I still have quite a number of dairy producers—in fact we have Oak, at Hexham, which still processes milk. But a release put out by the Australian Dairy Industry Council on 11 July, entitled Carbon tax to hurt dairy farmers says:The cost to dairy farming families of this carbon tax is estimated to be $5,000 - $7,000 per year. Electricity is a major component of dairy farming operating costs and this tax will have a severe, direct impact on dairy farmers.Given that we export so much of our processed dairy product from this country, the carbon tax will affect not only the price of a litre of milk on the shelves, but now affect the export opportunities that are already being marred by the high Australian dollar.It is not just the dairy industry that will be negatively impacted by a carbon tax. In a release dated 14 July, the Housing Industry Association says:The residential building industry will be affected more than most.It goes on to say:Around 500 facility operators will be required to pay the new carbon tax. For everyone else, the tax will be embedded in the products they produce, such as electricity, gas and other fuels, and in the primary materials such as steel, glass, cement, bricks and aluminium. The cost will further increase progressively as they pass through the various manufacturing and fabrication faces.This is a cumulative tax—it is an add on, add on, add on imposition of costs. What will it cost to build an average new home? According to the Housing Industry Association:… an average new house and land package is due to the carbon tax will be between $5,000 and $6,000.For those young people who are struggling—working hard and saving to build the great Australian dream—this puts their dream one further step away from reality, because they also going to suffer from there being fewer jobs.There will be massive job losses under this tax. In fact, on the tourism industry, which is part of my portfolio, the Tourism and Transport Forum said in its report on the carbon tax that 6,400 jobs will go in the tourism industry alone. That does not count the jobs that will be lost in the region I represent, in the coal industry, the aluminium industry and the energy industry, and in the indirect jobs that support those. So those young people struggling, working hard and saving to get the financial wherewithal to buy their home will have to pay another $5,000. And when they get in there, their electricity bills are going to be higher and their furnishings will cost more. This is not a good way of creating opportunity.One of the hidden aspects in relation to the carbon tax, and a reason we need a nationally regulated energy market to increase competition, is local government. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may not be aware, as indeed other members may not be aware, that the energy bill for the street lights in the community is paid for by the council. In New South Wales, I am not sure about other states, councils have their rate increases capped by the state government. I will give an example: in discussions with Maitland councils mayor, Peter Blackmore, I discovered that the councils electricity bill is currently $1.8 million per year. If it goes up 10 per cent, that is an extra $180,000; if it goes up 20 per cent, that is $360,000. And they will not be able to recover that from ratepayers. Where is their compensation package? In fact, Glenn Wall, the former mayor of Dungog council, said in an email to me last week, I am duly concerned regarding the impacts on local government and our capacity to absorb increased taxation liabilities and utility and resource costs increase, which are also being capped by the New South Wales government. He went on to say:The only people again that will be impacted will be our communities. Councils do not have the capacity to generate any further income. The community cannot afford huge rate increases to cover these increases (this is also problematic in New South Wales due to rate capping.) So the only option available will be to reduce the level of service we provide to the community.Service delivery by government is key; it is essential. As I said right at the very beginning, this has been a decade-long approach. It needs to be introduced but it does not need the impediment of a carbon tax.

397,0,0,0,1,2,"Husic, Ed, MP",91219,"Chifley","ALP","N/A",8483," I am pleased to contribute on the consideration of the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011. We arrive at this point today after a journey spanning two decades, a journey embarked upon in the 1990s when the Council of Australian Governments had the foresight to agree upon the need to establish a national electricity market. It was a key microeconomic reform of the 1990s and something that a former Labor government was involved in in conjunction with state Labor and Liberal governments at the time. In the time since the establishment of the market we have seen more dynamic pricing and breaking down of the old monopolies that existed in the sector and witnessed the entry of new companies, the creation of new jobs and the creation of a more customer responsive climate that has benefited both business and residential customers and that has helped deliver significant historical savings on business inputs.COAG has maintained its commitment to this important microeconomic reform and I emphasise the point that both sides of politics have worked together to see reform work to the advantage of the nation, the economy and the community. In fact, the legislation that we debate here today is the last big part of the national energy market reform program agreed by COAG in response to the recent 2002 energy market review paper Towards a truly national and efficient energy market.The main aims of the bill that is before the Main Committee and that will be considered by the House include streamlining regulatory requirements, increasing efficiency by harmonising regulations and delivering best practice consumer protection. What I like about this bill is that it aims to deliver benefit to industry—to businesses within the sector—and, importantly, to consumers, which will balance that out. That is to be commended and I will reflect on this further in my contribution today.The national energy retail law will provide energy consumers with a range of benefits, ensuring that they can access energy services on fair and reasonable terms. Over the longer term, the expected reduction in red tape that the national energy retail law facilitates will provide an efficiency boost in energy service delivery and foster greater competition, helping provide an environment that can deliver more competitive electricity prices and offers. This increase in competition will also see retail customers benefit from more choice in energy retailers and in the services that they offer. The bill recognises that energy is an essential service and therefore will give consumers stronger protections.The bill makes structural changes to a number of existing acts, like the Australian Energy Market Act and the Competition and Consumer Act, in order to give the necessary powers to the Australian Energy Regulator, the Australian Competition Tribunal and the Federal Court. The national energy retail law will work hand in hand with our new Australian consumer law to provide small customers with a range of strong consumer protections. It will also see the entire energy supply chain from wholesale markets to transmission and distribution networks through to retail markets brought under one regulatory umbrella via the Australian Energy Regulator. This is a significant improvement, especially considering the enormous level of state based regulation applied to the sector. Embedded within the legislation is a national energy retail objective to promote efficient investment in and efficient operation and use of energy services for the long-term interests of consumers of energy with respect to price, quality, safety, reliability and supply security; and, importantly, it will guarantee access for all small customers to an offer of supply of energy. It will set out mandatory minimum terms and conditions for retail contracts for all small customers and set up a framework for customers wishing to connect to new gas and electricity networks, including the installation of solar photovoltaic systems for the export of energy to the grid, and that will become something of greater prominence in the years ahead as more people seek to engage in that form of activity.I reflected earlier on the way this legislation seeks to balance the interests of all those affected or working within the sector, and as much as the legislation is designed to help businesses operating in the sector nationally, it is mindful of the needs of consumers across the country. One area I was heartened to see some focus on was the way in which energy suppliers deal with customers experiencing difficulties paying bills. This legislation will require retailers to develop a customer hardship policy which will need to be approved by the Australian Energy Regulator and which must contain a range of programs to help residential customers experiencing longer term financial difficulties. The hardship regime includes protections for vulnerable customers, including a prohibition on the charging of late payment fees, which has been controversial in their implementation and operation; a ban on requiring a security deposit; and a requirement on retailers to allow payment by using Centrepay. Beyond this there will be limitations on the disconnection of customers—which I think a lot of people, particularly in hardship situations, will welcome—including distinct processes to follow, restrictions on when a disconnection may occur, additional protections for customers experiencing hardship or difficulty, and a prohibition on disconnecting premises particularly where life support equipment is required.Another feature to emerge from changes within the sector has been the rise of door-to-door sales techniques designed to encourage customers to switch energy suppliers by signing new contracts for energy from a rival supplier to the one they currently use. While some consumers have welcomed the chance to change suppliers and lock in savings and get better service, others have felt pressured to sign the contracts. They have felt overawed by the complexity of the contract wording or they have had difficulties in exiting contracts where they feel that the contracts themselves have not lived up to the expectations promised in the actual negotiation phase. Energy marketing rules that build on the requirements set out in the Australian Consumer Law will ensure energy consumers receive full information before they enter into an energy contract, be it for electricity or gas or both. Importantly, the bill will hold retailers accountable for marketing that is conducted on their behalf. Again, I think that it an important learning that has emerged out of the process of change that has occurred, particularly through the course of the last decade.The Australian Energy Regulator will develop a price comparator website like the ones currently available for health and car insurance so that customers will be able to compare retail offers put before them, and, where they need to be accessed, consumers will be able to resolve disputes with energy businesses through a consistent approach across jurisdictions. Retailers and distributors will be required to handle customer complaints in accordance with published procedure, which must be consistent with the applicable Australian Standard. Given that a lot of retailers are operating across state boundaries, it is important to be able to set in place a consistent set of arrangements as they apply to customer complaint resolution. If the customer is not satisfied with how the retailer or the distributor has handled the complaint, obviously they can refer the matter to the energy Ombudsman in their state or territory.On this point, as much as we have seen improvements in the way that the sector has responded to customer need, we also know that they can perform better. One only needs to refer to the workloads of Energy and Water Ombudsman operations to know that consumers are not backward in coming forward about poor service. Some of the matters I remarked upon earlier form a healthy part of the day-to-day work of the ombudsmen as they operate in different states. I am mindful, in particular, of reference to the Energy and Water Ombudsman in New South Wales, who has got a healthy workload, particularly if you look at the latest stats that have been put out, which span from October 2010 to March 2011. They do remark that over the course of four years complaints about retailers have increased or continued to increase. A lot of them revolve around billing issues—for example, disputed accounts. The number of consumers complaining about debt collection or credit default listings because of a high utility debt has increased. Also, in terms of retail competition, complaints about marketers misleading or pressuring consumers continue to increase. That, as I have said and reflected on earlier, is what has been looked at through the course of this legislation and what is intended to be introduced through the course of the work of the Australian Energy Regulator to ensure that there are standards that exist across the nation so that, regardless of where consumers live, they can have some sort of protection and some sort of ability to resolve disputes. The legislation itself establishes a strong national regime to protect, as I have said, customers, particularly in the event that a retailer fails, and I would draw attention to the fact that there are provisions for a retailer of last resort. Of themselves these arrangements are not exceptional—they have been in place as a result of state based retail deregulation—but it is important to deliver a degree of consistency about the application and operation of retailer of last resort arrangements, especially when one considers how critical they will be in providing continuity of service in the event of a company being unable to continue in operation.Services and protections such as the ones that I have reflected upon in the contribution in the Main Committee today will become increasingly important in the face of a rise in electricity prices that is occurring in states and territories, and it is our responsibility to enshrine them now to assist those that may be vulnerable. I will just leave my remarks at that, and I do commend the legislation to the Main Committee and welcome the fact that, as remarked upon earlier, we have now a national energy or electricity market and we have operators that are moving across state boundaries. There are opportunities now for businesses to participate in this sector in a way that 20 years ago they would not have imagined. As much as this seeks to liberate a lot of those companies from needless regulation or conditions that do not necessarily benefit consumers or those industries—or those businesses, I should say—it also puts in place a strong consumer protection regime. I note that the minister is present. Again I commend the fact that the legislation does seek to balance out the industry interests along with those of consumers. Thank you.","Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HUSIC (Chifley—Government Whip) ","(16:50):"
398,0,0,0,1,2,"Fletcher, Paul, MP","L6B","Bradfield","LP","N/A",8486," I am pleased to rise to speak on the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011, and I am pleased to follow the member for Chifley, who has significant experience working in both the energy sector and the communications sector, both networked industries. I note that there are a growing number of members of parliament with experience working in the networked industries. I do not think that is a coincidence, because across the broad sector of networked industries there has been a program of deregulation, competition and liberalisation for some 20 years, and that has led to growth, to opportunities and, I would argue, to the increasing importance of those sectors within the national economy. That is a good thing, and I argue that it is also a good thing that people with experience working in those sectors are now serving in the national parliament.The bill that is before us is part of the long-term program to reform the national energy market. Its effect is to amend the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 so that that amended act will apply the National Energy Retail Law, the law which is set out in the South Australian act of 2011, which itemises the specific provisions of that law. It forms part of the cooperative Commonwealth, state and territory regime to regulate the non-economic distribution and retail regulation of gas and energy. The National Energy Retail Law has this to say as a statement of its objectives:The objective of this law is to promote efficient investment in, and efficient operation and use of, energy services for the long-term interests of consumers of energy with respect to price, quality, safety, reliability and security of supply.In its operations, this bill confers key powers on the Australian Energy Market Commission and the Australian Energy Regulator. The Australian Energy Market Commission is the national rule-making and development body in electricity and gas. The Australian Energy Regulator regulates electricity and gas transmission and distribution and, included within that, pricing.The provisions of this bill are in one sense procedural, but they are important nevertheless in facilitating the nationally consistent application of the National Energy Retail Law and National Energy Retail Rules. They represent yet a further stage in the implementation of a set of measures that goes back to a process initiated by the Council of Australian Governments 2002 energy market review entitled Towards a truly national and efficient energy market.In the brief time available to me I want to make three key points. Firstly, as I have already indicated, these reforms are part of the broader competition reform process in Australia, which began some 20 years ago and has played out over that period. Energy is clearly one of the most important sectors where reform has occurred. I secondly want to highlight the tensions between that reform process and the Gillard governments stated policy in relation to the carbon tax. And also I want to highlight some inconsistencies with developments in another parallel market, which is telecommunications.Let me start by talking about the broad competition reform process, which in many ways goes back to the Hilmer review reporting in 1993. That report noted that at that time:Government businesses account for 10% of Australias GDP, with rail, electricity, gas and water utilities alone accounting for nearly 5% of GDP. Improving the efficiency of these sectors remains a national priority.The report went on to say:While there have been some encouraging improvements … progress is being made from a low base, and Australian public enterprise productivity levels remain well below international best practice. For important industries such as rail, electricity and telecommunications, most Australian enterprises are achieving only 75% or less of the productivity levels achieved elsewhere.That therefore was the starting point in the early 1990s, when the Hilmer review reported. Triggered by that review and some other processes, we saw the carrying out of a reform process over a number of years in the gas and electricity sectors, as well as a whole range of other sectors. But in the gas and electricity sectors we saw the separation of a previously vertically integrated supply chain; the introduction of competition between generators and retailers; network elements become subject to access and price regulation; the creation of the national electricity market; and gas pipelines become subject to third-party access.Progress on this reform agenda was reviewed in 2002. If you go back and look at the 2002 review it does make some interesting reading, some nine years later. It opens with the observation that:Australia is endowed with significant, diverse and high quality energy resources. Australia has approximately 800 years supply of easily accessible brown coal and 290 years supply of black coal. It has large natural gas resources in the North West, in Bass Strait and in the Cooper-Eromanga Basin …It also referred to good wind, hydro and solar resources. The report went on to note that:… Australia’s electricity and gas prices—this is speaking in 2002—are close to the lowest in the developed world … for both major industrial and residential users.And it made this observation, which I would suggest remains as timely today as it was in 2002:Energy is, therefore, a very significant strategic policy matter for the Australian economy. It underpins the competitiveness of our exported goods sector, is a vital ingredient for domestic industry, and it is a very important item in the monthly household expenditure budget.A key objective of the program of the national competition reforms was to improve productivity. As Gary Banks, the Chairman of the Productivity Commission, observed in a speech in 2000, talking about progress which had been achieved to that point, a key benefit of the reform agenda was to reduce prices. He had this to say:The increased competition that has come with these reforms has also helped to ensure that the productivity improvements have benefited consumers, through consequent reductions in prices (and improvements in quality). For example:households and industrial users have benefited from declines in real electricity prices in the 1990s averaging around 16 per cent …Declines in the 1990s averaging around 16 per cent—how things have changed.If we turn to the second point that I want to highlight, there is a real tension between this policy agenda—the bill before us today, which implements one of the components of that policy agenda—on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the direction that the Gillard government has been pursuing when it comes to carbon tax. We now have a government going deliberately and directly in the opposite direction from the one which was cited so approvingly by Gary Banks in 2000 and from the direction which underpins the competition reforms going back to the start of the 1990s. We saw, as I do not need to remind anybody in this House, a promise by the Prime Minister in 2010 that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led, and of course we subsequently saw in February 2011 a complete reversal of direction.What is significant about that, apart from the issues of integrity and trust, is that we have the Gillard government, in substance, reversing the policy direction which has been pursued in energy markets for many years. Since December 2007, electricity prices across Australia have risen by an average of 50 per cent and gas by an average of 30 per cent. What a stark contrast that is to the track record of improvements in competition and efficiency and reduction in prices in the 1990s which I cited earlier. Of course, what we can now expect is further sharp increases in electricity prices, stimulated in part by the carbon tax.","Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FLETCHER (Bradfield) ","(17:02):"

403,0,0,0,1,2,"MemberContinuation","L6B","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr FLETCHER: I thank the minister for the question and the opportunity to answer it. The point that I would make in answering the question is that, in an environment where prices are expected to rise, it is extraordinary that you would then stick on a discretionary tax which is likely to increase prices by a further 20 per cent, and that is the consequence of this governments policy. That is why I say and we say on this side of the House that there has been a complete reversal in policy direction by this government.The 2002 review which I cited earlier noted correctly that our low energy prices are a huge competitive advantage, and it is clearly therefore a matter of considerable concern that we have such a sharp and direct reversal in policy direction by this government. It is further concerning that a consequence of the carbon tax policies being pursued by this government is that there is a key negative effect on major sectors of energy generation. The New South Wales government, for example, estimates a $5 billion loss in the values of its black coal based generation assets. to So it is very hard to understand why it makes sense on the one hand to be pursuing a continuation of the energy market reform process while on the other hand introducing a completely separate policy which goes in the opposite direction.The other thing that is very interesting in the 2002 review is that it highlights the importance of certainty in the regulatory regime applying to the energy sector for the purpose of encouraging investment. I cannot imagine that the authors of that review would have predicted a scenario in which a government would be elected in 2007 promising an emissions trading scheme, would in 2010 abandon that policy, would later in 2010 make a solemn promise to the Australian people that there would be no carbon tax and then in February 2011 announce, capriciously and with no notice, that there would now be a carbon tax. The degree of uncertainty facing the industry has been ramped up beyond what might reasonably have been expected or predicted when this review was written in 2002.The third point I want to make in the very brief time that remains to me is to highlight the difference, the contrast, between the reform agenda in energy and the way in which the reform agenda has gone wildly off track in the telecommunications sector. These are two networked industries with very considerable similarities. The regulatory frameworks are in many ways quite similar. Both were the subject of competition policy reforms throughout the 1990s. In the energy sector, the Gillard government is at least nominally continuing to implement the Howard governments reform agenda, albeit undermined, as I have noted, by its contrasting policy direction to do with the carbon tax. But it is very noteworthy that when it comes to telecommunications there has been a complete reversal of a reliance on competition. This government has effectively abandoned competition. Compare it to the electricity sector, where there has been a continued reliance on the existing assets in the sector rather than the government building new assets, where companies have been permitted to continue to operate based upon their current ownership structure rather than an effective policy of nationalisation, where existing players have been structurally separated through breaking up vertically integrated companies into generation, transmission and distribution as opposed to the spurious argument we hear in the telecommunications sector that the only way to achieve structural separation is to build a brand-new company at vast government expense. And where in the energy sector there has continued to be a commendable reliance on competition, the comparison is not a favourable one. I make the point that it is one of the many ways in which policy in these areas is rife with internal contradictions.","Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[30]","N/A","N/A"

In closing, can I indicate that the Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011 sees the Commonwealth play an important role facilitating the implementation of the Council of Australian Governments cooperative legislative regime for regulating the relationship between energy retailers and their customers. This regime, I am pleased to report, is the final major component of the national energy market reform program agreed by COAG in response to the 2002 report in terms of energy market review entitled Towards a truly national and efficient energy market and as set out in the Australian Energy Market Agreement.By applying the National Energy Retail Law as Commonwealth law, this bill will help reduce the regulatory burden on energy retailers, open the market to greater competition and provide a strong suite of energy-specific consumer protections. This bill amends three Commonwealth acts. The Australian Energy Market Act 2004 is amended to apply the National Energy Retail Law set out in the schedule to the National Energy Retail Law (South Australia) Act 2011 of South Australia and the rules and regulations made under it as a law of the Commonwealth in Australias offshore area. The Australian Energy Regulator and the Australian Competition Tribunal will have important roles in overseeing the proper operation of this legislative regime to ensure efficient and competitive outcomes in the energy market that protect the long-term interests of energy consumers. To this end, this bill amends the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 and the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to explicitly allow the new national energy retail law to confer relevant functions and powers and impose duties on these two Commonwealth bodies. Under the national energy retail law, the regulation of all energy retail businesses, except in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, will be undertaken by the Australian Energy Regulator, bringing the whole energy supply chain under national regulation for the first time.The Australian Energy Regulator will oversee a robust compliance and enforcement regime across all participating jurisdictions in a manner that will contribute to the achievement of the national energy retail objective. It will also have a number of new approval functions. The amendments to the Australian Energy Market Act 2004 contained in this bill provide jurisdiction to the Federal Court to hear proceedings under the national energy retail law. This bill also amends the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 to ensure the administrative decisions of the Australian Energy Regulator under the national energy retail law are subject to appropriately rigorous judicial review.In summary, the amendments in this bill represent a significant legislative step towards a truly national energy retail regime under a national energy regulator. This cooperative scheme will ensure that Australia enjoys strong energy customer protections and the benefits of competitive and efficient energy markets, while minimising the regulatory burden on industry.Having dealt with the legislative nature of the bill, which is important, I will deal with some of the issues raised, principally in the contributions from the members for Groom, Paterson and Bradfield, about energy prices. Then I might go to a question raised by the member for Groom about the energy white paper, which is related to these proceedings. Let us be very clear about electricity prices. This is the question that the member for Bradfield refused to answer or acknowledge. The biggest cause of recent prices is increasing network charges, particularly for distribution and, to a lesser extent, transmission, which collectively account for around 50 per cent of a household electricity bill. These problems confront all states and territories, irrespective of who is in government—be it a coalition government in New South Wales or a Labor government in Queensland. The changes are being driven by the substantial investment required in new and ageing network infrastructure. It is a fact of life. The investment is required to ensure the continued reliability of electricity supply that the community has come to expect. In essence, electricity is an essential service and the last thing the Australian community is going to accept from a state government of any political persuasion is shedding or blackouts. The reliability of the electricity supply underpins the operation of the Australian economy. I also indicate that some electricity networks are up to 40 to 55 years of age and are reaching the end of their useful life. There are therefore serious questions of reliability without that investment.As a growing economy, our communitys ever increasing expectations for the use of such things as air conditioners and widescreen televisions et cetera are part of a rising peak demand for electricity. This is largely caused, as I indicated, by the growing use of appliances such as air conditioners, which is placing additional pressure on the network. The size of the investment needed to meet these challenges varies across jurisdictions, but independent regulators recently authorised substantial expenditure by network businesses to carry out these upgrades, which obviously flow through to both industrial and household customer bills.Let us be clear: these increases would also occur under a coalition government. There is no avoiding these increases in electricity prices. Perhaps the member for Flinders is not prepared to acknowledge that, as was the case on 7.30 on 24 May when he incorrectly and in a most dishonest way said that under a coalition government:There will be no increase in electricity prices to consumers …I contrast those comments with those of someone who has some understanding, the former minister for energy, the member for Groom, who understands the challenges faced by the electricity market. I referred earlier, in a question to the member for Bradfield, to comments made by the member for Groom on 20 and 21 August last year, the Friday before the election day and the election day. In the Australian he is reported very clearly as saying that power prices were likely to double in the next five to seven years regardless of who is in government. That represents the harsh reality of the situation before us. And these types of increases are being experienced under coalition premiers.I refer to a range of comments by the Premier of Western Australia since he was elected only a matter of couple of years ago. He has had to front up to increases in electricity prices. This is reflected, for example, in a report in the West Australian of 9 February in which he said, The government has been increasing power prices as it seeks to overcome two decades of officially sanctioned caps on prices at a time when the cost of producing electricity has soared. He then went on to say this in a statement on 15 February this year:Some of the hardest decisions have been those that have increased the cost of electricity, water and gas for West Australian households and businesses. ... The reality is that the cost of delivering electricity, gas and water to households and businesses throughout this vast, hot, dry state—Sounds like Australia, not just Western Australia—is an expensive business. In the case of electricity, the cost of providing power is still significantly above what people pay for it. The recent increases have been necessary to ‘catch up’, after some poor decisions in the past and years of no price rises.Decisions made across the political spectrum, I might add. He went on to say:It is important to note that even with the increases of the past two years, taxpayers still have to contribute to cover the gap.In his budget speech of 2010, he also said, Moving towards ensuring charges reflect the true cost of delivering electricity is what this budget is about.It is about time that we had a little bit of honesty about what is driving the increase in electricity prices in Australia at the moment. Past generations built the network. Our responsibility is to maintain and extend the network in accordance with our demands. We have a growing economy. The demand for energy is increasing. We as a community not only expect reliability but we also expect the system to meet our peak energy requirements in a couple of weeks of the year. That effectively means that we need to build a system that is only used for a couple of weeks of the year. Our responsibility is to try and work out how to reduce that peak demand through improvements in energy efficiency. That is clearly part of the responsibility of the Ministerial Council on Energy and Resources. We need to work with industry and the community on those efficiency issues.There was a serious question raised by the member for Groom. I respect his understanding of the challenges confronting Australia from an energy security point of view. One way or another, the debate about a price on carbon has to be resolved. The record shows that we as a community have lacked baseload investment for some considerable time. There are special challenges coming the way of Queensland and New South Wales. In New South Wales, it is fair to say that the last real baseload investments were under the Wran government. When it was elected on 2 May 1976, it inherited an unstable electricity system, which led to blackouts and real problems for industry and households. That government built ahead of its requirements in terms of the needs of the community at that time, and New South Wales lived off that for many decades.Because of the uncertainty over a price on carbon, we have not had baseload investments for some time in coal-fired power in Australia. That raises ongoing issues over the next decade about where we go in terms of energy security. We have had growth in wind power. In more recent times, we have had a growth in solar PV, mainly because the price of solar PV manufactured imports has gone down. That growth has been assisted by a range of feed-in tariffs at a state and territory level, by governments of all political persuasions, and the introduction of the RET. In terms of reliability, the only real investment has been in peaking gas capacity. I might also say that in this transition, yes, there will be a growth in wind, a mature form of renewable energy, but there is also going to be a significant reliance on gas. The energy white paper was well underway in the last parliament. What derailed it was our inability as a community, in November 2009, to resolve the issue of a price on carbon. A price on carbon goes to the question of how you price the available energy options for Australia. Once this debate about where we go on a price on carbon is completed in this calendar year the work that is already underway and well advanced on the energy white paper will proceed to conclusion. All being well, a draft energy white paper will be released by Christmas for further debate and consideration by the broader community and finalisation in 2012.The member for Groom is right to raise the need to resolve the issue of this energy white paper. I wanted to resolve it in the last parliament. You cannot resolve it without bringing to the debate the question of certainty about where we as a community are up to with a price on carbon. That is an important input in enabling us to consider the different energy options for Australia in the decades to come. So I, in a proper way, indicate to the member for Groom that the work is underway and that my desire is, with the support of the department, to conclude this work, which has been done in full consultation with industry, prior to Christmas this year. Then it will be released for public debate. I commend the bill to the House.Question agreed to.Bill read a second time.Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.","Australian Energy Market Amendment (National Energy Retail Law) Bill 2011","BILLS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr MARTIN FERGUSON (Batman—Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) ","(17:17):"

However, Nancy Wakes life demonstrates that the famous quote should be rewritten and for all time remembered as: All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men and women do nothing.Nancy Wake was born in Wellington in New Zealand in 1912. Nancy was the youngest of six children, and in 1914, when she was just two, her family moved to Sydney. At the age of 16, she left Sydney and travelled to New York, then later to London, where she trained as a journalist. In the 1930s she worked in Paris, where in 1937 she met a wealthy French industrialist, Henri Fiocca, whom she married on the eve of World War II.Nancy could have escaped France and she could have gone to the relative safety of New York and seen the war out there, but instead she elected to stay and fight and to risk her life every day by taking on the Nazis, helping downed British pilots and Jewish families to escape. Through her efforts, by 1943 she was the Gestapos most wanted person, with a five million franc price on her head. So she decided to relocate to Britain, where she joined the Special Operations Executive. On the night of 29 April 1944, she was parachuted back into France to join the resistance. A French resistance comrade said of Nancy Wake that, when fighting, she was like five men and she would kill the enemy with her bare hands. Immediately after the war, Nancy Wake learnt that the Gestapo had tortured her husband to death in 1943 for his refusing to disclose her whereabouts.Upon her return to Australia, Nancy joined the New South Wales Liberal Party, and we are proud to call her one of our own. Never one to run from a fight, Nancy Wake was the Liberal candidate for the Sydney seat of Barton in 1949—running against Dr Evatt, the Deputy Prime Minister, Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs in the Chifley government. She needed a 16 per cent swing. While Chifley lost government to Robert Menzies, Wake recorded a 13 per cent swing against Evatt, with Evatt retaining the seat with a two-party preferred vote of 53.2 per cent. In 1951 Wake ran again. This time, Evatt was Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Again the result was extremely close, however, Evatt retained the seat with a margin of fewer than 250 votes. As an example of the truism that the more things change, the more they stay the same, an article from page 2 of the Sydney Morning Herald on 25 April 1951, entitled Whispering Campaign: Liberal claim in Barton, reads:Communists had associated with Dr. H. V. Evatts campaign organisers to make the election fight for Barton electorate a filthy campaign, Mr. H. R. Mallard alleged yesterday.Mr. Mallard is campaign director for Mrs. Nancy Wake, Liberal Party candidate opposing Dr. Evatt, who holds the Barton seat.Mr. Mallard said opposition supporters had started a whispering campaign concocting all sorts of lying stories about Mrs. Wake.One is that she was chucked out of Legacy, he said. The truth is she resigned from Legacy last year.Another is she dealt on the blackmarket in France while serving with the French Underground Movement.Mrs. Wake certainly dealt on the blackmarket there. She had to because she had only two ration books—her husbands and her own—with which to feed 50 Allied airmen she was sheltering from the Nazis.In the 1966 election Wake was again preselected, for the seat of Kingsford Smith. Despite recording a swing of 6.9 per cent against the sitting Labor member, Daniel Curtin, she was again unsuccessful. Our parliament is the poorer for not having had Nancy Wake as a member. One can only imagine the contribution she would have made to our parliament and our society if she had had the opportunity to represent her area in the federal parliament.Nancy Wake died on 7 August 2011, aged 98, at Kingston Hospital. We salute her bravery, her life, her selflessness and her service. She was a true hero in every sense of the word. We trust that the Nancy Wake story will continue to be told for generations, to serve as an inspiration to us all. May she rest in peace.","Wake, Mrs Nancy Grace Augusta, AC, GM","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) ","(17:32):"

This is a person whose history, story, contribution, energy and simple impact on history far outstrip that of anybody other than a very few number of Australians over the last century.Nancy Wake was born in New Zealand, but came to Australia at the age of two. She fled at age 16 to New York and Europe. She became a correspondent in the Hearst empire. Most importantly, while in Europe she was motivated by the early signs she saw of what the Nazis were doing to the Jewish population. She could see creeping evil working its way across Germany and across Europe, and she vowed to stand against it. So during the Second World War, because of her marriage to a French industrialist, she became an agent of the Resistance. She fought heroically, as others have set out magnificently in both chambers of this parliament. She was an extraordinary leader, and the fact that a young Australian woman, living in France, could become the number one most wanted person on the Gestapo list says that this was an Australian who transcended all boundaries to be utterly vital and utterly effective for the French Resistance, which was critical in aiding Allied pilots who were shot down, critical for leading the French resistance movement, critical to defying of the German war movement and critical to providing a beachhead in the lead up to D-Day. This was about preparing the ground, preparing the way and being engaged in the fundamental activities that helped to break down and weaken the German front across France. This was freedoms front line in its absolute definition.The life that she lived was a life well worth living. She lived it in her early days during the wartime years and then in the postwar years. For us, it is a great thing that she was a Liberal candidate in 1949 and 1951—coming close to defeating Evatt, who was the Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in those two respective elections—and again in 1966. She achieved great swings on each of those three occasions as a candidate for the Liberal Party but fell just short. It was the parliaments loss that one of the really great but unsung figures of the last century in Australia never made it to this parliament. It was certainly the Liberal Partys loss, but it was the parliaments loss as well.But we can reflect on a life well lived, in the best sense. It was a life of adventure. It was a life of opinion. It was a life that was willing to risk everything for the sake of something greater and it was a life of profound impact. We as a country are better for it. My one thought is that, strangely and curiously, we have not told her story properly. I hope that it is not just this short period of remembrance where her deeds are elevated again but that she becomes a part of the curriculum taught in Australian schools as an icon, an indicator and a role model of courage, integrity and simple chutzpah, as somebody who lived life as well as it could be lived.

409,0,0,0,1,2,"Smith, Tony, MP","00APG","Casey","LP","N/A",8495," I rise to support the motion of condolence of the Prime Minister for the late Nancy Wake and, in doing so, associate myself with and support all of the eloquent remarks that have been made both in the House and in this Main Committee chamber. As earlier speakers have pointed out, Nancy Wake led an incredible life, a long life and a life that mattered at a point in international history where the choices between freedom and the terrible alternative were startling for her.Previous speakers, from the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister through, have outlined in great detail her feats. Her main feat was courage in a critical situation. In doing what she did through World War II, risking her own life and taking what was clearly an instinctive decision that in the face of evil she would do something, no matter what the cost, she saved countless lives—and not just the lives of those in her immediate vicinity where she was working during her time with the underground. Critically, she was there risking her life in preparation for D-Day, as the previous speaker said, and the invasion of Normandy, which was to be the turning point in the European war that would drive the Nazis back and ultimately end that awful war in Europe. Each day Nancy Wakes life was at risk. She would have gone about her work thinking, I suspect, that her life would come to an end at some point. As the member for Hughes pointed out, she should be praised for taking risks—but an additional point is that she would have known the odds were that she would be caught and would suffer an awful fate.As you would expect, in recent days there has been a great deal written about Nancy Wake. There has been a wonderful book written about her, which I have not read, but I have read some of the commentary in the papers. We have some great historians in Australia who have written about the exploits of Nancy Wake, and we can reflect on the richness of her life and her contributions. One of those commentaries that stuck out for me was written by one of the gallery journalists, Paul Daley, who has written a few books on World War I. He wrote about an assignment he had when he was in London—he was told to track down Nancy Wake to interview her, and to do it within one day. He pointed out in the article that he had to find Nancy Wake somewhere in London to interview her—I think she was into her early 90s at the time—and it dawned on him that he had to do in a day what the Gestapo was never able to do over the course of the war. I recommend that the member for Higgins and others read that comment that Paul Daley wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald Sunday edition a couple of weeks ago. He found her in a hospital near the hotel where she lived. She had aged but she had lost none of her spirit and none of her forthrightness.It is no surprise that on Nancy Wakes return to Australia she sought to involve herself in public affairs. The story of this parliament in the years immediately after the Second World War is of people of both political persuasions, having served in that war and having sacrificed so much, wanting to come back and very much be a part of this parliament. It is no surprise at all, having fought so hard for the principles she believed in, having seen the sacrifice that people like her had made and having seen first-hand the atrocities in Europe, that coming back to Australia she would want to make her contribution in a democracy and in the federal parliament of Australia. She never quite got there, as we have heard. As some of my colleagues have said, maybe parliament was not suited to her—imagine what she would have been like in the party room! I think she would have been fantastic in the party room. It would have been another chapter in her history but I think we can all agree that few people have led lives like hers, with so many chapters and having done so much.It is right that we honour her in this parliament today but it is also right that we teach her story—which is an Australian story—and that it be taught not just in schools but right throughout the country in the years to come, ensuring that in the decades ahead everyone knows the story of Nancy Wake.","Wake, Mrs Nancy Grace Augusta, AC, GM","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) ","(17:39):"
410,0,0,0,1,2,"ODwyer, Kelly, MP","LKU","Higgins","LP","N/A",8496," During the winter recess Australia lost one of its greatest war heroes, Nancy Wake. Nancy died at the grand old age of 98 years, the world being a better place for her having been here. Many thousands of people lived due to her acts of courage, tenacity and sacrifice during the Second World War. Horrified by the acts of cruelty and injustice that she witnessed while a journalist in Europe, Nancy joined the French Resistance after Germany invaded France in 1940. A true inspiration, Nancy Wake embodied the Allied spirit, dedicated to freedom and democracy.Nancy is of course one of the most decorated women of the Second World War. She received many awards, including: the George Medal; the 1939-45 Star; the France and Germany Star; the Defence Medal; the British War Medal 1939-45; the Chevalier de la Legion dHonneur; the Croix de Guerre, with two Palms and a Star; the Medal of Freedom, with Bronze Palm; and the Medaille de la Resistance for her courageous endeavours. Australia, of course, finally recognised her achievements when they awarded her the Companion of the Order of Australia in 2004.Nancy Wake was born in 1912 in Wellington, New Zealand, but moved to Sydney at the age of two, and we claim her as our own. The youngest of six children, at the age of 16 years Nancy left home to pursue a career as a nurse, before leaving Sydney shortly thereafter for Europe, where she became a journalist for the Hearst newspaper group. After witnessing some of the abhorrent acts carried out by the Nazis, Nancy Wake felt duty bound to join the war effort. As Nancy Wake herself recounted:The stormtroopers had tied the Jewish people up to massive wheels. They were rolling the wheels along, and the stormtroopers were whipping the Jews. I stood there and thought, I dont know what Ill do about it, but if I can do anything one day, Ill do it.She got that opportunity after Germany invaded France in 1940, shortly after she had married Henri Fiocca, a wealthy French industrialist.Wake started her resistance activities by becoming a courier for the French Resistance. She then joined the escape network managed by Captain Ian Garrow. So successful was she at defeating and evading the Germans that the Gestapo dubbed her the White Mouse for her ability to elude capture. By 1943, she had become one of the Gestapos most wanted persons in France.After Nancys network was compromised she made her way to Britain where she received special training before parachuting back into France to build the French guerrilla forces, which she did, to over 7,000 strong. Wake remained and fought with the Marquis group until the end of the war. In Peter FitzSimons seminal biography of Nancy Wake it was reported that, even though they were outnumbered three to one, under Nancys leadership the Nazis suffered causalities in the order of 14 to one. Nancys friend Henri Tardivat said of her, and I think this best sums her up:She is the most feminine woman I know until the fighting starts. Then she is like five men.After the war, Wake continued working for British intelligence in Europe until 1957. She then moved back to Australia where she married former British fighter pilot John Forward. Nancy stood for politics three times, each time for the Liberal Party. Sadly for the Liberal Party and the parliament, she was not successful. Her two attempts in the federal seat of Barton against Dr Evatt in 1949 and 1951 came very close, with only 250 votes in it on her second attempt. In 1966 she stood for the seat of Kingsford-Smith and, sadly, again was defeated.She moved back to Britain in 2001, four years after the death of her second husband, and remained there for the rest of her life. Wake never regretted any of her involvement in the war or what she had to do in that war. She saw it as a just cause. She said:In my opinion, the only good German was a dead German, and the deader, the better. I killed a lot of Germans, and I am only sorry I didnt kill more.You can understand her sentiments when you realise what she witnessed and what she went through. In fact, she is very famous for having killed a Nazi sentry with her bare hands at the Gestapo headquarters in Montucon during a raid on a munitions factory. She also undertook a very dangerous solo mission to get new codes after her old codes were destroyed that required her to cycle on a bike, by herself, over 800 kilometres through many German checkpoints.I think that Peter Wertheim, head of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, put it best when he said of Nancy:She became resolved to fight Nazism after witnessing the shocking mistreatment of Jewish civilians by Nazi troops in Vienna.In todays superficial world, obsessed with appearances and material concerns, Nancy Wakes example reminds us of the things that really matter in life. She demonstrated that one person standing up against monstrous evil can make a difference.She was an amazing woman.

I like the fact that she left New Zealand at two years of age to come to Australia—if she had only moved to Queensland she could have been a real legend.The thing that always strikes me when it comes to Nancy Wakes life is her bravery. To leave home at 16 and travel to Europe—who does that? No one does that. She inherited £200 and studied journalism in London and then became involved in the French Resistance. There are a couple of things I would like to say. First of all, she ran three times for parliament. Her war record will stand out for all time and she is truly one of the greatest people ever to draw breath. She ran for Parliament three times and in some ways you would think that for someone like Nancy Wake it is probably a good thing she did not get in. It takes a special person to put up with a lot of the stuff in here and people like Nancy Wake are very much at the cutting-edge. We all have our troubles at question time but can you imagine a speaker trying to put Nancy Wake in her place? It does not happen lightly. Someone like Nancy Wake has to be revered. Someone like Nancy Wake is not a person to sit there and listen. Someone like Nancy Wake is out there doing stuff, and out there leading.I am old enough that when I was a kid I watched Vic Morrow in combat and played war games and read war comics. I know what it is like to play these games. You think to yourself what it would be like to be in a war. I am one of the lucky generation who were too young to go to Vietnam, and I have not been away to war. You think to yourself about bravery and what it takes to be brave. You think of what it must have been like in France in 1940 when the Germans came in. You think of what it must have been like to have your husband taken away from you, tortured and killed. You think of what it must have been like to be a mere slip of a girl—and she was a tiny girl—going around France working for the Resistance and showing true bravery in the face of overwhelming odds and at any time knowing that her life could be snuffed out.I speak to my children about what it takes to be a grown-up. I speak to my nine-year-old son about what it is to be a man. I know it is paraphrasing to say Men do this, because you have to be straight-up when youre a ma, but I talk to my daughters about what it is to be responsible. I talk to people at schools. So much more is expected of children now in year 12 than when we were in year 12. I often say to the kids when we are at a function that I would not have been there—I would have been out the back with a couple of mates having a cigarette. Kids today are so much more together than we ever were. I say to every child, to every girl, look for people like Nancy Wake to show you what is possible. There was this tiny little young girl, in 1940, running around France doing stuff that men were afraid to do, that everyone was afraid to do. She was a very special lady.I told my son the Nancy Wake story and he said to use the Chuck Norris joke: that she was probably ready to die a few years earlier but death was too afraid to come to her; that she slept with the light on because darkness was afraid of Nancy Wake. Those sorts of things are what we should be saying about Nancy Wake. Her record will stand for itself. At last we recognised her, in 2004.

412,0,0,0,1,2,"Alexander, John, MP","M3M","Bennelong","LP","N/A",8498," Nancy Grace Augusta Wake was born on 30 August 1912 and died on 7 August 2011, just a few weeks short of her 99th birthday. Nancy Wake is revered as one of Australias greatest war heroes, serving on the Special Operations Executive of the French Resistance during World War II. Her efforts earned her a listing on the Nazis most wanted list and the nickname the White Mouse, which the Gestapo attributed in recognition of her elusiveness. Like so many great Australians, Nancy Wake was born in New Zealand. Following the success of her fathers journalistic career, the family of eight moved to Sydney and established themselves in the northern suburbs of Sydney, not far from the electorate of Bennelong. Nancy developed respect for the military service from an early age, attending the very first Anzac Day service at Martin Place and returning every year after. This was a different time—a time when Australia was still very much ensconced in the yoke of mother England. Just prior to World War I, future Australian Prime Minister Andrew Fisher declared that Australia would fight on Britains side to the last man and the last shilling. Nancy was conscious and respectful of this reality. In Peter FitzSimonss wonderful book Nancy Wake: A Biography of Our Greatest War Heroine, Nancy states:That was simply the way it was. I was brought up in a family where, although we were from New Zealand and living in Australia, we were of Great Britain and we were loyal to whoever was on the throne. It was never something we questioned.Nancy had an adventurous spirit and was greatly influenced by Lucy Maud Montgomerys books, Anne of Green Gables and its sequel Anne of the Island, whose title character approached life with a level of enthusiasm uncommon for girls of that era. This spirit and imagination led to Nancys strong desire to travel and explore the world. Nancy Wake trained as a nurse, then travelled to London to study journalism, becoming a correspondent for the Chicago Tribune in Paris where she first hand saw the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany. In an ABC Radio interview in 1985, she said:I saw the disagreeable things that he was doing to people, first of all to the Jews. I thought it was quite revolting.In 1939, Nancy married a wealthy French industrialist and when war broke out they helped British airmen and Jewish families to escape the occupying German forces, in the process planning escape routes for thousands of Allied troops. Her activities and reputation grew and by 1943 the Nazis were directly targeting her capture, putting a 5 million franc bounty on her head. Her husband was captured, tortured and then executed for refusing to provide the Gestapo with any information about her activities or whereabouts. Nancy fled to Spain, carrying the guilt of her husbands death for the rest of her days. If it had not been for her, she mourned, he would have survived the war.Over the next few years, Nancy Wake trained as a special operations executive spy, parachuted into regions of France to organise the resistance, and facilitated ammunition deliveries and the establishment of radio links—all essential services in a war campaign. She helped to recruit an additional 3,000 fighters, nearly doubling the size of her force. She physically led fighters on guerrilla missions against German troops and installations, reportedly killing some soldiers with her bare hands and winning the respect of forces on both sides.Stories abound of her selflessness and heroism to support the war effort. This was recognised by the post-war French who awarded her the Croix de Guerre and the Resistance Medal and later made her a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. The British awarded her the George Medal, the Americans gave her the Medal of Freedom, yet, in a quirk of history, she received no formal recognition from her home country.After the war, Nancy became bored with her desk-bound London existence and returned to Australia, deciding to try her hand in the far less noble world of politics. Showing great judgment and foresight she joined the New South Wales Liberal Party and quickly became a hero within a young party. She served on the partys state executive and stood at the historic 1949 federal election that brought Robert Menzies to power, choosing to battle Labor legend Doc Evatt in his home seat of Barton. It is said that after winning preselection she sent Dr Evatt a telegram reading:Nancy Wake, Liberal candidate, parachuted into Barton tonight.The 13 per cent swing that she garnered fell just short but she chose to challenge him again in 1951, this time falling short by only a few hundred votes. Never one to give up, Nancy contested the seat of Kingsford-Smith at the 1966 federal election, earning a seven per cent swing for the Liberal Party but again falling just short. Whilst Nancy was bitterly disappointed at her three losses, it must be remembered that she was no ordinary woman of the Liberal Party and, whilst I never had the pleasure of meeting Nancy, I am sure that there are some conservative ladies within current day Liberal branches who would find her brashness and brutal honesty quite confronting. When asked about this for her biography, she responded:What did I care about trying to be a lady? After what I had been through the thought that I would worry about whether or not I wore stockings or a hat was completely ludicrous. If any of them ever wanted to chip me about it, I told them off in the strongest possible language.The irony of going through the history of this legendary character is that she would have hated all of this fuss being made about her. A close friend of mine knew Nancy well, and when I asked what she would have thought about this speech the answer was a gin-soaked response: Theyre all talking bull-dust. Just shut up and have a drink! Nancy was renowned for her straight talking and her plain speaking, and this never changed. She was incredibly brave, fun, happy-go-lucky, feisty and never ambiguous. When I asked this friend, who is far more eloquent than I, what the best way was to sum up Nancy, he simply said, She was a bloody good lady.It has been said several times already that Nancy enjoyed little more than a drink or three, and later in life she chose to sell her war medals in order to fund her lifestyle, being quoted at the time: There was no point in keeping them. Ill probably go to hell and theyd melt anyway. When successive Australian governments offered her some belated recognition, she responded: If they gave this to me now it wouldnt be for love. They can stick their medals where the monkey sticks his nuts. But she did have great respect and admiration for John Howard, who made time for a private meeting with her during one trip in London. As a result, in 2004 she accepted the Howard governments offer of recognition and was finally made a Companion of the Order of Australia.Nancy Wakes life is an inspiration to all Australians and those across Europe, who have written with reverence since her death. I am informed that it was her wish that her ashes be scattered in central France, where she attacked the local Gestapo headquarters in 1944. I hope that in death her wishes can be recognised by her government in a timely fashion, in a way that perhaps her wishes during her life were not. There will never be another Nancy Wake. May she rest in peace.","Wake, Mrs Nancy Grace Augusta, AC, GM","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALEXANDER (Bennelong) ","(17:58):"
413,0,0,0,1,2,"Tehan, Dan, MP",210911,"Wannon","LP","N/A",8500," I rise today to add my voice to everything that has been said before on Nancy Wake. I will not detail that remarkable life, because I think it has been detailed already and probably will be done so after me in great deal and probably more eloquently. I really would just like to make three points about Nancys life. The first is how inspirational she is to young Australians through the fact that aged 16, in the1930s, she was prepared, with £200, to set sail to go to America and then Europe and start her life. To have such courage at such a young age and to have such vision to want to see the world at that time is, I think, an inspiration to all young Australians. As a 19-year-old, I headed off for my European adventure to work on a family farm. I know how much that took, as a single male in the eighties, going to countries where the languages were foreign. So for a single female, aged 16, to head first to the United States and then for Europe, shows courage and foresight beyond her age. I hope my daughters and all young Australian females and males look at her absolute courage in saying at age 16 that she was going off to see the world.The second point that I would like to make is: what a true heroine she was. That she was on the Gestapos most wanted list, with a price of five million francs on her head shows how remarkable her war courage was. At a time when the Gestapo and their tactics were known to all—and it would have been known to Nancy what would have happened to her if she was caught—to continue the fight against the Nazis in the way that she did shows that the word heroine truly fits this remarkable Australian. The third point I would like to mention is about why she acted as she did. We have already heard the quote, but I would like to give it again because I think it clearly indicates the type of woman that she was. It was made when she was offered a decoration. She said:The last time there was a suggestion of that I told the government they could stick their medals where the monkey stuck his nuts. The thing is, if they gave me a medal now, it wouldnt be given with love, so I dont want anything from them.That goes to the heart of why she did what she did. It was not because she sought fame; it was not because she sought recognition; she just had a strong belief that what she was doing was the right thing to do. Once again, especially for young Australians, she is an absolute inspiration in this regard. At this time when social media dominates the agenda of our youth, Nancy Wake stands as someone who can show us a way through this. It was not about seeking publicity or grandeur; for her it was all about believing in the cause and acting for that cause. As I have indicated, the bravery with which she acted was remarkable.Also inspirational was the way she was prepared to put her hand up for the Liberal Party and take on Doc Evatt. She could potentially have found much easier options, but they were not for Nancy; she wanted to take on Doc. When she ran for the seat of Kingsford Smith, once again this was not an easy option but an incredibly difficult one. The swings that she achieved each time she stood are an indication of what the people thought of her. There is no doubt that at that time a woman running for political office would have had a fair few people voting against her just on the basis of her gender. The fact that she was able to achieve swings in those seats is remarkable in itself.I conclude by saying: vale Nancy Wake—she was a true heroine.","Wake, Mrs Nancy Grace Augusta, AC, GM","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TEHAN (Wannon) ","(18:07):"
414,0,0,0,1,2,"Neville, Paul, MP","KV5","Hinkler","Nats","N/A",8501," I too would like to honour Nancy Wake. Nancy Wake was a truly exceptional Australian and one who deserves to be celebrated. Many of the things I will say have been said by other speakers tonight, but they bear repeating. This was a girl who was born in very humble circumstances in New Zealand in 1912. She came to Australia as a child of four and lived in Sydney in the tough days of the First World War. She was deserted by her father and had a fairly ordinary relationship with her mother. This led her to adopt a fairly independent lifestyle even when she was in her mid-teens. For a time she was a junior nurse at the hospital at Mudgee in New South Wales. Because of a bequest from an aunt, she was able to go to Europe. She fell in love with Europe and decided to become a journalist.It was in her capacity as journalist that she found in the depths of her spirit an acute distaste for the Nazis. She was in Austria and she saw, following the Anschluss, how the Germans treated the Austrian Jews. She resolved that she would not be part of that but would do something about it. She became first a courier and later a member of the Resistance and still later again a spy. On her second encounter in Europe during the war she joined the SOE, the Special Operations Executive, and they were the best trained and the bravest of the brave.Very few books have had as much impact on me as the story of her life, The White Mouse. As other speakers have said tonight, the name white mouse was the title given her by the Gestapo because she was always one step ahead of them, she was always on the move and she took on many daring tasks but never once was corralled. It is funny how the Germans call the early troops in the First World War the Old Contemptibles and they called our troops in North Africa the Desert Rats and then they called her a white mouse. All those titles live in legend. In her case, indeed it should.In the story of her life some remarkable events occurred. There were occasions of amazing courage and daring, flirting with people who could put a gun to her head and shoot her at any time, riding 700 kilometres across France until the tops of her legs were literally bleeding so that she could get some equipment to the Resistance. She became such a legend that the Germans closed in on her and she escaped via Spain to England. Sadly, her husband paid the price. He would not give her up to the Gestapo and he was summarily executed. She came back in 1943 ahead of the D-Day invasion to lead the Resistance and at one stage she led 7,000 men. It was truly remarkable activity. She was competent in the use of weapons and she was known to have killed one of the Germans with her bare hands. She was a formidable soldier. I think today we have a sort of ambivalence, Australians in particular and perhaps Anglo-Saxons in general, about letting our females fight on the front line. Quite frankly, I still believe that today, that they should not. Nevertheless, imagine what the resistance to people like her was at that stage. She was commanding 7,000 in France in the lead-up to D-Day.Her remarkable feats during the Second World War led to her becoming the most decorated woman of the Second World War and certainly the most decorated Australian. She received the Legion of Honour, three Croix de Guerre, the George Medal and the American Medal of Freedom. That by any standards is a remarkable thing. The member for Bennelong rather graciously said that by quirk of fate she never received an Australian honour at that time. It was not a quirk of fate; it was plain bloody-mindedness and bureaucracy that denied the bravest Australian woman of the Second World War her just entitlement. Oh yes, they said, she fought in another army. She did not fight in the Australian forces. There were all sorts of excuses under the sun that were thrown up as to why she should not have an award. I have always found it extraordinary that the American President could grant the 3rd Battalion RAR after the Battle of Kapyong in Korea a presidential citation. The American President, in the immediate wake of the battle, granted our whole battalion his citation. Again, Lyndon B Johnson, after the Battle of Long Tan, granted D Company, 6RQR the same honour—the Presidential Citation—as did the Vietnamese government. Yet Nancy Wake, from her own country, did not receive a decoration until quite late in her life; following a visit from John Howard to see her, the Governor-General, Major General Jeffery, presented her with the Companion of the Order of Australia at Australia House in England in 2004. That was after slightly more than 60 years. Quite frankly, that was a disgrace.While on this condolence motion I am not anxious to add a fractious note, I feel compelled to, in one sense. I have been an unapologetic promoter of those who served so bravely at the Battle of Long Tan. And still to this day a number of them have not been properly honoured. I had the pleasure of putting the Star of Gallantry on the chest of Colonel Harry Smith, who was the commander as Major Harry Smith at Long Tan, just last year in Maryborough outside the Long Tan museum display. It was extraordinary that he would have to wait for over 40 years to have the DSO that he was originally recommended for granted. It is a disgrace. It is a blight on our country and it continues. His two lieutenants, Sabben and Kendall, had their awards upgraded to medals of gallantry, which is roughly the equivalent of the Military Cross. But there is still the commander of the carrier group that went in at Long Tan.As honourable members will know, 105 Australians and three New Zealanders faced 2½ thousand Vietnamese regulars and Viet Cong in the rubber plantation at Long Tan. Eighteen of them died that day. It was one of the most incredible battles; they were outnumbered by over 20 to 1. And still, until this day, eight from D Company, two from A Company and one from the troop carriers—11 of them—have still not had their awards upgraded. Nine of them received only MIDs, mentioned in dispatches, which is almost an insult. These 11 unresolved awards burn in my psyche every Anzac Day, Long Tan Day, Kapyong Day and Remembrance Day when I think of that injustice.It took us 60 years to recognise Nancy Wake—60 long years to recognise a hero who fought for the allied cause right at the front of the pack. Let us not make it another 60 years—it is 40 years now—for those 11 troops that still have not been properly acknowledged. Let us not treat them in the way we treated Nancy Wake. Nancy Wake, although New Zealand born, was certainly a great Australian, a courageous person, a person who loved life, a person who asked for her ashes to be distributed where she fought with her comrades in France, a truly remarkable woman.

417,0,0,0,1,2,"Jones, Ewen, MP",96430,"Herbert","LP","N/A",8503," On indulgence, I rise to speak on the life of Margaret Olley. One of the great tragedies of life is that you come into this place and you get to speak on the lives of people who you never get to meet. Margaret Olley has been one of my favourite artists for an awfully long time. Born in Lismore in 1923, she was educated at Somerville House in Brisbane. I am sure she had nothing to do with those terrible green uniforms they are walking around in now! During her lifetime she was the subject of over 90 exhibitions, a great favourite of Philip Bacon, who is a fantastic art dealer in Brisbane and throughout Australia. She wanted to paint and she wanted to focus her life on it, and she did. She sat in her house and she painted what she saw.A thing I love about Margaret Olley is that she said the painter was never finished. Philip Bacon would always tell the story that, if you put a painting down in front of her and it had been hung in a gallery for 20 years, he would turn his back and then turn around and she would be just brushing up and changing something. She was a true artist, where something was always ready to be done—something more could be added.I think the other thing I love about her is that she must have been tremendous company. She was a successful painter and subject. Two portraits of her went on to win the Archibald Prize. Of course, we all know the one by William Dobell in 1948, and this year was the one by Ben Quilty. Lots of prominent Australians painted her, and while she must have been an incredibly interesting subject I think she must have been even better company. To sit there and watch her paint, to sit there and watch her potter around the house with a packet of smokes always handy—it must have been lovely just to be around. I think everyone needs an aunt or a grandmother like Margaret Olley.She was named a Member of the Order of Australia in 1991 and was made a Companion of the Order in 2006. She was very generous with her time, very generous with her art and generous to all the people who really counted. She did not ever count herself as a big head—in Townsville we call them big heads. She never got above where she was. She was just a painter, just an artist; that is all she wanted to do and she never wanted to be anything more.The big thing I would like to say is that all the words that will be spoken here today and spoken about Margaret Olley throughout Australia will not mount up to five precious minutes in front of a Margaret Olley oil. To stand in front of something like that and see the depth and the talent and be drawn in is truly something spectacular. Vale Margaret Olley. Thank you for what you have done for this country. Thank you for what you have done for my life. May you rest in peace.","Olley, Ms Margaret Hannah, AC","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr EWEN JONES (Herbert) ","(18:25):"
418,0,0,0,1,2,"Garrett, Peter, MP","HV4","Kingsford Smith","ALP","N/A",8504," On indulgence, I want to associate myself with the remarks of the member for Herbert. I know that there will be contributions in the parliament from those who did know Margaret Olley well and from others like me who had the good fortune of meeting her and spending a little bit of time with her in her home in Paddington. It is the case that we have lost one of our most distinctive painters, somebody who was absolutely true to her vision through a life of extraordinary output. Given that she won the inaugural Mosman Art Prize in 1947 and has passed away in 2011 after a career of painting—in particular, in the latter stages of her working life, the still lifes for which she is so widely appreciated and known—it is a testimony to the endurance, the vision and the feisty character that Margaret Olley had. It is appropriate for the House to both recognise her contribution and reflect on her life as a painter, which is what she considered herself to be. As the Sydney Morning Herald said, she died with paint on her fingers. We can make an appropriate assumption or guess that that is as she would have wished it. She was a distinguished Australian and has been recognised as such. She was awarded the Centenary Medal for services. She was made a Companion of the Order of the Australian in 2006, an extremely high award in our country. Then there was her generous benefaction to public galleries the donation of artworks—many from her personal collection—and the writing of cheques. I have seen some estimates that her donations exceeded the sum of $7 million. I do not know whether that is accurate, but that is what has been reported. But the point is clear: she was an extraordinarily generous person.The thing that strikes one when reflecting on Margaret Olleys career is that she was no great follower of fad or fashion. It is true that she was influenced to some extent—or inspired at least—by some of the French painters, painters whose names we know well, such as Bonnard, Matisse and others. It is also true that in her early career she had a wide repertoire, painting landscapes and portraits as well. Over time, she increasingly came to paint what she saw in her own home: the still lifes, the proteas and the domestic scenes that strike a chord with people, whatever their appreciation, understanding of knowledge is. Margaret Olleys paintings touched everybody.She is represented widely in galleries around Australia, including, I am pleased to see, in the Lismore Regional Gallery close to where she was born. We saw some very eloquent testimonies to her life when she passed away. I noticed that Barry Humphries wrote about her, saying that she was someone who did good without being found out, reflecting on the fact that she had a tremendous sense of understanding for others. And yet she was in no way bound by the fashions and trends of her time.In this House we recognise, as we should, artistic endeavour. In giving tribute to someone who has made such a significant contribution as Margaret Olley has made it is entirely appropriate for us to reflect upon the contribution that artists as a whole and that individual artists make to Australian society and to our polity. Capon in his tribute said she was one of the most if not the most unforgettable people I have ever met. I met with her on occasion. The member for Wentworth will be speaking as we mark this condolence motion and I am sure that he will have something to add to this. But it is true that anybody going to her house for the first time, as I did, and engaging with her in discussion was taken into another realm. There were certainly no niceties or any unnecessary observances of the rituals of meeting with politicians. She was an extremely forthright and outspoken and had a distinctive personality. She wholesale someone whose directness was completely refreshing.At the same, she was someone who quite clearly had a vision to paint what she saw and what she loved. That is what comes through these paintings. The delight in colour, as Capon said. Her work is a continuing celebration of the great tradition of painting, painting as we know it and painting as we will always love it. There is a universality in Olleys oeuvre that touches a chord with so many.It is appropriate to not only recognise Margaret Olleys contribution but to recognise the contribution of those who work with a singular vision over time, regardless of whether they achieve high levels of recognition or not, and who continue to persevere with that creative spirit and to express it for Australians. In Margaret Olleys case, she did it across a span of many decades and with work that was of a very high order. We appropriately recognise her contribution in this House.I would like us to reflect on one of her distinctive bits of commentary, where she saidI’ve never liked housework. ... If the house looks dirty, buy another bunch of flowers, is my adviceThe fact is that she not only gave her advice but also then went on to paint those bunches of flowers and gave Australians immeasurable joy as a consequence.","Olley, Ms Margaret Hannah, AC","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GARRETT (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) ","(18:28):"
419,0,0,0,1,2,"Prentice, Jane, MP",217266,"Ryan","LP","N/A",8505," To say that our country has lost a national treasure with the death of Margaret Olley on 26 July is not an exaggeration but a statement of fact, Margaret having been named as such on the occasion of her being awarded the Companion of the Order of Australia. Margaret Olleys significant contribution to the art world will long outlive her, and I count myself fortunate to have met her on several occasions. Once asked how she would like to be remembered she replied:Ah ... l dont know, for helping people I think.Indeed she will be. This artist and philanthropist will remain an icon for her art, which is such an important part of our society. Creativity brings life and innovation. Margaret Olley enriched Australian galleries with her own work and the donated work of others—masters and unknowns alike. In addition to gifting the works of such luminaries as Picasso, Cezanne and Degas, worth literally millions of dollars, she encouraged struggling artists by buying their paintings to donate to galleries to help build the artists portfolios. Margaret Olley, as a true artist, referred to her work as the only thing I like doing ... the only thing Ive wanted to do all my life. Celebrity was not important. Indeed, as a young woman when William Dobell won the 1948 Archibald Prize with his portrait of her, she said she was embarrassed to think that people were looking at her.Although technically born in New South Wales, Margaret Olley grew up in our state of Queensland, where we claim her and where her talent was first recognised during her time at Somerville House. Of course such a talent would not be confined to one place or town and she travelled the world painting and studying before choosing Paddington in Sydney as her home, where she lived a long and full life in her famously eclectic home. When asked what her final words might be she replied:I might say to the good Lord: Just one minute. I havent finished that painting.It is therefore truly fitting that she died after a full day of painting. She was a vibrant soul until the end and her vibrancy will survive her. This is a woman who in her later life was forced to make use of a walking frame but equipped it with both a bicycle bell and a car horn—definitely not a woman to be ignored. The last time I saw her she also had a glass of carefully balanced on her walker as well. She was passionate not just about art but about social and political issues as well. Her vigour and persistence made her a role model. She encouraged emerging artists, including Ben Quilty who—fittingly in this last year of her life—won the Archibald Prize with his stunning portrait of her. When he asked why she painted so many works at one time, she said:Im like an old tree dying and setting forth flowers as fast as it can, while it still can.Indeed, those flowers will continue to blossom through not only her own works or the works she so generously donated to the people of Australia but also in the success of the young artists she mentored and who will continue to enrich our culture through their work.What a life, and what a legacy has been left to us. Margaret Olley once described her philanthropy with the simple analogy of a turning wheel, that all of life was about giving and receiving and therefore linked—simply adding so I like to give. The art world and indeed all Australian people are so fortunate that we were the ones to receive.","Olley, Ms Margaret Hannah, AC","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) ","(18:35):"
420,0,0,0,1,2,"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",885,"Wentworth","LP","N/A",8506," Margaret Olleys life spanned a great arc of Australias art history and indeed the history of my city and her city, Sydney—and indeed the eastern suburbs of Sydney, where she lived for much of her life, in Paddington. That is where she lived right at the end of her life and where she did much of her greatest work. Hers was an extraordinary life and a very fortunate one in many ways. Margaret had great challenges—she suffered from depression for a period but overcame that, and certainly in the last 10 years of her life, when I saw her from time to time in the eastern suburbs, she was always full of life and energy. The thing that stands out most in my recollection of Margaret Olley—an indelible recollection, really—is her extraordinary feistiness, even though she was so old. And she looked very old too, as the portrait by Ben Quilty in the Archibald only this year demonstrated. She was an old lady—88 years of age. She had not attempted to look like anything else, but she projected energy and life. She not only did this with very emphatic and often rather startling bouts of political incorrectness and frank advice to people about whether they were fat or thin whether she liked what they were wearing, let alone whether she approved of the art she was surveying, but she emphasised this with a walking frame which I always suspected she did not need at all. I remember I tried to engage her on this and she would not respond. She would come into a conversation with this walking frame and plonk it down with a thud, and that not only established that she was there but silenced everybody else and then she would hold court on whatever subject was taking her fancy at the time.Many artists are very shy people, immersed in their work and awkward on social occasions. Sir William Dobell is a very good example of that. He painted her in 1948 for the Archibald. It is a magnificent painting of her. It is a voluptuous painting. She is dressed in an old wedding dress. It is one of Dobells greatest paintings and one of the greatest Australian paintings and portraits. It was a very controversial painting, as many of Dobells portraits were described. It was criticised for being more of a caricature than a portrait but, when you compare it to his painting of Menzies or his portrait of Dame Mary Gilmore or even that rather devilish portrait he did of Brian Penton, the great Daily Telegraph editor, the one of Margaret Olley was certainly not a caricature. Nonetheless, it was controversial and that always helps the traffic at the Archibald and so every director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales wants to have a controversial winner because that gets the people through the doors. It certainly did so in 1948.But she was painted then as a young woman of 25, a beautiful, young artist by a great artist, a much older man, one of the greats of our art history and our artistic landscape. Then 63 years later she was painted again by a very young artist, Ben Quilty. She had those two paintings book ending, as it were, 63 years of her 88 years of life—the painting of the beautiful young woman and the painting of the old lady who is not frail, not beaten down and not disillusioned but still full of life and with every year of that life and experience in her face. It is a remarkable thing for her to be described with those two artistic bookends at either end of her life.She was also extraordinarily generous, and other members have spoken about this. I would not say she was a very wealthy woman but she was a financially successful woman not simply because of her artistic work but because she was actually a very shrewd property investor. She was able to accumulate quite a lot of real estate at different times and the wealth that she accumulated in very large measure she shared with the people of New South Wales largely through gifting paintings or assisting with the purchase of paintings by the Art Gallery of New South Wales, notably the works of Degas that the art gallery holds. And she donated many of her own works. She could be pretty scathing about other peoples paintings when she did not like them. Some years ago, honourable members may recall, Edmund Capon was extremely proud to have acquired a triptych, that is to say three paintings, by the American artist Cy Twombly, who painted a lot on classical themes. There are three pictures which have representations of what appear to be ancient galleys. He called it Three studies from the Temeraire, reflecting on the great painting of Turner, The Fighting Téméraire, where the Téméraire is being dragged off as night falls to be broken up. Edmund was incredibly proud of this. I recall that the Art Gallery of New South Wales spent $4½ million dollars or thereabouts on it, so it was a big deal and a great triumph for the gallery. Margaret was not very positive about it and, indeed, described it to Clive James as being three parts of nothingness. To Barry Humphries she was even harsher. She looked at it and said to him, Theres nobody at home. I thought that was pretty tough, but it gives you a feeling of her bluntness and her candour.We should all celebrate Margaret Olley. The wonderful thing about her life, for her, is that she lived it right through to the very end. How many of us would live to be 88 and be as alert at 88 as we were when we were 28, be working right down to the end and die, effectively in mid-brushstroke, just as we were still working on a painting? There were no years fading away in a nursing home for her, no years of frail dependence on others. Always independent, always at work, always alive, right up to the end, and then the curtain came down and she left our world—but left us an extraordinary collection of work and the memory of an extraordinary woman.I will quote some remarks that Barry Humphries, who was a very good friend of Margaret Olleys, wrote in his memoir of her. They very touching. He talks about seeing her only a few weeks before she died. She used to go and stay in his apartment and paint, because there is a beautiful view from his apartment in Sydney. He writes:I spent a long time with her on that last visit and most of her talk was about the importance of finishing that last big painting and her concern, too, for troubled friends. She had found what so few of us have been able to discover: the antidote to depression is concern for others. Last Monday night she slept, the panoramic painting of Sydney Harbour at last completed, and at some time in the early morning, Death surprised her.I do not know whether death surprised Margaret Ollie or indeed that anything could surprise her, but when death came to take her, they took her as full of life as she had been when William Dobell painted her, working right to the end—a great Australian never to be forgotten and so eloquently remembered by honourable members who have spoken before me. All of us in this parliament thank her for her work. We honour her. We say, We salute you and we farewell you—ave atque vale.","Olley, Ms Margaret Hannah, AC","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TURNBULL (Wentworth) ","(18:39):"

I last saw Margaret Olley at the opening of the National Gallery of Australias new wing—the wing that houses our Indigenous art collection. She was there as an honoured leader in Australian cultural life but also as a great philanthropist and because of her own work as an artist. She had been a great friend to that national collection, quite apart from what the member for Wentworth talked about in terms of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. She was an artist, a philanthropist, a passionate advocate for the arts and a fantastic mentor to young people coming through. She was all of that because she believed in the importance of the arts and its expressive content and believed in conveying the importance of it to younger people. She encouraged them to also be their best.Last week we had the meeting of cultural ministers in Sydney. We were at the Art Gallery of New South Wales with Edmund Capon—the director for so many years and soon to retire. He was as effusive as ever, still talking about projects that are going to be undertaken well beyond his retirement. He was also a very close friend of Margaret. We spoke about her, but he was interested in showing us around. We had an opportunity to view the gallery with the other ministers. He took great pride in identifying the gifts to the gallery that Margaret had made. Reminiscing about her, he told the story that the member for Wentworth told about her criticism of what Edmund thought was one of his greatest acquisitions.She was dedicated to her creativity and her craft. It led to a body of work which has engaged and enriched Australians in private and public collections. Her friends were with her as she worked to her last days to capture her vision of Sydney Harbour—a landscape on canvas. It was the legacy that she was so determined to complete. Those who were at the gallery told stories about a woman who was also generous in her donations to Australian galleries; a woman who delighted in helping local audiences access great international work. Her generosity to the National Gallery of Australia, the great collection that we house there—and I am going to a function tonight, along with other members of parliament, to see the Fred Williams collection—tells the story of her diversity and spread of interests. There are 15th and 17th century architectural pieces, including Indian marble carvings from the Moghul era, a beautiful Degas drawing and a number of works by prominent Australian artists.In her youth she was one of a new generation of Australian artists growing in confidence about their role in developing a strong Australian presence in the visual arts. It was an important and exciting time in Australian cultural life. She was great friends with the likes of William Dobell, Russell Drysdale, Donald Friend and Jeffrey Smart. Margaret has left another legacy to Australia because of her unstinting record in helping younger artists. In recent years she supported and encouraged a new generation of creative Australians with a frank and wise approach as a mentor.Just this year, her portrait by Ben Quilty won the Archibald Prize, six decades after William Dobell won in 1948 with an earlier portrait of her. It says a lot about her longevity, her inspiration and the quality of the artists who sought to depict her. As Ben Quilty said: Shes such an inspiration. He also said that she was a feminist ahead of her time. He described her as vigorously passionate about social and political issues as well as art, and enormously compassionate. He said Margaret had an infectious attitude to both life and death. Quilty noted how many new works she had on the go. He said Margaret came up with a powerful metaphor to explain her work:Im like an old tree dying and setting forth flowers as fast as it can, while it still can.These are the words of a tenacious, passionate woman dedicated to making use of her talent right till the very end. Quilty met Margaret Olley when she was a guest judge for the 2002 Brett Whiteley Travelling Art Scholarship, which he won. She was a friend and a great supporter of his work from then on.Born in Lismore in 1923, Margaret Olley was awarded the Order of Australia in 1991 for service as an artist and to the promotion of art. In 1996 she was awarded the Companion of the Order of Australia. I am told that she was also a good businesswoman, which allowed her to become a philanthropist on a significant scale. I might also note, in relation to her birthplace of Lismore, that she was an active benefactor and supporter of the extensions to the gallery in Lismore. So many of our artists come from the regional parts of Australia, and they do not forget their roots. Whilst the whole of the country can view on a regular basis great collections that Margaret Olley has contributed to in Canberra and in Sydney, it was also important for her to continue to inspire in the place that she was born.Margaret deserves every accolade that can be directed towards her. She got every award and deserved every one that she received. I have said before that a creative nation develops a more tolerant, more expressive and better citizenry, but it also underpins ultimately a more productive nation because it inspires, it develops innovation and it creates those linkages which are such an important reason that Australia performs so well on so many fronts.Margaret Olley embodied this. She understood the importance of her talent, and she chose to keep working and expressing that right to her dying days, but she also understood the importance of putting back to the community that had given her opportunity and putting back to the future generations of artists that will continue to promote the legacy of which she has been such a proud standard bearer. She will be sadly missed, but her works and her inspiration will live on forever.","Olley, Ms Margaret Hannah, AC","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CREAN (Hotham—Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) ","(18:49):"

423,0,0,0,1,2,"McCormack, Michael, MP",219646,"Riverina","Nats","N/A",8510," At 9.15 on the night of Monday, 25 July 2011, a statement was issued to all members of the federal parliamentary press gallery advising them:Our longest-serving and much-loved colleague, Rob Chalmers, is very, very ill and has decided to reluctantly retire after 60 years of insightful and independent political commentary and scrutiny.The following Wednesday, 27 July 2011, Robin Donald Chalmers passed away aged 82, surrounded by his loving wife, Gloria, and his children. From his first question time in March 1951, with the Daily Mirror, to his last budget lock-in in May this year, his efforts spanned an unprecedented 60 years. From Sir Robert Menzies to Julia Gillard, Rob Chalmers was a wise and determined presence in the press gallery and his knowledge and passion for all things political was renowned. When he began his career in journalism, typewriters and copy boys were in use, then came facsimile machines, the first mobile telephones, computers and the internet and email. What a transformation in telecommunications. A dedicated journalist to the end, Mr Chalmers death marked the end of an era.Rob Chalmers had a remarkable work ethic. Just days before his death he was still working on the upcoming newsletter, Inside Canberra, where as the editor he finished off his final copy only just missing out on seeing it in the final print hours before he died. The life of a journalist and editor is not an easy one, and I know all about that. It is a tough game with high public expectations, as you would expect, and intense deadline pressures and the need to be accurate, balanced and fair. As with any job there are good and bad aspects; character is tested each and every working day of what is more a way of life than a career.To remain on the scene for more than 60 years as Mr Chalmers did is no mean feat. Mr Chalmers was an inspiration to not just journalists but to all who worked within these political walls. It is not an easy job and it is not easy to maintain such dedication and passion in an ever-changing environment. He carried out his work with aplomb and with a certain sense of presence, and I am told the gallery will miss Robs determined shuffle along the corridor and his astute observations and wisdom. Rob was an old-fashioned journo to the core—shrewd, independent, authoritative. He represented the best of hardnosed press gallery journalism in this country. He had, as they say in the industry, ink running in his veins. He was happy to pass on advice and taught some of the very best, yet few will be able to match his array of knowledge on the very topics he loved the most—policy, politics and new ideas.As a fellow journalist by trade I pay my respects following the loss of a great writer and tutor, and as a parliamentarian I mourn the loss of a fine journalist who faithfully filed the news for an appreciative readership. To his wife Gloria, son Rob and daughter Susan I offer my deepest condolences. May he rest in peace.","Chalmers, Mr Robin Donald","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr McCORMACK (Riverina) ","(18:59):"
424,0,0,0,1,2,"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",30540,"Canberra","ALP","N/A",8511," As a former director of the National Press Club board and as the member for Canberra, which is home to many journalists and lobbyists, I rise today to echo the words of the Prime Minister in honouring the life and work of Rob Chalmers, who died, as the member for Riverina said, in late July at the age of 82. His death is a great loss to the corporate knowledge of this place and to the sense of history he brought to the press gallery and to the political life of Australia.Robin Donald Chalmers was born on 14 July 1929 in Sydney to his parents Robin and Janet. He came to the press gallery in 1951, to the so-called provisional building just down the road. As anyone who has visited that old building will know—I strongly encourage all members to take a tour of Old Parliament House if they have not already done so—the place is very cramped and the conditions in the press gallery were very tight indeed. In fact, some journalists camped out on the roof waiting for the next press conference or to type up their notes, it got that tight.Rob worked in Canberra for 60 years, more than half of this nations political history since Federation. Most notably he worked on his publication Inside Canberra, surviving 12 prime ministers—Menzies, Holt, McEwen, Gorton, McMahon, Whitlam, Fraser, Hawke, Keating, Howard, Rudd and now Julia Gillard. I understand that throughout that time he gingered all of them and was very vocal in his views on them, and according to one of my oracles here in Canberra, a Labor Party historian but also an oracle on Canberra history as well, Don Dwyer, none of them ever met his very high expectations. He was a very demanding man of very high standards, obviously. I believe Rob attended close to 60 budget lock-ups, from Fadden in 1951 to the latest one in May this year, and he witnessed 28 federal election campaigns and five changes of government. I cannot imagine what it must have been like to go toe to toe with such legends of the Australian political establishment, but Rob Chalmers did it. He came into the game of politics and political journalism at a vastly different time—a dramatically different time to today—a time when print and radio dominated the reporting of the days events. He witnessed the introduction of television, the 24-hour news cycle, the internet and the daily use of the social media of Twitter and Facebook. The world of 1951 was vastly different to the one we see now, 60 years on. Despite the massive changes to how news was reported over that time and is reported today, throughout this he not only kept up and maintained his relevance but continued to be a leader in the press gallery.I understand he was a great mentor to many a young and not-so-young cadet journalist in this place. He was a very strong supporter of my husband, particularly when he started on AM in the press gallery six or seven years ago. Every time Chris had done a report on AM, Rob would come up and give him a critique of what that piece was like. I understand it was very constructive and productive. He was very good at mentoring journalists and sharing the wisdom of all his years and all his experience and, in the end, I think, making them better journalists.I have been interested to read some of the anecdotes in recent weeks about this remarkable man. I think it is a remarkable thing that one man could collect and collate—indeed, in many ways be the embodiment of—our proud political history. I think any politician, staffer or journalist will agree that this place can be a pretty gruelling one at times. The stresses of public life and tight deadlines and of getting the right words out all can take their toll. To do it for 60 years is an absolutely extraordinary achievement.He contributed to this town in other ways as well. He was President of the National Press Club. Having been a director on that board, I know that it can be challenging at times—a roomful of journalists making decisions on financial matters can always be a challenge. He was a very proud member of the Royal Canberra Golf Club. He was also a great contributor to what parts of Canberra used to be renowned for, particularly the press gallery: the long lunch club, which used to involve a lot of journalists and senior people in the Public Service. Those lunches were always on Friday and tended to go from 12.30. The piece would be written and everyone would head off for the long lunch at the Commonwealth Club, the golf club or wherever. They were always interesting affairs and there was never any wine drunk!He was also a strong supporter of Australian industry. Because of that, some suggest that he erred on the protectionist side and so was not entirely thrilled with some of the initiatives and reforms that the Hawke-Keating government introduced over the eighties to get us to the open economy that we see has ensured our prosperity today.He was an Aussie of the old school, according to people I have been speaking to in researching todays speech on this condolence motion. He was popular and friendly. His presence, his stories and his gravitas will be sorely missed by all in this place and by many, many Canberrans. He was sent off in grand style with a formal funeral service at Queanbeyan, but the informal farewell, at the Press Club, was equally impressive, I understand, and the stories were pretty wild and pretty ripe.In farewelling Rob Chalmers, I offer my condolences and the condolences of all Canberrans to his family. As people have said to me, he was an Aussie of the old school. He was popular and friendly. He gave a great deal to journalism in this country. He gave a great deal to political life in this country. We honour and thank him for that.","Chalmers, Mr Robin Donald","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) ","(19:02):"

We spend a lot of time together here and yet we often come to realise that we know so little about one another outside this place.So it was with Rob Chalmers and me. I came here in 1996. After I became a shadow minister in 1998 I had portfolio responsibilities that were of interest to Rob Chalmers. On this basis I got to know Rob Chalmers very well, in a professional sense at least.Reflecting again on the nature of the place, I am very sad now that Rob Chalmers was in a nursing home. I did not know it and I am very sad that I was not able to be here for his farewell. Certainly, I would have visited him if I had known how unwell he was in his last days.Rob Chalmers was obviously an extraordinary person. Anyone who achieves so many years in the press gallery of the national parliament is an achiever. I read some of his last works and he was obviously still very sharp.He had a very strong interest in trade and industry policy. I suppose it is true that he was of the old school, but very consistent. He took his ideals and views about trade and industry policy to every issue of the day. He was most consistent and always advocated on matters on the basis of those ideals and principles.It is hard to imagine what it must be like to have been here for so long and seen so many members, prime ministers and treasurers come and go. Reflecting again on my earlier statements I regret now not to have found some time somewhere to have a meal or a few beers with Rob Chalmers, because he must have been a repository of some fantastic stories about this place, both the official and the unofficial sides of the place. So I have come to this condolence motion with lots of regrets.I am very happy to have known Rob Chalmers and to have had many policy discussions with him. And of course I am very happy to have been the subject of some of his stories—positive stories, I am happy to say. I very much regret that I did not get to know Rob Chalmers, the person, better and I very much regret I did not spend more time with him in a more social sense. I am sure that if I had I would be a better politician today, because I know that I could have learnt much from him both from his knowledge and his experience. I often say that I still learn every day I am in this job, and it is true. I have been here for 15 years. You would learn a lot from someone who has been here for 60 years, and I am sure I am not the only one who holds that view.So, I join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and all members who have participated in this debate in saying that he will be sadly missed. I acknowledge his amazing contribution to public life in this country and therefore his marvellous contribution to his nation.","Chalmers, Mr Robin Donald","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"
428,0,0,0,1,2,"Melham, Daryl, MP","4T4","Banks","ALP","N/A",8513," I have been in this place for almost 21½ years and in that time I have interacted with many journalists, past and present. I can honestly say that you could number on my left hand the number of journalists that I would be prepared to speak about in a condolence motion. Rob Chalmers is one of them. I found him to be a good person. I found him to be a decent person. I found him to be a very ethical person. And I liked him. All my interactions with him were interactions where he sought to check the facts in relation to something he was writing. He was one of those old-style journalists that actually believed in checking the facts before writing. He was about trying to achieve accuracy in what he was writing, because he understood the impact once he wrote and the publishing of what he wrote. That is not true of many in the gallery today due to the deadlines and sometimes the views that they have which, frankly, they do not want to change—which may if they chased up other sources in relation to their writing or what they put to air.Rob Chalmers was old school and he had, I suppose, a charm about him—and that is why I liked him. In many respects, he had a values system in terms of ethics and what it meant to be a journalist and the high responsibility involved with being a journalist. You only have to look at what is coming out of the UK at the moment to see the lengths that people are going to to get stories and how that is rocking the system. That was not Rob Chalmers.Rob was also so respectful of people in positions. Be they the Prime Minister of the day, the ministers of the day, the Leader of the Opposition or members of parliament, he understood the need to respect that people occupied positions and that in many respects most people are here to do good.So I want to be associated with all that has been said to date on the condolence motion and pay my respect to Rob and offer my sincere condolences to members of his family. He is going to be missed. The reality is that he was different from all his colleagues—and that is because he was here for some 60 years. He had a corporate memory and an understanding. We all think that everything that is happening around us is new and has not happened before. The truth is that in some respects it is groundhog day. Rob was able to recount to me stories in relation to Menzies, Chifley and others and incidents that occurred back then. In my life I have always respected older people and people like Rob Chalmers who have a values system and are happy to talk not in an aggressive way but in a way that is not putting you down—in a respectful way. With Robs passing this place has experienced a loss—a big loss—because I do not think we will see the likes of him again.","Chalmers, Mr Robin Donald","CONDOLENCES","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr MELHAM (Banks) ","(19:14):"
429,0,0,0,1,2,"McCormack, Michael, MP",219646,"Riverina","Nats","N/A",8514," Not since Australia II won the Americas Cup in 1983 has there been so much hype and excitement over an Australian sporting win on the international stage. Many Australians all over the world sat glued to their social media outlets to track Cadel Evans on his path to Tour de France glory. As a nation we are used to winning; it is something we do very well for a country of our size. Losing generally is not an option. The Tour de France was, however, a sporting achievement yet to be accomplished by an Australian. Put on a pedestal with the likes of cricketer Sir Donald Bradman, tennis ace Evonne Goolagong Cawley and swimmer Ian Thorpe, Cadel Evans has successfully put Australians ahead of the game in yet another global sporting triumph.Over a gruelling three weeks cycling more than 3,600 kilometres through the Pyrenees, Cadel crossed the line wearing the yellow jersey in Grenoble to become the first-ever Australian to do so. The final ride into Paris was one of excitement and joy not only for Cadel, his team and his family but also for a nation which wanted him to succeed so badly and finally fulfil his dream of winning, arguably, the worlds most arduous and toughest sporting event. After being runner-up in the 2007 and 2008 editions of the Tour de France, Evans 2011 triumph is a massive moment for the sport in Australia. The victory makes the 34 year old the oldest winner of the tour in the 88 years since Frenchman Henri Pelissier finished on top in 1923. Such has been the dominance of Europeans at the tour, Evans is only the third champion to have come from outside the continents clutches. Paving the way for future Australian wins, Cadel has been described as the inspiration to the next generation of Australian cyclists to match his mighty feats. If it is anything to go by, Australians do not like to hand back their trophies. Once the title is in our country, we like it to stay here.Since Cadels win in July cycling clubs have been popping up all over the country. The love for one of the original modes of transport is taking over the streets. Many fine cyclists hail from my home town of Wagga Wagga: Paul Fellows, junior world individual bronze medallist in South Africa in 2008; Jamie Green, who won silver in the team sprint at the junior world championships in Italy in 2010, and Max Housden, the current national team sprint champion—all outstanding track riders. Road racers Josh Collingwood, Bill Robertson and Ashley Humbert will also be inspired by Cadels feat. It will be especially significant for Collingwood, who in 1995 was junior world champion, Cadel finishing third in that particular event. For long time Wagga Wagga cycling coaches Barry OHagan and Bob Robertson, Cadels win raises the profile of the sport they love and to which they have dedicated much of their spare time. The whole cycling community comes to a standstill during the staging of the Tour de France.My electorate has its own version, the Tour de Riverina. This local race is a series of events held throughout my region bringing together some of the areas best and providing motivation and recognition for all competitors across the wonderful backdrop of the landscape that is the Riverina. Now in its ninth year, the Tour de Riverina has resulted in some exciting finishes, particularly those coincidentally in 2007 and 2008, when Cadel Evans went so close to winning the great French classic. Sport crosses all cultural, religious, age, gender and ethnic boundaries. It brings us together. Cadel Evans Tour de France victory certainly united a nation. Well done to him.","Evans, Mr Cadel","STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr McCORMACK (Riverina) ","(19:18):"
430,0,0,0,1,2,"Husic, Ed, MP",91219,"Chifley","ALP","N/A",8515," In 1914, with the world on the brink of war, a Victorian named Don Kirkham teamed up with a friend, Ivan Snowy Munro, to take the then very arduous task of travelling to Europe. But this was no ordinary trip: Kirkham and Snowy were the first-ever English-speaking competitors in one of the worlds great sporting events, the Tour de France. From 143 starters in that years race, only 54 finished, with Kirkham and Munro claiming 17th and 20th respectively. Not long after, the legendary Sir Hubert Opperman made the same journey, with Oppy riding in 1928 to finish 12th and again in 1931, when he crossed the line in 18th position.Those men inspired generations of cyclists. Fast-forward 50 years to Phil Anderson, known as Skippy in Europe, who became the first non-European to wear the leaders yellow jersey along the road in France. And fast-forward again to 2011, to last month, when a Victorian, born in the Northern Territory, became a national sporting hero and created worldwide headlines.For the thousands that watched bleary-eyed on TV screens across the country through to the thousands that turned out in Melbourne last week to welcome Cadel Evans home, and the many who watched into the small hours, Cadel represents more than a wonderful Australian sporting victory. His win reached out to anyone who takes even a passing interest in bikes: from our phenomenally successful Cycling Australia elite athletes, to weekend warriors and kids on training wheels getting a push along down the driveway from mum or dad.Cadels win represented a number of milestones. Not only did he become the first Australian to win the tour, at 34 he was the oldest winner of the race in 88 years, something that may give my colleagues the members for Oxley and Parramatta—and perhaps even the Leader of the Opposition—something to aspire to. For those who saw those crucial stages of the race itself, sport doesnt get much more gripping—in the mountains, desperately hanging on under a fierce attack from his competitors, and then, in that final time trial, a picture of utter determination as, second by second, he wound back the lead of Andy Schleck. Then the final ride down the Champs Elysees, effectively a victory lap.There is a tradition in the Tour de France known as the lanterne rouge. Translated literally as the red lantern, it is the moniker given to the rider finishing last in the tour. It is the person who never hits the headlines but one who is just as courageous as the winner. He shines a light along the road in order to see the way ahead.For all the accolades Cadel has received, I am certain he would be the first to acknowledge that heroism stretches well beyond the peloton on the roads of France, and past the fields and courts on which our sporting idols ply their trade. To the everyday Australians carrying their own lanterne rouge, to the unsung heroes, champions from the fields of health, emergency services, law enforcement, environment and many more, Cadels win in so many ways represents your achievements, encapsulating those very Australian traits of hard work, tenacity, staying in the race and simply giving it a red hot go. No one could fail to be inspired by those efforts of Cadel and other Australians in other fields.Main Committee adjourned at 19:25N/AN/A","Evans, Mr Cadel","STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HUSIC (Chifley—Government Whip) ","(19:21):"

X-ray scanners were installed at most IDCs in 2006. The X-ray scanner at Christmas Island IDC was installed in 2007 and at Curtin IDC in 2011.An X-ray scanner will be installed at Scherger IDC in the near future.Alternative Places of Detention (APOD) do not have X-ray scanners as they are considered low-risk facilities. Goods entering APODs are manually inspected.(2) X-ray scanners are used to scan all items brought into IDCs. This includes items brought into the centre by staff and visitors, mail and commercial deliveries such as food.If items are too large to fit through the X-ray scanner they are manually inspected and scanned with a hand held metal detector.(3) Official protocols do exist to govern the use of X-ray scanners at detention facilities. These are:Ministerial Direction No. 20 – Powers concerning the entry of visitors to immigration detention centres (Attachment A) can be obtained from the House of Representatives Table Office.Ministerial Direction No. 26 – Screening procedures in relation to immigration detainees (Attachment B) can be obtained from the House of Representatives Table Office.Detention Services Manual, PAM 3 – Chapter 4 – Communication and visits – Screening and inspection powers: Entry to immigration detention centres (Attachment C) can be obtained from the House of Representatives Table Office.Detention Services Manual, PAM 3 – Chapter 8 – Safety and security – Screening of persons in immigration detention (Attachment D) can be obtained from the House of Representatives Table Office.","Immigration Detention Centres (Question No. 434)","QUESTIONS IN WRITING","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[2]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","N/A","N/A"

This responsibility lies with state and territory governments. The Department worked closely with state and territory authorities to ensure any issues concerning non-compliance with electrical standards are brought to their attention for appropriate action.(2) As part of standard program administration, the Department maintains records of the installer for each solar system installation funded under the Governments solar programs.(3) To have been considered eligible for a rebate under the Governments now closed Solar Homes and Communities Plan, solar panel installations must have met stringent safety standards including adherence to Australian Standards and all relevant Commonwealth, state, territory and local government laws and regulations. Program guidelines also required certification by the installer that the installation had met relevant standards, building codes and local council requirements and that they, as the installer, were accredited by the Clean Energy Council (CEC) to install solar panel systems.The responsibility for arranging installation and choosing a suitably qualified installer rested with the applicant. Contractual arrangements concerning the installation are made between the applicant and the installer. The Department has no involvement in this arrangement.(4) The Department has been advised that the Electrical Safety Office (Queensland) conducted inspections of solar installations at the Parkhaven Garden Retirement Village and shut down all systems found to have incorrectly wired DC circuit breakers. The Department has been advised that all systems found non-compliant due to incorrectly wired DC circuit breakers have now been rectified by a CEC accredited installer.(5) The Government is not responsible for electrical safety or the rectification of technical faults associated with installations of solar systems. Any issues concerning faulty parts or an incorrect or incomplete installation are reported to the appropriate state or territory authority and the CEC. If a satisfactory outcome is unable to be reached through these avenues, the householders remaining option is to engage an accredited installer, at their cost, to have the outstanding issues rectified.N/AN/A","Solar Homes and Communities Program (Question No. 438)","QUESTIONS IN WRITING","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[3]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","N/A","N/A"
