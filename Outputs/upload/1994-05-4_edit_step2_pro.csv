The petitioners note particularly that:Australia is one of the worlds oldest democraciesAustralia has led the world in many democratic reformsOur constitution, based on the Monarchy, has:ensured national independencemaintained national unity in a federationprovided constitutional stabilityprotected our liberties and freedomsYour petitioners therefore request that:Australia should remain a constitutional Monarchy with Her Majesty the Queen of Australia as our Head of State.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:The petition of the undersigned shows that:1.We are concerned that teenagers are able to leave home by obtaining young homeless rate benefits without adequate investigation.2.We believe that the flawed nature of the guidelines governing eligibility for young homeless rate benefits is in some circumstances encouraging family breakdown.3.With the number of young people receiving youth homeless rate benefits increasing by a factor of ten over the past six years, we consider that there are insufficient programs to help keep families together.Your Petitioners ask that the Senate should:Call on the Government to:(a) review the guidelines for young homeless rate benefits; and(b) show a greater commitment to programs which prevent family breakdown.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:The petition of the undersigned show:We the undersigned citizens respectfully submit that the current arrangements for federal road funding discriminate savagely against Victoria.The petitioners note particularly that:Victorians contribute about 27% of federal fuel excise revenuesMore than 27% of freight movements occur on Victorian roadsHowever, Victoria over the last decade has received less than 20% of total funds available. This means that major investment funds are not available to upgrade deficient roads and create an efficient road network.Your petitioners therefore request that:The Federal Government ensure that Victoria receives its fair share of funding for existing and proposed national highways—at least $220 million in the next financial year.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/petition.grp/proctext/interject/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The government has decided it wants to put the statement down in the House at 4.00 p.m., which seems to us to be sensible and reasonable.However, there is another side to the matter: the opposition has put down a matter of public importance today—a matter of grave public importance—and that is the governments failure to allow Australias small business sector to reach its potential and provide real and lasting jobs to Australias one million unemployed.The effect of the governments request would be to push that matter to a later hour of this day, which causes us real concern. What we have, therefore, suggested to the government as a sensible compromise is that the government allow us the hour for our matter of public concern to be dealt with out of government business time, that is, the last hour of the mornings business. The debate would, therefore, commence at a quarter to twelve and finish at a quarter to one.I understand that the Manager of Government Business is sympathetic to that request but needs to check the availability of the small business minister to answer the oppositions charge on this matter. Subject to that availability, I think I am right in saying that the government will accept our request in that regard. Senator Faulkner can respond to that. But if the government is prepared to be reasonable in this way, then certainly we would be reasonable, because we understand why the government would wish the paper to be put down at the same time in both chambers. All we ask for is a touch of cooperation from the government in this regard.Leave granted.","N/A","ORDER OF BUSINESS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech/interject[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I may propose later on in the day that we revisit this issue and look at the timing of the debate on the MPI.I accept that it would be preferred and, I believe, appropriate that we deal with the MPI in an uninterrupted debate, that is, an hours debate not interrupted by a ministerial statement.

Since the Act came into operation in 1977 a total of 57 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the Act.Mr President, the effect of this bill would be to bring within the Schedule to the Land Rights Act that area of land which is the subject of the Wampana Land Claim. The Northern Territory Government, the Central Land Council and Gambamora Industries Pty Ltd have entered into an agreement which settles that Land Claim. As part of that agreement the Northern Territory Government agreed to request the Commonwealth to exercise its powers under the Land Rights Act to grant the claim area to the traditional owners by scheduling that area under the Land Rights Act. The result of such scheduling would be that no further hearing or report by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner would then be necessary in order for the Aboriginal people concerned to be able to have the full rights of enjoyment of their traditional lands in fee simple.Mr President, the Government has the assurance of all parties to the negotiations that representative views of all Aboriginal people concerned have been obtained and their wishes taken into account.There are no financial implications arising from this bill.Mr PresidentI commend the bill to the Senate.DEFENCE FORCE (HOME LOANS ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1994This bill amends the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990, to enable the adjustment of interest rates applicable to the Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Scheme to remove an irregularity.The Scheme established under the Act provides for a subsidised loan of up to $40,000 to members or ex-members of the Australian Defence Force for a period related to their length of service. The loans are made available by the National Australia Bank. The Bank paid a franchise fee to the Commonwealth to provide loans under the Scheme.The subsidy to be paid on a loan in any month is equal to 40 per cent of the average monthly interest to be paid over the life of the loan, calculated on a 25 year period at the Benchmark Interest Rate applying for that month. Essentially, the Benchmark Interest Rate is assessed on a month-by-month basis and represents the lower of the rate offered by the National Australia Bank and the average of the rates offered by the five largest Australian banks. The method of calculating the Benchmark Interest Rate is prescribed in subclause 5.15 of the Agreement between the National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth, contained in Schedule 1 to the Act. Section 35 of the Act prohibits amendment of subclause 5.15.Subclause 5.15 is currently operating in a manner that was not originally envisaged and which is not desired either by the National Australia Bank or the Commonwealth. The irregularity has arisen because special low introductory rates for new loans with interest fixed for a period of 12 months or less were not contemplated when the Agreement was drawn up. The present wording of subclause 5.15 applies these introductory rates to all borrowers under the scheme, irrespective of whether they are new borrowers, and for as long as those rates are on public offer. These special introductory rates are significantly lower than the Banks majority interest rate which previously would have applied. For example, from August 1993 to April 1994 the Banks introductory rate was 5 per cent compared to the majority rate of 9.5 per cent, and from April, 6.95 per cent compared to 8.75 per cent.This irregularity will occur whenever a special introductory rate is offered by the National Australia Bank. This results in a reduction of interest charges to customers and interest receipts by the Bank, and a reduction in Commonwealth subsidy payment for each month that the lower interest rate applies. Potentially, continuation of the present situation would result in the Commonwealth receiving windfall savings of up to $400,000 in a full year, depending on the particular interest rates that apply at the time.The National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth have agreed that subclause 5.15 of the Agreement should be amended so that borrowers under the Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Scheme have the benefit of the special introductory loan interest rates under the same conditions that they are available to the public. That is, the special rates would apply only for new borrowers and for the period that those rates are normally available to the public. Compared with applying the Banks majority rate to all borrowers, the saving to the Commonwealth would be about $100,000 a year.To enable the changes to be made, section 35 of the Act will have to be amended to remove the prohibition on amending subclause 5.15 of the Agreement. The bill achieves this by removing the reference to Subclause 5.15 from section 35. I would like to stress that the proposed amendment of the Agreement, as outlined, will still be subject to clause 20 of the Agreement, which provides that any amendment to the Agreement will have no effect unless it is confirmed in writing by the National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth.I commend the bill to the Senate. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL 1994This bill proposes amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to incorporate in that Act two Excise Tariff Proposals that have been previously tabled in the Parliament.Excise Tariff Proposal No. 2 of 1993 proposed a reduction in the excise duty payable in respect of gasoline for use in aircraft, or avgas, and Excise Tariff Proposal No. 3 of 1993 proposed an increase in the excise duty payable in respect of avgas and kerosene for use in aircraft, or avtur.AvgasClause 3 of the bill proposes a decrease in the excise duty payable in respect of avgas from $0.25456 per litre to $0.22443 per litre, a reduction of 3.013 cents per litre. This reduction is effective from 1 July 1993. This decrease results from three sources. The first is from the final stage of the Governments program of transferring Commonwealth owned aerodromes to full local ownership and encouraging owners of local ownership plan aerodromes to accept full financial responsibility for their aerodromes. The second is the result of changes in cost recovery arrangements for the provision of firefighting services by the Civil Aviation Authority, or CAA. The third is the result of changes in cost recovery arrangements by the CAA in respect of the provision of meteorological services by the Bureau of Meteorology. Both the firefighting and meteorological services will now be directly charged to aircraft operators.The cost savings from these sources result in a corresponding reduction in the proportion of excise duty used to fund the aerodromes and the firefighting and meteorological services. This reduction in funding is then passed on to the aviation industry in the form of a decrease in the rate of excise duty payable on avgas. A decrease of 1.013 cents per litre is attributable to the aerodrome transfer program and the remaining 2 cents per litre reduction is attributable to the CAA in respect of firefighting and meteorological services.Clause 4 of the bill proposes an increase in the excise duty payable on avgas to $0.22999 per litre, an increase of 0.264 cents per litre. This increase was announced in the 1993 Federal Budget and is effective from 1 September 1993. The purpose of the increase is to enable the CAA to recover part of the costs of aviation safety regulation from the aviation industry and is the first stage in a program to phase in recovery of the industrys contribution to these costs.AvturClause 4 of the bill also proposes imposing an excise duty of 0.264 cents per litre on avtur. This change was also announced in the Federal Budget. This imposition of excise duty on a product previously free of duty is to enable the CAA to recover part of the costs of aviation safety regulation from the aviation industry and is in conjunction with the proposed increase in avgas.Financial Impact StatementAvgasThe reduction of 1.013 cents per litre in respect of the transfer of ownership of aerodromes program will result in a reduction of revenue of $1 million in 1993-94 and $1 million in 1994-95.The combined decrease of 2 cents per litre from the changes in the CAAs cost recovery arrangements in relation to firefighting services and meteorological services is balanced by an equivalent decrease in moneys appropriated to the CAA. The financial impact is neutral.The increase of 0.264 cents per litre is balanced by an equivalent increase in the moneys appropriated to the CAA. The financial impact is neutral.AvturThe imposition of 0.264 cents per litre is balanced by an equivalent increase in moneys appropriated to the CAA. The financial impact is neutral.I commend the bill to the Senate and present its explanatory memorandum.Debate (on motion by Senator Reid ) adjourned.Motion (by Senator Faulkner ) agreed to:That the bills be listed on the Notice Paper as separate orders of the day.","N/A","ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 DEFENCE FORCE (HOME LOANS ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1994 EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

83,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CHAMARETTE","SN5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A",150,"—I was caught in mid-flow yesterday when we adjourned the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill for another matter. I would like now to continue my remarks. I had already stated the Greens (WA) support of opposition amendments 3 and 4 and I had begun to recount our position in relation to the amendments and this legislation. The Greens do not support the principles underlying this legislation for reasons I will presently outline, which are also reasons for supporting these amendments. Nevertheless, we are voting on the amendments as a way of improving the bill from our point of view, as we understand it will be passed with majority support.Our concerns relate to the fact that this bill gives powers to the Health Insurance Corporation to investigate frauds arising under the Medicare scheme, and removes that responsibility for the investigations which currently lies with the Australian Federal Police. The rationale for this move is that the Australian Federal Police have not been interested in or, possibly, capable of investigating frauds in this area.A number of criticisms of the bill with potential for infringement of civil liberties have been either met or are covered by amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats, which is why the Greens are in support of all the amendments put up by the Democrats. However, there is also the question of whether police powers should be granted to persons outside the police. The danger with a number of organisations having police powers is that it is more difficult to ensure that adequate control is exercised over them. For this reason, we believe that the requirement to have a search warrant in order for the HIC to enter premises without permission of the occupier is a reasonable one. We therefore support the amendments.","N/A","HEALTH LEGISLATION (POWERS OF INVESTIGATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
84,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator LEES","8U4","(South Australia-","AD","Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats)",151,"—I acknowledge the concerns of the Greens (WA) with the entire Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill 1993, but I bring to Senator Chamarettes attention the fact that this bill is supported by the medical profession—the AMA, the Doctors Reform Society and a wide range of medical groups—and, if anyone were going to be concerned about some of the issues she has raised, I believe it would be longstanding associations such as these.I note a fax I received last night from David Kindon of the Australian Association of Pathology Practices also stressing that this bill is needed. Indeed, he says that these amendments are effectively undoing what has to be done if we are to crack down on the illegal practices currently going on in pathology. It will make it extremely difficult for the entire profession as he believes that, if those illegal practices cannot be stemmed, all practices will be worse off. The government will step in and say, `We are spending too much money on pathology, and it will make an across-the-board cut in incomes for all pathologists. This will further disadvantage those people who are doing the right thing and will do absolutely nothing to crack down on the unlicensed centres that are operating.One of the reasons those search powers will be so useful is that the hundreds of unlicensed centres—the Australian Association of Pathology Practices Inc. has the belief that there are indeed hundreds of these centres—cannot be checked up on or spot checked. The likelihood of getting search warrants in all those cases is not only very difficult but probably so time consuming that it simply will not be effective. If these amendments go through, we simply will not be able to crack down on some of the rorts that have been documented.","N/A","HEALTH LEGISLATION (POWERS OF INVESTIGATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
85,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator NEWMAN","BE4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",151,"—I have been interested to hear the comments of both Senator Chamarette and Senator Lees. My concern is with the facts to which Senator Lees has just referred and which have come from Dr Kindon. My experience with legislation of this kind is that doctors are good at doctoring and lawyers have perhaps a better understanding of civil liberties issues. With this particular piece of legislation, for example, it was not until the opposition looked carefully at this bill and alerted the medical organisations to some of the hidden difficulties that they started to realise that the rights of both their practitioners and their patients could be in jeopardy under the bill as originally printed.We alerted them to the concerns which we had. They then took the bill to legal advisers, and they were advised that our concerns were reasonable and that there was a need for improving this act. While we all support the purpose of the act, there are genuine concerns as to civil liberties. The privacy issues have been addressed. It remains to be seen in practice whether they are adequately addressed, but it appears on the surface that those issues have been improved.However, we are concerned, as I said yesterday, that people are being given police authorities without the controls which the police in this land are subject to. We do not believe that we can rely on the doctors wish to clean up the fraud as being so overwhelming that civil rights concerns can be ignored. We are committed to cleaning up the fraud in the medical area, where it exists. In fact, the opposition has been keen, and expressed its views, on this issue long before this legislation came in. So there can be no way in which it could be suggested that we are soft on crime in connection with medical fraud. Nevertheless, I reiterate what I said yesterday: the end cannot justify unsatisfactory means. That is why we are so concerned to see that a search warrant should be obtained before such an entry takes place.","N/A","HEALTH LEGISLATION (POWERS OF INVESTIGATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
86,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COONEY","SF4","(Victoria)","ALP","N/A",152,"—I wish to say a few words about this issue. I have listened to the speeches from Senator Lees, Senator Chamarette and Senator Newman. I must confess that they put the argument very well. I am Chairman of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which looked at this bill. It detected matters that did go to the issue of civil liberties and to the issues of the sort of society that we want to live in. What has been said so far illustrates that.I think, though, that the Health Insurance Commission is in a difficult position. On the one hand, it is pressured to ensure that all crime is detected and suppressed. On the other hand, it is attacked because it goes too far. I think the problem arises from the pressures within society itself and the pressures which are reflected here. It is a good thing, as Senator Newman said, to raise these issues of civil liberties, not so much directed against the Health Insurance Commission but directed to the society we live in.What we are really saying to the people we represent who are listening to us today is this: what do they think is the right balance between these things? It is my view in regard to a lot of the legislation coming through at the moment that the balance is going too far in the direction of detection. If we wanted to bug every bedroom, if we wanted to examine every household, there is no doubt we could suppress a lot of crime, but at what cost? In a recent case the High Court said that evidence that was obtained in an unsatisfactory manner, where peoples privacy was attacked too much, should not be accepted. I think this debate has been a very important one. Therefore, I wanted to take part in it.","N/A","HEALTH LEGISLATION (POWERS OF INVESTIGATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I would like to make it clear that we are addressing opposition amendments Nos 3 and 4. These are totally unacceptable to the government. Effectively, they would gut this legislation which is a very important tier in the process of pursuing possible evidence of fraud. That is essentially what this legislation is about. It is also legislation that is trying to find the best balance between the civil liberties of the people who may be under investigation—essentially, medical practitioners, pathologists and pharmacists—and the civil liberties of citizens who, as we know, are being denied lots and lots of taxpayers dollars through the fraud that is happening.An important point, in picking up and trying to deal with the issue raised by Senator Newman—which I believe was dealt with very appropriately by Senator Lees—is that it must be understood this is a level of investigation that falls short of what is a warrantable search.","N/A","HEALTH LEGISLATION (POWERS OF INVESTIGATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

It is only a belief or a suspicion that there might be one. Also, as Senator Lees argued so well, in regard to many of the things that will be brought to the Health Insurance Commissions attention when somebody, for whatever reason, says,`I wonder about what is happening there, there is a case management committee level. A reference from that case management committee goes to the managing director. Permission has to be signed to go and look. So it is not as though people are rushing in willy-nilly; it is a thoughtful approach which asks for some powers to go and look. I say to Senator Newman that it is an inspection for compliance; it is not a forceful entry or a seizure of evidence.In order to reassure Senator Lees, who asked for reassurance that at this stage patients records may not be investigated, I can certainly give her that absolute assurance. I remind Senator Newman again that this is a balance that has been discussed at length during the committee inquiry, although I understand she was not persuaded by the arguments there. It is a balance that meets the needs of a significant part of the medical profession, the pharmaceutical people and the pathologists; people whose concerns were being taken into account when this legislation was first brought into this place and then referred to the committee, including the AMA, the Australian Association of Pathology Practices, the Australian Association of General Practitioners, the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, and others. These people, who know exactly what it means, are not unhappy with it.","N/A","HEALTH LEGISLATION (POWERS OF INVESTIGATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

93,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CROWLEY","ZF4","(South Australia-","ALP","Minister for Family Services)",152,"—That does not mean very much. That does not mean to suggest, nor is Senator Newman suggesting, that they are still in ignorance. Is Senator Newman suggesting that the whole medical profession is still in ignorance? That is a rather brave assertion. Maybe Hansard will be interested to make sure that all of these organisations get a copy of that, because they have had the assistance of going through the Senate committee inquiry, they have had the assistance of legal advice and they have also had a hand in seeing these amendments.These amendments take account of their concerns. I do not believe they will be approved by these organisations in ignorance. That is a very dangerous kind of claim for Senator Newman to make. I again remind her that this is an inspection for compliance; it is not forceful entry, and it is not for seizure of evidence. Quite properly, seizure of evidence needs a warrant, but this section is not for that purpose.There are lots of other examples of similar kinds of warrantless entry and search or inspection powers in different acts. For example, the New South Wales Medical Practice Act 1992 enables an authorised person to investigate complaints. An authorised person under the National Health Act 1953 can do the same to verify accounting records. An authorised person under the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974 can do the same to verify accounting records. Under the Ozone Protection Act 1989, an inspector can do the same to ascertain compliance; that is, have entry and search or inspection powers without a warrant.An authorised person under the civil aviation regulations can do the same to ascertain compliance. An inspector under the Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981 can ascertain compliance. An inspector of the ACT Weights and Measures Ordinance Act 1929 can also ascertain compliance. This is not unprecedented. It is in line with a lot of other areas where, by way of being reasonable and precisely to take account of civil liberties, these kinds of powers are provided to people.Senator Newman argues that this power is not in line with civil liberties, but it is a question of whose civil liberties they are and what balance we are striking. We are concerned that civil liberties do not pertain only to the people under investigation. In exactly the same way, health inspectors can go into restaurants and delicatessens to protect the civil liberties of the people who may eat that food. So why is Senator Newman arguing that this case of inspection for compliance is somehow an invasion of civil liberties but it is not an invasion in all the other acts? I have not actually heard her say that civil liberties are not at risk in all the other acts, but I presume that as these bills have been passed, they are in existence and nobody is raising major complaints about them the balance has been struck on behalf of the civil liberties of all people—those under investigation and the broader community.As this power makes a very big impact in this whole process of pursuing fraud, I argue very strenuously that the points Senator Newman is making are not persuasive at all. This is a two-stage process of trying to ascertain whether there is an offence and then, if in the face of evidence there is, to move with the more powerful warrant, after approval is given for that warrant. Again, that is according to the other procedures for permission for that warrant being sought and approved.I think there is a very good balance here. I remind Senator Newman again that this is an inspection for compliance; it is not forceful entry and it is not seizure of evidence—two very critical matters for her reconsideration of this very important point. In the end, we know that medical fraud and pathology and pharmaceutical fraud do happen. It is very difficult to put an amount on it, but the next time she wants to ask what the government is doing about it she might have to be reminded that she is in danger of gutting the very legislation that might assist the taxpayers of this country to recover some of these dollars—or the Health Insurance Commission on their behalf.This is not legislation that people have rushed into. This is legislation that has been through very extensive discussion and redesign. The government has taken account of so many of the points raised. It has moved amendments that, as I understand the passage of this legislation so far, have been agreed to and accepted—all to try to strike that balance.Senator Newmans amendments, Nos 3 and 4, oppose essentially one-half of the heart of this legislation and will, in the end, very much hamstring the capacity of the government or the Health Insurance Commission to prevent that fraud and see that the civil liberties of citizens are held up with some kind of equality against very properly protecting the civil liberties of the people under investigation. So I strongly oppose Senator Newmans amendments and suggest that she rethink the arguments, in favour of the governments position.","N/A","HEALTH LEGISLATION (POWERS OF INVESTIGATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"
94,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CHAMARETTE","SN5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A",154,"—I want to challenge the ministers current explanation and say that I am not persuaded by those arguments. The compliance inspection analogy the minister makes sounds very plausible; however, there is a big difference. In this case that inspection can lead to very serious criminal charges. The minister stressed that that is the importance of conferring those powers. So it is very different from compliance inspection models.Secondly, I understand that there is no community support for police powers being extended to not require a search warrant when an inspection or a search is being made that may lead to criminal charges. What we are discussing here is giving powers that the police do not have to agencies that have not been trained to respect the rights of the individuals upon whom they may be intruding. Even in the case of police who are trained to respect those rights, we know that there are concerns about the way those powers are exercised. The principle here is very different from compliance inspection. In this case, powers that the police do not have are being extended to non-policing agencies.The concerns the minister addresses are real, but there are other alternatives. I believe that we ought not to give powers inappropriately to health insurance commissions; instead, we should work on the professional associations. The minister says that these associations support the principle underlying this particular legislation. They should be encouraged to promote within their professions voluntary permission for compliance inspections. In that way we can use peer pressure and the professional associations themselves can assist the health insurance commissions to prevent medifraud. I believe that that would be a much more constructive way to go. The Greens certainly do not support this legislation, in any case, because of that extension of powers, but we feel that this amendment is worthy of support because it at least counteracts one very damaging aspect of it.","N/A","HEALTH LEGISLATION (POWERS OF INVESTIGATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
95,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator NEWMAN","BE4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",155,"—I appreciate Senator Chamarettes remarks because she covered two points that I particularly wanted to make in response to the minister. One of those points is that the Australian Federal Police could not exercise these powers without having to get a search warrant. So the extension of the powers to people other than police, giving them powers that the police do not have, is unacceptable.As Senator Chamarette also said, the examples given by the minister were very different because the ministers own amendments make it clear that HIC officers may enter premises if they have reasonable grounds for believing that an offence has been or is being committed. The minister dismissed that as if it were nothing. We are dealing with criminal offences and potential criminal offences. In those circumstances, it is critically important that a search warrant be required in order to protect the rights of the citizen. The minister quite wrongly—and I wonder at her motives—suggested that we were opposing this legislation, or that we were gutting it by supporting the legislation but putting some mechanisms in place to protect the citizen. We can in no way be described as opposing it or gutting it.We are going further than the government in saying that this important purpose to which this legislation is addressed must not at the same time do a wrong to others. We are making sure that the rights of Australians are not lost simply because it is in a good cause. The government seems to have lost sight of the need to get that balance. Despite all that the minister said about balance, she failed to recognise that the only way she will achieve balance, if she gives powers of search, is to give them under certain conditions. She tried to suggest that I was damning all the medical profession as not being concerned about civil rights and not knowing about civil rights matters. I have said that lawyers perhaps are more attuned to civil rights issues than are doctors, but the AMA, for example, has looked at amendments Nos 3 and 4 and has expressed itself as happy with them.I was interested to hear the remarks of Senator Cooney. He has great understanding of these issues and was chairman of the committee that examined these matters. Certainly he put his finger on a pretty serious problem. Indeed, the minister evidenced this by her litany of examples of those who can go in and do things without search warrants. He said that more and more legislation in this country grants power to go in and inspect people in their homes or workplaces for all sorts of new offences, or to obtain evidence in order to control the citizen in some way. There may be socially desirable reasons, but in this of all places in Australia we should be alert to the restriction on the rights of citizens. No matter how worthy the purpose, we must be careful to see that we do not allow incrementally a position to develop where the rights of Australian citizens are there in name only.The creeping power given in recent years to officials has been imperceptible, but nevertheless is serious. This is one place where I believe we must take a stand. I do not believe that it will gut the effectiveness of the act. It simply means that HIC officials must exercise the same responsibility as do police officers. I question why the government wants to give more powers to the HIC than it is prepared to give to the Australian Federal Police.","N/A","HEALTH LEGISLATION (POWERS OF INVESTIGATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
96,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HARRADINE","6H4","(Tasmania)","IND","N/A",155,"—I wish to deal with one of the excellent points made by Senator Chamarette in her remarks, namely that relating to officers authorised to enter and search premises and to seize stuff. Perhaps I should take up the point made by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) that such officers would not have the power to seize material. As I see it, they have power to take extracts or to make copies of material. I am taking into account the proposed amendment 8T. I hope the chair will forgive me for referring to subsequent amendments, but I feel it necessary to do so in order to make sense of the amendments and to check the points made by the minister to the effect that there is no power to seize. I understand that they have the powers as listed in 8T. This leaves aside the privacy matter. I understand that Senator Newman indicated that the matter had been adequately dealt with.Yesterday, the minister indicated that she thought the Privacy Commissioner had apparently notified the government that he felt satisfied that the proposed amendments would cover the privacy area. On the question of seizure, they do have power, but that is another point. However, here authorised officers are provided with entry, search and other powers for which, under normal circumstances, the Australian Federal Police or trained police officers would have had to obtain a warrant. That matter is exercising the minds of all honourable senators and, no doubt, the mind of the government. It appeared to be exercising the mind of Senator Cooney when he got up to speak, and I might mention something about that later.Is it not a fact that under 8L the authorised officer, with these quite extraordinary powers without warrant, could be anybody who is nominated personally by the managing director? As Senator Chamarette said, where there are warrants required to be obtained, those warrants are in the hands of police officers, who are trained to respect the rights of the individual—whether that always occurs or not is beside the point. However, those officers are trained in that area and they are fully aware of the ramifications if they do not respect the rights of the individual.I am not satisfied, from what has thus far been said by the government in this chamber or, indeed, by the officers appearing before the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, that such provisions are in place. It is a very onerous and responsible task. I ask the Minister what is being proposed in this regard? What training will be undertaken? Will the Federal Police train these people?","N/A","HEALTH LEGISLATION (POWERS OF INVESTIGATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
97,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CROWLEY","ZF4","(South Australia-","ALP","Minister for Family Services)",156,"—I would like to pick up on a number of points before I come to the one raised by Senator Harradine. I would say to Senator Chamarette that it is not accurate to say, as she did, that while I talked about warrantless entry and search or inspection powers, they, unlike these, do not lead to criminal charges. In fact, some of them do. It is not an unprecedented example that we are putting into legislation here. In some cases, the evidence provided by those other acts I quoted does lead to the very evidence that leads to criminal charges, and we need to bear that in mind. I do not want to take issue with Senator Chamarette especially because, as I understand, this is a position she has consistently held. Really, I want to correct one of the arguments that I do not find persuasive in her argument.Senator Chamarette raised the other important point of whether professional peer pressure, that is, compliance investigation by professional colleagues, might work. The evidence to this point is that, no matter the importance of professional peer pressure, clearly some of the profession are not persuaded by that. Whether or not their professional peers are coming round, we would still have to deal with the very important point raised by Senator Harradine. Would it be fair for the pathologist down the road, designated as an inspector for compliance purposes, to come in and see whether or not another pathologist is doing what he says he does or whether we would have to say, as in answer to Senator Harradines question, `These people would have to be trained. They would also have to have some kind of understanding of the responsibilities of this sort of work.I have some information in answer to Senator Harradines question about training in particular. The balance has been always as to whether the AFP should be given the particular information to know what to look for, that is, the medical pathology and pharmaceutical expertise. The evidence is that the arrangements we have in place at the moment have not been very successful. So we turn now to whether it might be better to train the HIC, which has a much better understanding of what the medical expertise is about, and to see that they are trained to the questions Senator Harradine raised, particularly in relation to the sorts of concerns the AFP has.I am advised that the Health Insurance Commission employs around 30 experienced investigation officers. These officers work with medical advisers and pharmacists as a team. They work through a case management committee process in each state, and that is overseen by a central national case management committee. All officers undertake ongoing training programs and some programs are actually provided by the Australian Federal Police staff college. By the end of this financial year most of the officers will have completed a two-week tailored refresher course at the college and ongoing training programs are planned. The points raised by Senator Harradine are very important and very valid. I believe the Health Insurance Commission is aware of them and is certainly assisted by the Australian Federal Police in providing that kind of assistance for its own investigating officers.The Health Insurance Commission investigations are probably more sensitive to and aware of the complexity of the government as a third party financier in the doctor-patient relationship than are the police, who have a general enforcement role. Health Insurance Commission investigators are specifically trained in medifraud. Moreover, they work in tandem with the Health Insurance Commissions medical advisers, that is, with medical professionals. So in some ways that goes part way to the point Senator Chamarette raised, though I do appreciate the difference between voluntary peer review and what we have spelt out here.Perhaps that will assist Senator Harradine in his concern about whether such people are sufficiently trained. I think that is a very important point. The Health Insurance Commission, I believe, has taken account of that kind of concern.","N/A","HEALTH LEGISLATION (POWERS OF INVESTIGATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Certainly a balance has to be reached in all of these areas. I suppose in white-collar crime there is a difference. It is a difficult balance to strike in white-collar crime; nevertheless, it has to be struck because of the difficulties of unearthing the evidence. It seems to me, at all events, that this is weighing the balance down a little too much at present.

The Medical Practice Act refers to investigating complaints; the National Health Act and the Nursing Homes Assistance Act refer to the verification of accounting records, and the others cover the ascertaining of compliance.Presumably in those circumstances the authorised officer has the right to enter, to inspect records and to search.

In the area I come from, the industrial relations area, there are quite clear provisions in relevant state legislation that inspectors have the authority to enter premises, to inspect books and all the rest of it for the purpose of ensuring compliance with relevant awards. But in those circumstances, in many cases, if not in most, I think there is a requirement for notice to be given.One of the difficulties that I have is that I would like to assure myself—and I suppose the Senate as a whole would like to have that assurance—that this is not incrementally tipping the balance. As I am speaking, I am thinking of what Senator Barney Cooney, the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, said. I would not like this legislation to extend these powers that extra bit. I have regard to what Senator Cooney said about comments made by the judiciary in respect of this. In any event, we have a primary responsibility in this chamber to ensure that that balance does not tip too far one way.I would like the opportunity to look at this legislation that the minister has indicated to see whether we are going that one step further. There might be an argument for going that one step further. There is clearly an argument to do something to rectify a situation which everyone agrees requires rectification and remedy. But I, for one, would like at least a short adjournment of the consideration of this matter so as to satisfy my mind that we are not going too far in one way. I give the government an assurance that I agree that something needs to be done in this regard, because what has been on offer thus far just has not worked.","N/A","HEALTH LEGISLATION (POWERS OF INVESTIGATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[12]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

But we do that on the basis, particularly, of the need for control. The obtaining of a search warrant does not prevent those activities taking place, but it does make sure that they take place in a manner which is fair to all parties and that there is some scrutiny by the legal system of who will do what and why.I do not believe that is gutting the system—it is certainly not trying to stop effective prosecution of fraud—but it provides the balance we are talking about. It is not stopping people having the powers; it is making sure that the use of the powers is properly scrutinised before they are allowed to take place. That, to me, is a reasonable position that the Senate can support. We all talk about balance; the requirement to have a search warrant gives that balance.","N/A","HEALTH LEGISLATION (POWERS OF INVESTIGATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I ask Senator Harradine to look at Senator Leess words yesterday in her contribution to this part of the debate. We have tried to strike a balance in two steps—that is one way of saying it. Everything that Senator Newman has said is possible under this legislation when it comes to forcible entry, seizing of documents or evidence and so on. What we were looking at—and what we hoped to achieve—was the prior stage of investigation for evidence of the sorts of things which, if officers have to seek a warrant, may not be there when they come back.As Senator Lees said, many of these examples will deal with evidence that will be easily rearranged, moved or replaced. Those are the sorts of things that also need to be investigated. Everything Senator Newman says, this bill agrees with; it spells it out. But, as I have said before, there are very restricted powers under this bill. It is not for forceful entry or the seizure of evidence, and it certainly does not involve going to patients records—or anything of that sort.I will reiterate a point for Senator Harradine. Practical experience to this point has shown that what is happening now is not effective. Large amounts of taxpayers dollars are being lost. In this place we have already agreed to a sunset clause, I think until 1996.","N/A","HEALTH LEGISLATION (POWERS OF INVESTIGATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[14]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

I believe that to this point a large amount of work has gone into this bill. It has been extensively canvassed through the Senate standing committee. There has been agreement at large, in light of all the evidence, that the balance—as proposed by these amendments to the legislation which have been brought in by the government—has been struck. I remind Senator Harradine that practical experience, as he says, shows quite clearly we are not recouping those dollars at the moment. The sunset clause is there; so if the balance has gone that way, within a very short time the whole process would be reviewable.","N/A","HEALTH LEGISLATION (POWERS OF INVESTIGATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[14]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
110,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator NEWMAN","BE4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",159,"—I will respond quickly to something that Senator Crowley said. As I understand it, one reason there has not been sufficient prosecution of fraud cases is this history of relying largely on AFP officers to do the work. As the Senate knows, an enormous number of jobs are given to the AFP, and it has to prioritise. I do not have evidence of this, but I suspect that some of the HIC work may have been designated as lower priority by the AFP than other work which is required of it by government.Certainly I believe that there has not been sufficient commitment in the past to chasing fraud. I welcome the fact that now at least we have evidence of a governmental commitment to chase fraud. I think that is one of the big pluses that come out of this whole exercise. But I would not suggest that because these powers have not been there the work was not done. The work was not done because there were other priorities, as much as for any other reason.The giving of these powers is important, but so also is the commitment to prosecute and to pursue people operating outside the law. They are innocent until they are proven guilty, and the structure of protection for citizens that we have enjoyed in this country, which is being whittled back, does not need to be whittled back in this case in order to investigate fraud. We can still do it. The powers are there, but a search warrant should be required first. Senator Crowley has not acknowledged, for example, that the taking of samples or photographs in many ways is equivalent to taking away the evidence. There were more things which I think justify—","N/A","HEALTH LEGISLATION (POWERS OF INVESTIGATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1/speech[15]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Senator Crowley has put great emphasis on that. But, in the obtaining of evidence from somebodys premises, some precautions need to be taken first. Therefore, I do not think we should be distracted by the minister saying, `Well, we have not done very well in the past. The reason for this is not so much one of there not being the powers but one of a commitment and a priority not being given to this work. I welcome the fact that that now appears to be present.

David Kindon has taken me through the material—it was a most interesting half an hour, although that was probably not as much time as it really deserved—and has shown me exactly how people are running other pathology operations. That evidence will give Senator Harradine an insight into why this power is needed.David Kindon uses slides and overheads to show various practices and levels of claims by particular pathology practices. They show the responses of just a select few pathology practices to previous measures taken by the government to try at least to slow down some of the increases. I emphasise that we are talking about a few. However, we are also talking about large amounts of money that those few seem to be able to accrue very selectively.

116,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SPINDLER","0X4","(Victoria)","AD","N/A",160,"—During the second reading debate on 2 March 1994 I indicated that the Democrats supported the main thrust of the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill. I say again that we welcome the attempt to give effect to the obligations that were imposed by the United Nations Security Council when it adopted resolution 827 in 1993. The setting up of this tribunal sends a very clear message to all in the former state of Yugoslavia that they must immediately stop violations of international humanitarian law or face the consequences.However, notwithstanding the extraordinary circumstances that have brought this legislation into existence, we believe that a balance must be struck between the need to ensure that procedures are in place for people to be surrendered promptly to the tribunal and other assistance rendered to it, and the need to have in place the safeguards that a nation such as ours would expect to have in its judicial process. The amendments that I will move today are in line with that objective.The amendment to clause 12 will give a person who has been arrested on a warrant the right to know what it is that he or she has been arrested for. I will move an amendment so as to require that when a person is arrested pursuant to a warrant, he or she must be handed a notice setting out the tribunal offence and the conduct that is alleged to constitute the tribunal offence to which the warrant relates. I move:1.Clause 12, page 7, subclause (1), lines 22 to 24, omit the subclause, substitute the following subclause:(1) A person who is arrested under a warrant must, as soon as practicable:(a)be given a written notice that:(i)specifies the Tribunal offence in respect of which the warrant was issued; and(ii)describes the conduct that is alleged to constitute that offence; and(b)be brought before a magistrate in the State or Territory in which the person is arrested..","N/A","INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL BILL 1994 INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At present, there is no right of appeal from the Attorney-Generals decision under clause 16. The application of the AD(JR) Act will be removed by an amendment to the act and this will be effected by the International War Crimes (Consequential Amendments) Bill.In framing these amendments the Democrats have been conscious of the need to ensure that the appeal rights are exercised expeditiously so that the surrender process is not unduly drawn out. The last thing we want to do is to delay these procedures which are, as I said, welcomed and supported by the Democrats. We believe that an executive decision of this type, which affects the legal rights of people, puts them at risk in our legal system and hands them over to another tribunal, must be subject to scrutiny by a court. We believe that the appeal should be able to be brought before an Australian court, but that the right must be exercised within seven days.With that same consideration of timing in mind, the amendments have been framed to ensure that the application to the Federal Court for a review of the Attorney-Generals determination will involve a full hearing on all the available factual material. Subsequent appeals to the Federal Court and the High Court would be only on errors of law. I submit that will ensure that the appeals are dealt with expeditiously.I should add that the model for these amendments is section 21 of the Extradition Act. I believe that that act sets a minimum benchmark standard so far as review rights are concerned on extradition and surrender questions. I believe it is important that this bill conform with those minimum standards.I am advised that the government is unlikely to support this amendment, and I find that disappointing. There is nothing in the scheme that I have proposed that derogates from the mandatory terms of the United Nations resolution. Certainly, the Democrats scheme guarantees the basic procedural safeguards and speed that are normally present in our criminal and administrative law.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL BILL 1994 INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I understand that we are supporting all the other amendments that Senator Spindler, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, will be moving. We oppose this one because we see that the tribunal established by the United Nations with a limited mandate is the proper forum in which war crimes allegations against persons should be considered.The governments concern is that if we were to incorporate the sorts of appeal rights and judicial review rights that Senator Spindler talks about, we could very easily be frustrating the work of the International War Crimes Tribunal. We would be frustrating it because, as we have seen quite often—particularly in my portfolio—the use of judicial review mechanisms can drag out a process for some three, four or five years. That is the sort of situation that we do not want to see eventuate by the incorporation of the principles contained in Democrat amendments three and five.Senator Spindler draws an analogy with the Extradition Act. The Extradition Act contains safeguards and covers a range of situations and arrangements with more than 100 countries. In this legislation we are talking about a war crimes tribunal; one body established by the United Nations with a limited mandate. I think one can draw a comparison between the specific mandate of that tribunal and the whole range of considerations that would fall within the ambit of the Extradition Act.This bill will be considered by the House of Representatives committee. That committee is now in the care of the eminent lawyer from New South Wales, the honourable member for Banks, Daryl Melham, who has brought his own drive and enthusiasm to the committee. I am sure that the sorts of issues that Senator Spindler talks about will be exhaustively assessed by that body.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL BILL 1994 INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

131,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator IAN MACDONALD","YW4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",165,"—The moral and political bankruptcy of the Labor Party and the disdain with which it treats the Australian public are evidenced daily, but they are no better demonstrated than by the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill 1994 that is now before the Senate.The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) in introducing this bill pretended it to be part of the governments caring `green direction—but in reality it is just another cynical exercise of the Labor Party to buy the second preferences of the Green and Democrat parties and to bribe the left wing faction of the Labor Party—that is, the Democrats and the Greens—to pass last years dishonest budget. That budget broke practically every major election promise the Labor Party made in the last election campaign.What concerns me more than the moral and political bankruptcy of the Australian Labor Party—and we have all come to expect it—is the fact that the Labor Party sycophants in the Canberra press gallery allow Labors dishonesty to pass daily, unchallenged. This duplicity is demonstrated by this bill. The Labor Party now supports ethanol enthusiastically. But let me quote to the Senate this gem, deliberately said as it was in answer to a dorothy dixer in 1990:The former Queensland Government . . . was a vigorous supporter of ethanol. It wanted a 10 per cent ethanol-petrol blend to be used in Queensland. This, of course, has been discontinued by the Goss Government since it took office.Ethanol has been tried as a fuel in only two countries in the world—the United States and Brazil. In both cases it was a financial disaster. The Brazilian Government provided subsidies worth more than $2.7 billion a year, but the new Government of Brazil is abandoning that program. . .A 10 per cent ethanol-petrol blend in Australia. . . has two drawbacks: the economic ones and the environmental ones. If the 10 per cent blend were to be an excise-free blend, it would cost Australians $435 million a year in revenue forgone. Subsidies for industry to keep the price below current bowser petroleum prices would amount to another $400 million a year.The other area of concern was the `environmental costs which were described as `prohibitive, and refer to the disposal of liquid wastes from ethanol distillation as `a major problem. Quoting another person, the person who was saying this in the Senate in 1990 went on to say:. . . in Brazil the waste disposal problem had turned rivers black, caused by the effluent coming from ethanol plants.That person went on to say:This would also increase pressure on marginal lands and on the environment.Who said all that? It was none other than Senator Cook, the minister now responsible for this bill. Four years ago a 10 per cent ethanol blend was bad for the environment and it was a financial disaster. Yet here we have the Labor Party, which is morally and politically bankrupt, today supporting a bill by the same minister who four years ago roundly criticised that proposal.I might say that four years ago I defended ethanol proposals in Queensland because I thought they were good for the sugar industry. But Senator Cook in answer to a dorothy dixer—something specifically put up by the minister—rubbished the proposal. Here we are, four years later, because Labor is pandering to the Greens and the Democrats, or what is left of the Greens—I understand the Greens are about to split up and one of them about to join the Democrats. Certainly what is left of the Greens are being pandered to by the government to try to get their second preferences and also to get through last years dishonest budget, which should never have been passed.What is this bill that Senator Cook is now proposing, contrary to what he said four years ago? The Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill provides for the payment of a bounty on Australian production of certain types of fuel ethanol. The payment of a bounty to ethanol producers forms part of the governments $36 million three-year lead abatement strategy announced in last years budget. The strategy was justified by the considerable health risks and environmental damage associated with toxic lead levels.Of the $36 million allocated for the strategy, $25 million has been allocated to the bounty scheme. This will involve a payment of $6 million in 1994-95, $8 million in 1995-96 and $11 million in 1996-97. The bounty scheme will run for three years commencing on 1 July 1994. The rate of payment of the bounty will be 18c per litre and will be payable on defined `new production of fuel ethanol, where it is produced in Australia from biomass feedstocks sourced from plants and animals grown in Australia and where production exceeds 350,000 litres per annum.Ethanol is a volatile liquid which is flammable and toxic and is produced on the fermentation of agricultural crops, such as sugar cane, sugar beet, cereal grain, sweet sorghum and cassava. When mixed into unleaded petrol as a 10 per cent blend, ethanol is an effective fuel requiring no modification to the engines of cars designed for leaded petrol. Blended with petrol ethanol lifts the octane range by three points, taking it into the range at which older cars designed for leaded fuel can operate.Ethanol has a number of environmental benefits, due mainly to the fact that it burns cleaner than other fuels. These benefits are a reduction in carbon monoxide exhaust emissions of between 10 per cent and 30 per cent; a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and lead levels; and a net reduction in carbon dioxide emission, a major concern in global warming.Importantly, ethanol is also produced from a renewable energy resource. But, on the downside, ethanol use can cause aldehydes which are eye irritants and possible carcinogens. The production of ethanol in Australia is constrained by a number of obstacles. Ethanol is more expensive to produce than fuel oils, while low volumes mean that producers are unable to make cost gains from economies of scale. In addition, to produce ethanol competitively and in commercial quantities requires a considerable investment in technology and infrastructure which industry has thus far been reluctant to make.Ethanol is currently produced in Australia primarily for the chemical industry and sourced from Sarina in the Mackay district of north Queensland not far from where I live. However, the Manildra Group operating in New South Wales sells a portion of its ethanol to the Caltex oil company for fuel purposes. Its plant near Nowra on the south coast of New South Wales has the potential to utilise 100,000 tonnes of wheat to produce 28 million litres of ethanol.Caltex blends the ethanol with fuel and distributes the blend through its `Bogus chain of service stations on the south coast. Caltex has been able to economically trial the sale of its ethanol blend because the New South Wales government has forgone its five per cent fuel excise and the ethanol has been produced as a by-product of the production of gluten in starch.Ethanol in Australia is currently produced in two main ways, using either molasses or starch from wheat. The Manildra Group uses starch, while the other major producers operating from north Queensland use molasses. A 1990 paper suggested that all of the Queensland molasses converted to fuel ethanol would be required to produce a five per cent ethanol blend for Queensland use. To provide a 10 per cent ethanol fuel blend for the whole of Australia would need the entire Queensland sugar crop.The 1990 estimates suggest that a capital investment of $200 million to $300 million would be needed just to make 300 megalitres of ethanol to supply a 10 per cent blend for Queenslands needs. Production of 300 megalitres of fuel ethanol would reduce Australias import bill for crude oil by about $100 million at a world price of US$40 a barrel. At the current oil price of around US$15 per barrel, this would reduce the import bill by less than $50 million.But the same land required to produce that 300 megalitres of ethanol could earn $160 million from exported sugar at a price of around 10c per pound—the average price for 1993 was 10.03c per pound, although the March 1994 average price was around 11.7c per pound. So, whilst using ethanol would reduce the import bill for Australia by reducing the amount we would pay for imported crude oil, it would cost us money because the money we could earn from that same amount of land, through the sale of sugar on the export market, is almost three times what we would save by the reduction in the crude oil price. So, at present there is not much in it for the Queensland sugar industry.A bounty may produce other more acceptable sources. A 1992 article in the Australian quotes a Dr Russell Reeves of APECE Research saying that ethanol can be produced at a cost that is competitive with crude oil prices from woody biomass such as forest thinnings, sawdust, cotton and grain crop stubble, rice hulls, bagasse and waste paper.There is some concern in the industry that, once the bounty is gone, it may not be profitable for Manildra to supply ethanol for fuel. According to sugar industry sources, for ethanol to be competitive, oil has to be at about $40 to $45 per barrel—it is currently only at $15 per barrel. The cost of production of ethanol is about 45c per litre at the factory gate, whereas the cost of petrol is about 25c per litre at the consumers market.I note the research by Trangie Agricultural Research Centre which suggests that ethanol can be produced from agricultural crop residues for 24c a litre. If this is correct we may be getting to a state where ethanol can be produced commercially. However, there is some doubt that ethanol will be used as fuel after the three-year period of the bounty finishes, despite the so-called protection in the bill. There is concern that the production capacity of Manildra, having been expanded by bounty subsidies, will at the end of the three-year bounty period be used to compete unfairly with other producers of industrial ethanol.To be registered for the bounty, the bill requires information about the marketing strategy for fuel alcohol, including reduction of pollutants and proposals for short- and long-term environmental considerations. It is necessary to prove the production is so-called new production and that more than 350,000 litres will be produced in each year.The bill gives the minister for resources and energy responsibility for approving the registration of an individual company based on the information provided. To receive the bounty, the minister must consider that the company will be able to `contribute significantly to the development of a competitive, robust and ecologically sustainable fuel ethanol industry.So it is of some concern to us that this later criterion is not defined in the act and is rather dependent upon the ministers judgment. As I mentioned earlier in my speech, four years ago the minister was totally opposed to ethanol for all the reasons he gave and this year he is in favour of it. So one would have a lot of doubt about the ministers genuineness and his ability to make a satisfactory judgment on this and any other issue.Fuel ethanol has definite advantages for the environment and the community. The main things holding back the industry are the high front-end capital costs and low production volumes. This legislation came into being as a result of the deal made between the government and its subsidiaries—the left wing factions, the Australian Democrats and the Greens—at the time of the last budget. It was a $25 million bribe to get the budget through. It is a blight on the Australian public system at the moment that this Labor government simply throws $25 million around to buy its way through the budget. That is what happened last time. We are just throwing away that $25 million of taxpayers money as a result of the deal done between the government and the Greens.Whilst I have some reservations, as I said in my speech, I acknowledge that the proposal is a good one from the environmental point of view and, for this reason, the Liberal and National parties will support the legislation. But we wonder whether enough thought has gone into this bill. We wonder whether the fuel ethanol industry can ever be self-sufficient without subsidies and whether, after the three-year bounty period, ethanol fuel production will continue.We wonder whether it is more likely that this bounty will simply allow another competitor into Australias current export trade in chemical ethanol but subsidised at taxpayers expense to the detriment of the existing ethanol export trade based in north Queensland. So, whilst this bill is intentioned, correctly, to get the fuel ethanol industry going, there is a real doubt about whether the industry can exist after three years without subsidies.If that is the case, all this bill will have done is, at taxpayers expense, given a competitor the ability to build up the capital works necessary to get its factory going and simply give it that easy, taxpayer subsidised way of building a factory to compete with an existing factory in north Queensland, which got there without subsidies. This bill and the work that Manildra is doing will be good for the grain industry in New South Wales, and that in itself is a reason to support the bill. But we wonder whether it is fair if the only result from this is to use taxpayers moneys to subsidise the establishment of a factory which will, after the three years, simply compete with an existing industry in north Queensland.We have supported the bill on the basis that it is a bounty for three years only—and we stress this—whilst suspecting that the fuel ethanol industry will be viable only if the bounty is later extended. The experience in the USA and Brazil was that when government subsidies were removed the ethanol fuel production ceased. For environmental reasons we are prepared to give the proposal the benefit of the doubt, so to speak, and we hope that the bounty does have the effect of establishing a viable, prosperous fuel ethanol industry that can exist in the future without permanent and distorting subsidies.","N/A","BOUNTY (FUEL ETHANOL) BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
132,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COULTER","TF4","(South Australia)","AD","N/A",169,"—Senator Ian Macdonald was quite right in identifying the genesis of this bill as being an Australian Democrats initiative. He was also quite right in identifying the negotiations which went on during the 1993-94 budget debates with the government as the mechanism which the Democrats were successfully able to use to convince the government that this was a very good scheme to enter into. So I would agree with Senator Macdonald there. However, to impugn the motives of the Democrats is quite wrong. For many decades I have been firmly committed to the proposal that Australia needs to move towards a much greater, and eventually exclusive, use of renewable fuels.I think Senator Macdonald and other senators would know that last year Australia imported $4 billion worth of petroleum product and that by the year 2000 that is likely to rise to something like $10 billion; that these petroleum based fuels are non-renewable, both within Australia and globally—they will run out; and that they are one of the principal causes of greenhouse gas emissions—one of the principal causes of smog emissions in our major cities and urban centres. For a whole variety of reasons similar to this we do need to move to renewable fuels of which ethanol, in the transport area, is pre-eminently sensible.Regarding costs, I think one could mount a very credible argument that the only reason that ethanol is not already competitive is that the hidden costs in relation to the use of petroleum—the costs of depletion, the costs of urban air pollution, the deaths which occur from lung cancer and other diseases in cities—are not borne as they should be against the use of petroleum. If those costs were factored in it may well be that ethanol and other renewable fuels already would be competitive.The bounty scheme which this bill introduces was also initiated by the Democrats. The government chose, in the budget, to increase—initially, very substantially—the price of petrol and to increase differentially the price of leaded fuel. The argument which the government used was that this was to discourage the use of leaded fuel, particularly in view of the fact that perhaps half the people who were continuing to use leaded fuel had vehicles that could, in fact, use unleaded fuel. However, there was nothing whatsoever in the governments original proposal which would have allowed those people who had older cars that necessarily used leaded fuel to eventually avoid that increased impost. Given that those people who had the older cars were often less able to cope with this increased price, the Democrats felt that this impost was unfair if the money from that differential simply went into general revenue.Therefore, we argued very vigorously with the government that at least some of the money from this increased cost of leaded fuel should go into providing an alternative. In the case of Manildra, we were aware of the fact that already 23 service stations in New South Wales were providing ethanol mixes—10 per cent ethanol in petrol, which was a perfectly satisfactory substitute for leaded petrol for the vast majority of the vehicles that would otherwise require the higher octane fuel and would normally be using leaded fuel—and that this number could be rapidly expanded.I understand that by the end of this year there will be 400 service stations in New South Wales providing gasohol, the 10 per cent mix of alcohol in petrol. It gives the lie to the claim often made by the opposition that the Democrats are opposed to industry. We are strongly in favour of appropriate industry. I would point out that Manildra has already made a $36 million investment as a consequence of the offer of this bounty.As I have already said, alcohol is not only a renewable fuel but also a very satisfactory substitute for lead in petrol. The government was initially anticipating a phase-out of leaded petrol perhaps by early in the next century. Under this bounty scheme if this three-year window of opportunity is used, as I hope it will be, to make the breakthroughs in the technology which are still required to bring the price of ethanol down—and I will refer to those in a moment—then I believe that we will see the phase-out of leaded petrol occur much more quickly. The transition in Australia to a much higher proportion of ethanol in fuel—eventually 100 per cent ethanol—as a transportation fuel could occur quite quickly.That brings me to the research going on in Australia, which is one of the other benefits of going down this road. As I think many senators would know, there has been excellent research in the University of New South Wales over many years into ethanol as a fuel. Dr Russell Reeves, who has been leading that research, has not only developed the gasohol mix for use in ordinary vehicles but also very successfully developed and patented a mix with diesel fuel—a 15 per cent diesohol mix. I understand that that diesohol mix is not only being trialled in Australia but is already being trialled in Sweden, another country with a great interest in ensuring that the use of petroleum based fuels does not lead to the environmental damage which it would otherwise do.From the little I have seen of that research, it seems extremely likely that the use of that diesohol could well become widespread. I understand that Manildra has been for some time using diesohol in its farm machinery and trucks. As I mentioned, the Action buses in the ACT and the buses in Sydney are trialling the use of diesohol. I am quite sure that that will become a viable and cleaner fuel. Emissions from engines using gasohol and diesohol with respect to not only carbon dioxide but also nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide tend to be lower than the emissions of unmodified fuels.Senator Macdonald also mentioned the derivation of ethanol from crops in north Queensland. I guess he is referring specifically to the use of either sugar or molasses as a feed stock for fermentation into ethanol. There are two concerns that I think one must put up front in relation to those feed stocks. Firstly, those feed stocks tend to be expensive, and that is one of the reasons why alcohol from that source is expensive. Secondly, in a world with growing populations, where one needs to look very closely at food supplies for people, there are serious ethical questions about diverting material that could otherwise be used for food into feed stock for fuel.One of the exciting developments that is going on in the University of New South Wales is work on the derivation of ethanol from cellulose. Cellulose is part of the woody material in all plants, the stalks of grain, a large part of the stems of trees, and so on, and is a much cheaper source of starting material for ethanol. It is also abundantly available. The work that is going on there involves a certain amount of genetic engineering: ideally, putting the appropriate enzymes for the breaking of the cellulose into a bacterium and then the various enzymes for breaking down the sugars which result from that initial digestion of the cellulose, so that in one step one would be able to derive ethanol from cellulose. This can already be done in several steps, but there seems every likelihood that the work in the University of New South Wales will be able to produce very cheap ethanol from that feed stock within the three-year time frame.It is terribly important that this bounty be put in place to encourage that development, because Manildra has stood very firmly behind the University of New South Wales in the research work it has been doing. As I have already mentioned, the Manildra company near Nowra has already committed some $36 million to expanding its ethanol production. I certainly do not share Senator Macdonalds concern that that ethanol will be used to compete with other producers of ethanol for the chemical industry and for other purposes at the end of this bounty period. I think Manildra has demonstrated a very firm commitment to fuel ethanol, even before this bounty was put in place.Manildra is in some respects a good example of the way in which companies should be going in terms of closed cycle processing. Manildra began essentially as a flour milling business. It moved on to taking the gluten, the protein fraction, out of the flour and selling that for protein enriched bread, value adding to the flour it produced. It then realised that it had the starch fraction of the flour which it could sell for various purposes, and it did that. It moved on and found that, using particular enzymes, it could ferment that starch to a whole range of sugars which had much higher value. It did that, and it produces things such as glucose and fructose from the starch.To do that it needed a particularly pure form of starch, so it had to purify the starch. It had waste starch left over, which initially, I understand, it was using for spray irrigation on nearby farm land. More recently, it has used what was otherwise waste starch for fermentation to ethanol. So it has used every fraction of the flour to produce a very much value added product. The final material—the waste water and so on—still goes out to irrigate pasture on which it fattens cattle. So there is very much a closed loop in this manufacturing.I understand that Manildra also will be installing its own power station and that that will further improve the environmental viability, the environmental sustainability, of the plant. It certainly suggests to honourable senators and others who may be listening that, if they want a very good example of a business that uses a natural raw material and squeezes all the value adding possible out of that material, they should go no further than Manildra.I hope that under this bounty scheme there will be other people in Australia who will see the advantages of going down this road. In my own state, on the Eyre Peninsula we have a group of farmers who are very keen to use rain damaged grain as a feed stock for the production of ethanol. It is a much smaller operation than Manildra but nonetheless one that in this case could take a feed stock that has a limited value and turn out ethanol for fuel. This could be turned back onto the farm, making the farmers in that district far more independent of imported fuel—expensive fuel, as most honourable senators would know—and turning out a fermentation mash that would have almost the same value as the initial feed stock of rain damaged wheat and barley.Again, one sees the possibility of very considerable value adding, of a local industry with local employment and local self-sufficiency being developed in which the fuel that is produced remains in the district. If that scheme gets up in the next few years, one may well see similar examples spread around Australia. I hope that will occur.The Democrats strongly welcome this legislation. It gives effect to that negotiated agreement between the government and the Democrats. We have been strongly committed to renewable fuels over a long period. That commitment remains firm. Our commitment now is not only to see this legislation passed but also to continue pressing the government in relation to that other portion of the research funding that came under the rubric of lead abatement strategy, to ensure that that also goes back into the fuel ethanol program so that Australia will develop a technology of ethanol from cellulose, producing cheap ethanol which it will then be able to export to other nations in the world. Australia is in no sense unique in needing to go down this road. Every nation will need to go down the road of moving from non-renewable to renewable fuels. The nation that first manages to make this transition will be in an excellent position to take advantage of that invention, that technology, and to export that technology to other nations.In the production of ethanol from cellulose, in the application of that ethanol as fuel—both with petrol and with diesel—and eventually in the use of pure ethanol fuels in internal combustion engines, Australia stands in a very good position to lead the world to a non-greenhouse, renewable source of transportation energy. This bounty will create that window of opportunity. Far from in any sense criticising this, we should be grasping this three-year opportunity and using this window of opportunity to ensure that we successfully negotiate down this path and come up with those further technical and economic developments during this interim period.","N/A","BOUNTY (FUEL ETHANOL) BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
133,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CHAPMAN","FF4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",172,"—The Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill is the governments response to its negotiations with the Democrats over last years budget. It is seeking to provide support for the development of an ethanol fuel industry in Australia as part of the governments supposed lead abatement strategy. Undoubtedly, the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions is a good thing for our environment, so the coalition does not oppose the passage of this bill, as was indicated earlier by my colleague Senator Ian Macdonald. However, we must wonder whether this government is merely applying a $25 million bandaid to salve its international conscience and to placate small interest groups in an industry whose economic viability is questionable.Ethanol can be produced either from ethylene or from the fermentation of sugars or starches yielded from a range of agricultural crops, including grain and sugar. The main benefits of ethanol, in the context of this legislation, are as an extender for petrol and diesel, which assists in the reduction of so-called greenhouse gas emissions. It also provides an alternative source of fuel from fossil fuel feed stocks. But we need to be aware that the large scale production of ethanol in Australia requires significant investment and infrastructure to produce commercially viable quantities.Brazil has the most significant ethanol industry in the world. In Brazil ethanol is produced from the domestic sugarcane industry. That yields four billion gallons a year of ethanol. But we need to remember that the ethanol fuel industry in Brazil is economically viable only because, first, in Brazil petrol prices are maintained at an artificially high level; secondly, ethanol fuel receives favourable taxation treatment; thirdly, there are direct government subsidies provided for ethanol fuel; and, finally, as I discovered when I visited Brazil in a delegation a couple of years ago, there is a mandatory legislative requirement that a certain percentage—as I recall, it was 50 per cent—of the engines produced in Brazil for its motor vehicle industry have to be produced on the basis that they run exclusively on ethanol fuel. So there is a remarkable degree of government intervention in Brazil to ensure that ethanol is a viable alternative. It obviously adds to the cost of transport in that country.As I said, that industry in Brazil produces about four billion gallons of ethanol fuel a year. By contrast, the Australian ethanol industry has very limited production capacity. A recently opened ethanol plant at Nowra in New South Wales—constructed at a cost of $23 million—has a maximum annual capacity of 28 million litres. Again, compare that with the four billion litres produced in Brazil. Most of this production is earmarked for the chemical industry. But a small proportion of the Nowra plants production is supplied to Caltex, which blends ethanol with fuel and markets this under its so-called `Bogus chain of service stations in New South Wales. The annual volume of `Bogus fuel sold in the past year was only 20 million litres. Given a 10 per cent blend of ethanol to fuel, this equates to only two million litres of ethanol being used as a fuel.Applicants for a bounty under this legislation are required to provide information to prove that they have a level of new production of 350,000 litres. A Queensland study undertaken in 1989 indicated that an investment of $120 million would be required to create an ethanol industry in Queensland capable of producing 300 million litres per year. Let me add that the Queensland government, having already invested $1.75 million in a joint venture with Queensland Science and Technology Ltd, is now in the position of determining whether an ethanol industry is viable. Does the federal government really hope to create a viable ethanol industry in Australia by spending just $25 million? CSR and Bundaberg Sugars ethanol production in 1989—currently used for the production of rum, methylated spirits and solvents rather than for ethanol fuel—was 50 million litres per year.Although current research indicates that there are sufficient agricultural crop residues in the Macquarie, Gwydir and Namoi valleys to produce 820 million litres of ethanol a year, it takes 100,000 tonnes of wheat to produce 28 million litres of ethanol. Certainly there is no doubt that there is a spin-off from the ethanol industry for the agricultural sector. Producers of wheat, sorghum, corn and sugarcane would benefit from the purchase—at a collection fee of $30 a tonne—of agricultural residues.The encouragement of a new industry with positive benefits for Australia should be lauded; but the cost of developing this new industry must not be overlooked. Moreover, the background to the governments strategy in this field is important. In October 1990 the government announced its intention to implement the Toronto target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent of 1988 levels by the year 2005. The stringency of this policy placed Australia in the position of a world leader in greenhouse gas emission reductions. Of course, in the governments desire to make itself internationally popular, it completely ignored the fact that the total contribution by Australia to gas emissions is indeed very small.The government and the then Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Mrs Kelly, naively suggested that the stabilisation of emissions by the year 2005 could be achieved without harming Australian industry but that it would require substantial structural adjustment. Apparently, this would be achieved through what she described as cost-effective, energy saving `no regrets policies. `No regrets emission reduction measures are those that supposedly offer economic and environmental benefits, apart from any lessening of the greenhouse effect.The governments commitment was in response to considerable hysteria on the subject of global warming, notwithstanding that many of the statistics quoted then on global warming failed to take into account the effects of global cooling caused by atmospheric sulfides from acid rain and volcanic ash. Now, only a couple of years later, the CSIRO estimates that the greenhouse impact will be less than half of the estimates used in the predictions by the Australian government in formulating its policies and strategies resulting from its participation in the Rio Earth Summit, Agenda 21 and the subsequent conventions on climate change and biodiversity.We also need to remember that ethanol itself is not without environmental consequences. In emissions created where ethanol is used as a fuel additive, high levels of aldehydes are created—these are both eye irritants and possible carcinogens. We need to be aware of that downside as far as the environment is concerned. It perhaps balances some of the claimed benefits of ethanol as a fuel. The London economics group of BHP released a study in 1992 which stated that implementing policies to achieve the Toronto target would destroy Australias steel and aluminium industries and cripple the steaming coal industry.Because of our enormous reserves, Australia has a fossil fuel based economy. We are the worlds biggest coal exporter and the worlds second biggest exporter of aluminium and iron ore. Nearly 90 per cent of Australias electricity is generated in coal fired power stations. Australia does not enjoy greenhouse-free nuclear power because, with the ready availability of coal, nuclear power is not economically viable. Even so, Australia produces less than two per cent of total world greenhouse gas emissions.In 1992 the Industry Commission showed that annual Australian losses by the year 2005 from global application of the Toronto target would amount to 1.5 per cent of Australian national output. That represents about $6 billion a year and the loss of 50,000 to 75,000 jobs. That is hardly something that we can sustain or justify with the current enormous levels of unemployment suffered by people in this country.Despite former Minister Kellys assurances, made to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in February 1992, that there would be no coal tax—a tax which, to meet the Toronto emission target, would need to be levied at $153 a tonne, thus raising the price of coal by more than 200 per cent—we have seen in media reports as recently as last week that the government is again considering a greenhouse gas tax. Less than two years ago the then minister said there would be no carbon tax, yet in the last week we have seen that it is again on the agenda. Of course, that will be a substantial cost to industry, to economic growth and to the economic wellbeing of this country.It is possible that next weeks budget will see proposals for an energy tax as a substitute for state payroll taxes. Certainly the Liberal and National parties support the abolition of payroll taxes—a direct tax on jobs—and the consequent job opportunities that would be derived from the abolition of that tax. An exchange of payroll tax for a greenhouse gas tax on industry—even allowing for the absence of an excise tax on ethanol as a fuel and with the addition of the bounty—would place in great jeopardy any possible generation of jobs.This government is now renowned for giving tax benefits or tax reductions with one hand and taking them back immediately with the other. As we know only too well, it is a tax and spend government. It does not know how to manage government finances, and it does not know how to save on expenditure, so its rapacious desire for tax revenue rises inexorably. Quite clearly, if it is going to abolish payroll tax it will, it would appear, introduce this so-called greenhouse gas tax, a tax on energy, as an alternative source of revenue. The government will try to dress it up as an environmental measure when, in reality, it is nothing more than the governments incapacity to match its spending with its available revenue. Doctor Brian OBrien, an environmental consultant from Perth, in a paper which he presented in February 1993, commented that the commitments made by Australia under the—","N/A","BOUNTY (FUEL ETHANOL) BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

143,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CHAPMAN","FF4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",172,"—I am quite capable of writing my own speeches and of researching the information myself. As I was saying before the interruption, Dr OBrien presented a paper in February 1993 when he commented that the commitments made by Australia under the auspices of the Rio Earth Summit were made during a period when Australia was in the depths of a recession and, in his view, had effectively nationalised the environment without establishing any clear benefit to it whatsoever. It is feared that with a recovering Australian economy these commitments may be pursued more vigorously, obviously to the detriment of that economic recovery.We hear a lot from the government about how we need to improve our capacity to export into the Asian region and that that is where our future lies. Of course, it is a very important market for Australian goods and services. If Australia is to have a prosperous future we must do business successfully in the Asian area. We need to remember that many Asian countries with rapidly growing economies are not signatories to various United Nations conventions. So this country, Australia—our own country—is left, unable to compete with those economies, because they are not burdened by the cost obligations of those various international conventions.In March of this year, whilst discussing carbon dioxide emissions, former Senator Richardson referred to the high degree of synergy between the target adopted by Australia and Australias commitments and principles in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. As recently as April 1994 the government was criticised by parties attending the consultative forum on international environmental issues—including the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace, Community Aid Abroad and the Council for Overseas Aid—for failing to meets its commitments and obligations under United Nations conventions. Ministers Evans and Faulkner agreed that they would consider the points raised by these organisations. So here we see the government coming under the influence of these organisations which are proposing policies which would be detrimental to the Australian economy and to the wellbeing of Australian people.It may be a simple point, but it is often missed, that many developing nations refused to sign the conventions unless they were given assurances of aid that would help them buy energy efficient fuels. The `north-south—who pays? debate is not a new issue. Australia and New Zealand, as part of the developed, so-called `north nations, are therefore required to contribute aid to developing nations which are not restrained by being signatories to these UN conventions and which can therefore continue to do whatever they like. Another recent example of this is the international convention on desertification which is currently under negotiation. Quite apart from the issue of the abdication of sovereignty which this convention involves, it deals almost exclusively with aid for African countries.Whilst supporting this legislation, there are a number of serious shortcomings in the governments approach to this issue which I have sought to highlight. I conclude by saying that two years ago the government committed us to a 20 per cent reduction in the level of greenhouse gas emissions that were evident at that time, but it had absolutely no understanding of how that was to be achieved. This bill may go some way towards achieving that goal, but it must be recognised that it will not be without cost to our standard of living and job creation in Australia. This government, while taking advantage of the international posturing in which it engaged in 1990, when it comes to the bottom line is really only paying lip-service to its commitments to the environment, and it is doing that at some cost to our economy.","N/A","BOUNTY (FUEL ETHANOL) BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start[6]/para","N/A","N/A"

154,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MARGETTS","DX5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A",176,"—I have just now been listening to a very good example of the NIML principle. People well know what the `not in my backyard principle is. It is espoused by those people who do not really mind what goes on as long as it is not actually affecting them. When it comes to climatic change, whether it is now or in the future, very few people can claim it is not in their backyard. That is what the `not in my lifetime, or NIML, principle is about. What we hear from Senator Chapman is a very good example of that: let somebody else pay in the future because it may not be in my lifetime.In relation to the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill, as we have frequently stated in the past, the Greens (WA) see a fundamental problem with the ongoing commitment to the private motor car as the major means of personal transport. It is not and never will be equitable. It results in a massive resource use and is a major contributor to energy use, pollution and particularly airborne emissions. The dependency on oil creates additional problems, economically and environmentally. The presumption of car ownership is built into our cities in a way that greatly increases the cost of urban infrastructure, while having very negative effects on equity and other social factors. We stress the need for a real and direct move to address these issues and reduce the dependency on private motor vehicles, particularly those run mainly on carbon based fuel.Use of fuel ethanol and gasohol cannot advance these aims on its own. Nevertheless, we support this bill since, as an additive, this fuel provides a better option for increasing octane ratings, making it a potential alternative for leaded petrol. I call on Senator Ian Macdonald to note that this proposal relates to ethanol as an additive rather than as an alternative fuel on its own. Lead emissions are a problem, and cars are the major source of such emissions. While we would like to see legislation designed to reduce the levels of lead in petrol with a definite phase-out date, we recognise that it is important to create alternatives; and this is one such alternative.Senator Macdonald spoke mostly of the cost and probable need for continued subsidy. We initially also thought that the three-year period may not be long enough. We are assured by industry that new processes are being developed that will drastically reduce costs and that this bounty is in large part what it needs to carry it over the development period. In short, industry is happy with the three-year period. Note that, while sugar has been used and proposed as the basis for an alternative stand-alone, fuel alcohol industry, the current development area is in the use of waste starches from the food industry. The proposal at the moment is for ethanol as an additive to replace lead, which is used to increase octane.The Greens also support the amendments put by the Australian Democrats. These are primarily designed to avoid the problem that has arisen. This bounty is intended to support the development of a fuel ethanol industry. So far, one company has shown the commitment and courage to actually take this challenge on and start producing fuel ethanol. It is strongly committed to improving its processes and to developing the industry. Yet, under the current wording, that company would be penalised. It would be the only one penalised. Although this company has just started production, all its current production would be considered ineligible as `new production. This is simply not fair and penalises the very people who should be congratulated if the intent of the bill is recognised.Other amendments are designed to make sure that those entering the industry are legitimate developers. They would exclude those who do not have a commitment to process improvement, including improving environmental consequences of production. We support these also.One additional issue is not addressed in the amendments, and I would like to draw the attention of honourable senators to it. Under clause 28 there is a guarantee of an appropriation. This is fine. Under subclause 29(1), provision is made for the comptroller to recognise valid claims in excess of the appropriated funds in clause 28. This is also fine since, otherwise, the valid claims of some would not be honoured. Unfortunately, subclause 29(2) then says that, where the money is not appropriated, no additional bounty can be paid.This means that, unless the government makes a commitment to appropriate required funds, either some valid claims will not be honoured or funds will be allocated on the basis of partial payments. It says in the explanatory memorandum that this varies from most schemes. It does indeed. Here we have a situation where a bounty is given to stimulate an industry and then set up in such a way that the industry will expect a certain bounty and may receive less or nothing. For a government that cites the need for `investor confidence as a reason to deny claims to the environment and social justice, it seems strange that it could happily create such uncertainty. Perhaps there is such a bias against the environment that the government thinks any industry with a whiff of greenness should be penalised. Let me reassure honourable senators that supporting the private motor car is not terribly green, and it is probably okay to treat fuel alcohol like other industries getting bounties.To conclude, we will support the bill and the amendments but would like to see eliminated the strange arrangement where a bounty is not really to be paid as stated or where it is not to be paid equally. We would like to see a commitment by the government to the principle that the level of bounty set will be the level paid and all valid claims shall be honoured. This could be done by eliminating subclause 29(2) but, at a minimum, it should be through an undertaking that, in the case of shortfall, additional appropriations will be put up and supported by government.","N/A","BOUNTY (FUEL ETHANOL) BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
155,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SCHACHT","4J4","(South Australia-","ALP","Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction)",177,"—As outlined by other senators, the Bounty (Fuel Ethanol) Bill proposes the payment of a bounty on the production of a certain fuel ethanol in Australia to assist in the development of a competitive, robust and ecologically sustainable fuel ethanol industry. The bill is part of a package of lead abatement measures announced in the 1993 budget which will complement initiatives announced in December 1992 by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his environment statement relating to a guarantee of the excise-free status of alternative fuels for a further four years as well as support for new ethanol production technology.The government is confident that the measures in the proposed bounty scheme will encourage the establishment of a competitive—I emphasise `competitive—ethanol transport fuel industry in Australia developed on an environmentally sustainable basis. The government will also assist in overcoming the technical and administrative barriers to the use of ethanol as a transport fuel with a $3.94 million research and development program over the next two years. That program will develop an ethanol fuel standard, extensively trial the use of ethanol blended fuels in vehicles and develop further improvements in ethanol fuels.I welcome the unanimous support for the bill. I thank all senators for their contributions to this debate.

The purpose of this amendment was, as I think Senator Margetts pointed out, to avoid penalising the excellent work Manildra has done over some considerable time before the bounty actually comes into operation. The bill as it stands would have the effect that a company which had entered into production earlier might well be penalised permanently throughout the bounty period by reason of the fact that it had made this production before the bounty scheme began.However, on the other side we have had from the advisers to the minister the very good point that the purpose of this bill is to do two things: to encourage the use of ethanol specifically for fuel but also to ensure that there is new ethanol production for that purpose brought on line. On balance, and bearing in mind that we understand that the government is not supporting this amendment, we have to accept that this amendment would not get up and therefore we will not proceed with it.I reiterate very strongly that Manildra is a company that showed a very strong commitment to fuel ethanol before the bounty scheme came into place.

182,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BELL","7U4","(Tasmania)","AD","N/A",181,"—Those who are observant may be aware of a number of questions on notice concerning overseas students that I have addressed to the minister responsible for the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Certainly the department and the minister have become aware of these questions and some sections of the media are beginning to realise that Australia has a pretty shabby record in this area. It began in the mid-1980s, when Mr Dawkins was Minister for Employment, Education and Training. The government at that stage discovered a new, lucrative source of income in the form of thousands of Asian students needing to learn English and to undertake other studies by coming to Australia and paying for the courses in private colleges.With government promotion, demand steadily increased. In 1986, the government streamlined overseas student entry provisions and introduced a student visa system which entitled students who had been accepted into an accredited course, after paying full fees, to a visa entry to Australia on the presentation of an official acceptance advice form. That policy was successful. A dramatic increase in the number of fee-paying students resulted, with student arrivals increasing by 800 per cent between 1986 and 1989 in the ELICOS sector alone. Servicing this increase led to an explosion in the number of private education institutions.It should be emphasised that until January 1990 the Department of Employment, Education and Training accredited private institutions to provide English and business courses to overseas students. The criteria by which institutions were accredited included management, course content, premises, qualifications of staff, welfare services to students and financial viability. I specifically emphasise that last criterion.After 1987, an inspection by an independent panel of experts was needed for the initial and provisional accreditation, which was to be followed by a further inspection. According to the minister, a further inspection by an independent panel of experts was required to confirm that institutions could demonstrate that they offered high standards of English instruction and business practice and that they continued to meet the above criteria. If an institution successfully demonstrated that it met these requirements, full accreditation was granted on an indefinite basis, subject to review every three years.I am emphasising these points to illustrate the degree of accreditation, examination and supervision of these expanding institutions. On the basis of this accreditation, encouraged by the minister and his department, institutions actively sought overseas students. However, while the initiative worked in the sense of increasing the numbers and in terms of fees being paid, other concerns were being expressed.It was suggested that the new, relaxed visa arrangements were being exploited by some students and some institutions, and it was said that the regulations allowed what were called `non-genuine students, primarily interested in working in Australia, to enter Australia too easily. For example, one report from 1990 that I have seen quotes a departmental adviser at a seminar telling his audience that ELICOS had become, in his words, `a non-compliance nightmare, and that it had `contributed to the overstay problem. I quote from a letter to me from Minister Crean of 3 March this year, which refers to `serious concern about the large number of overseas students, particularly from China, breaking Australian migration law either by remaining in Australia after completion of their studies or using the educational programs, particularly ELICOS, as a means of back door migration.In response to these so-called concerns, some relatively minor modifications were made to the visa system in 1987 and 1988. In August 1989 the government introduced new, tighter entry conditions to visa applicants in a move which, according to Minister Crean, was to deal with the perceived overstay problem. New checks on bona fides were instituted, a minimum educational level was required, an age limit of 35 was introduced, and dependants were not permitted to accompany students. In addition, institutions were told not to issue advice acceptance forms to new students from the Peoples Republic of China. The minister claims that this was done with the cooperation of private colleges, and with the expectation that refunds would have to be made by the educational institutions which had taken fees from prospective students.A report in the Canberra Times in September 1989 refers to 25,000 students being involved. This is no matter of small concern, this is a matter of great national importance: 25,000 students were involved in 1989. That is, 25,000 potential students had paid fees which were reportedly up to $5,000 each, and had been accepted into colleges; but suddenly, in order to gain a student visa they had to meet changed conditions—conditions which were different from those they had originally been informed about.Of course, in the expectation of ongoing student numbers, the colleges had made financial commitments for their courses. They had arranged extra accommodation, they had paid for printing, extra staff had been engaged, et cetera. You can imagine the amount of money involved in that, Mr Acting Deputy President. An estimate at the time was an expected loss to private accredited colleges of at least $25 million.Around October 1989 an agreement was reached between the government and the industry that refunds, with an additional payment of $100 each, would be issued by the colleges to each of the students who were to be denied entry under these new, arbitrarily applied conditions. The government would investigate the case for financial assistance to institutions which suffered cash flow problems as a result of the cutback in students. It is claimed that the government reneged on this arrangement. The arrangement had been with private colleges, and the government reneged by imposing such harsh conditions for eligibility for government loans that not one loan application was granted for the full amount of the application.We know the story from then on. Many colleges collapsed and went out of business as the number of students dried up. For example, whereas in 1989 and 1990 there were more than 20,000 visas issued by the Beijing embassy, in 1990-91 following the crackdown there were 1,579—from anything up to a possible 40,000 applications.The federal budget of June 1990 provided $50 million for loans to colleges to enable the department to provide direct refunds to students who had been denied an entry visa. The plan was to later recover the money from the institution with which the student had been enrolled. According to the minister, as at January 1994, a total of $66.076 million has been paid to students and $3.978 million has been recovered. Of the institutions involved, some 60 per cent have closed, with many in liquidation.The minister has provided a breakdown of the $62.098 million which has not yet been recovered. The amount owed if pending court cases or liquidations are successful is $33.926 million; the amount to be paid under negotiated or court sanctioned agreements is $1.091 million; and the amount to be written off is $6.746 million. The remainder of that, $20.335 million, is obviously not calculated in that breakdown. We can only presume that that also needs to be written off. I venture to suggest that the $33.9 million that is supposed to be forthcoming, if pending court cases and liquidations are successful, is an ambitious expectation.The recovery program is implemented by what is known as the China task force. Since 1990 this force has cost us, the taxpayer, $4.3 million to administer. The whole project has cost us $70 million. All we know is that about $3.9 million has been recovered to this point. Where the rest is coming from is a matter of some considerable conjecture. None of this takes account of the cost of compliance measures that have to be put in place by the colleges. Various observations suggest that that cost may be an additional $20 million.In recent answers to questions the minister attempted to praise the results of the governments overseas education initiatives. He praised the growth in the university sector. It recorded an income from educational exports in 1993 of $710 million compared with only $115 million in 1988. That praise is indeed properly given. However, the figures the minister quoted showed an increase in the private sector of only $190 million, including a substantial reduction in the English language sector from $200 million in 1988 to $120 million in 1993. Why? Is it true, as some in the industry have suggested, that the departments real goal is to eliminate the private colleges from the field? Is this government policy? If it is not policy, it would seem that the department has certainly got it wrong. It has obviously failed to implement whatever the government policy is.By any analysis of proper management, the initiation, encouragement, establishment of goals and purpose, and the monitoring and evaluation of overseas exports of education by the Department of Employment, Education and Training, and the government, have been an unmitigated disaster. Scores of businesses have collapsed, individuals have been financially crippled, millions of dollars of taxpayers money has been squandered and Australias reputation has been perhaps irrevocably damaged. Even though an inquiry by the Industry Commission resulted in some changes to the act, I would suggest that it was after the horse had bolted. No-one has been asked to take responsibility or even been required to explain the many inconsistencies.The government and the minister are attempting to explain it all away in terms of past mistakes now rectified. But it is simply not good enough; too many fundamental questions remain about the way the department is managed, about the way it evaluates and monitors its performance and about the way it sets its goals. Why were colleges required to refund any fees when they had already acted on a policy initiative of the government to expand education exports that had been accredited by the department, as I have explained, after `appropriate checks and after they had followed government and departmental directives?If increasing rates of `overstay were causing concern, why did not the departments investigation of reports from colleges enable offenders to be identified and deported? Why was not the problem, so-called, properly examined and rectified in a manner other than a unilateral crackdown on providing visas to innocent students who had paid fees?Is it true that only private colleges were forced by the department to keep meticulous records of attendances of overseas students, but not universities and government colleges? Again, why were these private college records not adequately monitored and acted upon? If private educational institutions were `cashing in on a desire for a backdoor immigration path, why did the accreditation monitoring not identify such colleges? We had the accreditation in place. Surely the monitoring was taking place and surely it was possible to identify such colleges. If so, it is not clear that anything was done about it.Why is it that the exciting, brave new world of millions of dollars from exports of education, initially seen to be available to the private sector, has taken a back seat to providing a source of income for universities? There is nothing particularly wrong with universities making a profit out of it, but that has been pursued to the disadvantage of the other sectors. One has to ask: what effect will this have on the tertiary education system of the future? There are many fundamental questions still to be answered. The evasion so far does not provide any reason to be confident that the Department of Employment, Education and Training is properly set up or structured to meet its responsibilities.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1[1]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am speaking this week because it is Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week. The society is running a number of functions to let people who have multiple sclerosis, who have recently contracted it and who are perhaps not aware of the society, know what services are offered and what goes on. There is to be an open day so that people can visit and find out what can happen at the society.There is another reason why I am pleased to raise this matter at this time. There is now a new minister for health, Dr Lawrence, and I want to make a plea to her to have a look at the situation that exists. I hope she will have enough sense and compassion to understand that the academic rules that operate under the Disability Services Act have precluded the respite care centre from being able to operate in the manner for which it was constructed. I hope she will go there and, understanding the need for the facility to operate as it should, make funding available in the same way as it is made available in other circumstances.The society in the ACT was incorporated in November 1978 to offer facilities for people with multiple sclerosis, not just in the ACT but in the area. The society has been significantly funded by Miss Gloria McKerrow. She has been most generous in relation to the construction of both stages of the proposal. The facility is not far from here—about seven minutes away at the most—in the suburb of Deakin. It comprises a day care centre, which was built first, and some fairly small administrative offices. The day care centre is a place that people suffering from multiple sclerosis can visit to meet other people, to discuss their common problems and complaints, to take part in activities and generally to enjoy being away from their homes and in an environment where they can mix with other people for a time.The premises were built in three stages, not just at the whim of somebody deciding to build it but only after careful and detailed consultation with people suffering from multiple sclerosis to ascertain what members of the society and their families believed would be of benefit and assistance to them—some offices, the day care centre and, perhaps most needed, some respite beds. The respite beds were a second stage of construction. This consisted of a four-bedroom unit within what looks like a small cottage adjacent to, but not attached to, the day care centre.For some reason, this has run foul of the Disability Services Act—of course, the act is not only what is put into place; it is the way it is interpreted. It is an absurd academic criterion that says that, because this place is not in a residential area, it cannot be funded. The respite care house is no more than half a kilometre from housing in the suburb of Deakin. If it were amongst those other houses, apparently, it could get funding for respite care. But, because it is next to the day care centre, it is precluded. I defy anybody to explain to me the logic of interpreting the rules in this way. People who want to go there, or need to go there for respite care, would be glad, on the days that they are there, to have the opportunity to go to the day care centre—some yards away—where they could meet and enjoy the company of other people during that brief period.However, from 1989—when the centre was opened—for those absurd reasons it has not been able to operate with government funding as a respite care centre. It has operated to a limited extent with the limited funds the society has had available to it. This is not the way it was intended to operate but still the absurdity goes on. Those going there this week to inspect the facilities as part of awareness week will see what is happening.There are more than 100 members in the society who may need, and like, to have access to the respite care centre from time to time. I think everybody agrees that people like to live in their own homes and that the facilities should enable them to do so. Respite care is available in peoples home. A carer can move in to look after somebody for a period of time but it is not always possible and it is not always in the best interests. There are times—for example, when a house needs to be painted or have a new roof put on it—when respite care, away from the principal place of residence, is absolutely reasonable.However, why does the respite care house have to be in a suburb? Why cannot it be half a kilometre away from that suburb next to the day care centre, so that during the day the person in the respite house could move to the enjoyable surroundings of the day care centre, and be able to take part in craft activities or book readings or whatever else might be going on there at the time? My plea to Dr Lawrence is that she have a look at this piece of absurdity and do something about it. This respite house is sitting there not being adequately used.I am not suggesting that people with multiple sclerosis in the ACT are not able to get access to respite care. They are eligible for respite care in their own home—whereby a carer goes to them—in the same way that other people are under the scheme. With the number of people suffering from multiple sclerosis in our community, a four-bedroom respite care house would probably not be adequate, if that were the only place where they could get respite care.The need to have a carer go into the home is a part of providing respite care, and this other facility is another part of the care. The facility has a most beautiful view across Woden Valley and the Brindabella Ranges. Anyone who goes there will see that it is purpose-built. It is a really nice small house with suitable bedrooms and suitable space for carers. People can go there for two or three days, or perhaps a week, if need be, and enjoy being in those surroundings—and make use of the other facilities available.As I said, I have talked about this before and it is still beyond my comprehension that this should be the case. There are a number of young people with multiple sclerosis in our society and the only place they can live if they are not able to be accommodated at home is in a nursing home. That is another aspect of this matter. One might decide that young people should be able to live in this facility for at least part of the time and be amongst others of a similar age, as against those with whom they are forced to mix at the present time. It is another aspect of this story.But the principal story stands on its own. That society has raised funds to build these facilities. It has had some government assistance with the day care centre. It has raised the capital sums involved but the money provided and made available by the federal government for respite care cannot be used at this facility because of the absurd academic rules. They seem to have been laid down with absolutely no consideration for the needs of the people concerned or the desires that they had when they expressed the view that a facility right there would be of great benefit to them.We have had a number of ministers for health; some have even expressed concern about it and shown interest. I know Dr Blewett visited the facility; I was there at the time. I thought he understood the problem; I thought he recognised the benefits that flowed from the place as it was, but nothing happened. Somewhere out there, there seem to be people pulling strings who say, `If you dont fit in with our rules, you dont get any consideration, no matter how sensible what youre doing might be.So today, in Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week, I make a personal plea to Dr Lawrence to whom I have written. `Please go and have a look at the facility. Please look at it from the point of view of people with multiple sclerosis who could get real benefit from being able to use this place. Please make funding available for them to use it as a respite centre. Do not allow yourself to be tied up in rules and red tape and do not allow yourself to deny the small amount of funding which would make life simpler and more comfortable for some of those people with multiple sclerosis in our community.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
184,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator LEES","8U4","(South Australia-","AD","Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats)",186,"—I again highlight the crisis facing rural Australia. I question whether, unless there is a commitment from government now in mid-1994, there is any future for many farming families. Last session my colleague Senator Woodley and I detailed the dire situation being faced by many rural communities where farmers have high levels of debt and very low incomes. Indeed, in many cases they have no income at all, with commodity prices at record lows.Today I would like to look particularly at the experience of the wheat and barley growers in my home state of South Australia. The majority of these farmers are in areas where they cannot diversify due to the various geographic features of their location. Many of these growers have experienced two very good years, particularly in the Mallee. Two very good seasons have seen record levels of production, better than anything they have ever achieved before. However, the financial hardship continues thanks to the incredibly low incomes. In other words, the incomes that have been generated, even by these record crops, have not met the basic costs of production.If we look at the average farm figures across Australia, we see that we are looking at incomes for many of about $50 a week if they are lucky. The unsustainably low levels of income are placing huge stresses on farm families. They are the direct cause of many suicides. The low levels of income are also impacting on machinery investment. In many regions the lack of machinery investment is creating problems with both efficiency and productivity. Low incomes also impact on environmental programs and lead to land use patterns that are not sustainable. They threaten the excellent work being done by landcare programs.I will look at machinery problems. These are being experienced by many farmers in the Mallee. They simply cannot get the job done quickly enough with the old machinery that they are forced to continue to use. In marginal farming areas, the timing of planting is crucial. If there are continuing machinery problems, the results can simply be that the acreage planted is less than it should be. Therefore, productivity drops and there is less grain for the export markets.Low incomes are forcing many farmers in 1994 to look at what they are going to plant, and many farmers are reducing their plantings substantially. I have a couple of examples, again from the Mallee. Two brothers, who two years ago sowed 3,300 acres of barley, will this year sow only 1,400 acres, as their finances simply do not permit anything more. At the other end of the scale, on a much smaller property another farm family, which normally sows around 800 acres, will this year sow only around 500 acres due to the low commodity prices.One finds from talking to farming groups throughout this region of South Australia, and indeed across South Australia, that this situation goes on and on. The suggestion is that we may see some 30 per cent less grain being planted this year than should be planted. If this trend continues, there will not be enough grain produced to service the export markets that have been built up over many years. In the 1990s, farmers are having to cope with grain prices lower than they were in the 1970s, but the input costs, of course, are in 1990 figures. In other words, the prices of Australian wheat and barley have fallen to levels far below the cost of production.The lower prices have been caused by the protracted trade war between the United States and the European Union. They have nothing to do with the effectiveness of our farmers. They are the most productive farmers in the world. If we could level the playing field tomorrow, we would do very nicely. Unfortunately, as the government has found to its cost and to the cost of our farmers, a level playing field is a myth, and I doubt whether we will ever get anywhere near that situation. Subsidised sales from both sides—from the European Community as well as from the United States—have slashed world prices.The farmers I spoke to believe that basically they have three options. The first is that they can go ahead and plant, knowing that the current prices will mean that they will lose money, much of which is borrowed, unless seasonal conditions are so favourable for a third year in a row that they get absolutely extraordinary levels of production yet again. The second choice is to go ahead and plant and hope that prices will rise by harvest time, but they do that in the knowledge that the final GATT agreement cleared the way for more subsidised grain from the US and the European Community to flow on to the world market. The third choice is not to plant at all and watch the United States and Europe take over Australias traditional markets, with Australian becoming known on the international market scene as an unreliable supplier.Unfortunately, the only response the farmers seem to be getting from the government is, `GATT is going to solve everything. Dont worry. Everything will be fine. The farmers believe that, from the year 2000, there may well be benefits, but how do they get to the year 2000? Once those benefits begin to flow, they see a future. But until we get there, between 1994 and the year 2000 all the indicators point to grain growers having the hardest time of their lives just to survive. They do not have anything spare to draw on to get them through these years.If the government does not act now, there could be a number of serious consequences. There could be an increased population shift from rural areas of Australia into the cities. This is occurring now, and it could well increase. While farmers are highly skilled in their particular trades, many of them have no formal qualifications. Many are aged over 40, an age when it is extremely difficult not just to get a job but to get into a whole new career. Most farmers, I imagine, will be destined to spend at least some time in unemployment queues.Another probability is that farm families will be displaced, and that will open the door to corporate farming ventures in which profit will be the sole motive. Not only will this mean a continued massive loss of people, if not the loss of towns, in rural Australia, but I believe it will also be an environmental disaster, as they will not take care of that very fragile landscape. Eventually, the cost of repairing that landscape will have to be met by the taxpayers.What we could have developing, and this has been put to me by people as I have visited rural Australia over the last few weeks, is a peasant class. Indeed, many argue that that has already been created. Many farm families are hanging on, surviving on a subsistence basis, not even able to sell their farms if they want to because there simply are not any buyers—or there are no buyers with any sort of a price that would leave the farmers with anything with which to move to the city. Then, of course, there is the loss of export markets if we simply do not go ahead and produce the grain. One set of arguments suggests, `No worries, well go back in the year 2000 and get back into the markets. But the fact is that the people with all the infrastructure and the expertise needed to produce those grains simply will not be available.As Senator Woodley and I stated in February, there needs to be a commitment from government, a change of political will, a commitment that something will be done about the rural crisis in Australia. The grain growers have been meeting across South Australia and have been calling for a variety of possible assistance measures, most of which are available in other developed countries. They believe that these assistance measures would provide a stimulus for investment, employment and productivity as well as reduce the enormous stress levels on farming families.The costings I have seen suggest that these measures would be less costly than funding farmers and their families through the range of support services they are going to need if they do end up in the cities; that is, support through the CES, the DSS, housing support and additional support through the health system. As all the statistics show us, people on low incomes with very high stress levels have a much greater call on the Medicare system than do those people who have a reasonable level of income and far less stress.After four years of depression, Australias farmers, farming families and communities have run down machinery, run down farm infrastructure—fences, et cetera—and very low morale. Public infrastructure such as railways is disappearing, and roads are getting worse as more and more of what was sent on the railways is now going on road. We see local governments not able to recoup part of their costs; we see rates not being able to be paid; we see lower school enrolments; and we see other public and private services disappearing. We see further pressure on the local policeman. Do they even keep one or can they simply operate from a district police centre? We see hospitals under threat and, indeed, some are faced with closure. Even churches are struggling to keep their presence in communities. It is time the government acted to ensure that as many Australian farmers as possible reach the next century so that those benefits that they perceive, those benefits that GATT promises, may actually be able to be delivered.The Democrats believe that time is of the essence. We cannot leave this problem another year; we cannot see the government sit on its hands for even another six months. As time is of the essence, the Democrats will be looking at extending the terms of reference of the inquiry that has just been set up to look into the rural adjustment scheme. We believe those terms of reference should be extended along the lines of what the grain growers are requesting. Those extended terms of reference would be as follows:(a)the current structure and competitiveness of the wheat and coarse grain industry includes the identification of strengths and weaknesses;(b)an examination of the contribution of the industry to the Australian economy, including its contribution to the further development of regional economies;(c)the potential for further development of the industry, including the identification of export market opportunities;(d)identification of any impediments to growth and exports, and any measures which could be undertaken to remove such impediments or otherwise contribute to the growth or export development of the industry, in ways that are consistent with the principles of efficient resource use within the Australian economy;(e)the appropriate form and level of price structure and subsidy for the industry, taking into account the ability of the industry to achieve its domestic and export potential, and the price support and subsidy regimes applied in other countries and Australian industries;(f)implementation strategies for any suggested measures;(g)the effect on the industry, consumers, and the economy in general of any measures recommended.All of the issues I have raised today have been raised with the minister. As yet, I understand, there has been no formal reply. I look forward to the ministers response and I look forward to hearing that the government is actually going to act.Sitting suspended from 1.26 p.m. to 2.00 p.m.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1[3]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am not sure exactly how the employment minister would currently define that.

190,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","VIC","ALP","N/A",189,"—I am aware of the concerns expressed by the residents of Darwin in relation to noise caused by military aircraft. Those concerns have been brought to my attention by a range of political figures, including my colleagues Senator Collins and Warren Snowdon. However, it is important to put into perspective the reasons why our operations in the north are so crucial to defence and will continue to be so.The RAAF base Darwin is a forward operational base designed to cater for the air defence of Darwin and its maritime approaches, and also for the support of air operations and training. Exercises of the type currently under way are essential to maintain this capability. However, we do recognise the problem of noise for the Darwin community and are moving to accommodate its concerns as best we can.The air force has in place a program updating the noise exposure forecasts for all bases around Australia, including Darwin. This involves a gathering of data such as the number of flights and the flight paths. That data is fed into a computer model which profiles those areas affected by noise. The scheduled Australian noise exposure forecast plan for Darwin airfield later this year has now been brought forward as a matter of urgency. I anticipate the forecast will be completed by, at the latest, July.Discussions are being held with the national acoustic laboratory for it to undertake noise measurements at Darwin during a major military exercise at the RAAF base. This will most likely occur later this year to coincide with exercise Pitch Black in the August-September period. There have been some suggestions that we should bring these tests forward, but the timing of these tests has been specifically chosen to coincide with one of the major exercises to ensure that these measurements are taken at one of the busiest times rather than one of the quieter times. We will certainly be looking closely at the results of these studies when they are available.I am also aware of allegations that visiting pilots are straying from their designated flight plans and agreed procedures. This is a matter of great concern to me. In view of that concern and the concern expressed by others, today I directed the Deputy Chief of Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Fisher, to visit Darwin probably next week to investigate first-hand all these issues; to report back to me personally so that I can be assured that there is no abrogation of the current flight plans; and, if there is, to put procedures into place to make sure it never occurs again.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The value of having a Labor government in office is shown by having a country with a growth rate now at the highest evel in the entire OECD—over a four per cent growth rate; the highest growth rate of any country in the 24 developed nations that make up the OECD. The value of a Labor govern ment is shown in having productivity increase by 30 per cent over the last 10 years. The value of a Labor government is shown by having business consumer confidence at the highest level it has been for years.The value of a Labor government is shown by having official interest rates at their lowest levels for 20 years. The value of a Labor government is shown by having increases in international competitiveness that have produced already an environment in which 60 per cent of our exports are now penetrating the fastest growing region economically in the world—namely, east Asia.

We have recently seen the super ministry of transport and communications split into two new departments and the splitting up of health and housing, and now the big question marks which surround the operation of DEET. Does the government accept that the creation of super ministries by Prime Minister Hawke has exacerbated the management and accountability problems now evident in DEET? Is the Prime Minister still confident that super ministries are an appropriate management structure, or are they something more than that? What have they delivered, or are they just part of an extension of patronage?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[5]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
202,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","VIC","ALP","N/A",192,"—So far as transport and communications is concerned, I think that the utility of that particular conjunction of portfolios at that stage was because the government business enterprise issue ran right across the whole spectrum of that combined portfolio. Exactly the same set of issues were involved in terms of corporatising and then creating the conditions for privatising the major government business enterprises in every component of that whole spectrum of transport and communications. As that issue of corporatisation, and subsequently in some areas privatisation, was steadily resolved as the nature of the policy issues changed over the years it became less obviously necessary, desirable or helpful to keep those often very different sets of policy areas in harness: that is the reason why it was decided to break those apart again.The foreign affairs and trade yoking together at the same time has proved to be spectacularly successful in generating an economic culture to the extent that that was previously lacking on the foreign affairs side of the portfolio, and also giving a new kind of access and dynamism on the trade side of the portfolio in its capacity to work, particularly in overseas posts, in much closer association with the existing foreign affairs network. Nobody has wanted to unwind that operation because the dynamics are working very well indeed.So far as the Department of Employment, Education and Training is concerned, there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that there is anything inappropriate or no longer conceptually helpful about keeping the different components of those together. The issue has been considered and reconsidered from time to time. The government does not accept the allegations that have been made. If there is anything fundamentally wrong with the administration of DEET at the moment, certainly it is not such as to require any fundamental root and branch review of the basic premises on which that department was put together.So far as health, housing and community services is concerned, there was always a question mark at the outset as to whether there was any very compelling inherent logic about bringing together that group of rather disparate policy and program areas. In fact, as time has passed it has been thought to be more sensible to rearrange and recast that area with the results that you have seen.Of the four major conglomerate portfolios that were put together during the Hawke years, two of them still retain their rationale, viability and vitality. As to the other two, other sorts of decisions have been made for the reasons I have indicated. I do not think Senator Kernot can or should draw any larger conclusions of the kind that she is trying to from that experience.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[5]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Yesterday the South Australian government announced a potential major reduction in education levels in South Australia, despite promising at the last state election to increase spending in the 1994 budget, keep school closures to an absolute minimum and maintain current class averages. There is a striking contradiction between that promise and the announcement made yesterday.Today in our white paper statement we will announce major initiatives in training and education. We want to assure the people of South Australia that the Commonwealth will maintain its commitment to education. I point out that we supply $210 million worth of funding to schools in South Australia, and that will be maintained. We also provide $50 million for TAFE in South Australia, and that will be maintained. We want to assure the people of South Australia that, whatever these drastic cuts in education in South Australia may be, the Commonwealth government will not run away from its commitment, unlike the Dean Brown government which is running away from the commitment it made last November.We want to point out particularly that we will maintain the major policy initiatives in vocational training of the last year or so by pouring over $100 million into vocational training. On behalf of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Mr Ross Free, I point out that we expect the state government to maintain its commitment to vocational training. On behalf of the federal government, I assure honourable senators, the parents, students, teachers and trainers of South Australia that the Commonwealth will be watching the Brown government very closely indeed to ensure that that amount of funding is not cut. If it becomes clear that the South Australian government is reducing expenditure on vocational training, we will take other action.We do not believe that this reduction in education is good for Australia. The best asset South Australia has is the quality of its people. It is just scandalous for the Dean Brown government now to suddenly, out of the blue, go back on its promise by cutting 150 schools and 1,800 teachers. We want to assure the people of South Australia that the Commonwealth will maintain its commitment to education in South Australia, unlike the Liberal Party which in government in South Australia is wasting it.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[6]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

Because of that, we operate a very restrictive policy which prohibits foreign purchases of established housing. This policy came into existence in September 1987. It is not new; it has been around for over seven years.It works on the basis that only temporary residents—that is, students, people here on work visas, et cetera—and foreign companies buying for their senior executives can buy established houses for their own use whilst they are in Australia. However, the government does permit foreign interests to invest in the residential real estate sector for development purposes.

219,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","VIC","ALP","N/A",196,"—The government believes that the prospects for concluding a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty are now very positive. All the nuclear weapon states are committed to negotiation of such a treaty and negotiations on it commenced in January at the conference on disarmament in Geneva. Negotiations are making steady progress on both the core articles of the treaty and the technical aspects—the difficult ones of verifying compliance. The Australian delegation, as with the chemical weapons exercise before it, has played a very active role in advancing these negotiations. We have tabled a complete draft treaty as a reference point for the conference in developing agreed treaty language.United States leadership in this matter has also been extremely important, with the US delegation in Geneva playing a very constructive role. President Clinton announced on 14 March that he had decided to extend for another year the US moratorium on its nuclear testing program until September 1995. I have written to Secretary of State Christopher welcoming that decision, and certainly it has been very important in creating the right atmosphere for these negotiations to proceed. It is also the case that France and Russia are maintaining their testing moratoriums. I am particularly pleased about that and about the extension of the US moratorium in so far as they occurred notwithstanding Chinas resumption of testing in October last year.On the subject of China, it has said that it remains committed to the negotiation of a test ban treaty by 1996. We have, nonetheless, heard reports that China has announced that it will again resume nuclear testing shortly. We hope there is no substance in those reports, but we cannot be sure of that. We have been urging China to join the other weapon states in a moratorium on its national programs. We, and many other countries, protested Chinas last nuclear test in October last year. We continue to urge China to refrain from further testing. I raised the issue just a few weeks ago in Beijing with Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, and will continue to do so.The commitment of the international community to a comprehensive test ban treaty is demonstrated by the fact that, at the last UN General Assembly last year, a resolution calling for such a treaty was, for the first time, passed not by a majority vote but by consensus. As lead sponsor of that resolution, we were delighted to secure for it a record number of co-sponsors—the highest in the UN General Assemblys history: 156 co-sponsors of that resolution.Early conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty will, of course, directly help prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, which remains our other major objective in the nuclear area. As a step toward nuclear disarmament by the nuclear weapon states, it will certainly improve the prospects for indefinite extension of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty at the extension and review conference scheduled for April and May next year.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[10]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At the time of that announcement, he made it clear that there were a number of reasons for that. He cited Dr Vince Fitzgeralds report on national savings. Dr Fitzgerald suggested in that report that the policy would more likely lead to an increase in the average size or quality of dwellings, rather than an increase in the rate of home ownership per se.Another reason, and a quite forceful one, put forward by the Treasurer at that time was that circumstances and conditions in the housing industry had changed dramatically since that policy was announced. In fact, we have had a projection announced in recent days of the number of housing units to be built in Australia—a very high level of 170,000 for the forthcoming financial year—a figure which, when one compares it to recent housing starts, stands very much above the average of recent years.The other important factor cited by the Treasurer, and one that we must keep in consideration, is that home ownership affordability is now at its highest level since 1984. One of the major reasons for that has been the reduction in housing interest rates—some half of what they were a couple of years ago. That has had an immediate impact on home ownership affordability. As I said, that affordability is now at its highest level in almost 10 years.The Treasurer also noted—and this argument is also relevant in response to Senator Tamblings question—that there are other possible ways for super funds to flow into housing financing markets without the need for legislative arrangements. One such initiative was announced on 18 April this year by the National Mutual Group and the ACTU. Under this particular initiative, home loans will be made to members of superannuation funds at interest rates lower than those currently afforded by most other lenders.The governments objective, in terms of the policy announced in the election, is still very much our objective—that is, to ensure that home ownership affordability can be achieved at high levels. We have achieved that because of the factors I have mentioned. The objective is still very much in our sight. The Treasurer announced on 19 April—and I can restate it now—that we have found other ways of ensuring that objective can be met.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[11]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

225,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COOK","RF4","WA","ALP","N/A",197,"—I thank Senator Woodley for his question and for following through on this issue. The Industry Commission is conducting an inquiry into charities in Australia. I might say that it is doing so because a number of leading charities see that as a virtuous and useful course of action for the Industry Commission to undertake.The charity industry in Australia is a very big industry handling millions of dollars. This inquiry is about helping to find ways in which charities can be more efficient in the delivery of donated dollars to their client base. One recognises the idealistic, laudable and very necessary role of the charities industry. An efficiency audit of this sort will help it. Indeed, criticisms of mismanagement in charities from time to time may well be defrayed by such an inquiry.However, Senator Woodley is right in saying that back in March, when I answered a question like this from him then, the information I had from the Industry Commission was that it would do all it possibly could to minimise costs on charitable organisations in making submissions to it. I understand that that is the case, and that it has instituted various inquiry mechanisms different from its ordinary industry inquiries in recognition of the fact that one does not want to divert the overheads of charities into answering submissions. It has done so by having representatives of groups of charities sit and talk things through with the commission, rather than put them to the effort of preparing overarching submissions. Senator Woodley concluded his series of questions to me today, however, by asking:Will the minister—in this case the Treasurer—now give consideration to allocating funds to reimburse those charities—I do not have a brief from the Treasurer on this subject.

241,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COLLINS","OF4","NT","ALP","N/A",199,"—Yesterday my colleague the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, and I chaired the first meeting of the Australian trade and investment packages ministerial council. As has just been stated, the ministerial council was established as a result of recommendations of the Garnaut report. The objectives of the council—I am sure Senator McMullan would agree that it was very successful in meeting those objectives—is to ensure a coordinated and focused approach to the future development of our important wool markets from Australia in terms of the numerous representations and activity overseas by a number of government agencies and, of course, the private sector. The council provides a mechanism to ensure the resources that are applied by government are being targeted to effectively support the overall development of this vitally important Australian industry.Yesterdays meeting was attended by representatives from all sectors of the industry and all government agencies that are involved in promoting and developing the sale of Australian wool and wool textiles. The meeting, as I said, was successful. Agreement was reached on the priority markets that are to be targeted by the various agencies and a work program was agreed for those markets. The key elements of the work program focus on improving the coordination of industry development and market access activities by both the government and private sectors. The council agreed that China and India were to be the prime targets in the development of markets for Australian wool. In the last financial year, for example, China purchased about $675 million worth of Australian wool, making China now our most important single customer.I was certainly pleased with the recent approval by my colleague the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, Gordon Bilney, of a $4 million package to boost assistance provided to the Chinese wool processing and textile industry. This is a very tangible demonstration of the governments commitment to ensuring its programs are effectively working together and is a significant contribution to the wool industry in Australia.The package was developed jointly by the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation and the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau. They recognise, as does the government, that China is of vital importance to the future of the Australian wool industry. On top of the $675 million I have just talked about, there is enormous potential for increased sales to China. We will discuss with key leaders in China how best to implement the programs based on the package with the aim of maximising mutual benefits in further developing the wool industry in China. In fact, an important meeting in order to do this will be taking place in about two weeks time.The importance of linking market development strategies to the funding activities of international financial institutions such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was also clearly identified at yesterdays meeting. The council has requested that a detailed analysis of that issue be prepared for the next meeting, which is scheduled to take place in October. At that time we will be able to examine in detail the progress that has been made on the work program we agreed to yesterday and also how new opportunities have been identified in the meantime.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[14]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This will be the first time since the Moscow Olympics that our athletes have not been dependent on the federal government for financial assistance for these purposes.I stress that, while the government welcomes this announcement, it did not occur because the government refused to provide this type of funding. It has occurred because of what I think is a very good example of the Olympic Committees initiative in developing marketing and fundraising options. I think it is also a very good indication of the widespread corporate and community support that exists for the year 2000 games.I think it is worth noting that this announcement was made during an exhibition of handball held in the Great Hall of Parliament House.

In the Senate, it is usually insults; in the case of handball, it is something else. It is a sport which is fairly new on the scene here in Australia, but it is played to very significant audiences in Europe and Asia, and it is a very long established Olympic sport. Australia has not competed in a handball competition at the Olympic level before, but we will in the year 2000.As the host country, we will not only participate in that sort of sport but also automatically qualify for all team sports. This means that quite a number of lesser-known Olympic sports, such as softball, volleyball and baseball, will be fielding teams at the 2000 games. I think this is good news for Australia, because it gives many more Australian athletes an opportunity to compete at Olympic level. Successful performances by all our Olympic athletes will certainly serve as an inspiration to the broader Australian community to participate in sporting activities.For its part, the federal government will concentrate more on the training needs of our athletes in the lead-up to the Olympics.

However, we still have not improved the prospects of the one million people who have been unemployed now for a number of years.

The government has put down eight major economic statements and has produced 12 budgets. In November 1991 we had the One Nation package, a youth package in 1992, the document Working for the Future , the employment incentive scheme, government statements and a green paper on employment and unemployment. However, the only solution by the present government to this increasing problem is to boost spending on labour market programs and training schemes.Last year a sum of $1.3 billion was spent to artificially create 644,000 places. Today the government brings in another paper which, again artificially, will take 37,000 younger people off the dole. Then the unemployment scheme for the older age group will remove another 30,000 people from the dole. Adding up all the schemes, one sees that there are 325,000 people now on schemes that will last up to 26 weeks. However, the effect of those schemes is to remove 325,000 people from the unemployment list. In this way the unemployment figures will be artificially disguised. The real figure that we have before us is at around 1,300,000 people who are not in real and permanent jobs.Australia has a small business sector involving 700,000 small businesses that employ 2.57 million people—51 per cent of the total private work force in Australia. Those businesses, if allowed to do so, can make a genuine attempt to sop up the unemployment rate. But last year and over the last three years some 60,055 small businesses hit the wall. That has been directly due to government policies and the fact that it has set its economic agenda to the detriment of small business.

I refer, for example, to the competition policy. Furthermore, in terms of sales tax policy, employers with payrolls of under $200,000 received some help. But those were micro interventions and are not worth two bob if the macro policy settings are wrong. In giving the figure of 60,055 for businesses that have gone to the wall since 1990, I would make the point that I see that as only the tip of the iceberg.Probably twice as many people have sold their homes, cashed in their superannuation, sold any assets they may have had, paid what they could and walked away. Such people are not recorded as a statistic. Never in the history of Australias small business sector have there been so many casualties.

In my view, he ought to be the shadow minister for small business for the coalition because, on my recollection, Mr Tuckey, who is the shadow minister, has issued only two or three press statements on small business in the whole 12 months he has had the portfolio.I have before me a transcript of the shadow ministers performance on Meet the Press on Channel 10 on Sunday in which he was quite willing to talk about everything but small business, wallowing in his reputation of being a tough political operator. His comments on small business were appalling because they showed no substance and no policy concepts at all. He actually said to small business people, `Dont invest in your business. I find that appalling, irrespective of which side of politics one is on. That the shadow minister would publicly go on national television and encourage small business not to invest is appalling. I am sure Senator Boswell would not say it, because his understanding of small business is much better than that of the shadow minister and most of the others in the opposition. I acknowledge that and always will.I am disappointed that Senator Boswell has raised this MPI today. I would rather have it in two days time or next week when we will have before us the full content of the industry statement. Although I will not give details here, I will say to Senator Boswell that many of the things raised by him about small business over the last year that I have been in the portfolio will, in one way or another, be covered in the statement that will come down at 4 oclock today. I think small business will be very pleased about those details.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Senator Boswell should not talk about lack of support from this government. We already have in place programs that have been very successful. I recommend that Senator Boswell get more detail about export access, a program designed to assist small and medium sized enterprises become successful exporters; a program in which we have already invested millions of dollars; a program that is organised and administered by the business organisations of Australia, and we provide the funds. That has been a very successful partnership. Chambers of commerce and manufacturing organisations have complimented the government on this program, saying that this is the best partnership.Many firms have entered the export access program and around 85 to 90 per cent of them have some indication of an export order. I would like to read to Senator Boswell an unsolicited letter which I received today. The writer of this letter, the Managing Director of Kronos Products, is quite happy for me to read it out in the Senate. It says:Dear Sir,I am the owner of a small manufacturing business situated in Sydney. My late parents started the business in 1958 approximately two years after arriving from Athens Greece. I have been with the business for some 36 years, although being a tired 45 years old, I still like what I am doing, ie. manufacturing and exporting our chocolate macadamia products around the world. Almost all of our production goes overseas and this in turn helps to employ some 38 people in our small factory.Reason for this letter is to express a sincere thank you to the people in the Export Access Programme especially the two officers helping us, Mr . . . Fisher in Sydney and Mr . . . Lindford in Osaka. Although we have been expanding our overseas markets slowly it was refreshing to see from our Chamber of Manufacturers, men that honestly and diligently helped and are helping our small business. Thank You and the government for assisting Kronos with their efforts.Yours sincerely,I find it a bit hard to get that letter today, unsolicited, and then to hear Senator Boswell say that we are not helping small business.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

268,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SCHACHT","4J4","(South Australia-","ALP","Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction)",204,"—We want small business to get into export because Senator Boswell knows as well as I do that we have to export more to get the deficit down. As Senator Boswell knows, the programs we have through NIES to get world best practice and better management processes into small firms has been an outstanding success. That is not just a federal government success story. It also includes state governments, Liberal and Labor, which have worked in cooperation with the federal government in establishing the NIES programs right around Australia. That has been a turning point in making our small and medium sized enterprises become internally more efficient and do better in their businesses in Australia. Where appropriate, export access also helps those who are eligible through producing products and services to become exporters.The issues that face small business, and Senator Boswell has raised some of them, turn towards the macro-economic settings within Australia. What better things can we do for small business than to have the lowest inflation rate for 30 or 40 years, the lowest rate of industrial disputation for 30 or 40 years, and a growth rate of four per cent plus? From my visits to many small businesses in recent months, on my anecdotal observation the growth rate of those small businesses is much higher than for the rest of the private sector and may be running at much more than the average of four per cent for this period. Interest rates are at their lowest level for many years.This is all because we have our macro-economic settings right. We also have a program to reduce the budget deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. That underpins the fiscal outcome for the federal government, which we are committed to. All of those things add up to an environment where small business can invest properly and with confidence.We do not need `Iron Bar Wilson Tuckey to go around telling small business, `Dont invest. I suggest to Senator Boswell—I will not ask him to do it publicly, for the sake of harmony in the coalition—that he privately tell Wilson Tuckey to shut up in his comments on small business. I do not think he does the coalition—","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

270,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SCHACHT","4J4","(South Australia-","ALP","Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction)",204,"—Why has he issued only two, maybe three, statements in 12 months on small business? Look at the transcript of the Channel 10 program on Sunday. All he talked about was numbers, leadership, the history of who he had done over in the past and who he had supported as Liberal leader. He did not address in a comprehensive way any concept about small business. Maybe that is why today in an interview on Perth radio the former Liberal leader in the Senate, Fred Chaney, said:I dont know whats happening within the Opposition. It just seems to me that the Opposition just keeps making itself irrelevant.Wilson Tuckey is the reason why, in policy terms, the coalition is irrelevant. I would welcome a change on the opposition front bench to have Senator Boswell as opposition spokesman on small business because he actually tries to understand and debate this matter seriously. He raises with me questions of a substantive nature on small business, trying to get an outcome. In the past Senator Boswell and I have worked together in Senate committees on a number of issues; we have worked together on getting outcomes on competition policy and I acknowledge his contribution. Without hesitation, I compliment him on his interest. I do not always agree with the view he takes, but at least one can have a decent debate on a constructive basis with Senator Boswell. This is not possible with Wilson Tuckey or with most of the rest of the opposition because they are not up to score with what is happening in small business. That is why overwhelmingly at the last election small business dropped the ball for the opposition and refused to vote for it.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

275,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KERNOT","XW4","(Queensland-","AD","Leader of the Australian Democrats)",206,"—I am going to make that point. Obviously they will come from small business. Many of us have been arguing since 1992 for an urgent national response on unemployment. We did not need a committee to tell us that unemployment was in the situation it is.We argue that government has a responsibility and an obligation to do all that it can there and then—not when it suits the government on the electorate cycle—to address the huge needs of the long-term unemployed in particular. It is too big a problem to be left to the markets. In fact, a continuing and recurring excess supply clearly shows a massive market failure which requires some measure of government intervention. This government has been avoiding that responsibility.We have been saying that, yes, we acknowledge the governments willingness to take action now. But we want to make sure that it takes action in a way that most Australians can share in the fruits of the recovery. We have been saying that the way to do that is by concerted action on three fronts: firstly, by increasing our 40-year record low level of public investment in infrastructure; secondly, by developing a strategic approach to sectoral industry and trade policy; and, thirdly, by encouraging small business.There has to be a balance found between the role of government—particularly in income support—and the role of the private sector in generating new jobs. A government policy directed to small business is absolutely essential to any unemployment solutions because small business has a greater capacity to produce jobs than any other sector. In the last three years—and I do not think this fact is very well known—employment by small businesses has grown—","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

The problem is that all of them pander to big business, and small business has been left out. There needs to be a better balance. Big business received a six per cent cut in its company tax rate. But small businesses, 70 to 80 per cent of which are not incorporated and are subject to provisional tax, are still subject to the punitive tax rules of the 1980s. Provisional tax is subject to an uplift factor of 10 per cent, which is four times the current inflation rate. There are no breaks for small business there.

283,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator KERNOT","XW4","(Queensland-","AD","Leader of the Australian Democrats)",206,"—I do not care what Wilson Tuckey said. We consulted extensively with small business in developing that submission. The small business sector acknowledged that. We recognise that small business must be the key plank of any plan to attack unemployment. This contrasts with statements by industry minister Cook telling small business not to expect too much from the budget.We included a number of key initiatives geared towards unleashing the job creating potential of small businesses. Our proposals included: a 30 per cent additional tax deduction for employing additional workers in their first 12 months; the phase-out of payroll tax; and replacing the training guarantee big stick with a 10 per cent tax deduction carrot on training. I notice that this last proposal is a probability, and a welcome one. It has taken a long time to drag the government to that acknowledgment, though. We also suggested reducing the uplift factor on provisional tax from eight per cent to six per cent; and, importantly, providing a rebate on sales tax on exports. Just these minimum tax reforms—with the exception of the phasing out of the payroll tax—would have had the effect of removing major disincentives in the tax system, disincentives to employing more workers and to the expansion of export activity.We have also proposed a four-point plan to improve access of small business to finance, built around a loans insurance scheme designed to reduce the risk premium on small business loans. To improve the skills base of small business, we propose a growing business network program to encourage small businesses to combine their resources to attack common problems and barriers to growth. We also propose a management training program aimed at very small businesses to improve literacy, numeracy and general awareness of business constraints and opportunities.Our proposals were thought out and they have been strongly supported by the Small Business Coalition, which represents more than 1,000 small business groups and 400,000 small businesses. The convener of the Small Business Coalition, Mr John Martin, in a joint statement with me last month, reminded the government that it cannot afford to ignore the proposals; if it does so, it will run the risk of allowing the recovery to become stunted by difficulties which could easily have been avoided.I appreciate Senator Boswell raising this issue, but I do ask, as Senator Schacht asked: where are the oppositions policies on small business? I hope we will see the policies as opposed to the rhetoric. I also say to the government that next week we will have the 1994 budget. Surely it will not again ignore, like the 11 budgets before it, the special needs of small business. I guess that the political opportunity that is presented to us with this redefinition of the oppositions role is that perhaps there is an opportunity for us to find the common ground that I have heard Senator Boswell articulate this afternoon and use our legislative opportunities in this chamber to bring action for small business.If we want to get Australia back to work, there are already plans on the table. Sensible and responsible plans are ready to go. For example, thousands of small businesses in rural Australia will not survive without some commitment from the opposition, the government and the minority parties. They are not only farm families but also machinery dealerships, corner shops, pharmacies, et cetera. They deserve constructive and cooperative leadership from all of us. It is not good enough to rely on training schemes alone. I hope this afternoons white paper will tell us what we know—that small business is where real jobs are coming from and will continue to come from in the near future as part of Australias complex solution to unemployment.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[6]/para","N/A","N/A"
284,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CRANE","UW4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",208,"—I rise to support Senator Boswells matter of public importance, which states:The governments failure to allow Australias small business sector to reach its potential and provide real and lasting jobs to Australias one million unemployed.I think it is very appropriate at this time, contrary to what Senator Schacht said, to debate this matter. Perhaps the wording should be changed to say, `and condemns this government for the destruction of so many small businesses over the last five years. It is instructive in that regard to look at the bankruptcy figures since 1989-90. There were 8,552 bankruptcies in 1989-90; 13,091 in 1990-91; 16,780 in 1991-92; 14,816 in 1992-93; and 7,351 to the end of the December quarter in 1993-94. In five years a total of 60,590 businesses have gone bankrupt, most of which were small businesses. This can be laid fairly and squarely at the feet of this government and its economic policies.I wish to pick up and put on the public record a couple of points. The first is the totally misleading claim by Senator Schacht. In fact, what he said with regard to Wilson Tuckey and the number of press releases he put out is a straight-out lie. The facts are that last year Wilson Tuckey put out 40 press releases and so far this year he has put out 14. Why any minister would want to come into this place and try to mislead the Senate in that manner is just beyond me. It does Senator Schacht no good, it does the government no good and it does those people who try to defend Senator Schacht no good. But it is really irrelevant to this debate.Senator Schacht also said that all we were going to do was put on a 15 per cent tax. He failed to mention the fact that we were going to get rid of fuel excise and payroll tax.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

290,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CRANE","UW4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",208,"—They are not all state bodies. Since when has DEET been a state body? Mr Beazley would love DEET to have been a state body after his performance in managing DEET. As for the minister for employment or, as he is known in the electorate of Swan, the minister for unemployment, he would have loved DEET to have been a state department. All of the corruption, fraud and so on in DEETs operation was raised here many years ago.The issue I want to deal with is one which I am absolutely certain will not be dealt with in this particular statement and that is the industrial relations legislation which came into operation just a few weeks ago. It is the single, biggest impediment to small business and employment. In fact, it has frightened the pants off small business. What this IR act has done in a technical sense is unionise the workplace, regardless of whether the employers or the employees want it. The no disadvantage test continues, and it is worse. In fact, it has removed any possibility of real, meaningful flexibility gains.Those opposite will not address that; they do not have the courage. Their masters will not allow them to address it. Government senators know darn well that that is a fact. While that no disadvantage test continues, we will not see true flexibility in the labour market and in the workplace. I can see Senator Carr taking down some notes. No doubt we will hear some erroneous nonsense in a little while.The other point I wish to raise is the federal governments use of international conventions through the external affairs powers to override state legislation. The state legislation is working, but the government is hell-bent on destroying the industrial reforms that are occurring in the mining industry in Western Australia. Workers are willingly signing contract workplace agreements because they are better off and they want to share in the growth and productivity in Western Australia. One may ask this government why the growth is so much higher in Western Australia. Why has unemployment fallen so dramatically since Premier Court and his government took over, in contrast to 12 months before when Mrs Carmen Lawrence was the Premier and we had the worst unemployment figures in Australia? It is an interesting and instructive comparison.If the government is serious about small businesses being able to increase employment, it must address these issues. In fact, what it has done is directly hostile to the very ethos by which these business operators live. It defies their principles and the trusted mechanisms under which they do business. They are comfortable dealing with local identities. They deal with local bureaucracy. They tolerate—I emphasise `tolerate—state departments, but they will not have a bar of the centralised approach of this government, simply because they do not trust it, and nor should they trust it. They do not trust what comes out of some of the hallowed halls of buildings in Melbourne. The people in them control industrial activities around Australia.I want to refer to the inadequacies and restrictions of jobstart. No doubt this will be dealt with in the white paper. I want to put on the public record for those who do not know about it that the average income support on jobstart is 16 weeks. It ranges from 12 to 20 weeks. In dollar terms, the assistance ranges from $100 to $230. The people who are taken on are obliged to be kept on for 12 weeks after the support period ends. If they are not, for whatever reason, DEET has a responsibility—although it is questionable whether it is carrying out that responsibility, having regard to what we saw the other night—to remove that business from the list of businesses eligible for the scheme, regardless of the reason for non-continuation of the employment.The problem with this has to do with the rigidity of the Industrial Relations Act and with the rigidity of the scheme. That is the reason why most small businesses reject it. One of the principle problems has to do with the termination provisions, which have been made far more onerous in this new act. There is no right to a sensible outcome between employers and employees. Almost every termination situation will end up before the arbitration commission. We have already seen that start to happen—and I am not referring to the heralded flexible employment agreements. Unfortunately, my time has almost expired, but I say to the government that it has driven small business into the ground.

It troubles me that the opposition can bring forward proposals such as this on days such as this. In one sense, it is fitting that those opposite can be so far off the mark, that they have taken their eyes so far off the ball. It is pleasing, I suppose, that a government has facing it, on a day such as this, when it is undertaking major changes in terms of its white paper on employment, an opposition that is so completely irrelevant.However, it is a danger to this country that the opposition is so irrelevant, so unable to address the key issues that face this country, so unable to come to grips with the concerns of Australians and, of course, so unable to make its point in an effective way. As I say, for a government, that is perhaps good but, for the whole process of parliament, one has to say, unfortunately, the opposition has missed the boat.It is very interesting that Senator Crane supported a proposition that reads:The Governments failure to allow Australias small business sector to reach its potential and provide real and lasting jobs . . .The whole proposition is founded, according to this proposal, on the government taking action, but the Liberal Party policy is that the government should take no action. The whole point of the Liberal Partys existence is to defend the market—`unfettered markets. Its idea of the way in which a society works is that those with power and influence are able to act unfettered by government regulation.When we have a case where a small business does require assistance from a government—I will draw the Senates attention to the enormous assistance that is provided by the Labor government—it is interesting that the conservatives in this place, in complete contradiction to their normal approach, say that the market is not able to assist this particular sector of the economy and that the government should intervene. It is a shame that they do not recognise that philosophical flaw in their thinking in a whole range of other areas. I guess, in due course, we will see the same sorts of contradictions emerge.What do we have in terms of the Democrats? The Democrats are very interested in small business, as we would expect. In Victoria, for instance, the Democrats electoral base has fallen below what is required for public funding. They are very dependent on small business for electoral support, so I understand the Democrats voicing their concerns here today. Of course, we are likely to hear more about their concerns. It is a bit odd with regard to the approach that the Democrats take in other areas—for example, industrial relations and the like—where they take positions far to the left of the Labor Party and, of course, demand—","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

This is the real contradiction for the Democrats: where do they stand on these sorts of basic questions? The real issue here is: where do the coalition parties stand? They are the ones who have raised these matters. I appreciate that the National Party has some concerns here, representing rural communities, and I expect it to come forward and make those points. But, in essence, the National Partys policies remain consistent. It believes there should be privatisation of profit, but there should be subsidisation and socialisation of business losses. That is a fair enough policy, I suppose. The National Party is certainly consistent throughout all of its activities and in the way in which it approaches them. So I do not find its position surprising.The Liberal Partys position is surprising. It comes out with all of this small business rhetoric when it has no real approach. It has no real basis of policy to deal with these sorts of issues. We have seen that John Howard and Dr Hewson are divided on questions such as their approach to the governments white paper. I suspect they are divided on matters such as this as well. It is a very sad indictment of the Liberal Party. Liberal Party members come in here and make noises about the concern—the crocodile tears concern—they have for various sectors of the economy, when the Liberal Party went to the last election with the policy of the GST, which of course would have done a great deal of damage to the small business sector in this economy.Recently, the Liberal Party spokesperson Mr Tuckey revealed on Meet the Press that he had managed to miss a few significant appointments with key business organisations. Of course, he was not able to designate what the Liberal Partys policies were in terms of specific policy directions. That is characteristic of the Liberal Party at large on these matters of basic concern to the people of this country.Senator Schacht, however, indicated here today that the Labor governments approach is detailed, is able to come forward with quite specific measures, and is able to demonstrate conclusively the extensive support that is provided by the Labor government to small business. No matter where one looks—whether it is in training, management assistance, labour market programs or export facilitation—one sees a whole range of measures that the government is taking. It is giving considerable amounts of subsidy—in fact, quite significant, very generous levels of subsidy—to small business.We have seen other measures, such as action under the Trade Practices Act, to prohibit unconscionable conduct in commercial transactions—again, to correct market failures. I am sure the Liberal Party would fully support those sorts of notions. It would support greater competition in the marketplace to make sure that businesses do have a fair go and that the large monopoly concerns are not able to undermine the ability of small business to compete.We have seen export facilitation moves and export access programs. We have seen research centres established. We have seen various government regulatory operations established to assist with licensing in states and territories. We have seen improved action in terms of purchasing and buyers fair programs introduced by the government. We have seen the introduction of enterprise networking programs by this government. The list goes on and on.Quite clearly, we have seen the product of these programs demonstrated in terms of the success that has been generated through small business. We have seen a 5.5 per cent growth in employment in small business over the last two years. One hundred and thirty-six thousand more people actually work in small businesses. Six out of 10 Australians work in small business. All of this progress has been recognised, even by such staunch allies of the Liberal Party as Ian Spicer, the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He has strongly endorsed the Commonwealths achievements in regard to small business. He has welcomed the third annual review of small business in Australia, which was tabled in this parliament in December 1993.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

Clearly, there is broad community support for what the government is doing with regard to small business. It is providing direct assistance. The Liberal Party is without policy direction. It resorts to the rhetoric of the market. It cannot cope with the contradiction that the market itself lets down small business, as large firms gobble up smaller firms. Now those opposite come in here and call on the government basically to provide additional assistance.The Labor government is committed to increasing export facilitation for small business and increasing productivity to make sure that businesses operate effectively and competitively. The government has allocated $94 million to provide export support for small business over the next three years. It has developed export access programs, which are currently helping 1,200 firms. In short, the government is doing more than I suggest most people in this country understand to help the 6,000 small businesses that currently operate within this country.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

There is low inflation and there are low interest rates. These are the critical matters that underpin all of the various actions that have been taken by this government in specific terms to assist small business.My time is short. Senator Crane mentioned the Industrial Relations Act. There has been a lot of hoopla by certain reactionary elements in the small business community. Mr Boyle in Victoria advised Jeff Kennett on the policy of `let them fear the sack. That was the attitude of some sections of small business, but not all. Great outpourings of concern were expressed prior to the passing of that act—the disaster that was going to befall this country. We have not seen the evidence of that. All we have seen is the rhetoric of politically motivated groups operating on the fringes of Australian politics in the country—and Senator Boswell knows all about that—and in some parts of Melbourne and Sydney, highlighting that concerns often expressed by small business organisations and people like Mr Boyle are ideological.

298,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CALVERT","5F4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",212,"—I rise to support my colleagues on this matter of public importance. I listened very carefully to some of the comments made by those on the other side. I particularly took note of what Senator Schacht and Senator Carr said about all the wonderful things that this Labor government has done over the years to help small business. Mention was made of macro settings and assistance. We cannot get away from the fact that all this assistance and all this help have resulted in huge numbers of bankruptcies.The so-called government help and the so-called macro savings meant that in 1989-90 there were 8,500 bankruptcies. That figure increased in 1991-92 to 16,780 bankruptcies. My colleague Senator Boswell gave us the figures for the total number of bankruptcies over the last few years. If that is the sort of assistance this government is going to give small business, God help small business in the next few years.I have a lot of friends in small business whom I have grown up with. I have been in small business myself. I know that from year to year the economy changes and all the rest of it. But the one single thing that people who have survived in small business say is, `For goodness sake, will you get the government off our back. That is their plea. One of my good friends in Hobart who survived is in the contract building business. He started with a small business—it is still a reasonably small business. In bad times, he works longer hours and in better times he probably has a few more holidays. He adjusts to the changes in government policy and whatever. However, the thing that really upsets him most and gets to him most is that, while once upon a time he could go to work and do a bit himself, he now has to spend most of his time at home filling out forms for the government. If the government really wants to help—and it has talked about this in the past—why does it not simplify the controls that are applied to businesses? Why can it not implement a bit of the micro-economic reform that it has been talking about for so long?We have been told today that the white paper will fix everything. I remember the build-up to the One Nation statement. It was a bigger build-up than the last Evander-Holyfield heavyweight boxing championship fight, which at the end of the day was just a fizzer. That is what the One Nation statement was—a fizzer. I hope for the sake of unemployed people in Australia that this one is not a fizzer. All these changes and all these training schemes have to be paid for with money—taxpayers money. Where do we get the taxpayers money from? A lot of it comes from small business, so the government will tax them more.We heard today about the tax burden placed on small business. At the last election, our goods and services tax policy was heavily criticised. I know that a lot of small businesses were frightened by the publicity that this government put forward. The fact is that as soon as the government was re-elected it increased wholesale sales taxes, fuel taxes and all the things that affect small business. And so it goes on.Small business makes criticism of the government and its policies all the time. This criticism comes not only from small business—it also comes from its own ranks. We talked yesterday about youth unemployment and the fact that the bipartisan committee of which I was a member pointed out to the government that the way it was administrating the Department of Employment, Education and Training was wrong and that a lot of the work being done by it should be done by Social Security. That was 18 months ago. What has happened? The government did not even listen to what was said in that report that we put forward. In recent days we have seen a television program that dealt with the way in which money has been ripped off from the system.The Bureau of Industry Economics reported that the government policies to help small business in relation to finance and management were inadequate. The same report recognised a crucial role played by small business in areas such as innovation and spelled out a number of deficiencies in existing support structures. Only in April of this year the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce released a study which called upon two key areas of the governments relationship with small business—Austrade and the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation—to make their products and services more available to small business. And it goes on.There has been a lot of talk by the chairman of the chambers export policy committee, Bill Farrands. He detailed the high costs of business regulations and charges and the waterfront and shipping charges. I know that there have been some improvements on the waterfront, but they are not good enough. We have to remember that small business is starting from so far behind that any drastic turnaround in industrial relations and micro-economic reform on the waterfront will take a fair while to impact on small business.I do not believe that the Victorian Employees Chamber of Commerce shares the governments optimism in the recovery for small business. It says that small business recovery at the best is shaky. There is no doubt that the government superannuation levy, the training guarantee levy and fuel taxes are inflicting a heavy toll on small business. I just hope that this white paper will help unemployment. The fact is that small business needs to get government off its back. It does not need help—it just wants a fair go and an economy that is working well. The evidence so far makes it clear that the only thing this government is interested in is taxing small business, not helping it.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

301,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Foreign Affairs)",213,"—This white paper reflects the collective concern of Australians and their collective ambition. Their concern for their fellow Australians, their ambition to make this a good society and a great and successful country.It is a statement about the two imperatives of a decent society—compassion and strength.About the bonds which exist between all Australians—and the premium this country places on the talent and energy of every individual.It is about the desire to extend the safety net and basic services which expand equality of opportunity and go to make a truly civilised society—and the ability to pay for them.This is a white paper for the times we live in: an era of unprecedented change and equally unprecedented national opportunity.It is also an era in which hundreds of thousands of Australians, through no fault of their own, are bearing the burden of that change and are denied their share of opportunity.Unemployment is without question the greatest problem we face. Unemployment saps the confidence and self-esteem of our fellow Australians—which in turn saps the nations. It damages the social fabric.It has profound consequences for our social cohesion.As we have seen in other countries, ignored and neglected as a social problem, left to a fate to be decided solely by `market forces, unemployment threatens to create a permanent underclass.It threatens to create the conditions for social decay.We are not alone among nations in this—it is endemic to the Western developed countries. This government for one is determined to deal with the problem.The Prime Minister said on election night last year that we will not leave the unemployed behind. And he said on Australia Day this year that this recovery must be shared by us all. The white paper presented today delivers on those two commitments.But success wont come easily: with this white paper we cannot say that the battle has been won, but we can say that it has been joined. And we sincerely hope not just by the Commonwealth government. It has to be understood that success here depends upon all Australians joining the effort.That means business and trade unions and communities. It means all tiers of government. If we do want to reach the point where we can say that every Australian who wants a job can have one, it will require a conscious and concerted national effort.So we dont say that this white paper will wipe away the problem at a stroke, but we do say that Australia will not leave people neglected and forgotten.Through this document, Australia says to those who are out of work: we believe you are entitled to the benefits of recovery and a chance to contribute to it.If you dont have the appropriate skills, well help you get them.If you are young, we will see that you are trained.If you have been a long time out of work, we will offer you employment and training, if that is what you need.It says we will do all we can to help make you ready for a job.The means of giving concrete expression to our intentions constitute the most profound reform of Australias labour market and social security provisions since World War II.The new provisions are tailored to meet the needs of the unemployed in the modern Australian economy. They will serve Australia for many years.The white paper is a statement of policy on employment and growth. It takes the view—the incontestable view—that economic growth is the key to employment growth.The evidence is very plainly there in this recovery—we have already seen 230,000 new jobs created in the past 12 months.That is why a substantial part of the white paper addresses itself to the means by which Australia can achieve higher levels of competitiveness.One of our great goals in these last years of the century must be economic efficiency, and the microeconomic reform and other measures described in this paper are no less important than the training, labour market and social security reforms.The government believes that Australia can sustain or improve upon the present rate of low inflation growth through to the end of the decade.The period will be characterised by a continuation of the trend towards successful small and medium size enterprises producing sophisticated manufactures for export.It will also see continued growth in sophisticated services.Australian business and industry will need to be increasingly flexible, innovative and responsive to customer needs.It will need these qualities to succeed in the increasingly competitive markets of the world.As these companies grow, jobs will grow with them. But we know from the experience of the 1980s that very largely these new jobs will go to new entrants to the labour market and not to the long-term unemployed.As the green paper indicated, even with strong economic growth, without intervention of the kind we have decided to undertake in this white paper, by mid-1998 there would still be some 290,000 people in the pool of long-term unemployed.This is not only profoundly unfair, it is profoundly inefficient. It is a waste of our greatest resource—the talent and energy of our people.Returning the long-term unemployed to the productive process of the nation not only returns them to the income, social interaction and creativity which work provides, it taps their potential for the good of Australia.As the white paper says, when we employ these otherwise wasted human resources we are made stronger.Large numbers of long-term unemployed people demand large outlays on social security and other assistance.Furthermore, having so many people effectively disqualified from the work force reduces the efficiency of the labour market.In this recovery the complement to skill formation in the labour market is not going to come from migration. This time it has to come from training our own people, including those who are presently unemployed.The details of the governments policy reforms are spelt out in the second volume of the white paper.The measures being announced today will cost $1.7 billion in their first full year. Those who may question the cost of these measures should ask themselves what are the costs of doing nothing. The cost of failing to introduce the major efficiency and equity benefits to the labour market, industry and the regions that this package describes.It is important to note that we have been able to accomplish these fundamental reforms consistent with our target of a deficit of around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97.For the information of honourable senators, I will concentrate on only the most substantial of the new measures.Central to the governments strategy for getting the long-term unemployed back into work is the job compact.The job compact puts new obligations on both the government and those receiving unemployment benefits. The government will provide to those who have been on unemployment benefits for 18 months or more individual case management, training and support and the offer of a job for six to 12 months.Individuals will be expected to take the job or lose their benefits.We will also introduce measures to identify people at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.Together with those who have been continuously unemployed for 12 months, these people will be given individual case management including remedial action in such areas as literacy, numeracy, language and vocational training and access to relevant labour market programs.It is expected that over half a million people will receive individual case management each year.This is a radical program, a qualitative change in the way we approach labour market problems.The objective is to make long-term unemployed people ready for a job, and break forever the pattern in which the long-term unemployed become steadily more dispirited and unqualified for employment, while employers become steadily less inclined to consider them employable.In other words, the purpose of the job compact is principally to see that a substantial proportion of the new jobs in the recovery go to long-term unemployed Australians.A new training wage will be introduced to provide employers with extra incentives to hire long-term unemployed workers and invest in their training.The training wage encourages employers to provide training places in two ways. The award wage will be discounted for accredited training and the employer will receive a wage subsidy from the government at a level above what it would be if no training were involved. This represents a substantial incentive for employers to play their part in the national effort.An in-principle agreement on the training wage has been reached with a high-level ACTU committee which will be recommending its adoption to the ACTU executive. The government will also be consulting with employers on the details of the training wage.To deliver case management and job placement services, the government will radically change the labour market by engaging community and private sector agencies.Job seekers will have a choice between these and the CES, with the competition between them regulated and encouraged by a new authority—the Employment Service Regulatory Agency (ESRA).The CES will be revitalised to meet the greater responsibilities placed upon it by the job compact and other initiatives.Additional resources, extra training of staff, external recruitment and improved information technology will be brought to the operations of the service.The emphasis will be on closer relations with employers, greater skills and efficient delivery through more sophisticated technology and coordination.For instance, job boards and job cards in CES offices will be replaced with computerised vacancy systems featuring user-friendly technology to encourage self-help job searches. Mr President, as the white paper says, we are never going to return to a world where large numbers of full-time jobs are available for unskilled young workers. As the keys to a successful modern economy are skills, ideas and innovation, the keys to employment are education and training.It cannot be stressed too much—in the modern economy skills are our greatest competitive advantage. Whether it is in global enterprises or local small businesses, it is on the ability of our people to add value that our standard of living depends.It is on skills that every individuals standard of living increasingly depends.In the past decade, the number of young people completing year 12 or an initial post-school qualification has dramatically increased. However we are still below the average for the OECD and well short of the goal that all Australian governments have set—namely, 95 per cent of 19 year olds by 2001.The white paper describes the governments program for building the skills of young Australians.The three principal elements of new government policy are: first, the government aims to encourage young people to stay in education and training by giving them appropriate financial support and more relevant courses run jointly by schools and industry.Second, we will be increasing the number and range of entry level training places for young people—by an estimated 50,000 by 1995-96.And thirdly, we will be introducing as a major policy change a youth training initiative for unemployed young people. The key to success is to provide help at an early stage in the unemployment cycle, which means with the least possible delay after leaving school. The principal features of the youth training initiative are:intensive case management, with an initial assessment of skills and knowledge, for all unemployed people under the age of 18;a doubling of the number of labour market and vocational training places for young people;assistance in finding a job; andreformed income support arrangements to help keep young people in education or training.Under the youth training initiative—in the clearest possible signal that every young Australian should be in education, training or employment—unemployment benefits—or the jobsearch allowance will be replaced by a youth training allowance.Mr President, investing in skills of Australians, particularly young Australians, is the best investment we can make. This is recognised well beyond the realms of government.Industry is increasingly recognising it and increasingly indicating its desire to play a part. We are very well aware of industrys concerns about the relevance of current training and for this reason we are anxious to engage industry in both the design and delivery of courses.In future, Australian vocational training will be available through traineeships based in schools, TAFE, industry and labour market programs and will be available to adults as well.A training wage which offers a much simpler alternative to the multiple industry-specific rates currently applying will be available to employers who provide entry-level training.Mr President, the social safety net was a term first used in the 1940s by Ben Chifley. He thought of it as the net under a trapeze artist, `to break the fall towards destitution and sustain a man and his family while they help him climb the ladder of opportunity again.The basic principle of the safety net remains the same—and so does the basic necessity in a decent society to maintain it. But circumstances have changed and so must the way we design the net. The most fundamental difference is that no longer do families depend on the man alone to bring in the income.In general, the present social security system continues to assume that only one member of a couple, in most cases the husband, will be actively looking for work while the other will be a dependant.This ignores the increase in employment for women. It means that unemployed couples have not been encouraged to take advantage of the opportunities in the labour market.Over the last 10 years, the gap between income support for a married couple and income from lower paid jobs has also narrowed and the incentive to find work has been greatly diminished.In another basic structural reform of our income support system, young unemployed couples without children will need to qualify for unemployment payments in their own right and the joint income test for unemployed couples will be abolished. The effect of this will be to encourage both partners to seek work. It also means that many low income working families will gain extra income support.Under the current social security income test, after a modest level of income, for every dollar of income earned, a dollar of income support is lost. From July next year the dollar-for-dollar taper will be replaced with a 70c in the dollar taper which will mean that people will always be better off from working because work will always increase their total income.In another radical initiative, a parenting allowance will be introduced to provide an independent source of income for parents in low income families who care for dependent children under 16 years of age.The parenting allowance will effectively provide a payment for one parent free of any obligation to seek work.There will also be a more generous income test for those who wish to combine parenting with paid work. By any measure, this is a major reform. The simplest measure is this—it will mean an extra $59 per week on average for nearly 120,000 low income families.The parenting allowance signals a new approach to income support based on the right of people to be paid as individuals, rather than as dependent partners.In this, and in the fact that it constitutes greater recognition of womens role in the work force and the growth in part-time and casual employment, the parenting allowance is consistent with the changes to income testing.Mr President, if we do not take remedial action, the long-term unemployed and many young Australians at risk of joining their ranks will be relegated to the margins of our national life and miss out on the opportunities offered by the present recovery.The same can be said of many of the regions of Australia. The white paper presents a new Commonwealth approach to regional development.If we are to make the most of all our national resources, including the skills and energy of our people, we need to ensure that the regions of Australia are given the opportunity to flourish—that they become partners in Australias growth.As the white paper says, to neglect the regions is to neglect not only a great many Australians and all that they have to give this country, but to pass up the opportunity to build a stronger and more diverse economy.Three reports on regional development have been received by the Government in recent times—the Kelty taskforce report, the McKinsey report and the report of the Industry Commission.The principal lessons to be learned are that the regions, though presently enjoying very different degrees of success, have in common an abundance of energy and commitment.The Government takes the view, with Kelty and McKinsey, that the most effective approach for the Commonwealth is to provide strategic assistance of a kind that will help the regions to make the most of their human and physical resources.More often than not, this will require them to integrate their local economies with the national and international economy.The white paper instances some remarkable achievements and some other places where major obstacles have yet to be overcome. The uneven performance of our regions in large part flows from an uneven quality of organisation and leadership.The white paper details the way in which the Commonwealth Government will support the formation and functioning of regional groupings and provide assistance to regions so that they can develop and implement effective strategic plans, with an emphasis on international best practice.We will also be significantly modifying the tax treatment of infrastructure bonds and taking other steps to encourage private sector investment in regional Australia.We will also provide funds for capital works where it can be demonstrated that their completion is vital to local economic performance.Mr President, the white paper nominates two regional development projects the Government will support which may be taken as models for other regions in Australia.The Goulburn Valley and the Sunraysia have developed plans for ecologically sustainable, highly productive, self-funding, irrigated agriculture which will repair the environment and greatly increase the contribution to GDP—the Sunraysia is expected to double output in the next two decades.The government will provide funding for essential capital works projects and support for restructuring through the rural adjustment scheme.Mr President, the Prime Minister will be going to the Sunraysia on Friday to see first hand the proposed projects and meet with some of the regions leaders.It should be noted also that reforms to the labour market, education and training and social security contain provisions for programs which will be specifically tailored to regional needs.In addition, some 60 DEET area consultative committees will be created and they will seek to establish direct links with successful regional development organisations. The consultative committees will include employers, local and state government representatives and education and training providers.Just as it is essential that we do not allow the long-term unemployed to become cut off from the mainstream of society, it is equally important that we take steps to see that regions of Australia are not left to drift out of the nations economic and social life.These reforms and initiatives necessarily depend on continuing economic growth. They depend on the ability of Australian enterprise to flourish and carve out a future in the world economy and especially the Asia-Pacific.For that reason the white paper contains a statement of the governments industry policy.In summary, the thrust of government policy is towards globalisation, competitiveness and productivity.We are seeing major success from measures already taken: a dramatic increase in exports, the rise of dynamic small and medium-sized businesses which have been born of the export culture developed in the last decade—`born global in other words—the growth of manufactured exports to rank now with agriculture and mining as a proportion of GDP and the rapid growth in exports of sophisticated manufactures.There is no question that our policies, including our tariff policy, are enabling Australia to be a competitive player in the regional and world economy.There is equally no question that we have no choice but to continue the process of reform which alone will keep us in the race.The white paper contains a broad statement of the principles governing our industry policy and a number of specific measures consistent with those principles.The process of micro-economic reform will continue. A consistent goal of the next few years must be economic efficiency. The principles of `best practice, which many Australian companies have adopted, must be adopted by the nation itself. In this, as in all the measures described in this white paper, much depends on other tiers of government, on trade unions, business, communities, the people of Australia themselves.It demands a continuation of the great cultural shift which has occurred in the past decade.The government sees its proper role as creating a competitive environment for industry and, by strategic intervention, helping to create competitive companies. As the paper says, our policy must be to harness the power of markets, while recognising that, left to themselves, markets will not always give us the best possible results.There are measures described in this white paper to remove impediments to business efficiency, to facilitate exports, to encourage research and development, to make access to finance for small and medium-sized business easier, to remove regulation and to lower business costs—and among the latter, the white paper announces the suspension of the training guarantee.One significant initiative will be the establishment of a body to improve coordination and delivery of government programs for business. The body, to be called AusIndustry, will be within the portfolio of the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology and will be guided by a board comprising people with experience in all aspects of business, from research and development to international trade.The establishment of AusIndustry is a direct response to two recent studies by McKinsey which found that business was often confused about the range of services available under government programs.Our success will also depend on the capacity and willingness of Australians to strike productivity bargains in the nations workplaces.The Industrial Relations Reform Act introduced last year provides the framework for this process to rapidly proceed. Much now depends on the willingness of employers and employees to strike the kinds of bargains which will be mutually rewarding to them, and rewarding also to Australias economic future.We have seen in a very short time a sea-change not just in the shape of the Australian economy, not just in its orientation and in the way we do business, but in the way we think about our business practice. We understand both the need for, and the principles of, competitiveness. We understand the need for cooperation in the workplace. We understand the need for skills and creativity.We know that we must be a nation which makes things and sells things in the international markets of the world.We know these things principally because we know that not to do them will mean to fail as a nation. It will mean a lower standard of living for this and future generations.The major reforms announced in this white paper should be seen in this context. We do not accept that we can raise the standard of living of Australians by allowing a large number of people to drift permanently out of the system.We do not accept that we can afford to waste their potential. Nor do we accept that the only way to maintain our standard of living is to lower the wages of Australian workers.The white paper is underpinned by the belief that Australia must and can be a high wage and a high productivity country.A hundred years ago, the Australian colonies federated into a nation which numbered among its watchwords `the social laboratory of the world. The Australia of a hundred years ago prided itself on advanced social policy.Just 50 years ago, with the white paper on full employment, another Australian Labor government codified and consolidated social policies which together formed the basis of the Australian social welfare system. That was a document of its times—in some essential ways, a much more modest document than this one.This white paper is a document for these times.These social programs, together with those introduced in recent years, mean that in this decade we should take pride in the fact that, faithful to previous generations of Australians, we have made this one of the most sophisticated social democracies in the world.It would be no bad thing if, in this decade, we also developed pride in the great changes we have made to our economy. We should be proud that we now compete in areas we once thought beyond our capacity.It would be a very good thing if, at the end of the century, we defined ourselves as one of the very fair societies in the world and one of the most creative.That is the philosophy which underlies this white paper.It is a program for employment and growth. It underlies all the policies of this government. I commend the statement to the Senate. I move:That the Senate take note of the statement.Debate (on motion by Senator Hill ) adjourned.","N/A","WORKING NATION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

305,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator DEVEREUX","1G4","(Tasmania)","ALP","N/A",220,"—On behalf of the Joint Committee on Public Works, I present the committees second report of 1994, entitled Refurbishment of Australian Federal Police College, Barton, ACT, and the committees third report of 1994, entitled Relocation of the Salisbury Explosive Ordnance testing facilities to Port Wakefield, SA . I move:That the Senate take note of the reports.The first report which I have tabled deals with the refurbishment of the Australian Federal Police College, Barton, ACT. The report recommends that the refurbishment should proceed, although there is a condition attached to this recommendation which I will explain later. The estimated cost of the proposed refurbishment is $10.5 million at July 1993 prices.The report mentions that the existing college building, although partially extended and later renovated, is nearly 50 years old and the standard of living-in accommodation and training facilities reflects this. If the AFP is to have adequate facilities for the training of police officers and officers from other agencies, there is a definite requirement for better facilities.The AFP examined a number of options, including the use of surplus schools and the integration of the college with a new AFP headquarters. Neither option proved practicable or financially realistic.Accordingly, the AFP proposes to upgrade the building to: comply with current regulations, fire safety and occupational health and safety; establish clearly defined functional zones and refine circulation and access routes within the complex; utilise existing courtyards more imaginatively; and upgrade the quality of work and residential areas.The committees report concludes that the extent of the proposed refurbishment is necessary due to the age and condition of the building and a requirement to provide a modern, integrated training establishment offering facilities consistent with contemporary standards and expectations. Therefore, the standard of accommodation proposed is consistent with a need to cater for the diversity of personnel attending training courses.Similarly, the extent of the proposed upgrading of building services reflects the requirement to repair and maintain deficiencies in existing systems and to modernise them where necessary.The committee has made recommendations concerning a number of design and consultative matters: on the question of fire safety, the committee recommends that the involvement of the ACT Fire Brigade should continue throughout the design and delivery of the completed project. The committee also recommends that an energy audit of the college should be carried out 12 months after the completion of the project. The committee recommends that the Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled should be involved in the design of refurbishment work relating to access and other facilities for the disabled. The committee recommends that the AFP should formalise arrangements with child-care centres aimed at providing certainty about the availability of child-care places.I said at the outset that the committees recommendation that the work should proceed is conditional. This conditional approval stems from the impact of the law enforcement review, now completed, on the structure and functions of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. The review had not been finalised at the time of the committees consideration of the proposed work.We were very conscious of a case where a completed work previously examined by the committee was not required as a consequence of organisational changes occurring during construction. I am sure the parliament would not wish to see a repeat of this type of debacle. The committee, therefore, recommends that the project should proceed subject to impacts associated with the law enforcement review having no significant bearing on the scope of the proposal.The second report which I have tabled deals with the partial relocation of the Environmental Test Facility from its current location in the Defence Science and Technology Organisation complex at Salisbury to Port Wakefield, north of Adelaide.For the benefit of honourable senators, I will try to explain what environmental stress testing is all about. It involves subjecting items of ordnance to a variety of tests which simulate their handling, transport and storage.At present this testing is carried out at Salisbury. The transportation of environmentally stressed ordnance from Salisbury to the Proof and Experimental Establishment at Port Wakefield poses risks to the public and Defence personnel which could be avoided.The scope of the proposed work examined by the committee involves the construction of 12 test laboratory buildings and control and administrative buildings, four storage magazines and associated infrastructure. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $8 million. The committee has recommended that the proposal should proceed.In arriving at this recommendation, the committee concluded that environmental stress testing of explosive ordnance is essential to ensure the safety of Defence personnel required to transport it and ultimately operate the weapons systems. The committee also concluded that there is a need for the stress testing to be undertaken at a safer location, preferably in close proximity to a proofing range.Defence examined a number of possible locations and concluded that Port Wakefield is the best one and, having inspected the Proof and Experimental Establishment there, the committee agreed with this assessment. The committee concluded that the extent of the proposed work can be justified on the basis of the specialised functions which need to be carried out by or in the various buildings proposed.The committee sought assurances from Defence about a number of safety and environmental issues. The committee was assured that the location and size of the proposed site provides adequate clearances and room for expansion; that preliminary engineering investigations have indicated that the site is suitable for constructing the buildings proposed; that there will be no significant deleterious environmental impacts from the proposed facility; and that there will be no additional firing and associated noise from the Proof and Experimental Establishment as a consequence of the relocation of the ordnance environmental stress test facility to Port Wakefield.Again, the committee sought assurances about the long-term viability of the proposed facility in the light of possible future policy changes. Based on the evidence presented to it, the committee concluded that, in the event of policy changes occurring in the future which may place the responsibility for all or some environmental stress testing of ordnance on Australian manufacturers, need for and use of the proposed facilities will remain.In terms of revenue from testing ordnance, the committee concluded that provision of a new purpose built facility will provide considerable scope for Defence to undertake additional commercial work without the need for additional staff.A feature of the construction of the new facilities will be the involvement of army engineers as the primary construction agency. The decision to use army engineers was made on the basis of the relatively remote site, the benefits to be gained from training and value for money. Army engineers are presently involved in the construction of RAAF Base Scherger, near Weipa, Queensland. From all accounts this is proving to be a very successful exercise.Finally, I should mention that the proposal has considerable local government support. The Proof and Experimental Establishment has been at Port Wakefield since 1928 and considerable goodwill exists between civilian and military authorities there. I commend the reports to the Senate.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Amendment No. 11, which we are proceeding with and which I understand the government is supporting, simply brings the bounty payment period from two months back to one month.

The number of producers of fuel ethanol are likely to be small, so the imposition on the department of administering a one-month bounty scheme compared with a two-month bounty scheme is not likely to be arduous. Therefore, there are benefits to be gained and no great penalties to be borne by the department. For that reason, we are very grateful that the government is supporting this amendment.

351,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COULTER","TF4","(South Australia)","AD","N/A",226,"—Mr Temporary Chairman, thank you for your fairness in this matter. I wish that fairness was shared by others in this chamber. The concern that arises with these proposed amendments is that the imposition of them on people seems to be unfair and arduous and too great in many respects. When we proposed these amendments we were informed by the department that these general penalty clauses had been carried over from previous bounty acts. They may well go back 30 or 40 years. They are general clauses which are carried forward into virtually every bill which deals with bounty.Clearly, under those circumstances, to amend these clauses in relation to penalties in a way that would take them out of line with all the other bounty acts would be quite unfair and confusing to those administering the acts. That is the reason why we will not be proceeding with them. A review is required of all the bounty acts which include essentially identical clauses, not simply an amendment of the legislation before us today.The reason for putting this before the Senate is to signal that these sorts of clauses appear in every piece of bounty legislation. They should be amended and reviewed in the light of modern practices with respect to penalties under bounty provisions. In view of the fact that other aspects of the administration of Customs are currently under review, I simply ask whether the minister is prepared to give an undertaking that these general clauses which appear in all the bounty acts will also be similarly reviewed. That would certainly satisfy our concern that these clauses, to a degree, are rather invasive in some respects and an unfair imposition in other respects. I seek here to signal to the Senate that these aspects of all bounty legislation need to be reviewed, and I seek an undertaking from the minister that such a review will take place.","N/A","BOUNTY (FUEL ETHANOL) BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[12]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
352,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SCHACHT","4J4","(South Australia-","ALP","Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction)",227,"—After discussion earlier today, Senator Coulter said that he would not proceed with these amendments, but that he wanted to explain the purpose of them and get some comment from the government. I want to put on the record that clauses 50, 52, 53, 54 and 55 which were to be amended by the Australian Democrats are enforcement provisions relating to powers of authorised officers under the proposed bounty scheme to have persons answer questions and produce documents. The proposed amendments are not accepted; these are powers consistent with similar powers in all other bounty legislation. I do not consider it appropriate to change such powers unless it is done in a precise and complete manner.I can give the Democrats and the Senate a guarantee that officers of the Australian Customs Service, in consultation with the Attorney-Generals Department, will conduct a review of all current bounty legislation to examine whether the common enforcement provisions should be consistent with those to be contained in the new customs legislation arising from the Australian Law Reform Commission report on customs and excise legislation. There is a reform process now under way in Customs which I announced only two weeks ago.I announced in the decisions endorsed by Cabinet that one of the major changes to customs legislation will be to change the seizure powers of customs officers—other than at the barrier to prevent, for quarantine reasons, the importation of drugs and prohibited goods. Once inside the country, in areas dealing with the administration of tariffs, tariff concession orders and goods in the commercial area, the government will change the seizure power so that customs officers cannot seize commercial goods unless they receive a warrant from an appropriate judicial officer—a magistrate or a judge—beforehand. We believe this is probably one of the most significant changes to the operation of the Customs Act to bring it into line with the latter part of the twentieth century and the twenty-first century. So it is quite appropriate that the similar powers that operate in the bounty act be reviewed.My view, and that of the government, is that these seizure powers which go with it, which were adopted way back at the beginning of the Federation, are no longer appropriate. I suspect they really come from the colonial period when Great Britain was dealing with old-style smuggling across the English Channel and seizure powers were made available to customs officers to stop that.My own view is that they are not powers appropriate for the Customs Service. Customs has to be industry sensitive and, in many of these areas, if there is a dispute it is a commercial dispute. I do not believe customs officers should have the power to seize goods in a commercial dispute. There may be a dispute, quite genuinely, over what amount of customs tariff is to be paid, or the amount of bounty to be paid or received. Often these cases are first dealt with in the courts. I do not think goods should be seized before a court or an appropriate tribunal has dealt with the matter and made a determination.State police forces in Australia work under the provision that they cannot enter premises and seize goods unless some sort of warrant for a search is granted by a magistrate. I think it is only appropriate that similar provisions should apply in this area. Therefore, I can certainly give an undertaking that we will review the operation of the bounty act.I draw the attention of honourable senators to the Australian Law Reform Commission review which took three years to look at the Customs Act. I suspect that in some areas I may have gone even further with reform than the commission suggested, although some of aspects come from the Conroy review itself. I draw attention to that report because, by the end of this year, I hope to bring into the parliament a major rewrite of the Customs Act. It will be a very comprehensive review of the act and of DEET. We will have to deal with a massive piece of legislation, but I think it is appropriate to do that so that Australian customs operations work with an act designed for the latter part of this century and the early part of the twenty-first century.I suspect it will be a major workload for the Senate. It may even be referred to one of our interminable committees, but I do not object to that. As a result of the Midford experience, in particular, I think everybody agrees that these reviews and redraftings of the act are long overdue. We need to ensure that customs administration is appropriate for the twenty-first century in Australia and not for the seventeenth century in Great Britain.","N/A","BOUNTY (FUEL ETHANOL) BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

366,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PATTERSON","LI4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",229,"—Other than amendment No. 8, all of the amendments mentioned in the message from the House of Representatives relate to the penalty units system. The coalition supports all the government amendments, other than amendment No. 8 in this message, as they are relatively minor and maintain the spirit of the Senates improvements to the penalty units system. However, the coalition does not support that part of the message relating to Senate amendment No. 8. During the last session, the Senate opposed those provisions in the governments bill relating to apportioning encumbrances on primary production assets when assessing deductions from the social security assets test.The coalition opposed those provisions as a matter of principle. We contend that the current assets test is overly harsh in its treatment of assets held by primary producers. We contend that there is a need to take greater account of the special and often adverse circumstances of primary producers. Given these beliefs, it would be hypocritical of us to support such a provision which would effectively reiterate the current exclusion of certain farm assets from deductions under the current assets test. The coalition recognises that opposing the governments provision will not substantively impact on primary producers because the department already assumes that such a situation exists when it administers the assets test.I am also aware that the government has obtained legal advice from the Attorney-Generals Department indicating that it will be able to continue to administer the assets test in this way even if these provisions are rejected by the Senate. While I am not in a position to comment in detail on this advice, I certainly do not reject it outright. However, this should not prevent those of us in the Senate who remain fundamentally opposed to the current application of the assets test to primary producers from not supporting this provision. On behalf of the opposition, I move:Omit paragraph (a), substitute:(a)insists upon the Senates amendment no. 8 to which the House of Representatives has disagreed; and(aa)does not insist upon the Senates amendment no. 5 to which the House of Representatives has disagreed; and","N/A","SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
367,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WOODLEY","HX5","(Queensland)","AD","N/A",229,"—I wish to indicate the position of the Democrats on this issue. Like the coalition, we are prepared to accept the new wording which is being proposed by the government for Senate amendment Nos 2 and 3, but the Democrats will continue to oppose the original Senate amendment No. 8.As I said in my speech during the second reading debate, the views of the Democrats on the assets test as it relates to primary producers are well known. For many years, we have thought that primary producers are unfairly discriminated against by virtue of having to include their family farms in the assets test. We see the farm as a working asset. As such, we believe that it should be exempt from the assets test.The new formula the government is seeking to introduce takes the simplified view that the make-up of a primary producers debt reflects the make-up of his or her assets. In other words, if one-fifth of a farmers assets are exempt assets, it will be assumed that one-fifth of the farmers debt relates to the exempt assets and, as such, will not be deductible from the farmers assets under the assets test. Primarily, what we are talking about here is the farmers house.The Democrats believe that the overwhelming majority of farmers have been on the land for many years and, as such, will have paid off that part of their original loan that related to the house. Further, most of the farms have very modest houses on them. Many farms would have been inherited and, therefore, have no debt against them. ABARE figures show that virtually all new farm debt incurred by farmers is for farm business purposes only—that is, for the purchase of land or working capital, for debt reconstruction or for the purchase of plant and livestock.

368,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CROWLEY","ZF4","(South Australia-","ALP","Minister for Family Services)",230,"—As has been made clear by both Senator Patterson and Senator Woodley, the coalition and the Democrats are seeking to omit part 7 from the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill because they see it, in essence, as being an attack on the rural community. That is simply not true. Indeed, the Social Security Act 1991 already contains very generous asset rules for primary producers. Part 7 of the bill, as Senator Patterson has effectively said, will only clarify the existing policy that has been in place for years. That policy requires that where an asset is exempt from the assets test—for example, a farmhouse on a farm—any debts related to the exempt asset should not be used to reduce the value of other assessable primary production assets.I would like to draw the committees attention, as did Senator Patterson, to the legal advice that has now been received from the Attorney-Generals Department to the effect that the existing legislation authorises the departments current policy. As a result, there is strictly no need to proceed with part 7, so the government could live with the amendment which deletes part 7 of the bill.However, the governments position has always been that policy should be made explicit in legislation—a position strongly supported by the Attorney-Generals Department and, curiously enough, by the opposition. It should be obvious now that there is nothing to gain from obstructing these changes. In fact, there may be real benefits from making perfectly clear how the primary production assets are to be valued.Senator Patterson argued, in relation to the penalty interest charge, that there are some things that should not be left to the discretion of the minister or senior bureaucrats, yet she is suggesting just that in relation to part 7 of this bill; in other words, not wanting to proceed to put explicitly in legislation what is the practice. I urge the committee, therefore, to support part 7 of the bill and have the matter clarified so that all farmers know exactly how the assets test affects them; in other words, to put explicitly into legislation what is the practice.Amendment agreed to.Motion, as amended, agreed to.Resolution reported; report adopted.","N/A","SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

372,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SHORT","DJ4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",231,"—The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1994 is an omnibus bill which makes a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987. These amendments are largely of an administrative nature or, alternatively, provide the legislative framework for policy measures which have previously been announced.As I say, this is an omnibus bill; it deals with a wide range of matters. I wish to dwell on one or two of them. My colleague Senator Ian Macdonald, who is to speak later in this debate, will deal with one or two issues as well. In particular, he will deal with the excise on aviation fuel.The provision in the amending bill that I wish to comment on particularly relates to the implementation in this bill of one of the measures announced in the governments March 1991 industry statement, which was called Building a competitive Australia , one of the 23 statements that the government has now made to produce solutions to Australias ills—ills which, I might point out again, are essentially of the governments own making.This afternoon we saw the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) deliver a new white paper called Working Australia . That is the 23rd in the series. Going back a couple of years and four or five white paper statements, we had this March 1991 statement, which was called Building a competitive Australia and which, like all the other statements that the government has made over its last 10 years, has virtually sunk without trace.The 1991 statement by the government modified the textile, clothing and footwear industry plan, which had been developed in 1986 to encourage the rationalisation of the TCF industry and the development of firms which are efficient and internationally competitive. Key elements of that plan included an industries development program, reforms to import arrangements and a program to assist employees displaced through restructuring. That 1986 plan was reviewed in 1990 and subsequently modified in March 1991.The modifying measures that were announced in that March 1991 statement are to be phased in by 1995 and will conclude in the year 2000. Those measures included the abolition of TCF quotas by 1993, the phase-down of tariffs to 25 per cent by the year 2000, some extra funding for what was called the industries development strategy, the introduction of an import credit scheme and, finally, the abolition of bounties on 1 July 1995 and their replacement with a five per cent tariff.The bill before us today has a provision which seeks to implement that last measure by amending the principal act to provide for a five per cent tariff on textile yarns. The five per cent is to be applied to all imports and, as such, the Australian system of tariff preferences, which gives preferential tariff treatment to developing countries, will not apply in this case.The opposition does not oppose this measure—as I say, it is simply implementing a policy decision of three years ago—but I point out that this provision means an increase in the level of protection being afforded to the production of textile yarns. At the moment, the bounty, which is currently 15 per cent of value added but which is to go to zero as of 1 July, will be replaced with the five per cent tariff. So we are replacing a zero bounty payment by a five per cent tariff. That constitutes an increase in the protection accorded to the industry. It is, therefore, contrary to the policy trend of this government and the policy of the coalition over recent years to progressively reduce the level of tariff assistance in the process of making Australian industry more competitive and more productive. I would want the Senate to note that.On the other hand, we do not oppose the measure. It has the support of industry—it would be strange if it did not—and it is a central plank in the TCF plan to which industry has been working. What it draws attention to is the disastrous lack of progress there has been in this country in the last few years on the governments part so far as micro-economic reform is concerned.If we look carefully at what has happened in the area of micro-economic reform we will find that, even by our own standards, it has proceeded as at a snails pace. When we compare it with what has been happening in other countries, particularly our major trading partners against whom we have to compete if we are to have the development of our export markets and export growth and the correction of our chronic balance of payments problem, we can see that in order to fix those things reform of our infrastructure industries is absolutely essential. We have to do it better and faster than our competitors. Indeed, compared with the movement in those areas by our competitors, our progress can be described only as glacial.Fundamental to any sustainable economic and employment growth is competitiveness and flexibility. It is somewhat ironic in that sense that we are debating this customs tariff bill on the day when the government has produced what the Prime Minister himself claims to be the most important statement by this government since it came to power in 1983. Yet he produces a statement today which in no way tackles this fundamental problem of the need for reform in our infrastructure industries.The privatisation push is absolutely essential if we are to increase efficiency and productivity in many areas that are now owned by government business undertakings. That asset sales program is in an absolute shambles. It has failed to reach its targets since its inception six years ago. Some assets nominated for privatisation as long ago as six years, when the program started, are still on the books for sale. The Australian taxpayer, therefore, still controls an airline, a telephone company, a bank, an insurance company, a rail corporation, a car leasing service and a shipping line—all businesses which should be owned and run by the private sector if we expect to have any chance of getting the efficiencies and productivity growth that we need.The governments commissioned report, known by the name of its author as the Hilmer report into competition policy, found that numerous areas in the public sector are in urgent need of reform—areas from law to electricity, and beyond. The public sector in Australia has largely escaped the need to compete. I certainly acknowledge that there have been significant improvements in some areas of public sector activity. I think the governments introduction of the financial management improvement programs and the like and some, but by no means all, of its rearrangements of the public sector have been positive, but a lot of them also have been negative. The fact remains that the public sector in Australia has largely escaped the need to compete. It is very interesting to see the movement by several of the state governments, under the control of Liberal or coalition party administrations, to implementing at rapid speed the many long overdue reforms in the public sphere.I regret to say that Canberra has been very slow indeed to respond and follow the lead of the states. A very important case in point was the decision last year to abolish compensation to states that privatised their corporations. That decision sent all the wrong signals to the states on this very important area of reform. The number one priority for reform is the area of industrial relations and the need for flexibility. The governments moves in that area—quite contrary to what is needed—have been retrograde. The government has gone backwards and has overridden attempts by the states to provide flexibility and deregulation. That has been a major setback for competitive reform of the Australian labour market.There is a long overdue need to make government regulations and legislation much more user-friendly and to make the law easier and clearer to understand and comply with. Instead, this government is seeking to increase the cost and complexity of the law. The recent changes to the fringe benefits tax are a classic example. The changes are enormously complex and very difficult to understand. The changes are very costly for firms to administer. The changes go absolutely in the wrong direction if we are looking seriously at increasing the competitiveness and the efficiency of Australian industry. The government keeps saying in its rhetoric that that is its aim, but when we match the rhetoric against performance we find a yawning gulf.The pressing need for microeconomic reform seems to have gone completely off the governments agenda for a variety of reasons. There are very different viewpoints within the government on this matter. The government Left is resisting these changes. This imposes a very heavy cost on the prospects and potential for growth—not just of our economy but, more importantly, of jobs in Australia. It is hypocritical in the extreme for the government to bring down white papers when it is not prepared to adopt measures that are necessary if we are seriously going to get Australia and Australians back to work. The opposition does not oppose the measures in this bill. Senator MacDonald will deal with one or two of the other issues—in particular the excise on aviation fuel. There are several other very interesting measures that are not largely important, but they are of an interesting and desirable nature. I refer particularly to the removal of duty on reference materials which are, of course, materials with an accurately known composition and which are used as the standard against which other like materials and processes are measured or marked. At the moment those reference materials are dutiable, and this bill abolishes that duty. I will not go into the details of the other desirable moves because collectively and individually they are not of great moment. They are all largely of an administrative nature or, alternatively, provide the framework for policy measures which have been previously announced.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[26]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
373,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SPINDLER","0X4","(Victoria)","AD","N/A",233,"—The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1994 has four purposes. Its first purpose is to designate Eritrea as a developing country qualifying for concessional rates of duty under the Australian tariff preference system.Secondly, the bill abolishes the import duty on so-called reference materials—materials that are used to establish standards for goods produced in Australia. Both of these measures are welcomed.The third measure is the validation of an increase in the rate of customs duty payable on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene. This measure raises a number of questions. First of all, it is an attempt to recoup from the industry the cost of the provision of safety measures at airports, but at this stage it only recoups a very small part of the cost. I understand that negotiations are still continuing with the industry. This measure recoups something like $4.5m, whereas the total cost of these services provided to airports at Commonwealth expense is of the order of $46 to $47m. No doubt some further adjustments will be made in future.A matter of concern that needs to be raised is that the increase in the rate of duty payable on aviation gasoline will fall far more heavily on communities in remote areas than on travellers between metropolitan centres. My concern is a little assuaged by the fact that we are looking forward to another bill to be introduced by the government called the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill which will be before the Senate shortly. That bill both increases and decreases in various measures the excise duty on aviation gasoline. The Australian Democrats will be watching very carefully what is being done by the government in a way to ensure that people in remote areas of Australia are not disadvantaged by these measures.The fourth measure that this bill seeks to address is to replace the value added bounty on textile yarns from July 1995 with a 5 per cent tariff. I find it a little difficult to follow Senator Shorts reasoning when he says that this represents an increase because the bounty is 15 per cent and, while it is certainly going to be abolished, it is being abolished in anticipation or parallel with this particular measure. It is only being abolished because it is being switched to a tariff. Therefore, the comparison between a zero bounty and a 5 per cent tariff is, with respect, not very factual.We are looking at a reduction in protection from a 15 per cent bounty to a 5 per cent tariff. In itself, a 5 per cent tariff is not of great moment. It is really little more than a cost recovery measure for the Australian Customs Service. As most of the yarns that are being imported are used in textile manufacture in Australia, we do not oppose this low level of protection. We have had consultations with the industry on this matter.I take a strongly opposing view to that taken by Senator Short, namely, as to the unilateral reduction in protection of Australian goods. In this particular industry this has meant that currently two-thirds of the textile products sold in Australian shops are imported, and one-third only is produced in Australia. Going back only five or six years that proportion was reversed: we produced about two-thirds of all goods sold in that bracket in Australia and imported only one-third.I think that we would all agree in the long term we must reduce our involvement in highly labour intensive industries and concentrate on the higher quality end of the market. Therefore, I had great pleasure two or three weeks ago to visit the Fletcher Jones factory in Warrnambool. That factory has been struggling under the adjustments undertaken by the government in the past few years in the TCF industries. However, that factory is now concentrating on reviving its old tradition of highly customised, high quality products, also emphasising the fact that they are Australian products. I believe that Fletcher Jones has turned the corner.I think that it is a good example of parts of the TCF industry which, after suffering considerable pain, have been able to adjust. The pain need not have been as deep and as sharp as it was. Hundreds of jobs were lost for a number of years and will be only partly recouped in Warrnambool. This has knocked the local community to such an extent that unemployment rates have been of the order of 16 to 18 per cent compared with 10 and 11 per cent in metropolitan areas.That could have been avoided if the TCF plan had taken account of the need to change the shape of the industry, and that need still exists. In our budget proposals we have suggested that the government should allow a further $20 million of funding to the TCF Development Authority. It is quite clear that while some of the larger operators have been able to benefit from the restructuring plans and from the funds available under those plans, many small operators have not done so as yet. Yet the plan is reaching a point where most of the funds have been committed.It raises an interesting principle. Here at least we have an industry that has had a plan. There are a number of other industry sectors which have been affected by the governments policy of opening up Australia unilaterally to world markets. Although other countries are protecting their industries through tariffs, quotas, subsidies, bounties and so on, and indeed by other non-tariff measures, the government has decided to throw open Australia and let those who can swim do so, and let the others sink. It is unfortunate that Australia has followed such an utterly stupid policy when other countries have taken a more strategic approach. Those countries have developed sectoral industry plans which rely on a careful assessment of the prospects of each industry, of the opportunities in domestic and overseas markets which, to my mind, and to the mind of any sensible person, would be an intelligent and strategic approach to the development of industry in Australia and in safeguarding jobs.This is my first opportunity to make a brief comment on the white paper which contains a number of measures that one must applaud. I mention briefly the reduction in the threshold for research and development taxation deduction purposes from $50,000 to $30,000—a measure that was contained in the Australian Democrats budget proposals. One must applaud a few such measures, such as the extension of the EMDG scheme to the tourism industry, although at only half the rate of reimbursement as applies to other industries.However, the white paper has once again ignored the strategic opportunities offered by sectoral and geographic regional plans, and by and large has relied on `churning the unemployed through training measures. Apart from that, it says that industry must help itself and the government will sit back and twiddle its thumbs and let them take such a course. However, we feel very strongly that the Australian government is responsible for creating the conditions which would enable our Australian industries to take full advantage of the growing world economy and to provide jobs for our workers.I believe my remarks stand in stark contrast to the statements made by Senator Short. He seemed to be applauding the free market sink or swim policy which envisages the government having no responsibilities in this field, except to cut costs and provide no infrastructure and certainly little in the way of services to industry or to the community generally. Having had current consultation with the TCF industry, I would point out that the Australian Democrats will be supporting the bill.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[26]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
374,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator IAN MACDONALD","YW4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",235,"—I wish to support my colleague Senator Short in addressing the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1994. I confirm that the Liberal and National parties do not oppose the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill. The bill seeks to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1987 to increase the rate of duty payable on aviation gasoline, avgas, and aviation kerosene, avtur, by 0.264c per litre. The rates of customs duty will be $0.22999 per litre for avgas and $0.00264 per litre for avtur. These amendments replicate the provisions of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill, which I understand will be dealt with next week.These increases were contained in the 1993-94 budget and form part of the CAAs agenda to recover part of the cost of aviation safety from the aviation industry. In its 1990-91 budget the government announced that it would phase in full cost recovery for aviation safety standard setting and enforcement services. This original proposal was strongly opposed by the aviation industry resulting in its review. In the 1992-93 budget, the Commonwealth announced a new approach—namely, that it would phase in 50 per cent of the CAAs safety standard setting and surveillance functions, with a cap of $22.8 million from 1 July 1993 to 1 July 1995. In early 1993 the CAA proposed a licence fee system of raising revenue to meet the first contribution by the industry to aviation safety, which again resulted in strong protest.The government and the CAA decided that the proposal needed further consideration. In the meantime, as an interim measure for 1993-94, some cost recovery was to be achieved by imposing an increase in the excise on avgas and avtur. There have been further negotiations, and 1994-95 will be another transitional year until final funding arrangements have been negotiated with the industry.The scenario for air safety is as follows: the estimated cost for air safety for 1994-95 is $60 million; the government will contribute $26.8 million; the industry will contribute $24 million; $1 million will be raised from the international airline fee; and $8.5 million will be raised from increased fees and charges. Naturally, there is some unhappiness in the industry over those increases. There is some concern that the major airlines think that they will be paying too much and that they will have to recoup the cost by increasing prices. They say that the need for airline safety is mainly in the general aviation industry. The general aviation industry says that the major domestic airlines carry the bulk of passengers and should therefore pay the bulk of the contribution.Whatever the technicalities and whatever the prices, clearly airline safety in Australia at present is undergoing something of a crisis in confidence. There are just too many anomalies and problems, particularly within the general aviation industry and the small commuter airline industry. Just last week a DC3 crashed into Botany Bay, thankfully with no loss of life. One wonders why that occurred and why that plane could not maintain its flight on one engine as it is supposed to do.For some time now, I have been trying to obtain from the Civil Aviation Authority information about the Monarch Air crash at Young in June of last year—a matter of some interest to me. Since then I have been trying to get information from the CAA. It is like trying to extract teeth. Every time I ask a question it seems to be the CAAs aim to make sure that I cannot get the information or that, if I do get some information, I get a little piece that means nothing in itself, so I have to come back later.I am not one of those people that are terribly literate when it comes to aircraft, airlines and comments that mean something to people that do know something about aviation. I need a bit of extra explanation. But I am very concerned that I have never received much cooperation from the Civil Aviation Authority. I seem to have been given misinformation about that particular accident. It is very difficult to obtain the sort of information that I would have hoped might have been readily available to me.The particular aircraft involved, VHNDU, was, as I think is fairly general knowledge, flying in an unsafe condition. The autopilot had been removed, which in itself is not a problem. However, the removal of the autopilot made certain other very necessary instruments inoperable, and that created a real problem.The CAA gave me a list of ramp checks done on this aircraft, VHNDU, and other aircraft; but the CAA did not do the obvious thing by telling me the results of those ramp checks. I had to come back yet again with a series of questions on notice, the last series of which were issued on 24 March and have not yet been answered. Again, the minister is in breach of Senate regulations by not answering in 30 days, but this is just typical of the difficulties that have been put in my way of obtaining information.I should have thought that, when the CAA indicated that reports had been issued on these ramp checks, it might have told me what was in those reports but it has not. I have had to go back with further questions on notice and ask the CAA, `What was said in the report of the ramp check that was done on this aircraft not very many days before the accident? I have had a great deal of difficulty getting that information, and I think I can now understand why. A lot was made clear in a report on the ABC a couple of Sunday lunchtimes ago on a program which I think was called Background briefing which contained a series of interviews with a number of people involved in that air crash at Young.These comments are on the public record. Everyone could have heard them on the ABC program. Because this bill has been called on in advance, I have not got together the information in the style that I wanted. However, I want to quote some things that were said on that program about Monarch Air and that particular aircraft. A Mr Gary Hearn, who was the chief pilot at Southern Airlines, a small operator which flew into Forbes and another town when Monarch took over that airline in 1992, is quoted on this program as saying:It was probably the most unsafe organisation weve ever had anything to do with. They just had no respect for the rules. They thought they were beyond complying with what every other operator had to comply with. They were overweight. The aircraft were carrying which should grounded them;—it does not quite make sense but that is the transcript—and I guess the pilots were outside their hours, and they werent necessarily current all the time either.This transcript of that program continues. One of the witnesses who was interviewed on that program goes on to say:According to the regulations, NDU should not have been flying without a working HSI. The pilots and engineers who worked on the plane should have reported the fault and grounded the aircraft. But when Nigel Clarke, a licensed engineer, was called in by Monarch to inspect the plane 12 days before the crash, the HSI was missing.Then Mr Nigel Clarke is interviewed and he says:If the HSI, the horizontal situation indicator, was not operating, me as a maintenance person would instantly, knowing that was a minimum instrument required for flight, would ground the aircraft and would have to get the instrument operating again.The interviewer said:So what did you do when you found that those instruments were gone?Mr Clarke again said:Well, I just .. this was in the period of me doing the inspection, I notified the person who was directly responsible for controlling the inspection, and that I was unable to check the remote compass system due to the instrument being missing, and that I should be called back immediately that the instrument was refitted, so I could do a functional check to ensure that the system was operating.When he did come back to look at it, the aircraft was already flying without his permission. Mr Gary Hearn, a pilot who actually flew that plane, VHNDU, for Monarch in 1992, said that at the time he flew it the autopilot and the HSI were working but that there were still maintenance problems. He said:Yes, I flew NDU, as I said, went out west one Friday night to Young and Cootamundra, and had to find some approaches in both these places, and the pilot lights failed actually on the return to Sydney. I lost the oil out of the engine, flying from Forbes to Sydney, and had to land at Bathurst. The oil was just, basically, coming out of the side of the cowl, and the Chieftain had maintained oil pressure down to about the last two litres of oil, so the oil pressure still maintained in the green. However, we landed at Bathurst and the engineer later said that it wouldnt have got across the Blue Mountains.I quote these excerpts only to indicate that that airline had a history of unsafe operations that the CAA knew about. It is of very grave concern, I am sure, to all members of parliament and to the public generally that this was allowed to happen.There is more evidence in that radio interview that one of the inspectors for the CAA actually recommended that Monarchs licence should be withdrawn. That recommendation was not taken up. Had it been withdrawn, a number of people might be living today who are not. So it is a very serious matter. Some of the statements on this radio program and some of the information I have received, I suspect, may be open to challenge. I am not saying that everything that was said on those programs is 100 per cent accurate. But even if some of it is accurate then it is a matter of very grave concern.My point in raising this publicly in the chamber today is to demand that the CAA supply me with the answers about that particular accident and about the aircraft and the company itself that I have been seeking for almost 12 months. If there are people who have not done their job properly in the CAA then they should not be protected by a wall of silence or a wall of obfuscation. Mr Sharp and Mr Jull, two of my colleagues in the other place, have also raised this matter, but it is getting very close to a situation where the whole question of aviation safety needs a parliamentary inquiry.I understand there have been an enormous number of reports into airline safety and into the administration of the CAA and its air safety function over the past decade. I have asked for details of these reports and cannot recall having got these either, but we will follow them up in the estimates. All that seems to happen is that another committee is set up, another consultant is appointed or another inquiry is set up. We do not seem to be getting anywhere with air safety.It is getting very close to the stage where the whole administration of the CAA regarding air safety needs looking at by a parliamentary inquiry or perhaps, depending on what comes out of further investigations into the Monarch airline disaster and the recommendations that may have been made in relation to that aircraft just before the accident, even a royal commission. This is a very serious matter and one which we as responsible parliamentarians cannot allow to continue without some resolution being reached.I raise those matters in dealing with this bill which relates to raising money to pay for airline safety procedures and regulations in the Australian skies. I confirm that the coalition will be supporting the bill at this stage.The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator McGauran) —I feel obliged to say, following your comments, that the previous President cautioned against debate on this aircraft accident as it was subject to a coroners inquiry. But there has now been a wide ranging public debate, so it is not desirable to restrict the Senates ability to debate the matter.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[26]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
375,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator OCHEE","EU4","(Queensland)","NP","N/A",237,"—The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1994 is quite interesting. When one gets the explanatory memorandum one sees that page 2 states that, amongst other things, the bill increases the rate of duty on aviation fuels. That is quite extraordinary, because this bill is marked on the first page on the bottom right corner with a `T. I hazard a guess that most honourable senators would not understand what that `T denotes. The letter `T in the bottom right hand corner of the first page of the bill denotes that it is a bill dealing with taxation. That is a notation put there by the chief parliamentary counsel—the people who draft the bill—to denote that this bill deals with taxation. For the greater part, this bill does deal with taxation. But where this bill increases the rate of duty on aviation fuels it does more than deal with taxation; in fact, it imposes taxation, because it imposes an extra burden on those who have to pay the tax on aviation fuels. It is very clear. That is what is said here.Why is it that this bill is not properly denoted? A bill which increases the rate of taxation should be denoted with `T*, meaning not just that it deals with taxation but that it increases the tax burden, but that is not denoted on the face of this bill. This may seem like some sort of arcane debate, but there is a very real reason why I raise this matter. This is the second bill in just a couple of months where the government and the chief parliamentary counsel have got it wrong. They have got it wrong again. They do not even know whether the bill is a bill imposing taxation or a bill dealing with taxation.As a result of the last mess-up we had a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, we had another reference to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to try to sort out this mess-up as to what is a bill which imposes taxation, what is a bill which deals with taxation and how these tax bills should be dealt with. But this government does not have a clue—if it had any idea it would not allow basic mistakes like this to be made.What disturbs me even more is where this bill was introduced. My colleague Senator Vanstone, the Deputy Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, will no doubt be interested in this tax conundrum that we have just discovered, because she, like me, will have to deal with it when the matter goes before the committee.I went across to the clerk assistant and I said, `This bill originated in the House, didnt it? The clerk assistant, without thinking, said, `Yes. Then he came over to me and said, `Look, Im dreadfully sorry, I made a mistake. The clerks rarely make mistakes, but he said, `I just assumed that it did because it increased taxation. In fact, this bill is a Senate bill introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Sherry, who is currently occupying the position of minister at the table. I know Senator Sherry is an extraordinary individual, but whether he has the power to do things which no other minister in the Senate has the power to do is an interesting point. Section 53 of the constitution says:Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate.I do not know how this appalling mistake was made. I do not know who is responsible for it. It could not be Senator Sherry—he could not be responsible for this sort of mistake. It has to be somebody else, but I would like to know who. I would like to know who on the other side thinks that we can just disregard all the rules in this place, disregard what is said in the constitution, and throw it all out the door.Maybe it was just an honest and genuine mistake. Maybe that increase in tax on aviation fuel was a last minute addition. After the`T had been put on the first page and everything had been put together, that was put in and the government had forgotten that it was introducing the bill in the Senate. Maybe that is what happened. Maybe it just forgot.Maybe the government thought that, provided it spent the money, it was not increasing tax. On page 3 of the explanatory memorandum it states:The increase in the Customs duty of 0.264 cents per litre on aviation gasoline and aviation kerosene is balanced by an equivalent increase in the moneys appropriated to the Civil Aviation Authority. The financial impact is neutral.The financial impact may be neutral. Maybe we are taxing the money here and spending it over there, but that does not mean that this is not a measure imposing the taxation. It is very clear that it is a measure imposing taxation. Just because the government spends the money it takes, it does not mean that it is not taking the money in the first place. It does not mean that the government has not stuffed up yet again on this bill. As I close, I would like to invite Senator Sherry to give the chamber an explanation of how the government got it wrong again.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[26]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

389,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WOODLEY","HX5","(Queensland)","AD","N/A",239,"—The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 contains a number of measures, but I want to concentrate my remarks on just two areas: firstly, the amendments relating to the Quarantine Act; and, secondly, the amendments to the Rural Adjustment Scheme Act. Broadly speaking, amendments in this bill to the Quarantine Act will allow Australias Quarantine and Inspection Service to more closely focus its attention on imports of highest risk. This will be done by providing legislative backing for quality assurance compliance agreements between the director of quarantine and those in industry to ensure that quarantine protection is maintained for all low to medium risk imports. The bill will also provide backing for the electronic entry and processing of imports for quarantine purposes.I understand that there has been a cooperative effort on the part of industry, customs and the quarantine service in the development of systems for the electronic entry of goods and, indeed, these systems are currently being put in place around the country. The government has given us an assurance that there is to be no risk to the level of quarantine security brought about by these amendments, and I certainly welcome that assurance.I turn now to the amendments to the Rural Adjustment Scheme Act. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) said that the act—will be amended to make the annual reporting arrangements for the Rural Adjustment Advisory Council more appropriate.In particular, the current requirement for the council to conform to the relevant division of the Audit Act 1901 is to be repealed. Instead the chair of the council will be required to submit an annual report to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, and that report will be tabled in the parliament. The report will contain not only a report on the advisory council but also on the operation of the rural adjustment scheme itself. As honourable senators will know, the Rural Adjustment Advisory Council is responsible for monitoring the operation of the rural adjustment scheme and for making recommendations to the government as to the future direction of the scheme and the amount of funding that is seen as appropriate for it.Over the past 10 months in my role as a senator, and for a good many years prior to that, I spent a lot of time travelling around country areas of Australia—mainly in my home state of Queensland, but also in some of the hardest hit regions of South Australia and Victoria. The message I continue to get from these people living in rural Australia is that the so-called process of adjustment is a very painful one for all involved. It seems to me that the very word `adjustment is yet another highly clinical term that comes from behind a desk in Canberra. It in no way conveys the despair of many of our farmers, or the utter hopelessness that they sometimes feel in going through the process of adjustment.Australian farmers have a tradition of passing farms from one generation to another. In some cases the ownership of a farm is passed down through five or even six generations. During all those years those farms were viable, but the farmers arrive in the 1990s to be told that their farms are no longer so. Given this, one can only try to imagine the horror of a family realising that its farm may no longer be viable and that it may have to be handed over to the banks to be disposed of as quickly as possible—in other words, for that family to be adjusted out of the industry.With the release of a number of positive economic indicators recently, and reports of growing business confidence, the plight of those in rural Australia seems to be dropping off the agenda. As such, I am very pleased that I am to be involved with the inquiry to be conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. This inquiry will look specifically at the adequacy of the rural adjustment scheme and at the extent of rural debt. I pay tribute to Senator Ron Boswell, who raised this reference in the first instance with me. We certainly supported the reference to the committee. Just as important, in my opinion, is that the inquiry will also examine the social, economic and ecological consequences of that rural debt, and recommend mechanisms for managing rural reconstruction. I am pleased that this inquiry will help to put the crisis of rural debt back on the public agenda where it most certainly deserves to be.In Queensland, while the rains earlier this year were great news for some of our primary producers they certainly do not mean the end of their troubles. Average farm debts for grain growers in Queensland are in excess of $250,000 per farm; for graziers, well over $200,000; and, for cane growers, around $150,000. Statistics collected by rural counsellors show that across South Australia average farm debt is nearly a quarter of a million dollars. In some parts, the debt was as high as $335,000. Indeed, more than a third of that states farmers are currently living below the poverty line.There are many aspects to the farm debt crisis. The human side of it is the one that I am particularly conscious of and concerned about. There is clearly a great need for governments, banks, rural counsellors and farmers organisations to work together to find solutions to the farm debt crisis. There are some valuable suggestions coming from farmers groups. I urge the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council to look at them.I draw attention to the Queensland Grain Growers proposal for a rural adjustment unit to be set up—a unit which would draw together in one place rural organisations; rural counsellors; community organisations such as Lifeline; state, federal, and local governments; and especially, and above all else, banking and other financial institutions, so that they can sit down and deal individually, case by case, with properties under the threat of foreclosure. I will certainly be looking for the councils report later this year to provide some concrete suggestions as to how this debt crisis for family farmers can be addressed.","N/A","PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
390,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TAMBLING","6E4","(Northern Territory)","NP","N/A",241,"—We are addressing the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. This is an omnibus bill which will amend several pieces of primary industry legislation, including the Quarantine Act 1908, three agricultural and veterinary chemical acts, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949 and the Rural Adjustment Act 1992. The Commonwealths quarantine service, in regard to fee for service, has suffered many problems. One problem is that many of the customers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service cannot get an accurate picture of how much the quarantine procedures, which can last up to about 10 years, are likely to cost.In recent years we have had a case of the Commonwealth encouraging goat owners to import goats and to place them in quarantine. The original price was quoted as $50 a year per goat with a quarantine period of five years. This blew out to $410 per goat and eight years in quarantine. Of course, the number of goats increased each year through breeding. In 1991 the government threatened to sell some of the goats to pay the bills, but the coalition combined with the Democrats to stop this and we advised all future users of the quarantine service to enter into contracts with the Commonwealth to ensure that their costs were known before putting animals into quarantine.I turn to this legislation and the amendments to the Quarantine Act 1908. This act will be amended to provide for the late payment of fees in respect of quarantine service, booking fees and deposits for services provided at quarantine stations, the withholding of quarantine services until fees and any deposits have been paid, the electronic processing of imports for quarantine purposes, the Commonwealth to enter into agreements with other persons for the purpose of carrying out quarantine functions, and notice to be given of imports. Many of these amendments were recommended by the Auditor-Generals report No. 35 1991-92 on quarantine fees and charges. That report regarding the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service made three recommendations on fees and charges, and required legislation for them to be implemented. These recommendations were the withholding of services for non-payment of fees; greater use of monetary penalties; and the introduction of a booking fee deposit system for quarantine.Three agricultural and veterinary chemical acts will be amended to extend the time available to the states to pass complementary legislation from July 1994 to July 1996. I am sure this has important implications for the states and territories. Amendments to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949 remove gender specific terminology and enable the appointment of an acting commissioner or acting assistant commissioner of the hydro-electric authority for more than 12 months. The Rural Adjustment Act 1992 is amended to make the annual reporting arrangements for the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council more appropriate.I certainly indicate the coalitions support for this legislation, but I highlight that what is missing from the legislation can perhaps be best typified by an example of a Queensland farming couple who went bankrupt recently and received a re-establishment grant from the Rural Adjustment Scheme Act 1992 which they used to purchase a home to live in. Legal advice from the Attorney-Generals Department suggests that this home could be available to creditors, which is against the spirit of the re-establishment grant.Section 22 of the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 appears to give protection to such payments. However, the government failed in 1990 and 1992 to also amend the Bankruptcy Act 1966, as it had done with all previous rural adjustment bills in which similar payments were legislated. This case came to light several months ago, but the government has been slow to address it.I am sure that it was only after the government heard that we were going to move an amendment that the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), in collaboration with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), gave a commitment to move an amendment to the law and justice legislation which will be debated here this week. But I am pleased at this stage—and I am sure that my colleague Senator Brownhill will also be pleased—to address many issues relating to this legislation.","N/A","PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
391,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BROWNHILL","RD4","(New South Wales-","NP","Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia)",242,"—The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus bill. Senator Tambling has outlined its full implications, and I imagine that it will go through reasonably quickly tonight. I will not hold it up for very long. However, given my interest in one or two areas to which this bill refers, I would like to make a few comments.With regard to changes to the Quarantine Act 1908, this is just another example of things not being right, accounting-wise, within AQIS. That is of concern to all of us, and it has been for quite some time. Senators may well remember that a number of years ago—Senator Tambling has already referred to this—a situation arose where a fee for service was varied significantly and the quarantine service tried to sell some of the animals it held in quarantine to offset costs owed to it by the importer of the animals. The coalition, with the assistance of the Australian Democrats, stopped the action, but it highlighted at the time—and it reminds us now—just how sloppy AQIS is and has been in terms of accounting and accountability.The amendments outlined in this bill will provide for late payments, booking fees and deposits, and other processing and accounting charges. Many were recommended in the Auditor-Generals report No. 35, which contained a number of criticisms of AQIS and its financial management. Other aspects of the inefficiencies of AQIS were highlighted by Senator OChee and me last year at the estimates and elsewhere. Much of what we argued involved sloppy accounting and a poor cost recovery ethos. This legislation covers some of the many reforms that AQIS desperately needs to make it efficient and accountable.Changes to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act will give more time for the states to pass complementary legislation necessary for the ag and vet code to become operational.The changes to the Rural Adjustment Act merely relate to the annual reporting arrangements. Much needs to be done to the rural assistance scheme, which this government continually seems to put in the too-hard basket. It is no surprise, therefore, that the reference moved by Senator Boswell, the National Party leader in this place, to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs to examine RAS has been taken up. Our complaints about RAS—how it could work, how it should work, but what it does not deliver—are well founded. The inquiry, which has now called for submissions, will be interesting.I am confident that, when the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs has finished its examination, more appropriate changes will be recommended that will allow RAS to operate as it was intended. I have no desire to delay the Senate any longer in debate on this bill, but I would urge that with both the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the rural adjustment scheme the government should take on board the many serious complaints levelled by the rural community about these two government agencies.","N/A","PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have to say that I, as parliamentary secretary to Mr Crean and Senator Collins, have had numerous pieces of correspondence across my desk about various aspects of quarantine matters, probably more than anything else, I suspect.","N/A","PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Those two amendments will be moved in the other place; I will not be moving them in the Senate. The first amendment relates to proposed new section 16AD, which contains no reference to a request for additional information being given to the agent of the importer. I understand that an amendment has been drafted to deal with that matter. Secondly, there is reference to `the principal quarantine officer in the State, but it does not provide for the territories. I am sure that Senator Tambling is particularly keen for us to acknowledge the territories in this legislation. I understand that Senator Bell wishes to speak for two minutes, so with those comments I will conclude my remarks.","N/A","PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

I will not take too much advantage of that indulgence or in any way obstruct the passage of this package of legislation. But I do want to take the time to indicate my disappointment, and distress really, at being confronted with a bill, as part of this package, which relates to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act. That act was the subject of some discussion recently in the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs into legislation concerned with the establishment of the National Registration Authority.The argument presented during that public inquiry was that the legislation should not be tampered with and should not be delayed. Let us get this straight: the legislation to establish the National Registration Authority should not to be delayed because it was very important to get everything under way and all hooked into gear so that the states could comply and all be ready at the same time. Now we have legislation delaying it not for a couple of weeks, not for a couple of months, but for a couple of years. I believe we on that committee were pressured not to suggest any substantial amendments to the legislation because the states were ready to go along with it: a deal had been done, it was all nicely packaged and ready to go, so we should not get in its way. Five minutes later we come to this place and find legislation requiring us to delay it. When I spoke at that inquiry and when I later assembled a dissenting report, that was the substance of my dissension. I feel justified now in having dissented.","N/A","PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[27]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

398,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MINCHIN","JX4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",244,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the document.I take this opportunity to congratulate the two commissioners involved, Gary Banks and Cliff Walsh, on what is an excellent report that ought to be compulsory reading for all those interested in regional development in Australia. The need for the government to remove the impediments to regional adjustment identified by the Industry Commission in this report is very urgent because of the situation in many of Australias regions. The commission says in its overview:The most striking feature of many regions is their high levels of unemployment, especially in the non-metropolitan regions. . . . Unemployment in recent years has brought significant regional, social and economic costs.That is what this report is directed towards. But after having had a look today at the white paper, which does address regional issues, it would appear that the Industry Commission report itself has been largely ignored by the government. On the face of it, what the government has done in relation to regional issues would appear welcome but, in terms of the fundamental problems identified by the Industry Commission, they are largely ignored. The Industry Commission report itself is largely ignored. Throughout the white paper all we see are references to Mr Kelty and his particular review.The major impediment identified by the Industry Commission in its assessment of the impediments is industrial relations. It is quite clear from reading the report that the commission certainly does not accept that what the government has done on industrial relations goes anywhere near far enough in addressing the major impediment which our industrial relations system is to employment in the regions.The government, in its white paper, has fluffed the opportunity in relation to this matter. It has done nothing further on industrial relations. It is quite clear that the government needs to go much further to enhance employment opportunities in the regions.The Industry Commission also identified regulation and taxation of services as a very major impediment. The report says:The Commission supports the view that intermediate goods used in the production process—such as fuel used for road transport purposes—should not be subject to taxation purely for the purpose of raising general revenue.That, again, has been totally ignored in the white paper. We see no reference whatsoever to that very major impediment to employment in the regions. In fact, this governments most recent actions involve increasing the costs of these services in regional Australia. Yet another increase in fuel costs is coming in on 1 August, something which the government hopes Australians have forgotten but which they will know all about on 1 August. This will be a further impediment to employment opportunities in regional Australia and is a matter for considerable regret. Yet again it is an instance of this government not paying attention to this excellent report.The report also identifies intergovernmental financial relations as a major impediment to employment opportunities in the regions. It says:The Commission recommends that the Commonwealth initiate a program of assessing options aimed at transferring additional revenue-raising capacity to the States . . .Again, the white paper says absolutely nothing about that issue. There is no agenda for the government on this issue. It has again completely ignored this major impediment to regional development. The report also examines the governments adjustment assistance schemes. In light of the comments made on Four Corners about DEET, it is ironic to note that the report says:Given the proliferation of labour market schemes and the substantial expenditure involved, the Commission recommends that there be an independent public review of their role and effectiveness.As a result of the Four Corners assessment of the debacle in DEET, we have seen how effective those schemes are. It is ironic that the commission made these comments back in December last year. This is an excellent report which I commend to the government. The government has largely done nothing about it in the white paper. I hope that, both in the budget and in future government action, the report is considered.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[29]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

400,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BROWNHILL","RD4","(New South Wales-","NP","Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia)",245,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the document.We are currently in the fourth year of the decade of landcare. As the Senate knows, the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs has started an inquiry into landcare. Submissions we have received and evidence that we have taken certainly indicate a high level of awareness of what landcare is all about and what the organisation aims to achieve.Landcare Australia is a non-profit company established in October 1989 as part of the strategy of the decade of landcare. It receives administrative funding of about $700,000 from the federal government. Otherwise, it seeks outside assistance. The report clearly sets out the companys objectives. Before I talk about the companys objectives, we should pay a tribute to Rick Farley from the NFF and Philip Toyne from the ACF for the work that they did in increasing awareness, through both the farming communities and the ACF, so that these can work together in the decade of landcare. I think that has been one of the big achievements.The evidence that they gave us earlier this week, which was public evidence, would make good reading for all those people who are interested in looking after our heritage, which is basically the land. If we do not look after it, we will not have our productive resources for the future.The objectives to develop a landcare ethic amongst all Australians are very admirable and very important to encourage and stimulate public awareness of the importance of landcare and the adoption of landcare principles, to encourage and stimulate public participation in landcare activities, to encourage and facilitate education on landcare principles in schools and the community generally, and to educate and disseminate all forms of information through all media to promote the objects of the company.I think that is important to note while we are talking about landcare tonight. Quite a few people wish to speak about it. I know Senator Sandy Macdonald, my colleague from New South Wales, wishes to speak about it, and I imagine Senator Crane and others do as well.Landcares object is also to develop activities to attract corporate and community funding to appropriate projects consistent with the objects of the company and to distribute funds to appropriate projects consistent with the objects of the company.If we look at subsequent pages of the report we see clear evidence that it is meeting those objectives. Sponsorship, for example, has grown from $461 million in 1991-92 to $838 million in 1992-93. Awareness campaigns are having an impact. Surveys suggest that nearly 50 per cent of all Australians—35 per cent in the city and 60 per cent in the country—know what landcare is all about.The most outstanding thing about the awareness campaigns undertaken by Landcare Australia is that they are showing that looking after our land—air, water and soil—is the responsibility of everyone. Promotions undertaken include involvement of companies like Uncle Tobys, raffles involving the Ford Motor Company, a school video competition and a new water quality 50c coin launch. These are the sorts of activities we need in order to educate Australians, particularly in cities, about the importance of caring for our environment.Landcare activities now come in many various formal and informal programs. In New South Wales, landcare groups have grown from 340 in 1992 to over 500 by July 1993. That sort of expansion is happening across Australia. I pay tribute to Jim McDonald from my area on the Liverpool plains who has done such a fantastic job for the landcare movement in the area. But funds are not keeping up with demand and there is a great risk that the enthusiasm that has been created by all this promotion will fade and pass if funds are not forthcoming.Evidence given to the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs yesterday showed that while the federal government uses a figure of $105 million when referring to environment/landcare type works, the more accurate figure is under $5 million. That is not much to spread across all the worthwhile projects in Australia. When we consider that was the initial amount spent on establishing the gardens around Parliament House, we realise just how inadequate that amount must be for the whole of Australia. I commend the Landcare Australia annual report to the Senate.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[29]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
401,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ABETZ","N26","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",246,"—I wish to make three points with regard to the annual report of Landcare Australia. Firstly, I congratulate the Landcare organisation and its thousands of supporters around our country. In my home state of Tasmania there are 100 groups and they are divided equally between the rural and urban areas. The problem of soil degradation is a real problem. Indeed, as an environmental issue, it is far greater than issues such as whether a certain river ought to be dammed or the harvesting of forests.Landcare has raised the consciousness of Australians about our soil and its importance to economic and national survival. One of the great strengths of Landcare is its non-political nature and its desire to get the job done. However, this non-political role of Landcare is being brought into question, and I will deal with that later. The sponsorship from the private sector of approximately $3.5 million is a tremendous result and a wonderful example of government, companies and the community working together to achieve a genuine goal for our country—the preservation of our valuable soils.The second point I wish to make is to sound a warning to the Landcare organisation not to become too bureaucratic. Its strength has been the fact that it has been based on local groups with local input, and local state assessment bodies. I trust this will continue to be the basis on which Landcare operates.The third and final point—indeed, the most serious point—I wish to raise is the prostitution of this wonderful scheme for cheap political purposes. It is no surprise that the person administering the scheme was the former minister, Ros Kelly, who will be eulogised for sports rorts. Similarly, the landcare program was prostituted by the federal government. It is sad that a wholesome project such as landcare can be sullied by the filthy political handling of the Labor Party. Indeed, before the last federal election, I have reason to believe that the minister overrode the selection decisions in one state to give preference to schemes in marginal Labor seats.Since the election, the blatant politicking has continued. I refer to the East Tamar landcare group in my own state of Tasmania. It submitted a proposal and was duly accepted by the Tasmanian selection panel and approved by Canberra. The private landowner was therefore given the green light, so to speak, and spent $4,500 of private funds on tree planting and assisting in soil preservation. Those funds, spent out of an overdraft account, were employed on the reasonable expectation that reimbursement would soon be forthcoming to the tune of approximately $2,000.The landcare group waited for its funds and they were not received. After many weeks the person concerned, a Mr Ian Sauer, rang Canberra to be told the moneys had been sent to Silvia Smith, the very short-term member for Bass, some six weeks previously. On inquiring why the money was sent to Mrs Smith, Mr Sauer was advised that a ministerial directive had been given that, in certain cases, the cheques ought to be forwarded to the federal Labor member for presentation. Mr Sauers cheque had been forwarded six weeks earlier to Silvia Smiths office. For the purposes of political grandstanding, the Labor Party was withholding moneys rightfully the property of other people. Mrs Smith was unavailable to make the presentation immediately because she was swanning around overseas.The withholding of funds causes embarrassment for landowners because their cash flow is unduly affected and leads to unnecessary interest bills being paid on overdrafts. Unfortunately, the East Tamar group was not an isolated example. The federal member for Bass, Mrs Smith, and the federal member for Lyons, Mr Adams, have both engaged in this scheme.In conclusion, I support landcare. I salute it as a project worthy of support and continued funding because of its real benefit to our environment and the educative role it plays. It is regrettable that the Labor Party cannot leave its filthy fingers off the program. As we read today in the Australian , it appears that prostitution is part of the way of life for the Australian Labor Party. That is for them, but it is a tragedy when programs such as landcare fall victim to Labors tactics.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[29]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
402,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SANDY MACDONALD","CX5","(New South Wales)","NP","N/A",247,"—I rise to support the motion that the Senate take note of the fourth annual report of Landcare Australia. It is a great pleasure to follow Senator David Brownhill who, as a working farmer on the Liverpool plains west of Quirindi, would be an exponent of farming best practice as far as landcare is concerned. It is also worth noting that his son David for some years was the Landcare officer at Inverell—which is not too far away from us—and he did a very good job there.We are nearly half way through the inaugural decade of landcare that Landcare Australia was set up to promote. Its aim was sustainable land use. The core aim of Landcare is the development of a partnership between governments—both the Commonwealth and the states—and the community, which includes particularly the National Farmers Federation. The aim is to address land degradation across this wide brown land.Landcares other important role is to work with the corporate sector to raise funding to support landcare group activity and conduct awareness campaigns. A large number of companies now provide sponsorship for landcare initiatives across Australia through the encouragement of Landcare Australia.Importantly, by accepting landcare groups projects as its own, Landcare Australia is able to offer tax deductions for any donations of money or property. Landcare Australia relies heavily on the landcare network for support in carrying out its awareness and fundraising functions, particularly for national events such as landcare month, which was held in March this year, and landcare day, which is held early in November every year.Landcare is maintained in its effort by an extensive regional and community group network across Australia. Those of us in rural and regional Australia are all very conscious of the good work that Landcare does. Landcare Australia is to be congratulated on its ability to raise public awareness of its work. Under the heading `national awareness the report says:Research conducted by the Roy Morgan Research Centre on the companys behalf, shows that between July 1991 and November 1992, the awareness of landcare doubled from 22% to 44% on a national basis, and increased threefold from 10% to 34% in capital cities.That is quite a remarkable increase in public awareness, and Landcare Australia can take a lot of the credit for that increase.I would like to make special mention on this occasion of the Liverpool plains land management committee, which has accepted the role of coordinating the planning, research, implementing, monitoring and evaluation of the rich Liverpool plains in New South Wales. It is an area of immense economic and farming significance and produces in excess of $120 million of export income a year.Much of the agriculture producing this income is now being threatened by salinity and other landcare problems. Opening a recent meeting of the Liverpool plains land management committee, the chairman—a Quirindi district farmer, Jim McDonald—said that the research should be appropriate and relevant to the body providing funds and to the clients. The meeting identified two essential areas of funding—hydrological mapping and water balanced modelling. The committee is to be congratulated on its landcare initiatives. I also commend Landcare Australia to each and every Australian.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[29]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
403,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CRANE","UW4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",248,"—I, too, rise to make some comments on the Landcare report and endorse the comments of my colleagues. Tonight I want to deal with a particular individual named in the report, Mr Elton Butcher, who received the Order of Australia for his services for land conservation. He retired on 30 June 1993 after many years as the chairman of the national soil conservation committee in Western Australia.I first met Elton Butcher in the late 1960s or 1970s. As a very young person I got involved in agropolitics. He had an outstanding career serving agriculture and the meat industry—I see Senator McMullan smiling, maybe he had the joys of knowing Elton Butcher. Many people claim to be the fathers of the Landcare program, but back in the late 1960s, 1970s and into the 1980s, Elton Butcher went out and argued the case for land conservation and proper development plans at a time when it was not fashionable to do it—at a time when almost everybody said that, once people walk through the gates of the land or the farm or onto the reserve, it was sacred country and nobody had any rights to preserve that particular resource.Elton Butcher was joined by a few other people—Harry Whittington, the promoter of interceptor banks; Graham Robertson, who was the commissioner for soil conservation for many years in Western Australia; Des OConnell; Bill Meier; and others—who created an awareness of the importance of soil conservation, land management, on-farm and forest plantations and a whole range of other activities including the preservation of natural vegetation. They put forward propositions that in those days were not fashionable such as mechanisms to assist fencing out native vegetation, fencing out areas on private land that have significance for water conservation and a whole range of other things. It is not often that people who are involved in this get recognition for their services. I congratulate Elton Butcher for being recognised and for receiving the Order of Australia.I well remember, soon after he jointed the Western Australian national soil conservation committee, seeing a car drive in when I was down on my own property. He had heard that I was planting trees through seeds. At that time, that was unique and considered to be one of those things that would not work and now that has all been proved wrong. Elton Butcher heard about this and had driven some 500 miles from his property at Pithara just to have a look at it being done in practice and to get a hands-on assessment of what was being done. That really epitomises the man and how he went about things. If he heard about an idea he wanted to see it and how it worked and make an assessment. He came back on a number of occasions to monitor progress through that particular period.Lastly, I want to comment on the amendments to the Western Australian Soil Conservation Act 1991. The Hon. Mr Dick Old was the minister for agriculture and one of the principal people with a number of us who designed what is now the Landcare program of Australia. Elton Butcher made a magnificent contribution to soil conservation and the preservation of resources in this land and I salute him for it.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[29]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

405,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SPINDLER","0X4","(Victoria)","AD","N/A",249,"—by leave—The recommendations in the Industry Commission report entitled Impediments to regional industry adjustment are a mixed bag. First of all, I will address the points which I think are detrimental to regional development in Australia. The report argues the need for greater regional flexibility in unit labour costs and greater flexibility in wages and work practices based on less restrictive conditions on workplace agreements. The report argues that this does not mean regional wage cuts. What does it do if it does not do that precisely? It clearly seems to imply that people in regional areas should earn less than people in metropolitan areas.The next matter that is greatly objected to is where the closure or downgrading of social infrastructure facilities within regions is contemplated. The report says, `Communities should be given the option of contributing directly to maintain facilities. So not only should people in regions earn less money, but also they should pay more for the community facilities that people in metropolitan areas enjoy at a lower cost or free.Finally, the report says that, where infrastructure provisions and delivery costs vary between locations, that should be reflected in different prices rather than masked by uniform prices. In other words, since it will cost more to provide services in regions, these costs should be reflected in the prices that people in regional communities pay. If it costs $13,000 to have a telephone connected—and in some remote areas that would be the case—the report suggests that that should be the price that people in regional areas should pay.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[29]/debate.sub1[4]/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

407,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SPINDLER","0X4","(Victoria)","AD","N/A",249,"—It is absolutely disgusting, as Senator Woodley says. I believe that we as a community must make up our minds: do we want people in regional areas; do we want people in rural Australia? France, Germany and the United States have made up their minds that they want a rural community. Those countries have made sure, by whatever means, be it trade measures, be it industry measures, be it community services, that they have vibrant and viable community in regional areas.The report also points to some things that should be done to contribute to that. The report suggests that the Commonwealth should introduce income tax zone rebates designed to compensate residents of regions for lack of government services. That is fine. It suggests more transparency in, and better coordination of, decisions on regional infrastructure provisions, and that is fine too. Clearly, we need to know what we need to provide in regions.The commission also considers that where governments seek to sustain populations in particular regions we should do so by improving regional infrastructure. Of course we must. We must take the range of measures which the Australian Democrats set down both in the budget proposals and in the paper that I published last Sunday as a challenge to the government in the white paper to do precisely that—to preserve our regional communities.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[29]/debate.sub1[4]/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

It was proposed by the Waterhouse Committee of Review in 1983 and recommended in 1988 by the Evatt Royal Commission and by the House of Representatives Committee on Community Affairs After the March report. These recommendations were endorsed by the National Advisory Committee (NAC) on the VVCS at its meeting in December 1988.The development of country outreach services is in line with the Governments commitment to ensuring better access, integration and availability of services to country veterans and their dependants. In the 1993-94 Budget, the Government approved funding for six COP co-ordinators to expand the program and allow veterans to have access to more effective counselling support right across Australia.(2) The use of contract counsellors in non-metropolitan areas has improved the access and availability of counselling services. The COP has provided more accessible services to non-metropolitan veterans and their families but requires further development. The network of approved counsellors in non-metropolitan regions needs to be expanded to areas currently with no contract counsellors or area representatives, or where there are too few to meet the existing and new demands for services.(3) Yes, the changes were discussed at a conference for Directors of Counselling and were the focus of a special workshop to discuss the changes in detail. There will be a staged approach to implementing the changes which will involve further detailed discussions with the Directors of Counselling.(4) The changes were considered necessary to implement fully the recommendation of the After the March report which had input from the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia and clients of the service.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

However it was not until 11 February 1994, that senior officials from the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency were informed by telephone by the South Australian Department of Mines and Energy of seepage from the mines tailings retention system. This was followed on 14 February 1994 by direct advice from the Corporation to the Secretary of the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and a Western Mining Corporation Olympic Dam Operations media release. The Corporation did not inform the former Minister directly.(2) Statutory obligations for supervision and monitoring of operations of the mine rest entirely with the South Australian Government. Under the Roxby Downs (Indenture Ratification) Act 1982, a three year programme for the protection, management and rehabilitation (if appropriate) of the environment (including arrangements for monitoring) is required to be submitted to the South Australian Minister responsible. According to the Corporation, the company, independent experts and state authorities have been monitoring the local water table since operations began in 1988.(3) It is recognised that current disclosure and reporting requirements have not been adequate and officials are currently considering options for improving arrangements. No decision has been made as a result of the announcement of the seepage about the possible involvement of the Office of the Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers Region in monitoring the operations of the Olympic Dam mine.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[15]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

445,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator McMullan","5I4","VIC","ALP","N/A",259,"—The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senators question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the National Transmission Agency:(1) There are five possible delivery technologies currently available:SatelliteHigh Frequency (HF)High Frequency ShowerMedium Frequency (MF) AMVery High Frequency (VHF) FM(2) The HACBSS (Homestead and Community Broadcasting Satellite Service) delivered by OPTUS satellite has been available throughout WA since 1987 for the delivery of ABC-TV, Radio National and Regional Radio. ABC Classic FM is also available by this means.With the closure of VLW there is no transmission of ABC Radio services available on HF in WA.The HF Shower is used only in the Northern Territory. Some parts of eastern WA may be able to receive it but it is not designed to serve WA. It is an expensive method of radio broadcasting and for this reason rarely used.The Second Regional Radio Network (SRRN) now provides many people throughout regional WA with radio services previously only received on HACBSS or VLW. It was always intended that VLW service would be closed down with the introduction of the HACBSS satellite and expansion of SRRN.MF transmissions cover most of the population of WA. NTA transmitters are at Albany, Bridgetown, Broome, Busselton, Carnarvon, Dalwallinu, Esperance, Exmouth, Kalgoorlie, Kununurra, Manjimup, Northam, Pannawonica, Paraburdoo, Perth, Port Hedland, Tom Price, Wagin and Wyndham.VHF-FM also covers much of the population of WA. NTA transmitters are at: Argyle Mine, Augusta, Broome, Bunbury, Carnarvon, Central Agricultural (Mawson), Cue, Dampier, Denham, Derby, Eneabba, Esperance, Exmouth, Fitzroy Crossing, Geraldton, Halls Creek, Jurien, Kalbarri, Kalgoorlie, Karratha, Koolan Island, Kununurra, Laverton, Leeman, Leonora, Marble Bar, Meekatharra, Menzies, Merredin, Mt Magnet, Nannup, Newman, Norseman, Onslow, Pannawonica, Paraburdoo, Perth, Port Hedland, Ravensthorpe, Salmon Gums, Southern Agricultural (Mt Barker), Southern Cross, Tom Price, Wyndham and Yalgoo.In addition, licenced self-help rebroadcasting facilities are located at Blackstone, Bow River Mine, Darlot, Golden Grove, Goldsworthy, Jamieson, Leinster, Mt Whaleback, Nullagine, Shay Gap, Tjirrkarli, Tom Price Mine, Warakurna, Warburton, Wiluna, Yandicoogina and Yiyili.Facilities provided under the Broadcasting for Remote Aboriginal Communities Scheme (BRACS) are located at Balgo, Beagle Bay, Djarindjin, Jigalong, Kalumburu, Kiwirrkurra, Langrange, Looma, Oombulgurri, Tjukurla, Warmun, Wingellina, Yandeyarra and Yungngora.(3) Satellite—Satellite receiver and B-MAC decoder (homesteads will already have these), plus audio system—eg. a Hi-Fi system.High Frequency—Shortwave receiver, preferably with an external antenna.MF Radio Transmissions—an MF AM radio receiver.VHF-FM—an FM radio receiver.(4) Satellite Receiving System providing access to 2 TV services and 3-4 radio services—typically $2500-$3000.Shortwave Radio—typically $80-$400 depending on quality, technology employed, and individual preference.MF Radio—typically $20-$250 depending on quality and individual preference.VHF-FM—typically $20-$250 depending on quality and individual preference.(5) MF radio is most suitable for mobile reception. However sufficient MF stations could not be established to reach all of the Australian land mass without significant cost outlays. HF can cover large areas but is less reliable and expensive to establish and maintain.(6) Existing shortwave transmitters at Carnarvon currently broadcast Radio Australia programs 24 hours per day. The existing antennas are optimised for transmissions to overseas target areas and would not be suitable for domestic shortwave broadcasting as they are presently positioned. The possible use of transmitters at Carnarvon for domestic shortwave broadcasting would require extensive work and Carnarvon may not be the best site for such a purpose.There are no national broadcasting shortwave transmitters at either Derby or Port Hedland.The ABC has negotiated with the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) of Australia to carry cyclone warnings and daily News Bulletins on its transmitters at Port Hedland, Derby, Carnarvon and Meekatharra. The coverage of the RFDS service is in the areas of north western Australia where the majority of complaints have arisen from listeners to the previous VLW service.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[16]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

These facilities differ enormously in the coverage which they provide (from a few hundred to several million people), and in the complexity and cost of their construction.The cost of adding to existing facilities in order to provide a parliamentary broadcasting service at individual sites would also vary widely, depending upon such factors as the location of the facility, the size of the transmitter and its power requirements, and the need to modify the existing facility.Assuming that frequency modulation (FM) transmission facilities were employed, capital costs could vary between something less than $50,000 and $1 million. For a major regional site at which infrastructure exists with capacity to transmit an additional program service, the cost would be approximately $300,000.(3) Surveys have not been conducted by the ABC on the size of the audience for the Parliamentary Broadcast service and this information is not available from AGB:McNair ratings service.(4) A copy of extensive statistical returns on the average audience for the live and replay telecast of Parliamentary Question Time and Order in the House has been provided separately to the honourable senator.(5) A copy of the details of audience reach by demographics over a twelve week period for each of the five cities has been provided separately to the honourable senator. ABC Television does not currently purchase regional data.(6) As explained in the answer to part (2), transmission facilities differ enormously in cost and complexity. The additional cost of operating and maintaining additional transmission facilities, could range from $30,000 to $150,000 per annum per site.(7) Annual reporting for the Parliamentary Broadcast Network is incorporated in the Department of the Parliament Reporting Staffs (DPRS) Annual Report.

The reasons for this include:improved service to clients through smaller offices;smaller, more manageable, offices less prone to fragmentation over more than one office building;reduced travelling time for field staff if offices are located closer to the taxpayer base; andstaff preference to work closer to home.In regard to the split of the Perth Office, in 1988 submissions were invited via newspaper advertisements for the provision of office space in two parcels within a 12km radius of the GPO and close to transport and other facilities. The advertisement stated that it was intended to short list the proposals prior to the implementation of a formal tendering process.Thirty five Expressions of Interest were received from 26 developers. The short listing process resulted in the selection of proposals for the following locations to proceed to the next stage:CBD/Fringe CBD—5 sitesMirrabooka—2 sitesCannington—2 sitesThe short listing process was based on issues such as location, indicative price, taxpayer demography, the availability and suitability of public transport links, the availability/suitability of supporting infrastructure, the availability/suitability of facilities and the ability to staff the location.The result of the second stage was that Cannington was preferred as the non-CBD location as it met the criteria for the establishment of an office better than other locations. At the time there was no major regional business centre in the northern suburbs, nor did transport links facilitate an easily accessed central location in the north.(3) All ATO accommodation is leased so agreements are made with owners/developers not builders.Pre-commitment leases which resulted in the construction of new buildings for the ATO over the past 10 years are shown below with the original owner/developer who was awarded the contract.

In many cases draft project proposals were discussed and modified before they were put to State Advisory Committees.In the case of Queensland the following project proposals were formally rejected by the State Advisory Committee because they did not meet Commonwealth funding criteria:Hervey Bay—Office Procedures Training Program ($90,000 Commonwealth grant requested);Beaudesert—Asset Management Water and Sewerage Department ($25,000 Commonwealth grant requested);Beaudesert—Digital Capture of Council Minutes for Text Retrieval System ($50,000 Commonwealth grant requested);Beaudesert—Health Research and Records Upgrade ($25,000 Commonwealth grant requested);Gold Coast—Geographical Information System ($990,000 Commonwealth grant requested); andGold Coast—Pavement Management System ($81,000 Commonwealth grant requested).(4) The general procedure adopted was that Commonwealth Ministers considered projects recommended for approval by State Advisory Committees. In Queensland no projects recommended for approval by the State Advisory Committee were rejected by Commonwealth Ministers.However, two project proposals from the Gold Coast Council which were rejected by the Queensland State Advisory Committee, were referred to Commonwealth Ministers at the councils insistence. Ministers confirmed the Committees rejection of the two proposals. The projects, neither of which met program guidelines, were:Pavement Management System ($81,000): the project involved capturing and entering data into a pavement management system; andGeographical Information System ($990,000): the project involved building a data base for management of council infrastructure.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[23]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

CSL continued jack jumper ant antivenom research after Commonwealth funding ceased in June 1992, but following a reappraisal of progress against commercial criteria, the Company has now decided to discontinue the research work from the end of 1993-94.CSL has arranged the relocation of antivenom research to a major academic institute. An announcement will be made to that effect in the near future. CSL will maintain a capacity to undertake product development as part of the Companys overall research and development effort in the event that further research generates positive outcomes.Consistent with its approach to other applications for health and medical research funding, the Commonwealth will consider future funding proposals for antivenom research under the auspices of the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&MRC) which is the most appropriate Commonwealth body to assess a grant application on its merits and against other health and medical research projects.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[24]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

471,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Crowley","ZF4","VIC","ALP","N/A",269,"—The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable senators question:(1) Yes.The Meridian Investment Trust (MIT) is treated as a managed investment. For social security income test purposes, managed investments acquired after 9 September 1988 (whether listed on the stock exchange or not) have income assessed at a rate of return based upon the performance of the investment over the previous 12 months, taking account of changes in capital value and any income distributions.MIT (formerly Estate Mortgage) listed on 16 December 1993. In the period leading up to listing, the Estate Mortgage trusts were suspended from trading. Hence, there was no past performance data at the date of listing.The listing of MIT involved the merger of the former Estate Mortgage trusts. The circumstances of the merger meant that the merged products were not new products for assessment purposes. However, as there was no performance data for the products for the previous 12 months, the net asset backing of a unit in the MIT ($1.00 per unit) was used as the start point for assessment purposes from 16 December 1993.The last sale price on the first day of listing was not used as the start point because the merged units were not considered to be a new investment product.(2) In general, the last sale price on the first day of listing is used for any new share or managed investment product. Where listing involves the continuation of an existing managed investment product, no new product is created and the calculation of the rate of return is not affected directly by the process of listing, except to the extent that it affects the current price of the listed product.(3) For new investments that have existed for less than 12 months, the impact on pension entitlement of using the list price rather than the sale price on the first day of listing for calculating the rate of return would depend on:the list price;the sale price on the first day of listing; andthe sale price at the current point in time of assessment.Where the current sale price is higher than either the list price or the sale price on the first day of listing, the general impact would be:to increase the income assessed (and reduce pension entitlement) where the list price was lower than the price at the end of the first day of listing; andto decrease the income assessed (and increase pension entitlement) where the list price was higher than the price at the end of the first day of listing.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[29]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

475,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Faulkner","5K4","WA","ALP","N/A",273,"—The answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) No. However, on 11 April 1994, the Australian Heritage Commission decided to enter the Beeliar Wetlands in the Interim List of the Register of the National Estate. Listing is scheduled for the next gazettal notice at the end of this year.(2) 1985.(3) Yes.(4) The Australian Heritage Commission receives a large number of nominations and cannot process all nominations immediately. Priorities for assessment must be assigned, and these are based on whether the area is under threat, whether Commonwealth decisions are pending, or whether the area can be assessed as one of a suite of like places, or within a more comprehensive assessment of an entire region.Processing of the Beeliar Wetlands has not been assigned a high priority because the area has at no stage been the subject of any Commonwealth decision, and the WA State Government has been moving towards the declaration of a Park over this area. The Beeliar Wetlands is a complex nomination. Investigation and validation of the claimed values, and selection of an appropriate boundary, has therefore been a complex and lengthy task.(5) The priorities in assessing these places were determined according to the above guidelines.Jandakot and Perth airports were placed on the Interim List on 17 November 1992.The Commission decided on 8 February 1994 to enter Ellenbrook in the Interim List, and gazettal is scheduled for later this year.While the Leda Area has not been subject to any Commonwealth decisions, the Commission is aware that the area is likely to be subject to development proposals, and for this reason has allocated priority to its assessment. If it is found to have national estate significance, interim listing would be most likely to occur at one of the two annual interim listings in 1995.(6) Fifty nominations in Western Australia have been waiting for listing consideration for more than 10 years; of these three are natural environment places. In most cases these nominations have not been processed because of a lack of a sufficient level of information supplied by the nominator or otherwise available to the Commission.(7) The Commission is not required to process nominations within any specified time. Nominations are not provided for in its Act. They are a mechanism adopted by the Commission.(8) Although there is no requirement to process nominations in a set time frame, in 1988 under a previous Minister the Commission was provided with additional resources to help process the backlog of nominations. This has led to a reduction in the overall backlog by approximately 60%.(9) The Commission is an independent statutory body.

479,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Faulkner","5K4","QLD","ALP","N/A",274,"—The answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) A report Reducing Lead Exposure in Australia, An Assessment of Impacts, prepared by the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology for the National Health and Medical Research Council cited studies conducted in the United States of America which showed a clear correlation between the level of lead in peoples blood and the level of lead in fuel.A major source of preventable lead pollution is generated by burning leaded petrol. It has been estimated that this contributes 90% of lead in air. Lead in air contributes to lead in dust, soil and water. Generally, where lead levels in petrol and the usage of leaded petrol have fallen, there is a reduction in blood lead levels.(2) (a) In Australia no.(b) Benzene is a known carcinogen which is strongly linked to the incidence of leukemia.(c) Benzene content of crude oil is very low. It is formed in several refinery operations, the main source being catalytic reforming. In Australia benzene content of petrol is restricted to a maximum 5%.(3) (a) and (b) The Government has spent 2.89 million dollars on a campaign designed to encourage owners of pre-1986 cars, which are able to use unleaded petrol, to do so. A list of cars able to use unleaded petrol was prepared with the cooperation of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries and the car companies and distributed widely through motoring and motor trade associations and the oil companies. Educational material was prepared for motor mechanics dealing with technical aspects of switching to unleaded petrol. An advertising campaign was run on television and in the newspapers and the oil companies assisted the campaign through service station displays, signs and promotions.Additionally, educational material was prepared for medical professionals, home renovators and professional painters highlighting the risks associated with lead exposure.(4) (a) There are no additional health risks because standard leaded petrol produced in Australia is essentially the same in benzene producing potential as leaded.(b) The health risks associated with exposure to lead have been extensively examined and documented in Australia and overseas. They include impaired intellectual development in children, kidney damage and raised blood pressure. The following initiatives were undertaken in Australia to review the health effects of lead: Commonwealth and State health and environmental agencies jointly sponsored the International Meeting on Non-Occupational Exposures to Lead in Melbourne, October 1992. This meeting brought together Australian and international experts to discuss recent studies into health effects of lead.The Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health commissioned the South Australian Health Commission to conduct a review of public exposure to lead in Australia. The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology was also commissioned to prepare the report Reducing Lead Exposure in Australia—An Assessment of Impacts and Risk Analysis of Economic and Environmental Impacts.The findings were reviewed at the June and November 1993 meetings of the National Health and Medical Research Council, which recommended a goal for all Australians to achieve a blood lead level of less than 10 micrograms per decilitre, with 15 micrograms per decilitre to be achieved by 1998.Strategies put in place by Commonwealth and State Governments to meet that goal should be sufficient to achieve a blood lead level of 10 micrograms per decilitre in 90% of children, aged 0-4 years, by 1998. A blood lead survey is being carried out later in 1994 to assess progress of the lead reduction program.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[33]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Of the twenty-four Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, all but Australia, New Zealand and Iceland rely primarily on contribution-based social insurance schemes for their retirement income systems. Eight OECD countries have a universal pension system in addition to or in place of a social insurance scheme.The eight countries are:Australia; Canada; Denmark; Finland; Iceland; New Zealand; Norway; and Sweden.Of those countries with a universal pension system, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Iceland have means-tested systems, with means-testing operating through the income security system itself or through special surcharges or other levies administered in the tax system. Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have small non-means tested universal pensions in combination with income tested supplements for low income earners.(2) The following is the estimated annual cost of paying the age pension free of income and assets tests to otherwise qualified persons of age pension-age (as at June 1993):(a) 90 years and over: $105 million; (b) 85 years and over: $300 million; (c) 80 years and over: $660 million; (d) 75 years and over: $1,300 million; (e) 70 years and over: $2,370 million; and (f) 65 years and over: $4,070 million.These cost estimates are based on populations, pension numbers and rates as at June 1993 and are the estimated combined costs for Age and Service pensions in 1993 dollars. The estimates include the costs of increasing rates for all existing pensioners to maximum rate and the costs of maximum rate pensions for new pensioners.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[35]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The aim was to ensure that procedures for claiming and reviewing payments were as simple as possible for clients.The use of annual taxable income for the financial year ending in the previous calendar year ensures that the administration of income tests for Family Payment is simple, effective and easily understood by the community. Under the current arrangements, most clients need only look at a single document, their Tax Notice of Assessment, to work out for themselves whether or not they will meet the income test requirements.Although the previous financial years income is used in most cases, a persons current financial year income may be used in certain circumstances. The current financial year can be used where significant changes have occurred in a familysfinancial circumstances. This applies where income in the current financial year has changed by more than 25% or falls below the Additional Family Payment qualifying threshold (the amount at which the maximum rate of AFP is payable).","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[36]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
