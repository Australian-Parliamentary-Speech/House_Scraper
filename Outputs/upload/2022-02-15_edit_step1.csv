Im pleased to present the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Schemes final report for its inquiry into the NDIS workforce. Critical to the sustainability of the NDIS, one of Australias most ambitious public policy initiatives, is a workforce of a sufficient size and which has the appropriate skills, qualifications and expertise to deliver safe, quality supports to participants. It is estimated that the NDIS workforce will need to grow by an additional 83,000 fulltimeequivalent staff to support participants at the schemes projected peak. However, attracting and retaining suitably skilled, qualified workforce continues to prove a significant challenge, with systemic issues persisting and the sector increasingly seen as overworked, underpaid, undervalued and poorly trained.","National Disability Insurance Scheme Joint Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

Its fair to say the workforce is burned out. Theyre exhausted from nonstop work to ensure that people with disability dont miss out on critical care. People with disability and their workforce have had to navigate the relentless strain of isolating from work and life when identified as a close contact, often without pay. And many, many disability workers have caught COVID themselves, putting their own health, their families and the people they care for at risk. Despite caring for some of the most clinically vulnerable Australians, they found it too hard to access appropriate PPE material which would have kept them and the people they care for safe. I have heard firsthand many stories of families of participants and care workers desperately trying to find PPE material so that the people who enter the houses of the participants can be properly cared for.","National Disability Insurance Scheme Joint Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"

But we dont provide careers and we dont provide incentives for people to move into disability care. People dont become disability carers for the search of their first million dollars. The nation doesnt sufficiently value their work. They work physically and they work mentally, but they also deliver on an emotional form of labour. These are people who, like all of us, have their own lives and their own stories at home, but they can never come to work being down, being upset or being angry, because the people they care for are in tune with how their disability carer is.

His hope and dream was to one day save up enough money to be able to buy the pub and run it himself. A little challenge he had was money. Thankfully, in our wonderful region we have the New Acland Coal Mine right there on hand. That provided him with a fantastic job and the ability to slowly but surely save up money so that he could one day pay for his dream. When the mine was, sadly, brought to an end—the last coal was brought out late last year—Tom received a redundancy; he was one of the last people to do so. We hope to see that mine open back up again, and its within the hands of the state Labor government to do so, and I very much hope that they take the opportunity to do that as quickly as possible. But, luckily for Tom, the bright side of the story came through: his redundancy payment coincided with the last pub owners retirement, and he was able to make his dream a reality—a great example of the New Acland Coal Mine working so well with the local community, supporting the local community and supporting local people to achieve their dreams. This is a fantastic example of whats happening throughout our region and a fantastic example of Goombungee getting ahead.","Groom Electorate: Goombungee","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[15]/speech/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"

One of my constituents, Victoria, from Ourimbah, told me she had had a bad accident on this round around five years ago. She said: I was told by the attending police officer that there were major upgrades to be taken in the near future, but nothing has ever come of it. The upgrade of the Pacific Highway through Wyong should be a top priority for this government. It would ease congestion, improve safety and open up employment zones on either side of the town centre for businesses like Wideline, which has two factories, two to three kilometres apart, which can take 40 to 50 minutes to travel between.","Dobell Electorate: Roads","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[16]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms McBRIDE (Dobell) ","(13:52):"

The great separation lowered Roe Highway beneath Kalamunda Road with two new roundabouts and on and off ramps. This gave congestion relief to 74,000 vehicles per day and saves them up to seven minutes travel during peak times.

Imagine being a woman on a powerline or construction worksite and expected to hold on all day or drive 20 minutes offsite because youve got to use the bathroom—and then putting up with the snide comments because you had to go in the first place. Its what Hawkesbury electrical apprentice Alison has experienced, because most of her worksites have limited, if any, toilet facilities. In fact, an ETU report found women in the trades are being expected to either hang on or face unsanitary, unsafe, inaccessible and unsuitable amenities. Women obviously have different bathroom needs at different times of their lives, and not having adequate facilities isnt just a health concern but a barrier to workforce participation. This is also a problem for ageing male tradies. If youve got prostate problems, it can be almost impossible to work on particular sites because of where the bathroom is, or isnt. Alison says she has been caught out many times, either having to hold on or to use toilets she describes as disgusting, with no paper, no sanitary bins and no running water or soap. We need national standards, and this has been ignored by the Morrison government, who are not capable of governing. Whether you work in an office or a building site, you have the right to be able to access toilet facilities that are fit for purpose.

The reason why its of great embarrassment to the shadow Treasurer is because today the unemployment rate is 4.2 per cent—a 13year low. When Labor last left office, the unemployment rate was 5.7 per cent, and we now have full employment in sight. And there are 1.7 million more Australians in work today than under the Labor Party, including one million more women in work today than under the Labor Party. Thats our record.

It is true that the reason the government has pursued a change to the character test through legislation over the last 1,200 days is, in principle, primarily to protect the Australian community from harm. In particular, it is to protect women and children from family and domestic violence in the remit that is given to the federal government—that is, the protection of our borders, the issuing of visas and the movement of people in and out of Australia. We have a particular responsibility—and it is a point that advocates for domestic violence victims make over and over again—to make better laws, to work with the judiciary, to change the system, to make sure that, wherever we have power and responsibility, we deal with the reasons family and domestic violence happens against women and children primarily.","Migration","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[11]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HAWKE (Mitchell—Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs) ","(14:47):"

For 1,200 days the government has said: give us more power not just to deal with the horrible crimes against women and children when they happen but to prevent them from occurring in the first place by denying visas offshore. In response, yesterday we heard a little bit about how Labor havent been doing their homework. And the response from Senator Keneally today again highlights that they have no substantial opposition to this bill. She said today that if she were immigration minister—Senator Keneally is Labors spokesperson on national security and the protection of women from overseas criminals—she would use section 116 of the Migration Act to deport permanent visa holders. She said that I, as minister, should have been aware of that and should have read that section of the act. There is only one problem with what Senator Keneally said publicly just before question time today: if she kept reading the act, shed have got to section 117 of the act. Section 117 says that that power cant be used in the case of a permanent visa holder. It cannot be cancelled under section 116. Thats millions of visa holders. So I say to Senator Keneally: youve had 1,200 days to do your homework on this bill. Understand that we are serious about the protection of Australians from serious crime and serious criminals. Read the act properly and you will understand this is a good law. The Labor Party should be supporting it. It is inexplicable that the Leader of the Opposition has signed a deal with the member for Melbourne in relation to this bill to oppose these laws when you consider what theyll do to protect Australians from future harm and future crimes.","Migration","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[11]/answer/talk.text/body/p[2]","N/A","N/A"

They wedged themselves and fell apart on the floor of this parliament and ended up voting against their own legislation. Then, when the amendment was carried consistent with what the Prime Minister had put to me in writing on 1 December and what he had told and leaked publicly to the media last December, he walked away from the legislation, but not before trying to do a deal in the cabinet about a national integrity commission, saying he would be prepared to bring it forward.

Two years—that is simply outrageous. Of course, the costs of construction have now increased, and this means that it will be more challenging to get this built. But get it built we will, because it is important for our local economy. We have a port that has been reliant on the local sugar industry, which clearly is in decline. We have lost a number of local sugar mills, which means a loss in production, and this means a loss in capacity needed at the Bundaberg port. We need to expand its operations, and a common conveyor will allow things like timber pallets to be exported more successfully, whether that be into the resources sector in the western regions around Biggenden and whether that be elsewhere.

That clearer picture, which is emerging after almost a decade now of LiberalNational governance, is of an economy which had its share of challenges even before the pandemic—flatlining productivity, weak business investment, stagnant wages, job insecurity, flatlining living standards and substandard economic growth well below average.

One of the concerns weve raised repeatedly about a budget which has $1 trillion of debt—multiples of what those opposite inherited from Labor—is that that budget is absolutely riddled with rorts and absolutely chockfull of waste. This is the most wasteful government since Federation, with every rort and bit of waste signed off by the Treasurer, the member for Kooyong, and the cabinet that sits opposite.

The first area she called out is that we need is leadership. Our recommendations are focused on strengthening leadership to foster safe and respectful work environments. This includes both institutional leadership and individual leadership of parliamentarians, officeholders and party leaders. Leaders set the tone, and leadership at the top is particularly important to set clear expectations and role model safe and respectful behaviour.","Parliamentary Workplace Reform (Set the Standard Measures No. 1) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[8]","N/A","N/A"

Susan Ryan introduced the Sex Discrimination Act, which became law in 1984 under the Hawke government. There are the female and male MPs—and we have one sitting down the front here—who made this an easier workplace for women like me who have had babies and young families while in office.

Not long after the March4Justice, I was sitting in a doctors reception, waiting for an appointment. They always play something on the television for everyone when they are waiting. There was a documentary on about the womens marches and the feminist movement in the 1970s. They showed some of the meetings of the women planning their actions and planning their marches. One thing that really struck me was how excited and happy they were and how they were, it seemed watching the documentary, full of a sense that they were going to make change and that, whilst they were angry at—lets face it—centuries of women not being treated equally to men, they also seemed to be full of positivity and hope.

She began working in my office early last year, during the period in which many issues which have prompted the Jenkins review and the current bill before the House came to light. So I sat down and had a chat with her and consulted with her on the process of writing this speech. I was relieved that she has always felt comfortable in her workplace and never felt uncomfortable within the parliament or in the workplace either. But despite that, through conversations with Maddie and other staffers, it became clear that, even for those women within parliamentary workplaces who cannot point to a specific experience of discomfort or harassment, there is a palpable sense of apprehension and almost fear. That apprehension is capable of creating a hostile workplace in itself.","Parliamentary Workplace Reform (Set the Standard Measures No. 1) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[5]","N/A","N/A"

I want to think about a point that really got to me in 2018. Cast your minds back to two weeks after former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called for cultural change in the way women are treated in this parliament, when the current AttorneyGeneral who was then the Minister for Jobs and Innovation used the privilege of cowards castle during a Senate estimates hearing to make threats to publicly name Labor female staffers. This was disgraceful—a sexist tirade that was predicated upon the innuendo that young female staffers were engaged in affairs. The implications made by the now AttorneyGeneral were baseless lies and deeply offensive to the women working in this building. This was done to serve her own political purposes. The now AttorneyGeneral explicitly threatened these young women and made public allegations without any proof or any rationale for her comments.

Disrespecting women by engaging in unsubstantiated inappropriate gossip regarding their personal lives is one of the many factors which contribute to broader harassment and violence against women. The appalling attitude towards women has been present for some time. Little has been done to address the gaping cultural issues within the government over the past few years. Last year, in the wake of the allegations made regarding the unsafe culture within Parliament House and the stories of women who came forward and shared their experiences of physical and mental violence, thousands of Australian men and women marched on Parliament House. They protested peacefully, demanding accountability and demanding justice. And what was the response? The Prime Minister responded by saying they were lucky not to have been met with bullets. This disrespect has been the hallmark of the latest incarnation of this government. There has been an appalling lack of leadership by those responsible for championing cultural change and the rights of survivors. Engaging in politics and our democracy is the birthright of all of us, but when people are afraid to engage in it, it means that we as a collective have failed.

Given the highly classified nature of her work, Libby couldnt tell anyone the vital role that she was playing; she simply told people that she was a typist. She kept this secret for 30 years. During this time the records of her service were misplaced and lost. This meant that for three decades, when she marched on Anzac Day, she simply did so as a civilian. Finally, in 2001, she received her service medals, but it wasnt with the fanfare or recognition that her service deserved. They simply turned up in the mail.

But this summer was stuffed up for a lot of people in Australia by this governments mistakes. I remember driving around my electorate over summer, looking at the massive, sometimes endless, queues of people lining up in the sun, and in the rain, to get a COVID test. People were forced to stand there for hours. I remember going to my local chemist trying to get a RAT and the chemist just laughing at me. They were almost impossible to find. Instead of being at the beach, a lot of people were forced to drive around from chemist to chemist to chemist—sometimes maybe even from my electorate to yours, Deputy Speaker Wicks—trying to find one of these damn things. If you were lucky enough to get one, then chances were that you had to pay too much for it. Only a couple of weeks ago I got an email from a constituent who said she had bought a RAT online from a major Australian company and the postage fee was 90 bucks—90 bucks!

Michael Beahan was a true Labor man and a great Australian. His story is one to which so many of us can relate in some way. Like a third of Australians, Michael was a migrant, coming to Australia as a 16yearold, and he worked at a factory manufacturing electrical equipment. He got an apprenticeship as an electrician and established his own small business. In his late 20s, Michael went back to study as a mature student. He obtained an arts degree and an education degree from the University of Western Australia and became a secondary school teacher. It was this combination of factoryfloor background, trade qualification and teacher education that led Mike Beahan to become WA Trades and Labour Councils first ever education officer and later the Trade Union Training Authoritys Western Australian director.","Beahan, Hon.

He also led the WA campaign for the 1983 federal election, again winning government from opposition and turning the erstwhile blue seats of Canning, Moore, Perth, Stirling and Tangney a deep shade of red. Perth has remained a Laborheld seat ever since under the stewardship of that great hockey player and champion Ric Charlesworth, another great hockey player Stephen Smith, Alannah MacTiernan, Tim Hammond and the incumbent, Patrick Gorman. 1983 was also the year in which Wendy Fatin was first elected to parliament as the member for Canning. Wendy, of course, then became the first member for Brand when the seat of Brand was created in 1984. Michael Beahan also led the WA Labor campaign in the 1984 federal election, at which not a single newly won Labor seat was lost to the Liberals. Nor were any WA Labor seats lost in the 1987 federal election, when Beahan was not only state secretary but also elected as a senator for Western Australia.","Beahan, Hon.

Now the corridors and our offices see art from everywhere in the nation, including art by many emerging artists.

In my time in this place, Ive had the privilege of working with Senator Lidia Thorpe and Senator Dorinda Cox, and one of the things that I have started to learn since being here is the meaning of the term intergenerational trauma. What it means is the pain that was suffered because of the violence and dispossession and the racist policies that saw children being stolen. It didnt just happen once; it happened over and over again, and it happened not just to the children that were taken and their families. The unimaginable grief and trauma that that inflicted got passed down to people who continue to live it. They continue to live it not only because it has been part of their family life but because it continues to happen in too many respects. It continues to happen in many ways in our society now, where we see much higher rates of First Nations children being taken and where we see children being locked up in a system that says that children as young as 10, in some places in this country, can be taken and put in prison. Prison is not a place for children. But that is where we are putting them, and we are doing it disproportionately to First Nations children. Some of the policies have ended, but some of them have continued. First Nations people now, as I am learning day by day, arent just having to deal with the traumas of the past, which we as white people in this country dont do a very good job of being honest about, but theyre having to deal with ongoing trauma being inflicted and reinflicted day after day, including on their children.","National Apology to the Stolen Generations: 14th Anniversary","STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BANDT (Melbourne—Leader of the Australian Greens) ","(17:10):"

But apologies have to be fully given. Apologies have to come without conditions if theyre to be full apologies. What did our Prime Minister say when it was his turn to come and speak? He said: Sorry is not the hardest word to say. The hardest is, I forgive you. No, Prime Minister; it is not in your remit to be talking about offering forgiveness. That is something that only those whom injustice has been inflicted upon are in a position to offer. And, in many instances, theyre only going to do that when they think theres sincerity and when they think theres been truth and when they think theres been healing. That is why, when this sorry with an asterisk came during this really significant occasion, there was outrage. There was outrage from the First Peoples Assembly of Victoria, who said, Get in the bin, and there was outrage from our senator Lidia Thorpe, who said, How dare you ask for forgiveness when you still perpetrate racist policies and systems that continue to steal our babies?","National Apology to the Stolen Generations: 14th Anniversary","STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"

When the Prime Minister stands and addresses the country, people need to hear that he understands the pain and not that he is somehow suggesting that the next step must be forgiveness. The apology must be unconditional for it to mean anything, but this one came with an asterisk. There is work to do. Forgiveness is something you earn, not demand. We have to start in this country by telling the truth, especially those of us who benefit from the decades of dispossession and violence that have happened, that have come before us. All of us who are not First Nations people benefit from it. It is time that we told the truth about that. We also can do some practical things like have a proper, fully serviced national compensation fund. That is not going to take away the pain but it will go some way to helping people address it and will go some way to acknowledging the pain and suffering. Thats what weve been pushing for—a nationally consistent compensation scheme, as well as ensuring that there are the range of services available to provide for the emotional and mental health needs of survivors. It is something that makes sense and something that we will continue to push for. But, when we have a situation where descendants of the stolen generation are twice as likely to have experienced discrimination in the last 12 months, 1.9 times as likely to have experienced violence in the last 12 months and 1.6 times as likely to be in poorer health compared to other First Nations people, we have a responsibility to apologise fully and unconditionally but then to set about a process of action and healing.","National Apology to the Stolen Generations: 14th Anniversary","STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

But, so long as we fail to tell the truth, all of us are going to suffer. You cant sweep this under the carpet. You cant sweep history under the carpet, especially because, in too many respects, its continuing to happen.

Of course, she has family connections who were part of the stolen generation. Its very real for people in the Top End. Nova, having established the Nova Peris Foundation, is doing some project work in the Tiwi Islands. The Royal Australian Navy recently had her sponsor NUSHIP Arafura, down in Adelaide, which I think is extremely appropriate. And she can feel very proud that she played a strong role in the campaign to free the Aboriginal flag. Well done, Nova!

The money never made it to those kids, and those kids thought that their parents didnt love them. It was only after their parents died that these kids, who grew up to become adults, learned the true story. They now carry around, like a stone, the guilt that they feel about their parents.

For those of us who did lockdown and had to selfisolate et cetera, there was an end date. The refugees came looking for safety and found themselves in indefinite detention.

Im proud of the fact that, under this coalition government, we have seen an increase in services in areas like health, with, for example, funding for the Royal North Shore Hospital, and health care on the North Shore at record levels. Im proud of the fact that weve seen increased funding flowing to aged care. Im proud of the support that weve been able to provide to our schools, both government and nongovernment.","North Sydney Electorate","GRIEVANCE DEBATE","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[2]","N/A","N/A"

One of the projects that Ive been most involved in has been the work of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust at the two sites that lie within my electorate. At the Woolwich Dock, weve seen increased funding to support its ongoing restoration. At Sub Base Platypus, the old submarine base, we are in the final stages of creating what is such a magnificent community facility. It is not often that you have the opportunity to create new open spaces, new parks and new community facilities around our crowded harbour foreshore, and thats what this government has been able to achieve. Soon, construction will begin, with support from this government, of what will be the final but probably most significant part of its rehabilitation as a community site, and that will come with the demolition of the old torpedo factory and the creation of even more parkland. The harbour foreshore is a precious part of our local community not only because of its intrinsic environmental values but because of the opportunity to create more recreational space.","North Sydney Electorate","GRIEVANCE DEBATE","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"

So a big focus of my work as the member for North Sydney has been to make sure that, to the extent the federal government can, we are supporting an increase in the capacity of our local sporting facilities, and thats been reflected in some of the projects that Ive successfully fought for. Weve been able to support the Lane Cove Council to rebuild the outdoor pool at Lane Cove, and I saw this just a week or so ago when I visited the Lane Cove Swim Club. The pool was at risk of falling into Pottery Green below it and needed to be completely rebuilt. I am very proud of the work that were doing at the moment to support North Sydney Council to rebuild the North Sydney Olympic Pool, a pool that has a national profile. Its one of the most beautiful pools in our country. Again, it faces major structural issues, with a grandstand that has been there since the Empire Games were held there—they were actually the catalyst for its construction—and a pool shell which was cracking and leaking water into Sydney Harbour at an alarming rate. Through the $10 million were providing, that pool is now being rebuilt in a way that will serve future generations.","North Sydney Electorate","GRIEVANCE DEBATE","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

These regional hubs have in turn seen huge levels of development and growth, so they are now cities and destinations in their own right.

Building this infrastructure will be expensive—thats undeniable—but, when you compare the low cost of regional land currently with the cost of land in Sydney and Melbourne, or the cost of land in comparable mega regions, it is clear that so great an uplift can fund the cost of the infrastructure many times over. We just have to find a way to capture this uplift and hypothecate it towards the cost of the infrastructure.

Further levies on hyperprofits like those seen at Badgerys Creek should also be captured. This should not be seen as the introduction of a tax. There is a clear justification for retrieving some of the gains that have been created only by investment of taxpayers money.

National infrastructure on this scale is clearly well outside the interests of this smallscale electoral cycle. Planning settlement and building huge pieces of infrastructure are the work of decades, not three years, and longterm plans that remain constant are less attractive in a political climate that prioritises new announcements over large deliveries.

Well, this issue has now become an escalating integrity crisis for Geoff Provest. If this land is rezoned, he needs to take responsibility and resign from state parliament, because his election in 2019 would then have been based on a lie. Everyone wants a new Tweed hospital.
