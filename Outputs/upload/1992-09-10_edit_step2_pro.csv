I refer him to the ANZ Bank report yesterday, reported in todays press, that the rundown in national savings, both private and public, for the last five quarters has been the most severe for almost 20 years and that national consumption is exceeding national disposable income by no less than 2.2 per cent of GDP. Does he agree that the increase in our national savings is essential for investment, job creation and stronger economic growth? If so, why does the Government persist with policies which deliberately accelerate the fall in public savings? I also ask whether it is correct that the Government brought on the recession which commenced in 1989-90 because consumption was far outstripping production. If so, why does the Government continue to pursue policies which lead to increased consumption without doing anything to provide the necessary climate for increased production?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[1]/question[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The fact is that private savings fall because of falling incomes. So far as public savings are concerned, we had a bit of a debate about this following the Budget, but we believe the Governments budgetary position is sound because the structural Budget position is correct. The Budget deficit for 1992-93 is estimated to be 3.3 per cent of GDP—less, of course, than the 4.1 per cent we inherited in 1983-84.Opposition senators —Oh!","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[1]/answer[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
6,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BUTTON","4F4","VIC","ALP","N/A",675,"—Well, that is true. I understand the Oppositions reluctance, bent on narrow ideological commitment, to acknowledge facts. The fact is that in 1983-84 the Budget deficit as a percentage of GDP was 4.1 per cent. It is now 3.3 per cent. The Australian Governments Budget deficit as a share of GDP is lower in 1992-93, at 3.3 per cent, than that of the United States, which is 4.4 per cent, the United Kingdom, which is 4.2 per cent and Canada, which is 3.6 per cent, to take three relevant examples.Over the years of Liberal-National Party Government Budgets, deficits averaged 2.4 per cent of GDP. Between 1984-85 and 1992-93, the estimated outcome is one per cent of GDP—around three-quarters of one per cent—and that includes the current years estimate of 3.3 per cent, averaging it out over the period of this Government.By international standards, as I pointed out, that is a very modest deficit outcome. That is because this Government is the only one in the last 30 years of the history of this country to run four Budget surpluses successively. In that circumstance, we can afford increased expenditure to help boost the economy and the productive sector of the economy, to which Senator Short referred in his question. In the context of a recession, that is an appropriate policy to adopt.The Governments proven fiscal record has resulted in Australia having the lowest general government gross debt. In terms of the private sector, we hope for a recovery in that situation as we come out of the recession.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[1]/answer[1]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

Nissan Motor Co globally.I commend the reading of this article from a company which was once a manufacturer here, and will be until October, but which will become an importer of cars into this country. It highlights the importance of stability in tariff policy for this industry and the importance of linking this Australian industry with the global automotive economy. If we do not do that it will not survive. If honourable senators note that the automotive industry exported $1.2 billion last year, and that figure is growing, then they will understand the importance of those connections with the global automotive industry.The decisions by the Government were based on an Industry Commission report. Some of the Oppositions principally zealous spokesmen go around the country saying, `We are going to save industry $20 billion. Look at the Industry Commission report which identifies all these savings. We are going to screw our courage to the sticking place and save industry all these costs economy wide—all costs based on the Industry Commission report. When it comes to the automotive industry, because of mindless zealotry, the Opposition says, `The Industry Commission report is not good enough for us. We are tougher than the Industry Commission on this issue. We are pursuing a National Farmers Federation 1970 agenda and we are going to have zero tariff for everybody. That is what the Opposition is saying.With respect to the Industry Commission report, it is not only that fact but also the fact that the Leader of the Opposition misreads the report and goes to Adelaide and says, `We will create 5,000 more jobs in the automotive industry in Australia. That is the most loopy statement I have ever heard about industry policy by any leader in this country. How does he do that? He reads selectively an Industry Commission report which says that if all the changes are made to industry generally across Australia then more jobs would be created in an industry like this. But he ignores the Commissions estimates of the many more thousands of jobs that would be lost as a result of a zero tariff option.Somebody said even death is a learning experience.

18,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TATE","NJ4","TAS","ALP","N/A",677,"—I find it incredible that this question is directed to me in my capacity as representing the Minister for Health when it is about the purported decline in income available to two-income households in Australia. It seems to me to have nothing to do with any particular portfolio responsibility that I represent.However, it is quite clear that the effect of the Federal Oppositions policy in the area for which I do have representation in this chamber would be to create a situation where those who are involved in providing for their households the medical and health services that are essential in the case of a particular illness or disease or traumatic automobile or industrial accident would be in a far worse position than they will be under the newly announced Medicare revamping that has been undertaken by this Government. I am quite sure that the Australian people and the householders to whom Senator Reid refers will want to have the assurance they can have from this Government that, in particular, the public hospital system will receive a huge injection of funds to ensure that all Australians can receive the medical and hospital attention they need to deal particularly with chronic illnesses and traumatic accidents, which otherwise can lead to tremendous expenditures falling on the household.The Oppositions answer to that is to require householders to pay increased private health insurance premiums. In order to shield some of the low income earners from the increased private health insurance premiums, they will transfer money that would otherwise go to the public hospitals in this country—they are cutting funds to the States by 5 per cent and that must impact on the public hospital system—to subsidies for private health insurance premiums. Under the Opposition, private health insurance premiums will increase because those opposite will leave an unregulated market where the private hospital system, and particularly the AMA and the doctors who belong to that union, will be able, according to Dr Hewson when he visited the AMA, to charge whatever the market will bear.Australian households of the sort Senator Reid purports to be concerned about will be faced with increasing costs to visit their general practitioner in order to get that vital primary health care, the primary way in which they receive medical attention. I believe that Senator Reid has misdirected her question. However, in so far as households will be affected by our various policies on the provision of health care, it is quite clear that Australian households will be far better off and less financially penalised under the Federal Governments proposals than they would be under the Oppositions.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[3]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

26,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COOK","RF4","WA","ALP","N/A",678,"—That is right, Mr President. These figures are about absenteeism. Dr Hewsons comment attacking Australian workers for being lazy is relevant to the findings of the survey. The survey was reported by the National Institute of Labour Studies in Adelaide. It was reported most recently in the Sydney Morning Herald under the headline `A nation of sickie takers? Its just an Aussie myth. I will just summarise the report, which stated:Australians invented the term `sickie but new research shows our reputation for taking them, which is said to have endangered our productivity and international competitiveness, is undeserved. We are not a nation of malingerers after all.The research found that most Australians use only half their entitlement.The article continues:Mr Mark Wooden, an associate professor at the National Institute of Labour Studies in Adelaide, who has recently completed one of the biggest studies undertaken of absenteeism, found that despite a runny nose, a sore throat or a stiff back, most people drag themselves out of bed and into the workplace.Those are the findings of the research. The findings show that absenteeism in Australia is less than in most OECD countries, that most Australians take, at most, only half of their entitlements, and that we are ranked in the middle order in the OECD.That has to be contrasted with the allegations that Dr Hewson makes about lazy Australian workers. There is another report, referred to in todays Courier-Mail in Queensland, by an Australian consulting group, Towers Perin, which compiled a national study entitled A Day in the Life , to find out attitudes and views in the Australian workplace. The article quotes the report as stating:`Australian workers are a cheery, hard-working lot—but they want a pat on the back for it. Thats the finding of a report released today, the most extensive ever compiled in Australia on the attitudes and opinions of the workforce.The article continues:The findings contrasted markedly with Australias image as a nation of lazy and indifferent workers.I conclude this quote with the statement:Employers groups, surprisingly, endorsed these surveys findings yesterday, admitting that managers could do better to foster closer relationships between themselves and their staff.I think it is true that Australian farmers are hard working; certainly Australian miners are amongst the most productive in the world. In my recent tour of Australian manufacturing industry, employers said that their most important asset is their workers and they wished that they could pay them more. There is a general recognition, at real industry level, that the Australian worker is productive and hard working. But this continual knocking by Dr Hewson—knocking of the economy, knocking of the dollar and, now, knocking of Australian workers—is shameful and is an indication of his erratic behaviour and his immaturity.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[4]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

Finally, will the Government consider emergency measures to protect the Australian sugar industry from further damage arising from this US decision?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[1]/question[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
29,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BUTTON","4F4","VIC","ALP","N/A",679,"—I will answer the last part of the question first. The Government announced a policy of an effective tariff level in respect of the sugar industry in June of this year. It has an Industry Commission report before it for consideration, which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, has already indicated the Government does not intend to adopt in the totality of its recommendations.In respect of the second last part of the question, there are all sorts of fears, probably legitimate, in respect of both North America and a move towards higher protectionism for the NAFTA group of countries. There are fears about that, but those fears have to be considered in the hothouse environment of a United States presidential election in November in which it would seem, from reading the pronouncements by various political figures there, that almost anything goes. We have to take that into account in assessing the course of the American election and what might follow after it.Fears are sometimes expressed about increased protectionism in Europe. It is very difficult to draw conclusions about that at present, but it may be so. If one looks at the European Communitys agreement with Japan about the automotive industry, one can see that there is a highly protective regime in place until the year 2000, which effectively limits Japanese car imports into the European Community to 16 per cent of the market. The Europeans say that after the year 2000 it will be a free market, but we have heard all those things before. So there are concerns about those sorts of issues.I make the point that 60 per cent of this countrys trade is now conducted with the countries of the Asia-Pacific region. For example, the ASEAN countries are committed to lowering protection. In some countries within ASEAN, such as Singapore, there is pretty well a free market, as there is in Hong Kong. In various parts of the region there are different regimes in place. The things Senator Coulter talked about in North America as growing trends towards protectionism are not so apparent in the area in which we conduct something like 60 per cent of our trade and where our largest trading partners are Japan, Taiwan, China, Korea and so on. A very small percentage of our trade is conducted, for example, with the United Kingdom or Europe, relative to what it was 30 years ago.As far as the sugar industry is concerned, the trap in NAFTA and the illusions that have been floated around about NAFTA and Australia becoming a member of NAFTA are simply these: it is quite apparent that in terms of imports, of free trade with Australia, as a member of the NAFTA group we would be beneficiaries—I hope the way I am using that word is understood—of computers, motor cars and things of that kind from the United States. Our industries such as sugar, wheat, steel and dairy products would not be beneficiaries of any such arrangement. It is quite clear that our exports to the United States would not be allowed in on a free and fair basis in the context of the NAFTA agreement. That is why they do not want us. That is why they have never asked us to join NAFTA, and it is most unlikely that they ever would. Our more competitive industries would do a lot of damage in their marketplace, and that is something the United States clearly will not tolerate, whether it be from Japan or anywhere else.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[1]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

41,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COLLINS","OF4","NT","ALP","N/A",680,"—On a bitumen road, Senator Tambling keeps on interjecting. These reports have sparked the usual tirade of abuse—supported, I am pleased to say again, vociferously by Senator Tambling. Of course, I make these comments as someone who actually worked in Kakadu National Park for eight years before I got into politics. Parks do need to be managed. As usual, only half the story has been told. I am pleased to advise the Senate of the other half. The parks plan of management, which is legally binding on the management of ANPWS, explicitly forbids events such as car rallies being held in the park, which is not surprising. Therefore, there was no discretion at all for the park management, under their plan of management, to have allowed this rally to occur in the way it was proposed, anyway. But no-one, of course, including Senator Tambling, paid the slightest attention to pointing that out.If I am being asked whether the Federal Government plans to remove the explicit prohibition on holding car rallies inside a national park, the answer is no, we do not. Frankly, I would be amazed if the Opposition shadow Minister for the environment would support such a proposal in any case.The other problem was that the organisers had failed to tell the board of management of the national park of their plans to hold the rally. That did not get a mention, either. The ANPWS has gone to considerable trouble to tell the organisers of the rally that it is happy to cooperate in the aim of the rally, that is, to raise money for charities, if it can possibly do so. ANPWS management have informed me that they are confident that plans can be made for some reasonable action to be taken to allow the rally to have some presence in the park in a way which will not disturb the other park visitors.The case for the organisers of the bash was not helped—and this was something they had to acknowledge—by the behaviour of the rally participants the last time the bash was allowed to go into the park, when the park management was besieged with complaints by other park users about the grossly unsociable behaviour of some of the rally participants. I do not say this as a criticism of the rally organisers—we are talking about 2,000 people in one group, and we cannot expect to control them all—but, among other things, the last time they went into the national park some of the rally participants violated sacred sites by urinating on them and by indulging in unsociable behaviour such as drinking and careering off the roads and driving over the very sensitive environment in their vehicles.I conclude by saying that the ANPWS management is anxious to cooperate with the rally to assist in raising money for the charity it is proposing to support, but at the same time not destroying the amenity for all the other visitors to the park.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[2]/answer/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

49,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BUTTON","4F4","VIC","ALP","N/A",682,"—Senator Sowada is correct in that the Government appropriated a sum of money in the Budget for this purpose. There has been some discussion about it for some years, because it is felt that the life of the present Lucas Heights nuclear reactor runs out at some time in the year 2005, I think it is. I am not sure of the exact date.If I might say so, without being rude, what the honourable senator is doing by way of this question is suggesting to me some topics which should be considered by an independent inquiry. The Minister for Science and Technology is quite determined that there be an independent inquiry into the future of the nuclear reactor after the year 2005 or whatever it is.One of the things the inquiry will have to do if it decides that there should be a further investment in a new reactor is to determine where that new reactor should be, whether it should be at Lucas Heights or somewhere else. That would be one of the considerations. It may be that, if the inquiry determines that it should be somewhere else, the question of an inquiry into the health of local residents would perhaps be less relevant, depending on the proposed siting which the inquiry might suggest.In so far as the need for a nuclear reactor is concerned, I cannot say anything about that. The inquiry will presumably assess that. There are very legitimate and important uses of the Lucas Heights reactor, particularly in terms of production of medical isotopes and so on. The nuclear medicine industry is large and growing in Australia and also as an export industry from the Lucas Heights premises. I think that will be a factor which the inquiry will want to take into account.They are my comments, but let me address Senator Sowadas question to the Minister for Science. I am sure he will take into account many of the considerations which she has raised in her question.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Could I suggest to Senator Tambling that he might like to pay a visit to Uluru National Park and have a look at this so-called open road he referred to on which the organisers want to put these cars. It is not an open road; it is the bitumen road that runs around the base of the Rock to allow people access in buses to have a look at the reason they go to Ayers Rock, that is, Ayers Rock. That is the road. It is not an open road.Parks have to be managed. People who go to parks want to have a look at the resources of the park—at the flora, the fauna, the physical attributes of the park. If at all possible, they want to do it in a bit of peace and quiet. That is why people go to national parks. I repeat: the last time the bash went to the park, some of the participants—and these are mostly young people having a good time, and fair enough—indulged in highly unsociable behaviour. They violated Aboriginal sacred sites and took their vehicles off the road and drove over parts of the park not on the road. As a result, the park service received many complaints from other users of the park.The position the Opposition is taking on this, shamefully supported by Senator Tambling, gives us a taste of what our national parks would be like should these people ever get into government. I say again that I would like to hear a public statement from the Federal shadow Minister for the environment as to whether he supports the current plan of management for Uluru National Park, which specifically excludes things such as car rallies from inside what is in fact a very small national park. Kakadu is a big national park; Uluru is a small one, with very heavy pressure from visitor numbers. It is a perfectly reasonable exclusion.I say again that the management of Uluru National Park is anxious, ready and willing to support the organisers of this rally and to help them raise money for their charity by getting them media coverage, which I know can be done in a managed way, but at the same time, as I said before, not to destroy the amenity of the national park for other users.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[5]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

Only yesterday my colleague Senator Bob Collins was able to present to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police the Institutes inaugural innovative management award. The Australian Federal Police has carried out perhaps the most extensive reorganisation ever undertaken by any Federal Government agency, perhaps any government agency in Australia, over the last three to four years, under the direction of the Commissioner and with my full support.Basically, what he has done is to achieve a situation where those members of the Australian Federal Police are on fixed term contracts, which means that at the end of 10 years their efficiency, their constructive contribution to the force, is assessed. If, indeed, it has been constructive, there is a renewal of their contract. But there has been a move away from the idea of security of tenure until the traditional time of retirement. There has been a complete reorganisation away from the very hierarchical and quasi-military style of police force which has been inherited from the experience in Britain. In this way, there has been an amalgamation of the sworn members and the staff members of the AFP, a reduction in the structure of the ranks from 11 to five, and the development of performance based promotion criteria. In this way, as I say, there has been a complete reorganisation, restructuring and refocussing of the Australian Federal Police.This could not have occurred without the full cooperation of the union concerned, the Australian Federal Police Association. Indeed, it has played a very important role in ensuring that its members understood the significance and impact of the change on their individual circumstances and on the organisation concerned.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[6]/answer/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

59,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","VIC","ALP","N/A",685,"—My colleagues are being a bit cruel to Senator Boswell because he always intended to ask this question. He was disadvantaged only by his position in the starting order. So it is a case of two great minds thinking alike.This particular issue has been under consideration by the Australian Government for some time. It does underline the difficulties of getting trade liberalisation from the United States in a bilateral agricultural area. Really, the problem will not be great in the first six years, I think it must be conceded, because in that time it affects only a fraction of the Australian trade. The tariff reduction period for sugar is the longest phase-out period of any product in the NAFTA area, being 15 years. Also, there are other arrangements which are contingent and conditional with regard to this matter. It is not easy to try to predict the trade consequences with regard to NAFTA and sugar.At the moment Mexico is a net importer of sugar and it has an undeveloped sugar industry. The US sugar regime applies a tariff quota to all imports. Naturally, once one gets outside the quota area, as Senator Boswell would know, the tariff makes any exports to the United States virtually impossible.Australias allocation for the 1992-93 marketing year is 96,786 tonnes of sugar. The Mexican quota is 7,250 tonnes. Under NAFTA, over the first six years the Mexican quota can increase from 7,250 tonnes to 25,000 tonnes. One would have to say that is an exceptionally marginal change. The crunch point comes after the six year period because then the quantity allowed from Mexico would be 150,000 tonnes. Clearly, in six years time, this would trigger a major difficulty for Australia. After that, the quota can continue to grow at 10 per cent per annum.All of this is dependent on Mexico being a net exporter. However, what will probably happen, as I think Senator Boswell has indicated in his question, is that corn sweeteners from the USA will probably pour into Mexico, in turn have an import substitution effect and in turn make it more likely that Mexico becomes a net exporter of sugar products.At every stage in the formulation of the NAFTA concept, through our congressional lobbyists and others in Washington, we have pressed the Americans on this point. We will continue to do so. We will also continue to try to protect our access to the Canadian market, which is far more substantial than it is to the US market. The real crunch point, though, comes when Congress looks at these proposals. That is when we will have to put in our maximum effort. The crunch point down the track comes in six years time.I do welcome the question on sugar from Senator Boswell. He has been silent on this issue for some time. When I happened to be in Queensland, I watched him run around making some very effective statements on sugar. I have listened to him make some very powerful statements on sugar in this chamber.

The paper went on to say that I had called on Mr McLachlan to give an assurance that the coalition wanted to retain the manufacturing sector.The political correspondent, Mr Ross Peake, has told a deliberate lie in this newspaper. At no stage did I express any concern about our tariff policy or any part of our Fightback policy—at no stage! At no stage did I call on Mr McLachlan, as the newspaper suggested, to give an assurance that the coalition wanted to retain manufacturing industry. That is completely untrue and I want an apology from the Canberra Times . I do not know where Ross Peake got his information but, wherever he got his information from, I believe that he made it up. I do not believe for one moment any of my colleagues would have misrepresented me so thoroughly in the party room. I believe that Ross Peake made that up.When we get to the stage where the media print deliberate lies about what is said in our party room and they do not have to make an apology for it, I believe that we have reached a pretty poor situation.

84,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BEAHAN","NE4","(Western Australia)","ALP","N/A",691,"—by leave—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the report of the Committee on the conduct of elections, New Boundaries for Cooperation , together with submissions and the transcript of evidence. I move:That the Senate take note of the report.I seek leave to have my tabling speech incorporated in Hansard .Leave granted.The speech read as follows —On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters I present the Committees report entitled The Conduct of Elections: New Boundaries for Cooperation.There is no doubt that the conduct of elections is a matter of great interest to all members and senators.There is an unfortunate tendency to take for granted the fact that we have an electoral system which is:reliable, professional, free of corruption and independent of government or political influence;an electoral system in which the community can generally have confidence.This is not so in many countries, and it is interesting to note how highly regarded our Australian electoral officers are when they are employed as advisers or observers in the conduct of elections in newly democratic systems.So the inquiry and its report The Conduct of Elections: New Boundaries for Cooperation should be seen in the context that both the Australian Electoral Commission and the various State commissions run consistently highly professional elections.But we should always strive for better and more efficient ways of doing things and this is what the report is about.While electoral systems as individual systems are efficient this cannot be said of the constitutional structure in which they operate.There is much talk currently of the need for micro economic reform. One prominent figure went so far as to say that every galah has an opinion on the subject. One of the areas most in need of micro economic reform is the Constitution. From an electoral standpoint there is something slightly absurd about the presence of eight electoral systems in a country of seventeen million people—with a ninth currently planned for the Australian Capital Territory.The inquiry set out boldly and perhaps over optimistically to look for sources of reform in one area, the conduct of elections. Despite the early fears of some, the Committee did not see this as a one way process. They were not obsessed, as some seemed to believe, with a Federal takeover of State sovereign rights. There was just as much discussion about proposals that the States run Federal elections as there was about the proposal that there should be one national electoral system.Perhaps Professor Hughes, the former Chief Electoral Commissioner was correct when he said in evidence:The possibility of having only one set of electoral authorities, the States, was lost shortly after federation, when the Commonwealth chose to set up its own machinery on the ground that differences in the Federal and State electoral systems required different electoral officials to administer them.The Committee became aware very early that a long history of tensions, mistrust and rivalry both between Federal and State institutions and, for that matter between State institutions themselves could not be overcome easily.So the report is a compromise but a practical document containing 59 recommendations which the Committee believes are possible of achievement even given the seemingly impossible obstacles and antagonisms between the eight administrations.The Committee found it difficult to make a comparative analysis of the costs of conducting elections across the eight electoral administrations, because of their different accounting and reporting procedures. However, it does appear that the costs incurred by the Australian Electoral Commission are relatively high. In this regard the impact of maintaining a permanent office in each Federal electoral division on the AECs costs is significant. The cost of supporting the divisional network in the AECs State head offices and central office add further to the total cost of a permanent divisional structure.The divisional network has been subjected to scrutiny on several occasions, but has managed to survive the `rationalisation which has been the lot of the public service generally. The Committee believes that the interests of the electorate are best served by retaining a dedicated returning officer for each Federal division within a reorganised divisional network. Savings in infrastructure costs would result. Several recommendations in the report address how this might be achieved.Grouping some divisional returning officers and their support staff in regional offices, or collocating two or more divisional returning officers and support staff, would be a sensible reorganisation in metropolitan and major provincial centres. Decisions on how to reorganise particular offices ought to be based on costs and on benefits and convenience to electors. The operational requirements of particular divisional offices are more relevant to the concept of reorganisation than the development and application of a set staffing entitlement.The topic of resource sharing between the State electoral commissions and the Australian Electoral Commission did not produce as much excitement as the divisional returning officers and the electoral rolls did. Nevertheless it was a most productive term of reference in relation to suggestions for improvements aimed at making voting more `user-friendly. Twenty-seven of the reports fifty-nine recommendations relate to increasing and enhancing resource sharing between State commissions and the AEC.The Committee addressed two main issues in considering how resource sharing between the Commonwealth and the States might improve voter convenience.the first is the confusion that many voters experience when they discover that Federal and State elections are conducted by different electoral administrations. This confusion is apparent when voters at State electoral events expect assistance at Federal divisional returning offices. The confusion is exacerbated when people attempt to cast pre-poll and postal votes across electoral systems. The number of people being denied assistance or information on the grounds that they have visited or phoned the `wrong office will be significantly decreased if the Committees recommendations are adopted.the second area of resource sharing which could enhance voter convenience is that of polling procedures. Within the limits of differing relevant electoral acts there is scope for some standardisation. This would be more convenient for voters and for polling officials who often work for both Federal and State administrations.Other resource sharing recommendations address administrative procedures; the use of common returning officers and polling staff; staff training and development; and electoral research and education.The Committee gave serious consideration to the possibility of establishing a single electoral body to conduct all Federal and State elections. The concept was favoured by many of the AECs divisional staff. Their support reflected the fact that they are in the front line of attack when would-be voters experience the confusion and inconvenience caused by the existence of separate electoral bodies in Federal and State jurisdictions.Despite the fact that many of the arguments in favour of a single electoral body were persuasive, it was obvious that the concept could never command a level of acceptance necessary to introduce it, even on a limited or experimental basis. Most States were implacably opposed to the idea of a single body, though some offered to conduct Federal elections on behalf of the Commonwealth within the particular State.The electoral roll and the dissatisfaction of some of the States with the roll maintenance service provided by the Australian Electoral Commission, were dominant issues in the inquiry. A fourth term of reference was added after the initial advertising of the inquiry, in order to accommodate the States concerns.From the beginning of the inquiry it was obvious that there was intense interest in both the costs and methods of maintaining the electoral roll. For all States and Territories except South Australia, the Australian Electoral Commission collects the data and compiles the roll using a computer roll management system called `RMANS. The fact that the `user pays principle is now being applied to electoral roll maintenance, and the increasing sophistication of computer technology has put RMANS under close scrutiny. Some States expressed concern at the lack of consultation about roll maintenance issues, including the development of RMANS.The Committee took these concerns seriously and gave much attention to them as it considered its recommendations, designed to improve the national management of our rolls.The Committee recommends the establishment of an Australian Joint Roll Council, to consist of representatives from all electoral administrations, to oversee roll management. The council could also address other matters of concern to more than one electoral administration.To complement the Australian Joint Roll Council the Committee recommends a ministerial council of Ministers responsible for electoral matters in each legislature.The Committee stopped short of recommending that the Australian Electoral Commission be expanded to include one of the State electoral commissioners in rotation, although we have recommended that this be placed before the ministerial council. If approved, this expansion of the AEC would provide a substantial voice for the interests of roll users.The unfavourable views some States hold regarding the AECs divisional network were raised in relation to the cost of roll maintenance. As the States have been asked to pay half the direct costs of maintaining the roll, some of them placed on record their concern about the rolls reliance on the network of divisional returning offices in each Federal electorate. Some States see the maintenance of a permanent field structure as an unnecessary and costly administrative practice—one which they decline to support financially, even if the support is indirect.The effectiveness of `habitation reviews or as they are now called—`electoral roll reviews in cleansing the roll also came in for some criticism from the States. The Committee recommends that the proposed Australian Joint Roll Council consider alternatives to habitation reviews. For the present, the timing of roll reviews should reflect the electoral timetable of the States as well as that of the Commonwealth. The funding of electoral roll reviews should reflect the purpose of the particular review.At the outset of this inquiry the Committee had no idea that it would wander through such an intricate labyrinth of administrative and technical detail. Particularly in relation to the costs and methods of maintaining the roll, what appeared on the surface to require a review of policy in fact demanded investigation of major questions of personnel management, intergovernmental relations and detailed technical information. The Committee trusts that the inquiry has provided a useful forum for these issues, and that the resulting report will contribute to workable solutions to existing problems.The Committee was assisted in its task by two expert advisers—Mr Mike Duff, the South Australian Deputy Electoral Commissioner and Mr Tim Glanville, the Deputy Australian Electoral Officer for Victoria. I would like to place on record the Committees appreciation of the contribution made by both advisers to our understanding of the intricacies of electoral administration. We thank them very much.Thanks should also be directed to Laurie Brereton the former Chairman of the Committee and to Bev Forbes the former Secretary for the work they did during the early days of this inquiry.I would also like to thank the current Committee staff, the Secretary Judy Middlebrook and her assistant Frances Coates for their skill, dedication and willingness to help, and the Chairman Arch Bevis who managed to weave his way through a complex web of claims and counter claims to achieve a bi-partisan report.Mr President, I commend the report to the Senate.I seek leave to continue my remarks later.Leave granted; debate adjourned.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is not appropriate that tobacco and alcohol be included in the basket of goods and services that is used to calculate the index of prices that are paid by the average Australian consumer. The majority of Australians do not use tobacco, and alcohol usage is incidental to daily sustenance. If these products are removed from the CPI calculations, a major immediate effect would be to liberate the taxing authority from any concerns that increasing excises or taxes would be inflationary.","N/A","CENSUS AND STATISTICS LEGISLATION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

This Bill will also clarify issues relating to the AIDCs trading powers and reduce the size of its Board. The extension of the Commonwealth guarantee to 30 June 1998 will have no net effect on revenue.BackgroundAIDC, the Corporation, is a Government Business Enterprise which was established in the early seventies. In 1989 the operations of the Corporation were changed: a new company, AIDC Ltd, was floated on the Australian Stock Exchange. The Corporation retains an 81 per cent interest in AIDC Ltd.AIDC Ltd has taken over the investing operations formerly carried out by the Corporation. It operates in a commercial manner without Government direction.Under a management arrangement between the Corporation and AIDC Ltd, the Corporation is the borrower on behalf of AIDC Ltd. The AIDC Act allows for AIDC borrowings to be guaranteed by the Commonwealth. At 30 June 1992 the amount of borrowings guaranteed by the Commonwealth stood at around $2.7 billion.The Commonwealth GuaranteeThe AIDC Act currently provides for the Commonwealth guarantee on AIDC borrowings to expire on 30 June 1994. This Bill amends s35 of that Act to implement the Governments decision to extend the guarantee to 30 June 1998.There is also a need to clarify the Commonwealths obligation to AlDCs borrowings made during the operation of the Commonwealth guarantee, but which are subsequently rolled over into a further investment. These amendments ensure that the guarantee does not continue on moneys reinvested after the statutory limit on the Commonwealth guarantee has expired.Reduction in AIDC BoardAt present the Board of AIDC is composed of a Chairman, the Chief Executive of the Corporation, the Secretaries of the Departments of Industry, Technology and Commerce, and Primary Industry and Energy. At present the statutory minimum number of other directors is between 4 and 8.AIDC is now basically a holding corporation with the AIDC Ltd as the operating company of the group. Indeed, since 1990 AIDC has been managed by AIDC Ltd under an agreement between them. Accordingly, the requirement for a large Board is no longer appropriate.It is proposed that the number of `other directors who may be appointed be reduced to one.Power of AIDC to enter into swaps and other financial transactionsA UK court ruling has called into question the power of statutory corporations to enter into certain financial arrangements such as interest rate swaps, foreign exchange agreements, forward rate agreements, options, futures, or hedge agreements. Given AlDCs role as a corporation operating in financial markets it is important to have its powers clearly defined. These amendments make it clear that the AIDC has these powers.Debate (on motion by Senator Knowles ) adjourned.","N/A","AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1992","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

102,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOLKUS","XE4","(South Australia-","ALP","Minister for Administrative Services)",695,"—I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard .Leave granted.The speeches read as follows —SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF PROCESS BILL 1992On 5 March 1992, the Honourable Peter Duncan MP, Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, introduced a Service and Execution of Process Bill in the House of Representatives.In the Second Reading speech introducing the Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary said that the Bill was an important law reform measure and that Honourable Members, the States and Territories, the legal profession and other interested persons should have an adequate time to examine it before debate. He welcomed comments and suggestions on the Bill.Comments were received on that Bill from State and Territory agencies (with whose operations the Bill is most concerned) and from other persons and bodies. As a result of these comments and consultation with State and Territory agencies some changes to improve either understanding of the Bill or its operation were identified. While the changes were few many amendments, mostly consequential or drafting amendments, would have been needed.The Government has decided it would be simpler to introduce a new Bill rather than amend the Bill introduced in the House of Representatives in March. Accordingly, this Bill has been introduced in the Senate.This Bill will replace the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901. That Act was one of the earliest enactments of this Parliament, in fact, Act No.11 of 1901, showing the importance accorded to provision for interstate service and execution of process on the creation of the Commonwealth.The Bill largely implements recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its report on Service and Execution of Process.The Act now provides for—interstate service of court and other process;interstate service and enforcement of subpoenas;bringing prisoners interstate to give evidence;interstate enforcement of civil judgments of courts;interstate arrest and return of persons to face criminal charges; andinterstate enforcement of lower court fines.The reference to the Law Reform Commission which led to its report was given by the Hon. Neil Brown QC on behalf of the Attorney-General in 1982. The reference resulted both from concern that the Act was in need of reform, and from suggestions from several State Attorneys-General that the Act should be extended to the process and decisions of tribunals.The State Attorneys were concerned that process issued by tribunals, such as a consumer claims tribunal, effectively stopped at State borders.In its report the Law Reform Commission found that, while the Act had remained largely unchanged, changes in Australian society since 1901 have been dramatic. Business outlook is increasingly national and, for many purposes, State and Territory boundaries have become artificial and even meaningless.Reflecting these findings, the Commission recommended a major updating of the procedures in the Act, and their extension to the process and decisions of tribunals.The Act is, of course, concerned with the effective operation of State and Territory process and so of State and Territory bodies—the courts, police and correctional authorities.Accordingly, the Government has carried out an extensive and detailed program of consultation with the States and Territories about the Law Reform Commissions recommendations, and about proposals to improve on those recommendations.The Government has been particularly concerned to focus on the practical application of its recommendations for State and Territory courts and agencies.With respect to civil proceedings in courts, the Bill greatly simplifies procedures for the interstate service of process and enforcement of judgments. In particular—The Bill sets out an exclusive method for interstate service of process. At present a plaintiff can use procedures under the Service and Execution of Process Act, or under State laws. This can cause problems especially where a plaintiff attempts to use part of the procedures under the Act and part of the State procedures in the one proceeding.The Bill adopts the Corporations Law rules for service on companies, and the same rules for service interstate on natural persons as apply for service intrastate of similar process on natural persons.Safeguards are set out relating to minimum time limits for interstate service of initiating process and subpoenas, and to the payment of expenses for interstate witnesses. Provision is made for notices to be attached to subpoenas setting out the rights and obligations of the person served.No endorsement will be needed on process commencing a proceeding against a person in another State. Solicitors will be able to use the one document for service anywhere in Australia, supplemented by an information notice as prescribed when service is interstate.Also abolished by the Bill is the need for a particular connection between the cause of action and the State in which proceedings are commenced. Instead, the Bill provides for a stay of proceedings in an inferior court where there is a more appropriate forum to determine the matters in dispute between the parties. Combined with the cross-vesting legislation which provides, amongst other things, for transfer of proceedings between Supreme Courts, this will enable cases to be determined in the most convenient forum.The Bill abolishes the requirement to obtain leave to serve a subpoena interstate. It also provides improved procedures for the making and determination of applications for relief from interstate subpoenas.Under the Bill judgments can be enforced interstate by a simple registration procedure in the appropriate interstate court. The judgment will be registered on lodgment of a sealed copy of the judgment, or of a fax of a sealed copy.One area where the Bill diverges significantly from the Law Reform Commissions recommendations is the interstate service of subpoenas on persons who are under some kind of restraint which affects their ability to comply with the subpoena.Examples include persons on bail subject to reporting requirements, on parole, home detention, periodic detention or various forms of alternative sentencing options.A person subject to a restraint which might be breached if he or she complied with an interstate subpoena will be required where State law permits, in the first instance, to apply under State law for `consent to comply with the subpoena (for example, where a witness is on bail, by applying to a court to vary his or her bail conditions). If no `consent is given a warrant can be issued and a magistrate will decide whether the person should go interstate on bail or in custody.The Bill also provides for interstate service and execution of process of State and Territory tribunals.Honourable Senators will recall that the Law Reform Commissions recommendation for procedures to enable the interstate service of subpoenas issued by investigative tribunals was implemented last year by the Service and Execution of Process Amendment Act 1991.Under the Bill initiating process issued by a tribunal performing an adjudicative function of the kind specified in the Bill can be served interstate.This includes a tribunal performing a disciplinary function, for example, a tribunal determining whether a person is a fit and proper person to carry on a particular profession.Judgments of tribunals performing an adjudicative function will be enforceable interstate by registration in a court in the same manner as judgments of a court.It will be possible for subpoenas issued by tribunals to be served interstate where leave is obtained from a court, judge or magistrate. Differing requirements apply about who may give leave depending upon the function being exercised by the tribunal and its jurisdiction.The Bill will streamline procedures for the return of persons interstate to give evidence or to face criminal charges.The requirement for interstate warrants to be endorsed by a judicial officer of the State of apprehension is abolished. The Bill also enables action to be taken on a copy of a warrant (including a fax copy). This removes the need for the issue of a provisional warrant while the original warrant is being sent interstate.The Bill substantially reproduces Part IVA of the Act which provides for the interstate enforcement of lower court fines. Part IVA was inserted in 1963, has been subsequently amended, and was excluded from the reference to the Law Reform Commission. Minor changes have been made to ensure consistency with the rest of the Bill.The Bill is expected to have no impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue.I table the explanatory memorandum for the Bill.I commend the Bill to the Senate.SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF PROCESS (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1992This Bill is consequential upon the Service and Execution of Process Bill 1992. It provides for—the repeal of the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901;continued application of some provisions of that Act where action has been taken under that Act before the date of the repeal;amendment of some Acts in consequence of the repeal of the Service and Execution of Process Act.The Bill is expected to have no impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue.I table the explanatory memorandum for the Bill.I commend the Bill to the Senate.Debate (on motion by Senator Knowles )—adjourned.","N/A","SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF PROCESS BILL 1992 SERVICE AND EXECUTION OF PROCESS (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1992","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

109,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CROWLEY","ZF4","(South Australia)","ALP","N/A",697,"—Indeed he was a great bloke. I thank Minister Bolkus. I thought he and I would have had our butcher in common. Lou Cimarosti was born in 1928 in Gilbert Street in inner city Adelaide of parents who had migrated from Italy. I have not really discovered what it was that led to a significant migration of Italian people at that time to Adelaide. Lou grew up there, went to a nearby primary school and became apprenticed to the butcher in that very same street. Subsequently he became the owner of that butcher shop. I got to know him when my children were going to a nearby kindergarten and child-care centre. It was this butcher shop that provided the meat for the child-care centre. It was quality meat and quality customer service and I have stayed there ever since.The butcher shop is one of those that has sawdust on the floor and a chopping block. You can have your meat taken off the bone while you are there. One tiny story illustrates best what sort of people Lou Cimarosti and his family were. One day I was in the butcher shop with a number of other people when in rushed somebody to say, `Quick, quick. Old Mrs X down the road has been found unconscious in her garden. The butcher took off his apron and so did his assistant, and off they went to help attend to this lady. `Please wait, he said, `but if not, come back later. It took about 10 minutes but in some small way the idea of downing tools to go and help somebody in the community who had been caught in very distressing circumstances illustrates exactly the sort of person Lou Cimarosti was.He was highly involved in community work. He had a way of making people feel welcome in his shop. He and his family were very much committed to the idea of participating in the community, but in a nice, old-fashioned way. You did it because it was mannerly, you did it because it was polite and civil to do. As a result, he had very extensive custom. A lot of people wanted to go there. We enjoyed meeting and catching up with each other there. I take the opportunity to acknowledge those very best old-fashioned qualities that sometimes get overlooked or ignored in our galloping society. I extend my sympathy again to the family of Lou Cimarosti and acknowledge his great contribution in a modest and humble way to the city of Adelaide.My first story was about death; the second is of life. One of the pleasures I have had is occasionally being driven by a Commonwealth driver in South Australia, Mr OGrady. That is not to distinguish him from any other Commonwealth driver, all of whom look after me splendidly. What distinguishes Mr OGrady is that he is the father of an Olympian silver medallist. From time to timehis son rode in the team cycling pursuit. I am happy to acknowledge that, but one of the things we overlook when we are talking about medallists and representatives of Australia at the Olympic Games is the sorts of families that have backed them, the whole range of family backgrounds, but in particular the contribution of parents to the achievements of their children, whatever age those children are.I also want to acknowledge the contribution of wives, husbands, sons and daughters—indeed, a lot of relatives—to the coaching, training and committed effort of athletes. I would like to suggest that it is worth our thinking from time to team about the families behind the medallists and, in particular, to know that they are as varied and as generous as, for example, is illustrated by a Commonwealth driver colleague, Mr OGrady in South Australia. I simply wanted to acknowledge that in the Senate here today.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

122,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Collins","OF4","QLD","ALP","N/A",699,"—The answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) Installation of a television translator facility at Razorback Lookout (Pigabeen), designed to serve areas to the south of Tweed Heads with five television services (three commercials, ABC-TV, and SBS-TV) was initiated, but the facility has never been commissioned.(2) It is now unlikely that such a translator facility will be commissioned, for the following reasons.In the early 1980s it was thought that, owing to the nature of the terrain in the Gold Coast/Tweed Heads district, low-power `in-fill translator facilities would be required at Mt Tamborine, Farrell Lookout (Currumbin), and Razorback Lookout, in order to provide adequate reception of the Brisbane commercial television services throughout the district.At that time, the Tweed Heads area lay in both the service area of the Brisbane commercial television stations (BTQ, QTQ, and TVQ), and the service area of RTN Richmond/Tweed. These four commercial services began transmitting from a translator on Mt Tamborine in 1983, and were joined by ABC-TV and SBS-TV in 1985. All of these commercial and national services began transmitting from Farrell Lookout in 1988.The translator at Razorback Lookout was to be commissioned later, to serve any areas around Tweed Heads which were not being served by the Mt Tamborine and Farrell Lookout facilities, or by the various parent stations.As a consequence of the decision to include the Tweed Heads area in the Television Equalisation program, so that it would be served by NBN (Nine Network) and NEN (Seven Network), as well as NRN (Ten Network), this region was excluded from the Brisbane licensees service areas. Thus the Brisbane stations were no longer eligible to transmit from Razorback Lookout.Many viewers in the Tweed Heads area have invested in mast-head amplifiers and high-gain antennas in order to receive the Brisbane stations signals from Mt Coot-tha (the parent stations) or from Mt Tamborine. When test transmissions were made from Razorback Lookout in October 1990, the relatively strong `local signals seriously disrupted the viewers long distance reception of the Brisbane stations, and no further transmissions have since been made from Razorback Lookout.A signal strength survey of the Tweed Heads area was conducted in May 1992, following establishment of the Prime (UHF 44) and NBN (UHF 47) transmission facilities on Mt Nardi. Over ninety per cent of the area surveyed receives good signals from that site, but there is a small part of Tweed Heads which does not receive an adequate signal.This small pocket includes up to 100 households on the seaward side of Mt Razorback, where residents experience difficulty in getting adequate signals from Mt Nardi or from Mt Tamborine.Viewers in this area may be able to improve their reception of the commercial television services by aiming their antennas towards Mt Nardi, but the only full solution may be for the 100 or so households to install their own cable system. Officers from my Department would be happy to provide advice to the affected residents, if they decide to pursue this course of action.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[3]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
