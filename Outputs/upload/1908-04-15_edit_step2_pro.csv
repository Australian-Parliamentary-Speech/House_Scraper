It is only from motives of our own, and in accordance with our own policy, that we feel obliged to treat it as hostile. But that is of our own choice. There is nothing in the motion itself which necessarily conveys a reflection on this Government. The Government do not recognise that the condition of the Postal Department which calls for special treatment or- for inquiry has been brought about by any legislative or administrative action of their own or of this Parliament. But those questions will be dealt with in their proper place. Consequently, although there has been no change in the attitude of the Government in that regard, I see no constitutional obstacle to the House proceeding with business.

If five or six members of the Labour Party at any time asserted their independent convictions on a matter of considerable importance on which they felt strongly they would certainly cause a crisis. The position of the Government is. such that a crisis would occur at any time that five or six honorable members of the Labour Party differed from them on an important matter such as is that relating to the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into the administration of a Department of the Public Service. The Opposition are not to blame. I do not think they are ashamed of the vote they gave. I do not think that we have reached a position in which any honorable member is a bit ashamed of the vote he gave. The crisis has been caused by six or seven members of the Labour Party exercising their honest convictions on an important matter without regard to the interests of the Government. We are not responsible for that. It is rather too bad to expect us to go to the assistance of the Government, although it would be very convenient for them if we always did so. They have had our votes more than once to save them when the Labour Party have been against them, and they expect us when six or seven honorable members of that party break away, to rush to their assistance and patch up their position. I do not think an Opposition can fairly be expected to perform that service for the Government unless there is involved a matter of principle on which they are in agreement with the Ministry. Unfortunately on the occasion under review we were absolutely opposed to the Government. We felt that a Royal Commission should be appointed, and the only course open to us was to vote for the honorable member for Gwydirs proposition. I can only say that if the honorable member for Gwydir accepts the compromise proposed by. the Prime Minister I accept it with him. I raise no point upon it, feeling sure that he will carry his proposal to a straight out issue when the proper time comes. As to the Tariff, could any one have a greater interest in getting it out of the way than the Opposition have?

I think it right to make this explanation as to what actually took place on Thursday last. We did not object to the Prime Ministers amendment we took no exception to it. What we did want to provide, however, was that the matter should not be postponed for three weeks, and we endeavoured to secure that the Federal Capital question should not also be shelved. These two desires were in no way inconsistent. The Prime Minister, of all others, was the honorable member who, after declaring that the Capital. Site question should be decided at an early date, did his best to postpone it for at least three weeks. On him, therefore, is the responsibility for any delay that has taken place in regard to the settlement of that question. I do not mind, telling the Prime Minister something else about the Federal Capital question, if it will do him any good.

My answer to all the jibes of the Prime Minister is that we do not object to the postponement of the Federal Capital question for one or two days. This has been a mock political crisis - a sham affair - all through. It has been pathetic to read in the newspapers of the desire of the Prime Minister to resign office, and of his, only at the last moment, consenting to remain in office. These reports may or may not be correct ; the Prime Minister has not said one. word on the matter. But we have seen the Prime Minister in this kind of mood before. His attitude to-day is, I do not wish to remain a minute in office, but for heavens sake do what you can to keep me here !  That is the explanation of what has gone on during the last week-end. Where is the Government Whip? That gentleman never had such a busy time in his life as he has had in squaring matters outside; and -the result of it all is that the Prime Minister has consented to retain office, in order to put the Tariff through. There may be some danger to the Tariff in consequence of a possible change in the Ministry, but, personally, I confess I do not see what that danger is, having regard to the position of the Tariff in this House. The Government, however, seem to scent some danger, and even the scenting of danger was a sufficient appeal to the Prime Minister to take the steps he has taken during the last week-end to ultimately persuade my honorable friends in the corner to take the action they propose to-day. I should like to know where we now stand. We are told that the motion of the honorable member for Gwydir is to be postponed until the Tariff is out of the way. But what is meant by the  Tariff  ? Do the Government mean by the  Tariff  the schedule of requests that is now before the House? Are my friends of the Labour Party going to assist the Government to put this Tariff on the statute-book at the earliest possible moment, and then trust to luck as to the complemental part of the  new protection  in which they- are so interested? Does dealing with the Tariff mean dealing also with the new protection, or are the members of the Labour Party going to deliberately assist the Government to pass the Tariff at the earliest possible moment, and then, it may be, aid in putting the Government out of office before the new protection proposals are dealt with? If that be so, I can only congratulate them on their attitude.","N/A","SUPPLY(Formal).","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[6]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That is a question on which I should expect to hear something from .my honorable friends in the Labour corner. I dare say they have made up their minds, and I only throw this hint out, because I shall be glad to hear what the complete proposals of the Government amount to. As I said before, this  crisis  has, in my judgment, been a sham from beginning to end. The threatened resignation was a sham - there never was a resignation, threatened or intended. This is simply a repetition of tactics on the »part of the Prime Minister with which we are by this time well acquainted, and they, . therefore, cause us no surprise.

In that event there will be no Opposition in the present sense, when the  outs  are always trying to displace the  ins.

238,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MALONEY, William","KLM","N/A","N/A","N/A",10475,"- The honorable members opinion of that corner nearly coincides with my own, and I do not think they would welcome it. The right honorable member for East Sydney did not mention the fact that New South Wales, by its population, can claim twenty-seven votes in this House as against Victorias twenty-two. The difference is five votes and the direct Opposition  has exactly five votes more than the straight-out Ministerial party. There is nothing for the right honorable member to boast of in that. The honorable member for Parramatta will admit -that in the direct Opposition there are members who are more in unison with the Labour Party than with the Opposition Corner Party. Out of the twenty-seven New South Wales members, there are only about twelve behind the leader of the Opposition, while he has not even one Victorian supporter. I hope the proposal of the Prime Minister will be agreed to as quickly as possible. By no act of mine in this House would I willingly have thrown the Tariff into the turmoil of a political crisis. I know that in one firm alone, over 200 more employes have been taken on, while 800 have had their salaries increased. That was due to the difference of 3d. agreed to by this House in the Excise duty on hand-made and machine-made cigarettes. If we went back to the conditions of the old Tariff, which was most incomplete, 200 employes at least would lose their places, and the other 800 would have their wages reduced. For that reason alone, I would take no step to prevent the Tariff from finally passing. I am, after eighteen years experience in Parliament, against Royal Commissions. If the House wants to remove the abominations that may exist not only in the Post and Telegraph Department, but in other branches of the Public Service, let us be honest, pass an eight-hours Bill, provide that every, hour of overtime shall be paid for, and compel officers to send in their claims every week. If that were done, there would be no need for a Royal Commission. Later on, when that question comes before the House, I shall put my arguments forward. I will content myself now with saying that I hope the day will come when there will be no Opposition to be led by the honorable member for Parramatta, and when, no honorable member will consider it his duty to strike at the Government at every opportunity, no matter what happens. That is not democratic, or in accordance with Australian sentiment, and the sooner it is ended, the better.","N/A","SUPPLY(Formal).","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[7]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Later, when 1 discovered that fact, I saw that, ifI allowed the formal motion for going into Committee of Supply, under which grievances are debated, to be proposed in the ordinary way, I should be challenged with having broken the compact with the Opposition. It had been telegraphed all over the Commonwealth that members would be invited on Thursday to vote on the Federal Site question, and no other, and I felt sure that, when it was found that they were being asked to deal with any or every grievance, I should be charged with having deliberately brought about the postponement of the Federal Capital Site question. My mistake was, that directly I found out that Thursday was grievance day., I did not point out the position to the House, and give notice of my intention to move to postpone the consideration of the Order of the Day for going into Committee of Supply. My action in moving the postponement of all grievances was impelled by the necessity for1 fulfilling our pledge; because I thought that my inaction would be distorted into an attempt to defeat the wishes of those to whom I had promised that we should deal with the Capital Site question. Those remarks dispose of the statements of the deputy leader of the Opposition, who has since said himself that there was strong reason for not dealing with the Capital Site question on Thursday, and that he had a motive for not wishing that the question should come on on the day fixed.","N/A","SUPPLY(Formal).","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[10]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There was no reference made at that time, and certainly I have not the least recollection of the honorable member referring to its being set down for, or coming up, on any particular day. In fact, at that time, I believe it was on the notice paper,and could not be brought forward on grievance day. The honorable member also told me, if my memory serves me aright, that he thought that a majority of his party were in favour of the appointment of a Royal Commission. He may have meant a majority of the House, but, if so, he did not convey his meaning to me. I took him to mean that a majority of his party were in favour of the proposal.

Anything I could say to persuade honorable members to push on with the question of establishing a Federal system I would gladly say. In Victoria, married sons, with families dependent upon them, are being sent to prison simply because they have not complied with an order made by a Court to contribute so much towards an old-age pension. The sooner that this question is taken up by this Parliament, the sooner will that regrettable state of things be removed. Sir George Turner,- to his honour, instructed that no one should be sent to prison on account of his poverty, but I am sorry to say that it is now being done in Victoria under cover of a failure by a son to contribute to the provision of an old-age pension for his parents.","Old-Age Pensions","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
