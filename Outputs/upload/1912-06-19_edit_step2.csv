I feel the honour all the more, inasmuch as it seconds that bestowed on me by the electors of Australia, who have transferred me from a humble position in life to that of a legislator for the Australian Commonwealth. I feel the honour the more, because of the fact that I represent here a vote totalling eight more than that which was accorded my predecessor at the election in 1910. The honour is appreciated by me the more highly, in view of the fact that at the election of 1910 the Werriwa poll represented 75.06 per cent, of the electorate, thus establishing a record for the whole of New South Wales. Not only did the vote cast for me exceed that given to my predecessor, but at the recent election the votes cast throughout the constituency represented 76 per cent, of those enrolled. I take that, not only as indicative of the great interest taken in the contest, but as giving ground for a fair claim that the vote demonstrates to the country that Werriwa spoke as strongly as it could speak in favour of me as the Labour candidate, and in favour of the policy of the Ministry of the day. As to the Speech delivered by His Excellency the Governor-General, I take it generally that honorable members on all sides of the House agree that it is one fully worthy of the occasion, meriting the earnest attention of a deliberative assembly of this character. It is a Speech far-reaching, all-embracing, and all -important; and no matter how opinions may differ as to the various proposals to be placed before us, our feelings, I think, will be in unison in the respect to which I have referred, namely, that it is a Speech which may fairly claim the attention of the Australian Legislature. I should like now to touch briefly on the first portion of His Excellencys remarks. There is no room for difference of opinion regarding his reference to the bountiful rains which have recently fallen throughout the length and breadth of Australia.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A fortnight ago we were apprehensive of the future, and desired anxiously the breaking of a drought which threatened to destroy the prosperity that we were enjoying. Much as human minds and human hands may do, they are helpless without the assistance of a greater power. Our laws may help or mar the progress of the country, but they must be ineffective for good without the blessing of seasonable rains. The Governor-General points out that the general prosperity of Australia is indicated by the great increase in the revenue of the Commonwealth from Customs and Excise, land taxation, and postal and telegraph services. Whatever may be our political opinions, we must be glad of a prosperity that not merely benefits individuals and the Governments of the States, but also affords resources wherewith the great works for which this Parliament must be responsible may be carried out. I am informed that, for the nine months ending 31st March last, the total revenue of the Commonwealth was £14,298,981, as against £12,992,215 for the corresponding period of the last financial year, an increase of £1,306,766. On these figures we may fairly assume that the actual revenue of the current financial year will exceed the estimate given by the Treasurer in making his last Budget speech. I take it that Parliament having determined that there shall be a. Commonwealth bank, all honorable members desire that the institution may be a success, and may realize the ideals and anticipations of those who proposed its establishment. All must be glad that the Government has obtained the services of a gentleman held in the highest esteem by financial authorities. There was comment upon the delay in appointing the Governor of the Bank, but it was far better that there should be delay than that any but the best possible man available should be obtained for such an important position. Honorable members must hail with delight the announcement in the Speech that the Australian Notes Act is working satisfactorily. The value of the notes in circulation at the end of last month was £9,512,151, and there was held in the Treasury sovereigns to the value of £4,305,215. Although the Act requires the Treasurer to keep a gold reserve of only 25 per cent., that reserve is now between 40 and 50 per cent, of the value of the note issue. In some quarters the alarm has been raised that the banks may, by an understanding between themselves, collect as many notes as they can get, and then make a demand simultaneously for their payment.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

I come now to that unique proposal, the provision of maternity grants. In making it, the Ministry set an example to the world, and the principles on which it is based will receive general indorsement, irrespective of political opinion. We know what a boon and blessing the grants will be in that time of stress and trial in which children are born, and the humanitarian spirit which prompted the Government to provide relief when it is most needed must be universally applauded. These grants may be termed grants for the encouragement of immigration, because they encourage the increase of those immigrants who are the best we can have - the babies of the people of the country. The grants will be available to rich and poor alike, without distinction of class or creed. They will thus be in no way charitable doles, but the right of every mother, whatever her social position. The need for some measure of this kind is indicated by the fact that last year Australia lost 9,000 infants under the age of twelve months, many of whom died from preventible causes. If 50 per cent, of the lives that would otherwise be lost can be saved by this humanitarian legislation, it will do well indeed. The proposal is a completing link in a chain of legislation forged by Australia, in regard to which she leads the world, based as it is on the principle that the States duty is from the cradle to the grave to look after those citizens who cannot look after themselves. The announcement that the Government intend to resubmit during the present session proposals for the regulation of trusts, combines, and monopolies will naturally excite great controversy. As one fresh from the field of battle, I hail this determination with satisfaction. During my electoral campaign I lost no opportunity to place before the people my views -on the referenda, and assured the electors that I was in accord with the action of the Government in submitting the referenda for their approval.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

My return is an indication that the electors of Werriwa will support the referenda proposals when they are next asked to vote upon them. When, a year ago, the Werriwa vote was antagonistic to the referenda proposals, it was claimed by our opponents to be an indication that Werriwa rejected the referenda, and did not wish to be represented by a Labour candidate. Now by their vote the electors have shown that they indorse the policy of the Labour Ministry of the day by sending a representative to support it, and that they are prepared to accept the referenda. What has occurred in the Werriwa electorate will occur throughout Australia. When the referenda vote was taken the public was apathetic, and did not fully realize the importance of the issues placed before it. In view of the small proportion of those voting, and the general apathy of the community at the time, the Government are justified in again submitting the issue, and there is evidence that the people are prepared to reconsider the matter. Recent occurrences show that it is absolutely necessary that the powers of the Parliament shall be widened to effectively deal with monopolies and combines. We are told in the Speech that, although the decisions in the proceedings taken against the shipping and coal combines were in favour of the Government, finality has not been reached, because an appeal to the High Court has been lodged. Under the present law, convictions cannot be secured without endless litigation and enormous expense. The Government are justified, therefore, in asking the country to give Parliament the powers which were asked for some twelve months ago, in order that the processes for dealing with trusts and combines acting in restraint of trade and to the detriment of the public welfare may be simplified. Another question to which I desire to make reference, because it is always an all-important one, is that of defence. The speeches we have heard of late at all events indicate that there is no difference of opinion on any side of the House as to the policy that is now being pursued by the Ministry of the day. All appear to recognise that, in establishing a system of universal training, and providing for an Australian Navy, we have taken a right course of action. In the working of such an all-embracing law as that relating to defence, weaknesses and omissions that need to be remedied are sure to be discovered, and His Excellency the Governor-Generals Speech indicates that it is the intention of the Ministry to give Parliament an opportunity to consider an amending Bill to remove the defects which the operation of the Defence Act has laid bare. We shall all hail with delight, in connexion with this question of defence, the amicable arrangement that has been made with New South Wales for the surrender of certain territory at Jervis Bay, under conditions which will give the Commonwealth absolute control, and make it the supreme master of the area in question. It is most satisfactory to know that such an agreement has been made, and that its conditions absolutely secure the position of the Commonwealth, which, in all such matters, ought to be the dominant power. His Excellency, in the course of his Speech, made reference also to the Northern Territory. I am sure we were all pleased with the statement that the Government have appointed an Administrator, a Judge, and the head of a Government Department for the Northern Territory. We must welcome also the announcement that provision is being made for the reception .of settlers there. We cannot reach that ideal which we hoped to attain when we took over the Territory from South Australia, unless extensive works are carried out to make it a proper habitat for the white races, and it is therefore gratifying to know that, during the recess, the- Government have been carrying out works  that will lead to the proper development of that important part of the territory of the Commonwealth. Honorable members, I am sure, will applaud the stand taken up by the Ministry in determining that there shall be no admission of indented black labour into the Northern Territory. The suggestion has been made in certain quarters that the Government should weaken in its White Australian policy to the extent of admitting indented coloured labour into the Territory ; but that suggestion is not likely to be received with favour by the present Ministry. I am sure that the House generally will, by its indorsement of this action, show that it is determined to maintain, at least so far as the Northern Territory is concerned, the principle of a White Australia: I shall not detain the House any further by dealing with other matters to which reference is made in His Excellencys Speech, but before resuming my seat I desire to thank honorable members generally for the cordial reception they have given me, and the kindly feeling they have manifested towards me on the occasion of this, my first speech in the House. I recognised that, as a young member, I had to place myself in the hands of Honorable members, and particularly of honorable members of the Opposition, and I desire to thank them most sincerely for having enabled me to make my initial speech in this House under conditions of the most favorable character.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[2]/continue[3]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

Apart from the satisfactory result of the election itself, the victory secured by the Labour party conveys another lesson which is of special importance at the present juncture. It had been said for the previous twelve months that the rejection of the referenda proposals by a majority of over 4,000 votes in the electorate of Werriwa did not augur very well for the success of the Labour candidate at the next election, but the contest just brought to a successful issue there bears out in every way the opinion that has always been expressed by honorable members on this side of the House, that the result of the referenda vote could not be taken as an index of the opinions of the people of Australia. Coming to His Excellency the Governor-Generals Speech, I wish to congratulate the Government on the very suitable appointment they have made to the governorship of the Commonwealth Bank. I think we shall all admit that in Mr. Miller we have, as Governor, the right man in the right place, and I believe I can say also that the appointment is a very fitting conclusion to the series of arrangements in connexion with the establishment of the bank. The establishment of the Commonwealth Bank alone would have justified the existence of the Labour Government. Everywhere I have gone, and I claim to represent one of the most important farming constituencies in Victoria, I have heard the most widespread approval of the action of the Ministry m establishing this bank. I have never yet met a man on the land who was prepared to say that he had anything for which to thank a private banking institution. The experience of most people, and especially those who have settled on the land, is that the private banking institutions generally get hold of their deeds, and treat them very well in prosperous times, but that when a bad season comes their way, the banks not only drive them into a corner, but bayonet them when they get them there.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The private banks of Australia hold to-day£55,000,000 of the peoples money in the form of current accounts, on which they pay no interest, but for keeping which accounts they actually make a charge. The banks have been carrying on their business upon credit, or, in other words, upon public confidence ; and, taking all these facts into consideration, we must recognise that it is about time that the people had an opportunity, seeing that they supply, not only the business, but the stock-in-trade, to establish their own bank, and to do* their own banking business. It is also satisfactory to learn from His- Excellencys Speech that the Australian Note Issue has been such a pronounced success. I do not think that there are many honorable members, even of the Opposition, who will dispute the fact that the Australian Note Issue Act has been a decided success. It is consoling to find that honorable members opposite now practically agree that the issue is calculated to be a success.Mr.W.

I do not think any doubt exists in the mind of any one except certain irresponsible organizers outside as to the safety of the note issue. In His Excellencys Speech, reference is made to the marked effect which the Land Tax has had in increasing immigration and land settlement, and that statement is borne out by a paragraph in the Land Tax Commissioners report, in which he estimates that, since the institution of the Federal Land Tax, £22,000,000 worth of large estates have been made available for settlement purposes.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[3]/continue[5]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

Many men have been desirous, for years past, of going on the land, but have been forced out of the country during the last twenty-five years because of their inability to obtain the land they require. The present position affords a very interesting and favorable contrast to our experience in Australia before the passing, of the Federal Land Tax. I am particularly glad to know that the tax has done such good work in the direction of promoting immigration. The opponents of our party have, at all times, said, that we, as a party, are opposed to immigration. I think I can say, not only for myself, but for every member of the party with which I have the honour to be- associated, that we believe that in Australia there is room for twenty or thirty millions of people.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[3]/continue[6]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

Personally I would oppose in every way every attempt to bring immigrants here before land is made available for all our own people who are able and willing to go upon it. If we are going to have charity in regard to the lands of Australia, I contend that charity should begin at home, and that something should be done to settle our own people on. the land before bringing others here, perhaps to walk the streets of our cities and be left to fill the ranks of the unemployed.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[3]/continue[7]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

Until every mothers son in this country who is able and willing to go upon the land has his wants supplied, I believe it would be a right attitude for a Federal Government to take up to discourage others from coming here. I think much more effective work will be done, and a much better regulation will come into vogue, than that adopted by the State Governments, after the institution of the new scheme mentioned in the Governor-Generals Speech, to provide a maternity allowance for the mothers of children born in the Commonwealth. In this regard it is only necessary to call attention to the alarming statement that 9,000 of the children of the Commonwealth die every year under the age of twelve months to prove conclusively that the first year is a very critical time in a childs life. Statements that have been published in the press lately do not reflect a great deal of credit on those who have made them. They refer to the proposed action of the Government as a low-down, contemptible scheme. In this they show a callous indifference to the checking of the nations growth, evidenced by the fact that 9,000 children die each year in the Commonwealth under the age of twelve months.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[3]/continue[8]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

It was to be expected that reference would be made to the re-submission of the referenda proposals. Looking back over the work of the last two sessions, and looking to the work as outlined in the Governor- Generals Speech, it is abundantly clear that unless fresh powers are given to the National Parliament there will be very little left for it to do. In travelling over my electorate and other electorates, I find a general regret expressed by people that they did not have more time to consider on their merits the proposals that were submitted to them twelve months ago. The Attorney-General told the House on one occasion that he had proof that £100,000 was paid by the monopolies of Australia in order to defeat the referenda, and it was said in the press and elsewhere that there were no monopolies in Australia. Our opponents asserted that, as there were no monopolies in Australia, the powers asked for should not be given to the. Commonwealth Parliament.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[3]/continue[9]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member must have seen it published in the newspapers ; but I should like to ask how many of the people of Australia could safely be told to-morrow that there are no monopolies in this country. One monopoly in particular showed their appreciation of the rejection of the referenda and their thanks to the people for having saved them on that occasion by putting up the price of sugar by £3 .12s. 6d. a ton. In a very little while they got back in that way the amount that they put into the fund to defeat the referenda. We have instances every day, and I am sure that honorable members opposite have instances in their own electorates, of the effect of monopolies. In the fruit season, I find that the pigs are allowed into the orchards to eat the apples and other fruit. When I ask the fruit-growers why they do not send their fruit to the cities, where it should bring enormous prices, they tell me that if they do so they do not get enough to pay them for the boxes and the freight. A statement was published in the metropolitan press a little while ago to the effect that, in Melbourne, there is a selfish combine of middlemen standing between the fruit-grower and the consumer, and making, in the fruit season, profits as high as 450 per cent. In regard to the Shipping Combine, a few weeks ago a responsible Minister in the State Parliament, whose candour we must admire, told the producers in the country that the space on the boats had been taken for the last twelve months, and would, for the next two years, be farmed out to the producers who wish to send their products abroad. That statement should have considerable weight with the producers when the referendum proposals are again submitted to them. It has been the practice of honorable members opposite, when they have introduced a proposal and have found it unpopular, to shelve or pigeon-hole it j but I am pleased to belong to a party who, believing that these proposals are the right ones, will have the courage to attach their names to them in twelve months time, and be prepared to sink or swim with them in the interests of the National well-being. I also congratulate the Ministry on their proposals for the development of the Northern Territory. That is a question about which honorable members on the opposite side of the House have been talking, to my knowledge, for ten or twelve years, and it is pleasing to know that, although nothing was done all that time by them, something has been done now by the present Government, who have been in power for only a brief two years, towards settling that great country. The Northern Territory is the back door of Australia, and, while it was left open, as it was in the past, it was a menace to the effective defence of these shores. I should like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Government, and particularly the Minister of Defence, on the success of his schemes to provide an effective system of defence. I think it will be admitted by both sides of the House, and I believe it is freely admitted by men of every frame of political thought, that the defence scheme of the Government meets the requirements of this country in every way.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[3]/continue[10]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

It is satisfactory to note that the reorganization of our land forces, under our system of compulsory military training, appears to have the entire approval of the great majority of the people of Australia. I find wherever I go that at least 95 per cent, of the people approve of the compulsory military training, which to-day is doing so much to discipline the young fellows of the country, keeping them off the streets, providing and insuring for them a better manhood than otherwise would be the case.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[3]/continue[11]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

We are told by organizations outside, in which honorable members opposite are interested, that the present Government must be got rid of; but it would be very interesting to have a comparison of the work and the policy of the Government during the last two sessions with the policy of honorable members opposite - that policy which a few nights ago was referred to by the honorable member for Flinders in words to this effect-All the bones had been carefully removed, and nothing left but a kind of gelatinous compound, political food for infants and invalids, warranted not to cause the slightest inconvenience to the weakest digestion. . . . Unless they arrived at some clear and definite programme, he did not know whether it would not be just as well for Australia if the Labour party were to be victorious at the next elections.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[3]/continue[16]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member for Flinders went on to say -Unless they could arrive at something the people could grasp and understand as a definite, clear, and progressive policy, and not a vague tissue of generalities, it might in the long run be best for Australia if the Labour party had another three years tenure of office.I should like to compare the work of the last two sessions and the work outlined in the Governor-Generals Speech, with the predictions made by honorable members opposite and their friends two years ago, before the present Government came into power. In my electorate the people were told - and this is typical of what was told the people all over Australia - that if a Labour Government came into power the farmers would, amongst other things, find their lands nationalized, export duties placed on wheat and other primary products ; and, last, but not least, as insisted upon at ladies afternoon tea meetings, that the marriage tie would be torn asunder. Had any of these predictions been fulfilled, I should not find myself here to-day seconding . the adoption of an Address-in-Reply ; I should be ashamed to associate myself with a party that could be guilty of such legislation. Seeing, however, that none of these forecasts have been realized, we on this side have a right to expect that those who have maligned the Labour party in so shameful a fashion will be prepared to apologize for their slanders. The opponents of the Labour party in my electorate spend three-fourths of their time in abusing the present Government. They appear to forget altogether about their own policy, but that is not surprising, seeing that really they have no policy of their own. A typical scarecrow which is held up in farming communities throughout Australia is the threat that, if the present Government is not got rid of, farmers will be called upon to pay 12s. a day-- indeed, some predictions go as high as £1 a day - to their farm hands for six and eight hours work. When it is pointed out - and this is a fact which cannot be denied - that if wages are raised in the farming or any other industry, it must be as the result of a decision of a Judge sitting as a Court or Board, altogether outside the power of Parliament, our opponents have no answer ; they are left absolutely without any effective ammunition, and their chief bogy vanishes. W.e on this side invite the fullest criticism of our policy; all we ask isthat we may be fought on fair lines and judged on our policy alone, and not on matters over which we have no control. During the last two years the present Government have been spending over£150,000 more than the previous Government in providing telephonic, telegraphic, and mail services in the backblocks and country constituencies generally; and in the course of the last three months I have challenged opponents to point to one thing the present Government have done to injure any man on the land or elsewhere. When the policy of the present Government is considered and criticised on fair lines, we must come to the conclusion that their record will stand as a monument to a party which has had the courage to redeem its pledges to the people, and has done well for every man, woman, and child in Australia.Debate (on motion by Mr. Deakin) adjourned.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH: ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[3]/continue[17]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"
