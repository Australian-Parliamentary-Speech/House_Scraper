3,0,0,0,1,1,"Jones, Stephen MP","A9B","Whitlam","ALP","N/A",669," I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and move:That this bill be now read a second time.The Public Sector Superannuation Salary Legislation Amendment Bill 2022 repeals paragraph 5(e) of the Superannuation (Salary) Regulations with effect from 1 July 1986 and provides that the effect of the repeal does not apply to individuals where limited circumstances are satisfied.The changes in the bill are only relevant to current and former Commonwealth public sector civilian employees.The default superannuation salary of a member of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme established under the Superannuation Act 1976 includes the value of any allowance that, under the regulations, is to be treated as salary under the act.Prior to 1 March 2022 paragraph 5(e) of the regulations provided that the rent-free use of housing made available to a person by reason that they held a particular office or performed particular duties or work was an allowance that was to be treated as salary for the purpose of the act.The value of rent-free housing as per paragraph 5(e) of the regulations flowed through to the default superannuation salary of members of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, and members of the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan and certain members of non-Commonwealth choice funds.At the time the regulations were made in 1978, an employees assessable income was taken to include the value of rent-free housing. With the introduction of the fringe benefits tax regime in 1986, the tax burden in relation to rent-free housing shifted from the employee to employer.Following this change in 1986 the Commonwealth has typically not treated rent-free housing as forming part of superannuation salary and generally neither employers nor employees have made superannuation contributions that have taken into account the value of rent-free housing.A recent case before the Federal Court has exposed differing views on the operation and scope of former paragraph 5(e) of the regulations. If the interpretation as argued by the applicants was accepted, it would have significant financial impacts for the Commonwealth and inequitable financial outcomes for differing cohorts of individuals.Some individuals would receive an unexpected windfall increase in their superannuation benefits while others could incur potentially large unexpected debts for unpaid member contributions with little or no corresponding increase in their superannuation benefit.These outcomes would be a consequence of the reliance by all relevant parties on a view that rent-free housing at the time it was provided did not form part of superannuation salary.Retrospectively repealing paragraph 5(e) of the regulations will regularise the past administrative practice of Commonwealth employers and employees by effectively restoring the position with respect to rent-free housing that all relevant parties have treated as governing the Commonwealth civilian public sector superannuation schemes since 1986.The repeal of paragraph 5(e) of the regulations will commence from 1 July 1986, the date of the introduction of the fringe benefits tax regime, and therefore regularise the change in practice that seemingly occurred after that time.As the purpose of the retrospective repeal of paragraph 5(e) of the regulations is to regularise the longstanding practice of employees and employers, the bill makes provision for cases, if any, in which paragraph 5(e) was applied historically in particular employer relationships in a way that included the value of rent-free housing in superannuation salary.The bill does this by excluding a limited cohort of individuals from the effect of the repeal of paragraph 5(e) of the regulations where no-one was acting pursuant to a mistake as shown from the actions of both Commonwealth employers and employees as evidenced by contributions having been made on the basis, in the period 1 July 1986 to 28 February 2022, that the value of the rent-free housing received by the employee was included in their superannuation salary.The exclusion end date of 28 February 2022 reflects that paragraph 5(e) of the regulations was repealed with prospective effect from 1 March 2022.I commend the bill to the House.","Public Sector Superannuation Salary Legislation Amendment Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JONES (Whitlam—Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services) ","(09:01):"

10,0,0,0,1,1,"Bandt, Adam Paul MP","M3C","Melbourne","AG","N/A",670," Thank you, Mr Speaker. Leave is not granted. If I can explain why and put our position on the record to be clear about the division we will be calling, it is unusual for a bill to come to the House for a second reading with people not having time to consider it, debate happening immediately and then it goes straight to a vote. This is a bill that has financial consequences, as the minister has outlined. It is a bill that was brought to the Senate in similar circumstances yesterday and rushed through in the morning. It is not clear that there is a compelling case for urgency or that this cant be dealt with in the normal course.I understand that, as a matter of process, it is probably the case that the government and the opposition are prepared to push this through quickly. But on bills that do have financial consequences, especially if something has been known for some time, especially where the context was carried over from the previous government, we should not be in the practice of forcing people in this House, especially when there is such a large number of crossbenchers here, to just take something at face value and push it through without the opportunity to have the usual debate. We are in a position where we dont know enough about this bill to be able to support it because the government is rushing it through.From what the minister has said, my understanding is that this is in part about how a court interprets an enterprise agreement and what counts as salary for the purposes of superannuation. It is often the case that employees will make trade-offs in doing that and will say, I accept a lower wage in return for a bigger package, and then superannuation is calculated on that whole package. If thats whats happening here, then it may be that the employees have a legitimate argument. On the other hand, it may be that theres a loophole that has been exposed, and, if we had more time to consider it, we might be in a position to agree. But given that it is being rushed through and theres been no basis put as to why it should be rushed through and, especially given that we know that this issue has been here for months and could have gone through the usual parliamentary processes, we cant support it being pushed through on the second reading. The usual practice should apply.I understand theres a lot that the House has got to get to today, so we wont speak any further on the second reading question. We tend not to divide on the question that will now be put by the government to ensure its passage through—weve made our point about it being rushed through—but we will oppose the second reading, in large part, on process grounds because we dont think that any of us should be put in a position of having to vote on a bill that has only been introduced today when no compelling case for urgency has been made. It sets a very, very bad precedent, especially given that there were weeks in which everyone in this parliament could have been given the content of the bill, told of its significance and able to consider it with their own teams, take advice and come to a genuine position. This is bad process. Its a bad way to start the parliament, and we cant support it.","Public Sector Superannuation Salary Legislation Amendment Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BANDT (Melbourne—Leader of the Australian Greens) ","(09:07):"

12,0,0,0,1,1,"Robert, Stuart Rowland MP","HWT","Fadden","LNP","N/A",670," I thank the government for introducing the Public Sector Superannuation Salary Legislation Amendment Bill 2022, and I thank the Leader of the Greens for his concerns, some of which are quite legitimate. It is a very rare thing for a parliament to consider making a retrospective law, dating back to the 1980s, on something that is currently before the courts. Its very, very rare. Ive been here for 15 years. This is only the second time Ive seen it done. The other time was when I did it as the Assistant Treasurer five years ago. So Im very cognisant of why assistant treasurers, who are responsible for super and tax, always get lumbered with the most contentious and difficult issues. Its why I appreciate the point the Leader of the Greens made because this is very, very unusual.One of the reasons assistant treasurers find themselves in these positions—and the last time also dealt with superannuation—is that when laws were written back in the 1980s and 1990s many things were assumed. In the case I dealt with, the assumption was that everyone knew what a lump sum was in super. And it was not defined until people took it before a court to seek it to be defined.We are facing a similar issue here, where, pre-FBT and in the absence of a definition—in this case, the condition of rent-free housing ostensibly for diplomats overseas, whilst not explicitly provided for, being a basis for salary for which super is on top of—public servants have sought to take it to court. That case—the Peace case, if you like—relates to potential windfall superannuation payments, as well as unexpected debts from unpaid member contributions, and is before the Federal Court. It has been taken there by three former diplomats who are claiming the value of their publicly funded rent-free housing should be included in their salary for superannuation purposes.That is the basis of this discussion. It will potentially have an impact on the budget of somewhere between $8 billion and $11 billion. It is a serious issue, and its why we should look at this seriously. Id like to say from the outset that the opposition will be supporting the government, noting the irregularity and the rarity of this coming up. This issue has been considered by the government soberly and sensibly, and we thank them for that. The previous coalition government was keeping an eye on this, as a very high-risk public administration issue, prior to the election. So this is not something that is being rushed by either the coalition or the opposition when it was previously in government. This has been thought through. The bill is consistent with the former governments approach to addressing issues like this and how theyre to be done.For the benefit of the House, this issue about rent-free housing was generally not provided prior to the introduction of FBT in 1986 as it would have attracted income tax. From 1986 onwards it became commonplace that the tax burden shifted to the employer and that rent-free arrangements, unless explicitly stated, did not count as a salary for superannuation purposes. That was the generally considered view. Those views should be held to stand regardless if they were not included in instruments at the time or otherwise.Since 1986 the Commonwealth has typically not treated rent-free housing as forming part of superannuation salary. Generally neither employers nor employees have made superannuation contributions that have taken into account the value of rent-free housing. That is how the system has run for 36 years.I appreciate now that there is a court case and were having to face a difficult issue whereby these issues werent defined, but it doesnt mean that the definition wasnt implied and well understood for almost a third of a century. The applicants in the case before the Federal Court—Brendan Peace & Ors v Commonwealth of Australia and Anor, the Peace case—are trying to demonstrate differing views on the operation and scope of paragraph 5(e) of the regs. They have argued for an interpretation which has not been consistent over the last third of a century. If accepted it would mean a large number of former and current Commonwealth employees, excluding the military, as the minister said, in their thousands would have the value of rent-free housing treated as salary for superannuation purposes.I appreciate courts dont look kindly when the federal parliament intervenes mid-case retrospectively. Whilst I appreciate the courts sentiments it is this places role to legislate, not the courts. It is the courts place to interpret legislation. If this place is not satisfied with what the other separated power, in that case the court, has done it is implied upon this place to seek to make it right. This is the basis of the discussion that we are having now. On that basis, noting its a difficult issue, noting it is a very rare thing to do and noting it is done sensibly and soberly as it should be, the opposition will be supporting the government.","Public Sector Superannuation Salary Legislation Amendment Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ROBERT (Fadden) ","(09:11):"

The question of urgency was raised by the Leader of the Greens.

No sane government could do otherwise than this parliament has done this morning. It would be intolerable.It wasnt my intention in the course of this debate to go through the scale of the moneys involved, but the member for Fadden, in his second reading debate address, has alluded to the fact that the cost, well known to those opposite because they were considering the same matter when they were in government a few months ago, is in the order of $11 billion. To the members of the Greens I will simply make this point: thats about what we spend on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and it would well and truly pay for the cost of any proposal to introduce dental care into the Medicare Benefits Scheme. These are not small amounts of money. No sane government could do anything other than what we are proposing to do today.I want to thank the member for Goldstein and the member for Mackellar.

Clause 3 of the Climate Change Bill sets out the objects of the bill. This clause, in its current form, has been included after discussions between the crossbench and the government and is a welcome addition to the bill.The bill in its current form sets out three objects of the bill: to set out targets, to promote accountability and to ensure that advice from the Climate Change Authority informs the settings of targets and annual climate statements.The proposed amendment adds another object:… to advance an effective and progressive response to the urgent threat of climate change drawing on the best available scientific knowledge …This amendment aims to broaden the legislation beyond the setting of a number to reflect that the parliaments intention is that this legislation be an effective, symbolic start to real climate action.This amendment clarifies the underlying climate goals of the bill, the urgency of action and a link to scientific knowledge. An acknowledgement of the objects clause of the urgency of action and a link to scientific knowledge should give business certainty that this is a new era in climate policy and that the Australian parliament has an intention to be guided by the science and to decarbonise our economy. The setting of a numerical target is the first step in this significant shift.A related amendment is also proposed to amend clause 3(b) so that it promotes accountability and ambition to reflect that this is the start of a significant journey ahead.Objects clauses serve a few purposes in legislation. Firstly, they provide a statement of the policy objective of the legislation that enables the parliament and the public to gauge the success of legislation in achieving its policy goals. This bill contains provision for periodic reviews of the operation of the act under clause 17. If the purpose is narrowly defined as the setting of a target and not to the underlying climate goal, reviews could be limited in scope accordingly. A review might say, Yes, the legislation was effective in setting a target, irrespective of whether or not those targets were met. It would be a reasonable community expectation that the review should examine the effectiveness of the legislation in driving climate change mitigation, rather than just the setting of a target.Secondly, objects clauses assist in statutory interpretation, especially for broadly worded provisions. Proposed sections 12, 14 and 17 contain broadly worded obligations. An objects clause that refers to the underlying climate objectives assists in ensuring that these obligations are interpreted consistently with those climate objectives and that that advice, those reports and those reviews have substance to them.This amendment is consistent with community expectations of the governments mandate to legislate a target, making it clear that the purpose is to drive real and urgent action on climate in line with the science.","Climate Change Bill 2022, Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr RYAN (Kooyong) ","(09:58):"

Accordingly, nothing in subsection (1) limits Australias ability to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions beyond 43% below 2005 levels by 2030.Ive moved this amendment because the science says that we should be hitting at least 50 per cent, preferably 60 per cent, by 2030 to help keep global temperatures below two degrees and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. I went to the election believing, based on modelling and evidence, that 60 per cent is a realistic target within that time frame, but I appreciate the consideration that the minister has given me and other members of the crossbench and this opportunity to move an amendment that I believe strengthens the language of this legislation.In the course of conversations with the minister about this bill, I advocated strongly for 43 per cent to be explicitly noted as a floor, not a ceiling, when it comes to carbon emissions. This plain language is necessary I believe to prevent ambition from being thwarted, to make sure that there are no unintended consequences of this law that limit our future capacity to be brave and innovative, and to lead on climate policy. Im pleased that the minister has indicated his readiness to accept this suggestion of the addition of a note on page 5 to make it clear that the legislation does not limit Australias ability to reduce its net greenhouse gas emissions beyond 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. This will have some legal force, but, as the Supreme Court of Victoria has stated:Although a note such as this forms part of the Act, it is subordinate to the substantive provisions, of which it is merely explanatory or illustrative.Nonetheless, the amendment that I am proposing makes it clearer that there is opportunity to go beyond the 43 per cent cut in carbon emissions supported by this government.I urge the minister to take a further look at the initial proposal when considering further legislation, but for now this is a substantial step forward. To those members of my community who wanted a more ambitious target, I say this: this bill provides a means for that ambition; without a guiding principle, it is difficult to progress. So, in my mind, this is very much a start, not a finish.I thank the minister and the government for the collaboration, and I look forward to being ambitious and brave together.

The member has provided speaking points to the amendments, which I will now read out:I am deeply disappointed that I have tested positive for COVID and will be unable to vote in favour of this Bill in the House.Because this is a Bill that is good for regional Australia, and which will drive the economic future of regional Australia.This Bill sets in law a commitment that the vast majority of Australians support—that we will decarbonize our economy by the middle of the century.And today, I seek four simple changes to make a good Bill an even better one, by inserting regional Australia at the heart of our climate policy framework.First, I propose to amend the Climate Change Authority to make sure that Australias climate policies boost economic, employment and social benefits for rural and regional Australia.In the Governments Bill, the Climate Change Authority is the body charged with advising on climate targets and climate policies.I believe that renewable energy and the new industries it will unlock could become the next goldrush for regional Australia—but only if we plan it right.Second, I am proposing to expand the list of eligible qualifications for appointments to the Climate Change Authority.These are the people who will be advising on Australias targets and tracking our progress to achieving those.We need regional voices at that table. And we need people who understand how to make renewable energy actually deliver for regional communities.Third, my amendment requires the Minister to outline the benefits that their policies are delivering to the regions.A key part of the Governments Bill is that the Climate Change Minister must, each year, deliver a statement to the Parliament on Australias progress in reaching our targets and the effectiveness of our climate policies.Under my amendment, that statement must specifically outline the social, employment, and economic benefits that those policies are delivering to the regions.This is an accountability mechanism.It means that no Government can get away with a climate policy that does not specifically address the unique circumstances of and opportunities for regional Australia.And finally, my amendment requires regions to be explicitly considered when setting new emissions targets.Under the Governments Bill, the Climate Change Authority must provide advice on any new or revised emissions targets.Under my amendment, when advising on those targets, the Authority must advise the Minister on the benefits to regional communities that a higher target would deliver, and the physical impacts of climate change on regional Australia.This means that in three years, when the Government sets our next target for 2035, it will be forced to reckon with two facts: that climate change is damaging the regions, and that decarbonizing the economy must deliver for the regions.It is only sensible that Australias climate policy framework has a particular focus on the regions because we regional Australians are at the forefront of the changing climate.We regional Australians endure the brunt of the droughts, the floods and the bushfires that are becoming increasingly intense.And it is the regions that will host almost all of the new renewable energy, all the new transmission lines and a huge part of the new industries Australia must build to truly take advantage of the net zero economic opportunity.This transition will happen primarily in the regions, so it only makes sense that our climate policy keeps a special focus on the regions.I thank the Member for Mayo for moving these amendments on my behalf and I thank the Minister for Climate Change and Energy for working with me constructively to improve the Governments Bill.The Coalition right now has a choice—to support these amendments and support regional people, or to put old politics ahead of regional people and prosperity.I urge all Members to vote for these amendments. By putting the regions back into the centre of the climate debate, we are making this Bill something that can work for every part of our country.I was very pleased to read that speech and put forward those amendments on behalf of the member for Indi.","Climate Change Bill 2022, Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) ","(10:31):"

The member for Mayo is a strong advocate for regions, and I am sure the member for Mayo would agree that the member for Indi is a particularly strong advocate for regions.The member for Indis amendments, as the member for Mayo has indicated, really do four things. They require that the annual climate change statement to the parliament made by the minister of the day include reference to regional Australia and the impacts on regional Australia and also that this be included in the advice to government by the Climate Change Authority on the setting of future targets. Also, this adds to the performance of functions and, I think, importantly, adds rural and regional development and community energy as qualifications for appointment to the Climate Change Authority. These are very sensible amendments, and I am pleased to indicate on behalf of the government that we will support them.I would be shocked if any member opposed these. If the National Party is opposing—we will see in a few moments—the inclusion of regional affairs in these things, it would really indicate just how low this debate has fallen.

This is like having the Climate Change Authority assess their own homework. Why wouldnt we have an independent authority come in and understand the economic impact on regional and rural Australia?So to be constructive, as the National Party always are, which is at the heart of representing regional and rural Australia and understanding the impacts this will have on regional and rural Australia, we will be working through the Senate committee process to make sure that we can work constructively to get back to the core principle of independence and having transparency on what impact this will have on regional and rural Australia and those people we represent that have borne most of the bill in us meeting Kyoto and Paris, so that that burden is not unfairly put on regional and rural Australia.

I also thank the member for Mayo for speaking on her behalf in the chamber. I appreciate the concern that the member for Indi has for regional communities. Its certainly a concern shared at least by everybody on this side of the chamber. I appreciate also the fact that she is seeking to protect regional communities from impacts of this bill because, rest assured, there will be impacts from this bill.As I said in the second reading speech, it is an indictment on the government that it has utterly failed to include any safeguards in these bills and has, indeed, actively removed safeguards from the nationally determined contribution—the NDC. The coalitions 2021 NDC included a requirement for regular reviews of the impact of the governments climate change policies on regional communities, on jobs and investment, on energy prices and on agricultural land. The new Albanese Labor government have stripped all of these safeguards from the NDC. That is exactly the act that they have taken.With respect to the amendments from the member for Indi, it is not good enough to have the Climate Change Authority do this work. The leader of the National Party is right; it is the equivalent of them marking their own homework. Worse still, it is like the minister himself marking his own homework. Thats what these amendments would effectively enable. Thats why we have decided, as an opposition, to also oppose this amendment. Its not good enough for a climate change policy body with a narrow field of expertise to be considering the very broad impacts that these bills would likely have on regional Australia. And so the coalitions approach in government was to have reviews conducted independently—reviews undertaken independent of government by the Productivity Commission. While I thank the member for Indi for her contribution today—I really do—the coalition will oppose these amendments.

39,0,0,0,1,1,"Wilkie, Andrew MP","C2T","Clark","IND","N/A",683," I move amendments (1) to (3) to the Climate Change Bill 2022 as circulated in my name:(1) Clause 10, page 5 (line 10), omit 43%, substitute 75%.(2) Clause 10, page 5 (line 16), omit 2050, substitute 2035, at the latest.(3) Clause 12, page 7 (line 18), at the end of subclause (1), add:; and (e) Australias scope 3 emissions of greenhouse gas.As I mentioned in my second reading speech, the governments bill is a good start. But it is deficient, seriously so, and the three amendments Ive presented to the House would go some considerable way to remedying it.Firstly, we need much more ambitious targets because what we do this decade is obviously critically important to the success or failure of Australias response to climate change. Indeed, experts at the Climate Council tell us that net zero by 2050 is at least a decade too late. In fact—and I quote the Climate Council—this time line carries a strong risk of irreversible global climate disruption at levels inconsistent with maintaining well-functioning human societies. And using the same methodology as the Climate Change Authority did in 2014, experts have calculated that the global emissions budget gives Australia only about 15 years to reach net zero.The message could not be clearer, and when reflecting on it we need to also consider the fact that Australia is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and that much of our wealth has come directly from our fossil fuel resources, which directly contribute to the problem. This economic advantage, plus our abundant natural resources, actually places us in prime position to develop renewable energy capacity and the ability to export this clean energy to the rest of the world. In other words, Australia, of all countries, can be so much more ambitious. With all this in mind, amendments (1) and (2) replace the weak targets that are currently in the bill with targets of a 75 per cent emissions reduction on 2005 levels by 2030 and a commitment to reach net zero by 2035 at the latest. These are science backed and equitable.Secondly, Australia is one of the largest exporters of fossil fuels on the globe, and our own measuring and reduction of carbon emissions needs to reflect that. Indeed, since 2005 our fossil fuel exports have more than doubled, meaning that the emissions caused by other countries burning Australias exported coal, oil and gas are more than double our total domestic emissions. This contribution to global climate pollution is significant, and its our responsibility. Yet the current government, even while acknowledging the need to reduce our emissions at home, continues to commit to new fossil fuel exports, which will exacerbate the global climate crises—as though these are separate issues.We simply cant pretend that even though its Australias policies that have led to Australian companies digging up Australian fossil fuels we simply have no responsibility for the carbon emissions released as a result. Thats why amendment (3) requires that Australias scope 3 emissions—the emissions we export overseas—be included in the ministers annual climate change statements. This would ensure that the public cannot not be misled when it comes to Australias huge contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions and puts our fossil fuel exports front and centre.As Ive said before in this place, the overall goal is to reduce the amount of carbon emissions being released into the atmosphere, and we cannot lose sight of this. This isnt a question of whether Australia must report on scope 3 emissions according to international law or whether these emissions are counted in some other countrys database—no. Regardless of whether we plan to export it or burn it here, what matters is that we leave Australian coal, oil and gas in the ground—and when we do dig it up, we need to account for it. Amendment (3) requires the government to report to the parliament on what we are doing to ensure that this is the case in the future.Time is rapidly running out to reduce emissions and to mitigate the worst of the extreme impacts of climate change. There is so much opportunity for Australia in the energy transition, and we should be taking a lead on the international stage, not sitting on our hands. Amendments (1), (2) and (3) reflect this ambition, and I call on all members to support them.","Climate Change Bill 2022, Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[12]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WILKIE (Clark) ","(10:54):"

What we know is that the planet is like the human body: there is a narrow temperature range within which it can exist and still be healthy. If you heat up the human body too much and go beyond that acceptable range you start to get sick, organs can start to fail, systems can start to collapse. You might not know how much damage is done but you will do damage that might be irreparable. Heated up beyond that, death almost certainly follows. The planet is the same. The planet has a guardrail of acceptable temperatures, and we know what they are because that is what was signed up to in the Paris Agreement.Scientists have made it crystal clear that, beyond two degrees of global heating, runaway climate change may become unstoppable. Feedback loops may kick in and it might be too late for our kids and grandkids to do what is necessary to fix it. They have also given us a clear indication that at two degrees, and even if we stop it going over two, we will say goodbye to the Great Barrier Reef, crops will start to fail, and in the Murray-Darling Basin you will be looking at substantial collapse in agricultural productivity during the lifetime of todays primary school students.The Paris Agreement also says we should keep alive the hopes of limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees. That is something our Pacific Islanders are crying out for because they know that if it gets to two degrees and we dont stop at 1½ degrees, their homes will disappear. Even 1½ degrees would mean a scarier world than what we have now. It would mean certain crop failures in Australia. It would mean worse fires and floods than the ones we are seeing at the moment. We have already hit one-and-a-bit degrees and we have to stop the world heating by 1½ degrees, so if we hit two degrees, say goodbye to the Great Barrier Reef. Large parts of Australia will start to become uninhabitable if we go above that, and we may never be able to stop climate change. That is why we are doing this. We are not doing this just to have a little bit of pollution reduction; we are doing this to stop us going over the cliff.To meet those targets, we have been told what we need to do. Unfortunately, because the coalition took us backwards for so long, we now need to move faster. When someone has made the problem worse, we need to act more quickly to fix it, not slow down. The Climate Council, the climate targets authority, our Pacific Island neighbours and the worlds scientists have all said very clearly: if you want to stop global warming exceeding two degrees, you need to have at least 50 per cent cut, but if you want to limited to 1½ degrees, to give us a chance of the reef surviving and the 60,000 jobs that depend on it, to give the Pacific Islanders what they are asking for and what indeed I think this government just signed up to a couple of weeks ago when it signed up to a communique that said it was committed to limiting global heating to 1½ degrees, then you need pollution cuts of 75 per cent. That is crystal clear. That is the science. That is why we are doing this. Anything less and you are giving up on 1½ degrees.As the member for Ryan eloquently put it yesterday, youve got to understand what Labors targets mean. Labors targets mean—according to the Climate Council and the Climate Targets Panel—overshooting two degrees. Thats what they mean. If you think what were now seeing is bad, with the fires and floods, Labors targets mean it will be twice as bad. They mean twice as much heating in our planet, which will mean an exponential lift in the risk to human life and the risk to our environment. Were not doing this just to cut pollution by a little bit; we are doing this to try and stop climate change becoming a runaway chain reaction. So, the next time there are fires or floods, or when we see the Great Barrier Reef bleaching next, know that that is what Labor targets are all about. That is what they are designed to achieve: two degrees or more of heating. Climate Analytics and the Climate Council all say that. We need to do better. We need to support these amendments.","Climate Change Bill 2022, Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[14]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BANDT (Melbourne—Leader of the Australian Greens) ","(11:15):"

There are two changes that Id like the government and the House to consider. The bill, as drafted, would require the minister to make an annual statement to parliament about Australias progress in reducing emissions, relevant international developments, the governments climate change policies and the effectiveness of the governments climate change policies.My first change would require that the statement consider, sector by sector, the impact of policies. It is important that Australians can see the progress being made by each sector of the economy and understand where climate policies are effective and where they are not. I hope this would bolster the governments sector-by-sector-specific plans, setting out targets and measures that would provide certainty for businesses, investors and other stakeholders.My second change would require the statement to consider the effectiveness of the governments policies in general, rather than climate policy specifically. This is a subtle change but an important one. It will allow the minister, with advice from the Climate Change Authority, to consider the impact of the governments policies which may be making the emissions reduction task more difficult, such as fossil fuel subsidies. Transparency will help to inform the public debate and allow voters to take an informed view of the full cost of government policies.I believe these changes are reasonable and sensible and will help us make progress towards emissions reduction.

The Climate Change Authority is charged with giving the minister advice that relates to the ministers preparation of an annual climate change statement. By amending clause 14, page 9, of the Climate Change Bill 2022 I am seeking to strengthen the parliamentary transparency over this advice. The amendment would have the effect of causing the written advice the Climate Change Authority prepares to the minister to be tabled within 15 sitting days, rather than simply being put on a website somewhere at an unspecified time, or, worse still, potentially being lost in a ministers tray.The initial draft that was shared with me as a member of the crossbench some weeks ago relied heavily on putting parliamentary and public trust in the climate change minister to do the right thing. As I said earlier in the debate, the truth is that while that may work, in this current situation its not good enough when it comes to legislating for sustainable, positive change. Im very grateful to have had the opportunity to work with the minister and his team to increase the role of the parliament—all members of parliament—to increase transparency and enable greater insight into what advice has been received from where and when.

55,0,0,0,1,1,"Steggall, Zali MP",175696,"Warringah","IND","N/A",690," I move amendment (1) to the Climate Change Bill 2022 as circulated in my name:(1) Clause 15, page 10 (after line 2), after subclause (2), insert:(2A) The Commonwealth must only communicate a new nationally determined contribution in accordance with Article 4 of the Paris Agreement that first includes a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for 2035, 2040 or 2045 if:(a) the Climate Change Authority has given advice under subsection (1) on the target; or(b) the Minister, after consultation with the Climate Change Authority, is satisfied that the new nationally determined contribution needs to be communicated urgently to further the matters set out in Article 2 of the Paris Agreement.Note: This requirement does not apply to adjustments of nationally determined contributions. Such adjustments must represent an enhancement of Australias level of ambition under subsection 10(6) and advice on such adjustments may be requested under paragraph 15(1)(b).For those who have not read that amendment, the intent of the amendment is to ensure that the future of targets and emissions budgets is informed by science—something which for far too long has not really been the source of the debate in this place. This is achieved through requiring the minister to seek the advice of the Climate Change Authority in advance of lodging a new nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement. This is important because we know the world is moving towards net zero, and we need to ensure that we are compliant with our obligations under the Paris Agreement and are focused on the ultimate goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to achieve limiting global warming to as close to 1.5 degrees as possible. This amendment also clarifies that future greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets are required for 2035, for 2040 and for 2045. This provides a very clear road map to net zero.The note included in the amendment further reinforces that, while the new Climate Change Authority advice isnt necessarily required for adjustments to nationally determined contributions, any adjustment must represent an enhancement of ambition towards emissions reduction. This means we cannot slide backwards following any change of government, and I would call this our future insurance policy. It says that, once an NDC has been made, it cannot be amended to go backwards.Whilst, of course, this means also that the government does not have to seek the advice of the Climate Change Authority to review its 2030 target, I would urge the government, when the evidence is in, when we see how well the international community and industry and business invest in our transition, to be more ambitious. We can send the message that we are up for more. Australians have always, on the world stage, in so many areas, punched above our weight. In sport, in industry, in business, we always manage to overachieve. So I would encourage the government, when its possible, when advice is available, to do that.I would like to take this opportunity to ask the minister a clarifying question on the consequential amendments bill. I appreciate the ministers commitment to continue reviewing further acts for inclusion in the consequential amendments. Minister, could you please confirm that this review process will also consider strengthening the operation of the current set of amendments, such as for the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, and require, in time, a shift from may consider the climate change impacts to must consider the climate change impacts. Clearly, may provides a huge loophole, from a legal background, for further projects to be approved and the climate impacts just ignored. Must provides a much greater liability to consider climate impacts on funding and approvals and projects. Its clear that thats needed if we want to achieve the ultimate goal of the Paris Agreement of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.","Climate Change Bill 2022, Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[20]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STEGGALL (Warringah) ","(12:02):"

59,0,0,0,1,1,"Watson-Brown, Elizabeth MP",300127,"Ryan","AG","N/A",692," I move amendment (1) to the Climate Change Bill 2022, as circulated in my name:(1) Clause 15, page 10 (after line 5), after subclause (3), insert:(3A) The advice given under subsection (1) must include an explanation of how the greenhouse gas emissions reductions targets have taken into account the matters set out in Article 2 of the Paris Agreement, including the global goals of:(a) holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels; and(b) pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.If were to prevent catastrophic climate change, we must keep global temperature rises as low as possible and not pass dangerous tipping points. The Paris Agreement recognised this reality when it set the temperature thresholds that must not be crossed. Article 2 of the Paris Agreement committed countries, including Australia, to:… Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change …It is these temperature goals that must inform Australias climate targets and therefore any assessment by the Climate Change Authority of what Australias future climate target should be, including Australias nationally determined contribution for 2035.In 2014 the Climate Change Authority produced its progress and targets review, which, guided by temperature thresholds, assessed what Australias fair share of emissions reduction should be to stay within those thresholds. The Liberals then stripped the Climate Change Authority of its requirement to advise on targets. We welcome the requirement that the Climate Change Authority once again advise on emissions targets, and it is critical that it now again adopts the same approach. This amendment will ensure that when the Climate Change Authority again provides such advice, as is required in this bill, it will follow the same approach as in 2014 and be explicitly guided by the Paris Agreements temperature goals.The amendment does this by adding a new subclause 3A to clause 15 of the bill, stating that the advice given by the Climate Change Authority under subsection (1) of clause 15 of the bill must include an explanation of how the greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets have taken into account the matters set out in article 2 of the Paris Agreement, including the global goals of (a) holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels and (b) pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.The importance of the Climate Change Authority deriving Australias target from the remaining carbon budget so as to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement is reinforced by the inadequacy of the targets offered by governments in recent times. Climate scientists, using the same methodology as the Climate Change Authority, have determined that Australias 2030 target to stay below two degrees would be 50 per cent and to stay below 1.5 degrees would be 74 per cent. This amendment requires this methodology to be once more followed by the Climate Change Authority.In the course of negotiations by the Greens with the government on this bill, this amendment has been agreed to by the government, and I thank the government for their agreement to the amendment. I commend the amendment to the House.","Climate Change Bill 2022, Climate Change (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[22]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WATSON-BROWN (Ryan) ","(12:15):"

It was, of course, where the former government, in their wisdom and brilliance, paid over $30 million for a piece of land that the Auditor-General found was worth $3 million. Indeed, it tied up a lot of the previous audit committees work, dealing with rorts, waste and incompetence, be it in grant programs, procurements or, in this case, purchase of the land.The less talked about fact, though, is not just the actual cash, the taxpayer money, that was paid for a piece of land—at 10 times its value—but also what we could well term the and well throw in free steak knives and the kitchen sink package to incentivise an unwilling seller. It was a package of incentives. Youd love to deal with the Commonwealth if you were selling them land under these circumstances. They saw us coming from a distance. Under the former minister in the former government, the department threw in a lease, generous infrastructure provisions, a tunnel, which was uncosted, under an airport access road and changes to the master plan—in the coming decades, when they want to build another airport runway there, you can guess whos going to be on the hook to move the infrastructure; its going to be the poor old taxpayer—as well as other sorts of works.I want to record the important fact that it wasnt just the outrageous overpayment for the land; it was the whole package of incentives that sat around this to incentivise an unwilling seller. In the Auditor-Generals words, the purchase fell short of ethical standards. In my six years on the audit committee, the word ethics is used so rarely in the Auditor-Generals reports. I think were going to see it used a little bit more in the ones coming through the pipeline. Thats just a prophetic projection. The committees report also agreed:… the Department did not undertake all reasonable steps to determine what a suitable cost would be for the Government to acquire the property, to demonstrate that the price paid for the property represented an efficient, effective, economical and ethical use of public funds …The committee found that it was just not appropriate.In terms of the recommendation, I will just make this point, and I want to put it on the record for the parliament as someone who, in a former life, under governments of both political persuasions, did use compulsory acquisition powers as a public servant. The committees view, and this was a bipartisan recommendation, was that, pending any systemic changes, there should be a clear default presumption that compulsory acquisition powers shall be used for land acquisition, that the starting point for any agencies, be it infrastructure or other departments, that want to go out and purchase land in these circumstances should be the use of the compulsory acquisition powers—they should not get sucked into this incentivising an unwilling seller and end up paying vastly more than we should with taxpayers money—and that off-market voluntary acquisitions should only be used:… when carefully justified and thoroughly documented, in which case compulsory acquisition methodology should be used as a benchmark to help ensure that a situation like the Leppington Triangle purchase does not happen again.I think thats a really important point to note. If the compulsory acquisition powers had been used—its a mystery. The Auditor-General could never find why the initial decision to use the compulsory acquisition powers was diverted from, but if compulsory acquisition powers had been used, we would not have had this situation. I commend the report to the House.","Public Accounts and Audit Joint Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"

This is good policy, and this is coalition policy, because we understand that every single dollar—especially for those Australians who are no longer working, who are in their retirement—is very important.On 2 May the coalition announced that, if re-elected, wed increase the income test threshold for singles from $57,761 to $90,000, to give more seniors access to the concession card, and that we would raise the couples threshold from $92,416 to $144,000.Labor quickly adopted this coalition policy and are pretty shamelessly trying to rebrand it as their own policy here today. They wont be the first government to have done that, but they are very shamelessly doing that, with one important problem. In the first few weeks of this government, one of the hallmarks has been broken promises, and today, with this bill, we see another broken promise. The media release that Labor released very shortly after we made this announcement, said:Labor will widen eligibility for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card, in line with the Governments announcement today.The government then being the coalition government. It went on:Were not interested in playing politics when we see a good idea.And—this is the great moment of irony:Unlike the Morrison Government, we can be trusted to deliver on our announcements for older Australians and pensioners.You have there an unequivocal adoption of the coalition policy by the Labor Party, with one problem for the government. The announcement from the coalition was that this measure would take effect from 1 July this year, from the first day of this financial year. This bill states that the measure will take effect from 20 September this year, which is more than three months later than was promised.You see a succession of broken promises now from a very, very brief period of time in government. Weve seen those opposite not willing to repeat their commitment to reduce power prices by $275—the number 275 cannot be spoken by those opposite. When you add all of that up—and here we have another bill that, in a small but significant way, breaches another pre-election commitment—it is very disappointing. Nevertheless, we will support the bill, because, even though its later than they promised in the middle of the campaign, our view is: better late than never. And well never, obviously, say no to good coalition policy being adopted by the government.Importantly, these changes, late though they are, will give an extra 50,000 older Australians access to more affordable health care and medications to help ease their cost of living. At the Commonwealth level, all cardholders are eligible for cheaper medicines and health care, and they may also be eligible for state, territory and local government savings that are often used, including for discounted rates, electricity and gas, ambulance, dental, eye care, recreation and public transport.This coalition commitment is the first change, outside of indexation, to the income threshold of the Commonwealth seniors health card in over 20 years. Currently, more than 436,000 Australians aged over 67 who are not already receiving a pension or benefit, have a seniors health card. As I stated earlier, with the additional 50,000 that will now become available, this will mean that more than 486,000 people will become eligible, or an 11 per cent increase.In our view, in my view and in the coalitions view, senior Australians, who have worked hard and made our country what it is today, deserve our country to recognise that effort and to recognise that we are standing on their shoulders. This is a small but important way that we can demonstrate that in a tangible way. The coalition, as I stated at the outset, will be supporting this bill, supporting good coalition policy. Good on the Labor Party for taking it on and for adopting coalition policy, but they really need to be held accountable for making sloppy promises in the election that they really have no intention of keeping. They adopted our policy holus-bolus in the campaign, saying that this would commence on 1 July. They wanted to spend a lot of time before they reconvened the parliament, which has led to this now not being available until 20 September. Thats another broken promise from this government. But as I said, its better late than never, and of course we will be supporting good coalition policy.","Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Lifting the Income Limit for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SUKKAR (Deakin) ","(12:45):"

As the shadow minister indicated, it has the support of the opposition, and its a realisation of a commitment that the Albanese Labor government made in relation to providing support for seniors in this country. Clearly, its a very significant matter. As we know, there have been sufficient efforts to provide support for people. Cost-of-living pressures are such that we need to do what we can to alleviate those pressures. We have inherited probably one of the largest public debts any government in this country has inherited. It is now well over $1 trillion of debt—debt that was accumulated by the previous government, and most of which was accumulated prior to the pandemic. Whilst, of course, we supported measures by the previous government in responding to the pandemic, to support the economy, to support business and workers and the like, unfortunately I think in some part they failed. There was expenditure on rorts and other things that need to be cleaned up by this government. We want to make sure that seniors in this country are given support, and thats why were looking to ensure that this legislation is passed. This will lift the income limit for the Commonwealth seniors health card.

75,0,0,0,1,1,"Khalil, Peter MP",101351,"Wills","ALP","N/A",699," Over the first sitting fortnight of parliament, the Albanese Labor government has taken real action on issues that affect everyday Australians, and this particular bill will lift income limits for the Commonwealth seniors health card, seeing more self-funded retirees become eligible. The action of this bill would ease the increase in cost-of-living pressures that so many senior Australian face. It is something I am committed to in my electorate of Wills, and I know all my colleagues are on this side. In particular, this will ease the cost of concessional medicines and medical services, the importance of which we are all conscious of anyway, but even more so during the pandemic which weve experienced. This will mean an increase in the income limit to $90,000 for singles, up from $57,761, and $144,000 combined for couples, up from $92,416. This will expand access for more than 44,000 people from September this year, increasing to more than 52,000 people in the year 2026-2027. I commend the Minister for Social Services for introducing the legislation in the first sitting fortnight, showing that the Albanese Labor government understands the real cost-of-living pressures of Australians.I also want to take this opportunity to speak more broadly to the economic concerns of retirees and senior Australians in my electorate of Wills. As an urban electorate in the heart of Melbournes northern suburbs, Wills has seen a lot of change over the decades. More and more families, students, young professionals and emerging migrant groups have moved to the area and created the wonderfully diverse community Im fortunate to represent. This has coincided with a significant increase in house prices and associated costs, like council rates and land taxes. Whilst homeowners accept that there are costs associated with homeownership, senior Australians are undoubtedly feeling the pinch as costs continue to rise. Whilst many of these senior Australians may have assets, likely bought decades ago at much less than their current value, they are often income poor. Its a common problem: asset wealthy, asset rich; income poor. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the southern half of my own electorate—in Brunswick and Coburg in particular.Decades ago, back when former Prime Minister Bob Hawke represented the seat of Wills—I have illustrious predecessors—they were not the highly sought after suburbs that are now known for their cultural and economic opportunities. They were much more working class, and a much lower socioeconomic demographic was represented in those suburbs. They were working-class suburbs, effectively—and they still are to a certain extent, but were much more so 20, 30 or 40 years ago. They were home to working families and new migrants who worked exceptionally hard to give something back to their country, have a good life for themselves and their children, and set themselves up.Like any Australian, they dreamt of owning their own home, and many of them at the time were fortunate enough to do so after decades of hard work. But today they face a situation where their home value has increased but their income has not. In fact, it has very likely declined in retirement. Now, I know what many people—in particular, younger Australians and those unable to buy their own home—may think: So what? And that might be a fair response, as the prospect of homeownership remains so far out of reach and they are often met with ridicule, with suggestions such as Give up the avocado toast, or, Dont eat kale for breakfast, or, Just get a loan from your parents—we heard that from the previous governments ministers—often coming from those on the other side of this House.In my job as the member for Wills, I represent an electorate that is home to both a lot of young and a lot of older Australians, and I dont think their interests should always be framed as competing interests. I think thats false; its a false dichotomy. It shouldnt be the case that we expect older Australians to be so pressured by the cost of living that their only choice is between poverty or selling their family home. For many, its the first and only home theyve ever known, the home they raised their family in, the home that theyve celebrated in, the home that they have cherished memories of. They are not big developers or property magnates. They are everyday people facing the prospect of being forced out of their home. That is what is happening by stealth in many communities across the country as a lot of inner city councils continue to increase rates and fees. This is something Ive raised on numerous occasions on behalf of my community, including with representations to local councils and the state governments as well. At the end of the day, these people are not asking for a free pass but for common sense and compassion that considers decades of context rather than just the challenges of the day.At the same time, I know that when I speak to senior Australians they are often worried about the unfairness facing young people, whether it be the staggering cost of homeownership, the insecure nature of the workforce or the threat of climate change. These are such important issues, ones that the Albanese government has taken action on in the first sitting weeks of our government, including the passage today of the first genuine plan in a decade to tackle climate change. These are issues that senior Australians are talking about all the time, because it is an electorate which is compassionate, regardless of your age group, and an electorate where people do look out for one another.When we make decisions in this place, and indeed at all levels of government, we need not pit groups of Australians against each other as if they have competing interests. The choice is not between allowing senior Australians to stay in their family home or supporting homeownership for young people. Thats false. Its a false choice. The choice is about taking real action to make both a reality and to ease the cost of living and other challenges facing Australians from all walks of life and backgrounds. As the Prime Minister has said, government should be about bringing people together—less about conflict; more about getting things done. This is what we are doing by expanding access to the Commonwealth seniors health card. And it is what we will continue to do in this government, with massive investments in education, housing, renewable energy, jobs, aged care, health care and child care.For the seniors in particular, we will freeze deeming rates at their current levels for two years, protecting around 900,000 age pensioners and other pension recipients from interest rate rises—making sure pensioners can keep more of their money in their pockets, making medicine cheaper, cutting the cost of medication on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from the current maximum of $42.50 to $30, delivering more affordable housing so older Australians who dont own their own home wont find all their pension eaten up by rising rents, delivering 50 bulk-billed Medicare urgent care clinics. We will also put the care back into aged care by ensuring registered nurses are on site 24/7. Its about improving standards of care and nutrition and ensuring better oversight of aged-care funding.These are just some of the measures that an Albanese Labor government will take to ease the cost of living and improve the quality of life for older Australians, because older Australians deserve respect in their senior years. They deserve a government that will be on their side when it comes to easing the cost of living and accessing quality health- and aged-care services. And they deserve a government that will recognise their decades of contribution to our society and to our country by looking after them, by meeting the obligation that we have as a government to make sure that we fulfil our commitment to them, in the same way they have committed to this nation.It is not just what we should expect in an egalitarian country like Australia; it is what we should champion as creators and passers of public policy and legislation. I know this is a priority for the Albanese Labor government. We see that today with this bill and the other legislation debated this past fortnight. I, for my part, will continue to advocate for real action that makes a positive difference for my community as we deliver a better future for all Australians, young and old.","Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Lifting the Income Limit for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KHALIL (Wills) ","(12:53):"
76,0,0,0,1,1,"Sharkie, Rebekha MP",265980,"Mayo","CA","N/A",700," I rise to speak in support of this bill, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Lifting the Income Limit for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card) Bill 2022. This March the age pension was increased by 2.1 per cent—by $20.10 for singles, taking it up to $987 a fortnight, and by $30.20 for couples, taking it up to $1,448.80 a fortnight. While touted by the former government as the largest increase since 2013, the 2.1 per cent indexation lagged behind the Consumer Price Index trimmed mean annual inflation, which excludes large prices and falls, which increased to 2.6 per cent in December 2021.This was the highest it has risen since 2014, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This means that cost-of-living increases are hitting age pensioners budgets especially hard. Mayo is the oldest federal electorate by median age in South Australia and it is in the top 10 nationally. Older people in my community often share their concerns with me regarding the rising cost of rents, household expenses, council rates, power, petrol and services. The cost of health services and products are also top of the list of my constituents concerns, whether it be the rising cost of out-of-pocket expenses for procedures and prescriptions or the diminishing number of bulk-billing doctors. In Victor Harbor, where the average age of residents is just over 60, theres not been a general practice that uniformly bulk-bills pensioners and concession cardholders for many, many years.While costs continue to climb, this bill represents one practical way in which we can help to ease financial pressures for older Australians receiving the age pension. This bill will, hopefully, increase the yearly seniors health card adjusted taxable income limits, including deemed income, from $57,761 to $90,000 for a single person and from $92,416 to $144,000 for a couple. This benefit will help 50,000 self-funded retirees, who will now become eligible for the seniors health card. Ive got to say that we dont talk enough in here about the challenges faced by self-funded retirees. Now they will be able to access concessional co-payments for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, for medicines concessional thresholds, for the PBS safety nets, at the doctors discretion, and possibly even bulk-billing when they go to see their doctor. Co-payments for senior health card holders for PBS listed medicines will be reduced to $6.80 maximum, down from $42.50, for PBS listed medicines. Theyll also be provided with access to other linked concessions from state and territory governments and private organisations. So this is incredibly welcome.This is one of many initiatives that are required to ease the financial distress experienced by many older Australians, and there is much that we can do to that end in this place. For example, earlier this week I moved a motion saying, Lets let pensioners work without penalty. We know theres a huge workforce shortage in our nation, and this could be a real game changer for both employers and older Australians. National Seniors found that one in five of the pensioners they surveyed said theyd be really keen to work again. They dont want to deal with Centrelink and the low threshold, where theyre effectively earning $37 a day and then having to interact with Centrelink or lose 50c from every dollar earned in their pension. There are many seniors struggling in our community. Some are self-funded retirees and some are on the pension. Its our job in here to do the very best for our older Australians.A related issue, which I hope the minister will consider, is that, right now, when you are applying for the pension, if you are in a $5 million home somewhere in metropolitan Melbourne or Sydney, and if that is your only asset, you are eligible for the pension. However, if you are a senior Australian from rural or regional Australia, and your house is on 20 or perhaps 40 acres, there are a whole lot of rules around whether you can get the pension. Effectively, for any blocks over two hectares in size, unless you fit some criteria, the rest of that property is included as part of your assets. I dont know if too many people in here have had a small property, a farm or a farmlet. You cant make a lot of income on those remaining 15 hectares if youre on a 20-hectare property. So I would urge the government to look at the two-hectare rule and lift it to 10 hectares. It just makes good sense. How can we have that inequality, where the home people in rural Australia live in is perhaps worth a lot less money than the home of those living in inner-metropolitan regions or metropolitan cities of Australia, and yet one qualifies for the pension automatically, because thats their only asset, and the other one doesnt? I dont know where this rule came from, but two hectares is incredibly small. A lot of people in their 50s are making a tree change—perhaps theyre on 20 hectares—and they get to retirement age and they dont meet the criteria. They are considered to have the ability to make an income on the rest of that property, beyond the two hectares, and therefore they miss out on the pension because of that rule. I urge the government to have a close look at that, and I will be writing to the minister accordingly.To come back to this bill, this bill goes a long way to assisting our older Australians. Therefore, I commend this bill to the House.","Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Lifting the Income Limit for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) ","(13:03):"
77,0,0,0,1,1,"Elliot, Justine MP","DZW","Richmond","ALP","N/A",701," I also rise today to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Lifting the Income Limit for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card) Bill 2022. This bill increases the income limit for eligibility for the health card. It really is an overdue measure, and it will benefit so many seniors right across the country. As we all know, after a decade of mismanagement and neglect under the former Liberal-National government, the cost of living in this country is soaring, and the cost of health care has soared as well. In particular, the former government put primary care in crisis, with the average out-of-pocket cost for GP visits increasing by 60 per cent over the past decade. This is impacting our older Australians severely. Remember, our seniors built this country. They paid their taxes and raised their families, and they must be treated with dignity and respect. They have that with an Albanese Labor government. And its an Albanese Labor government that will increase the income limits for the Commonwealth seniors health card. This will see more in the pockets of our seniors, because we want to help ease the costs they are currently facing. Our government went to the election with a plan for a better future for Australians, and we are delivering on that.The Commonwealth seniors health card serves those who have reached age pension or veteran pension age but dont receive any social security benefits or payments, due to their income or assets. The card provides eligible seniors with a number of beneficial health concessions, including concessional co-payments for Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines; lowered PBS safety net; extended Medicare safety net; some bulk-billed visits to the GP, at the GPs discretion; and, in some instances, other concessions, including for public transport, utilities and council rates. So there are a range of benefits.This will assist seniors because, with the Commonwealth seniors health card, medicines under the PBS are cheaper. Medicines that might have cost $42.50 under the PBS will not exceed $6.80. The seniors health card also provides access to the lowered PBS safety net from July this year. This threshold was lowered to $244.80, allowing cardholders to receive their PBS medicines for free upon reaching the lowered threshold.Accessing these benefits really translates into savings for our seniors, particularly with those medicines that they may access more regularly, such as blood pressure and cholesterol medications. In addition, cardholders will gain access to the extended Medicare safety net, and that means, once the threshold is met, a Medicare rebate of 80 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses for the remainder of the calendar year. That really is a fantastic move.As I said, the seniors health card can also provide for bulk-billed visits to the GP if the GP extends that eligibility to the cardholders. Whats also great about this card in some states and territories—there are variations—is that cardholders may receive discounts on their property and water rates, electricity and gas bills, ambulance costs and public transport, just to name a few. That makes a huge difference with those day-to-day costs.This bill increases the income limit for a single person from $57,761 to $90,000 a year and, importantly, may apply to a person who is a member of an illness-separated couple or a member of a respite-care couple. For a couple, this bill increases the income limit from $92,416 combined to $144,000 combined. These changes will allow approximately 52,000 self-funded retirees and seniors to become newly eligible for the card. The new income limits will also apply to both current and future cardholders and claimants.This bill is a very welcome cost-of-living relief for our older Australians. I know in my electorate and throughout the country this has been an issue that many have raised for so many years. The Albanese Labor government is delivering on our commitment. This will make a big difference to many seniors. Were committed to restoring affordable and accessible health care for all Australians.The Commonwealth seniors health card has been in place since 1994 as a means of providing access to health concessions for self-funded retirees. Increasing these income limits is a very important move that will affect the lives of many self-funded retirees as they deal with the costs of health care and the cost of living. By increasing the income limits, our government is taking practical steps to really ease those cost-of-living pressures. I know how much it will help people across the country and, indeed, in my electorate of Richmond. I commend the bill to the House.","Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Lifting the Income Limit for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ELLIOT (Richmond—Assistant Minister for Social Services and Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence) ","(13:10):"

This is important to the electorate of Casey because we have 2,812 people on the Commonwealth seniors health card, 15,729 on the age pension and around 24,000 people aged over 65.On 2 May the coalition announced their policy to increase the singles income test threshold from $57,000 to $90,000 to give more senior Australians access to the concession card. The couple threshold would also increase from $92,000 to $144,000. I heard from many of my constituents during the campaign of the need for more support for aged and seniors, so I am so glad that this policy has come through. I note that Labor quickly adopted this coalition policy during the election and theyre now obviously trying to claim it as their own. But it is great that this is being delivered for senior Australians.The measure also gives an extra 50,000 older Australians access to more affordable health care and medications to help ease cost-of-living pressures. The cards are available to Australian residents over age-pension age who are not already receiving a pension and have an adjustable taxable income under the threshold.We will of course be supporting this bill, as I said, because this was a coalition initiative, although its disappointing to note that Labor have decided to push the start date out to 20 September. It was originally announced for July. As we know, many Australians, particularly our older Australians, are struggling with rising inflation and need support straightaway. Its another example of the current government not having a plan to help Australians today or this week. They are pushing off to September initiatives, like the jobs summit. It does not help anyone today. This initiative to support Australians should have been put in in July, but Im glad it is coming in—better late than never.Currently more than 436,000 Australians aged over 67 who are not already receiving a pension or benefit will have the seniors health card. Senior Australians have worked hard to make Australia all it is today, and it is important that the country takes care of them in return. This is a good policy. I only hope Labor adopts more of the coalitions policies to ease the cost-of-living pressures on seniors and, indeed, all Australians. Its another example of why this government needs an economic plan to deal with the challenges coming our way. Theres increasing pressure with inflation and increasing pressure with rising interest rates.

I know there are other speakers keen to speak on the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Lifting the Income Limit for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card) Bill 2022. Labor was very clear during the election: if you vote for us, there will be no broken promises and we wont waste a minute in government. Thats what were doing. Were getting on with the job. The coalition had nine years to do this and they didnt get around to doing it. We will get around to the job of fixing the failures of the previous government.At the election, Labor committed to increasing the income limits for the Commonwealth seniors health card. This will replace the annual indexation which would otherwise occur on 20 September. Its no surprise that the cost of living is the red-hot issue in the community, and this will help with cost-of-living pressures for older Australians, including those in my electorate. This bill increases the annual income limits for Commonwealth seniors health card holders from $57,761 to $90,000 for singles and from $92,416 to $144,000 for couples. Thats a substantial increase in eligibility. There will be an extra 44,000 newly-eligible CSHC holders assisted.Were very pleased to have brought this forward to the parliament. We are very pleased that we are in government and able to get this done. It wasnt done by the previous government. It is being done by the Albanese Labor government.

80,0,0,0,1,1,"Stevens, James MP",176304,"Sturt","LP","N/A",703," I rise to support the coalitions election commitment to increase the income thresholds for eligibility to the Commonwealth seniors health card. It was a great day in the campaign when we announced this, and not that big a surprise when the Labor Party dramatically and rapidly said, Well do that as well. This legislation changes the eligibility income threshold to $90,000 adjusted taxable income for singles and $144,000 for couples. It is a dramatic increase in eligibility. It is estimated that nearly 50,000 people will now be eligible for the Commonwealth seniors health card. Self-funded retirees are the great economic heroes of our country. They are in a position to finance, largely, their own retirement and take an enormous burden off the taxpayer by way of funding their retirement rather than needing to draw on the appropriate supports that are in place for senior Australians who are eligible. The Commonwealth seniors health card is an important indication and a practical support, and one that they deserve. It indicates to them that we value the fact that they have provisioned for their retirement and that, despite having provisioned for their retirement, they deserve some support from the government.The last few years have been challenging for all, but particularly for self-funded retirees, given the economic turmoil and headwinds around the pandemic. I have a very significant cohort of self-funded retirees in my electorate of Sturt and a lot of them have been apprehensive about their financial circumstances. Obviously, there were dramatic issues in markets with investments that they rely on to provide for their retirement—all of their own savings. This is an excellent way of making sure that they understand how much we value them. They should be entitled to support through the Commonwealth seniors health card around pharmaceutical and medical benefits.It is worth noting that the Commonwealth seniors health card is also used by state governments and others to provide concessions et cetera to seniors. I know thats not the case in South Australia; I am sure it is in most, if not all, other jurisdictions. Being eligible for the Commonwealth seniors health card not only gives you access to medical and pharmaceutical entitlements through the Commonwealth but also provides for other concessions that can be accessed through state, territory and local governments. So it is very important.Its disappointing that Labor have broken their promise to introduce this by 1 July. Im sure that is particularly due to the ridiculous delay in the parliament sitting. I apologise to all of the self-funded retirees who have missed out on a fair access to this card from 1 July, but Im hopeful that this bill will rapidly move through the House and the Senate, and that we can adopt it and give the entitlement to all. I commend the bill to the House.","Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Lifting the Income Limit for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr STEVENS (Sturt) ","(13:19):"

Increasing access by raising the income threshold for eligibility to receive this card will be of great benefit to many of the seniors living in the beautiful Lyne electorate. I have advocated for many changes to how senior Australians can contribute to the community in their retirement, but giving them some of the financial benefits that come with access to this will be a great bonus.

If youre not on a pension but you are a senior and have a fixed income, this card will be a great benefit to you.Raising the threshold from $57,761 to $90,000 for singles and from $92,416 to $144,000 for couples is really quite a significant change that will benefit up to 44,000 new Australians who will be able to access the card. This is such a good idea that it was actually our policy in the last election, and Im open to supporting anything that is sensible and reasonable that comes from the other side. Weve also called for many other things for pensioners that are not related to this bill, but I support this bill, and I hope that the members of my electorate enjoy its rapid appearance through the due process once it gets up to the Senate.","Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Lifting the Income Limit for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card) Bill 2022","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2[1]/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr GILLESPIE (Lyne) ","(13:23):"

Not only that, this teenager also attempted to carjack a woman at a local park. Was he sent to jail? No. Did he have a conviction recorded? No. The judges say theyre working within their limits.What do Labor want to do with the high crime rate that we see in Townsville? They want to raise the age of criminal responsibility.

It seems that the gas shortage lies in what one media story refers to as market exploitation by Australias east coast gas cartel, made up of five multinational entities that control 85 per cent of the gas. Three of those entities, in which the major stakeholders are ConocoPhillips, Origin, Sinopec, Shell, Santos, PETRONAS and TotalEnergies, control over two-thirds of Australias east coast gas. Of those companies, between 2015 and 2020, the last period for which figures are available, five paid zero tax and one paid minuscule tax in what would be a multibillion-dollar business sector. The distribution of the gas is dominated by the APA Group. There is no justification as to why Australians should face a gas shortage or pay exorbitant prices for an Australian resource. I call on those companies to do the right thing, show some corporate responsibility and ensure that the Australian people can buy Australian gas at affordable prices.","Gas Industry","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p","Mr ZAPPIA (Makin) ","(13:30):"

But, incredibly, he used personal suffering to create heartbreakingly beautiful songs and stories that pierced the heart of the nation. Took the Children Away, of course, will remain embedded in our national psyche as an expression of an experience which only some families, including my own, actually experienced, but which through Archies words and music were made intelligible to other Australians. This was done in a way which compelled empathy and which I am convinced was a vital stepping stone along the path to the apology, which could only be delivered by a Labor government and was delivered by Prime Minister Rudd in 2008. Took the Children Away played loudly at the start of the Going Home Conference, attended by hundreds of Northern Territory Stolen Generations survivors, including my father, in 1994.

The rental crisis is reaching social layers that we have not seen before in a long time.

What is deeply frustrating is that the Labor government is backing the stage 3 tax cuts, which will cost $224 billion over the next 10 years, but is only committing $10 billion to build social and affordable housing, and I think those are completely broken priorities.

Older people and small-business owners who need to get change and pay bills cant do this in regional communities, because of what has been happening in the banking sector.The Commonwealth Bank made $8 billion in profit last year. You would think that, if you could do that, you could keep some bank branches open in communities where there is no public transport instead of expecting disabled people, elderly people and business people to travel 20 or 30 kilometres to get to the nearest branch. Its appalling that they have done this with no consultation and no input from anyone in the community.Of course, the bank came out and said: Its okay. You can go to the post office and do all your bill paying there. Our postal staff are already under stress because of the workload they are getting. The previous government tried to put Centrelink in there as well, to make their jobs even harder. But the fact of the matter is that not everybody is capable of using electronic banking. The bank said, We have had a decrease in foot traffic over the last two years. Yes, they have. The pandemic has caused that. Lockdowns have caused that. That is no reason to shut this branch.

The Creative Economy Taskforce was established by me as the Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts in the previous government to provide strategic advice and support to the government on the creative economy as we recovered from the effects of COVID-19 and to assist with the implementation of the coalition governments creative economy JobMaker package. Under this package there was over $500 million in additional targeted funds for the arts and entertainment sector to alleviate the effects of COVID-19. Total funding for the arts in 2021-22 reached over $1 billion, a record for Commonwealth arts funding under any government—Liberal or Labor.I note the Minister for the Arts recently announced a new advisory body which does not include any of the eminent arts leaders who have served on the Creative Economy Taskforce. Of course while I make no criticism of members of that group—indeed, I worked with a number of them in my time as the arts minister—I do think its unfortunate that there has been no continuity here. I understand that the next meeting of the Creative Economy Taskforce will be its last. The minister has been publicly silent about the Creative Economy Taskforce. This is disappointing. It is disappointing that he could not bring himself to appoint any of these distinguished arts leaders to his new body. I reiterate my thanks to the members of the Creative Economy Taskforce for their vital contribution.

In fact, the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association has noted climate change to be the single biggest hurdle to agriculture achieving $100 billion by 2030. Thats what the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association said on the record. So we addressed climate change with the bill today.Today is a good day.

He was what the papers call an outspoken backbencher and a meticulous, combative minister. Now, to mark a sometimes rugged public life, we offer the tranquil courtesy of a condolence motion in recognition of his service to our nation.The youngest of three boys, Jim was left to work the family farm at Greenvale during the Second World War while his brothers served. In 1964, upon the death of Senator Harrie Wade, he was chosen to fill the casual vacancy—the beginning of 16 years as a senator for Victoria.A glance at the late senators pre-parliamentary CV reveals a seeming mass of contradictions: a delegate to the Timber Workers Union and a member of the Young Country Party; a member of the Waterside Workers Federation and the junior chamber of commerce. Some might imagine he was a mere contrarian. After all, as a newly elected senator he voted against the establishment of several committees that he then went on to serve on. But I think two words take us to the core of the paradox and the heart of the man: agrarian socialism. Jim Webster was one of those old-school Country Party representatives who believed very much in government intervention, whether it was more funding for select irrigation projects, tax breaks for timber plantations, new subsidies for rural industries or more support for tobacco growers. He knew what he believed, he knew what mattered to the people he represented, and he fought for it fiercely and frequently.Later on, he went on to serve in the first two terms of the Fraser government first as the Minister for Science and, after 1978, as the Minister for Science and the Environment. He had quite a record during this period. During his time in the portfolio Kakadu was declared a national park, whaling was banned in Australian waters, new support was given to the CSIRO and progress was made in preserving the Australian Antarctic Territory, which the senator visited twice and where Webster Bay still bears his name. He had a farmers respect for the land and an explorers love of beautiful places.He left the Senate in January 1980 to take up the post of Australian High Commissioner to New Zealand—four more years of service to the nation in a long life that was well lived. We honour him today and extend the respect of the parliament to his family and, in particular, to those people who knew him in the National Party. May he rest in peace.","Webster, Hon.

Born in 1925 on Flinders Island, Jim moved with his farming family to the outskirts of Melbourne as a child. As a student, he ran the family farm while his older brothers served in the war but he was prepared to serve himself, joining the Air Training Corps. He worked as a clerk in a log mill and as a tally man on Melbournes wharves before joining his grandfathers timber, hardware and plumbing business.He filled a vacancy in the Senate in 64 and was re-elected through the sixties and seventies and served until 1980. In his first speech, Jim spoke about the values he shared with his party: those of free enterprise and minimal government intervention. He stated:I pray that we shall retain in this country a system whereby freedom of the individual is paramount.Under Prime Minister Fraser, he served as the Minister for Science and the Environment. He championed Australias research in the Antarctic, the banning of whaling in our waters, the work of the CSIRO and our film and television industries. He was Deputy Leader and then Leader of the Country Party in the Senate. He also held the positions of Deputy President of the Senate and Chairman of Committees. As the Prime Minister pointed out, after leaving office he became Australias High Commissioner to New Zealand, before, most importantly, returning to where he started, farming the land. On behalf of the Liberal Party, I offer my heartfelt condolences to Jims colleagues, community, friends and family, especially his four children, Simon, James, Andrew and Tim.","Webster, Hon.

On behalf of the federal National Party, we honour the memory and pay our deepest respects to the life of Jim Webster, a Victorian senator for the National/Country Party, who served for 16 years in the parliament. He passed away on 3 April this year. Jim leaves behind him an incredible and distinguished legacy. He was a former leader of our party in the Senate and a former Minister for Science and the Environment, who served in the Fraser government.Throughout his entire career, Jim was a faithful servant of the Country Party and the National Party and the people of regional Victoria. Born in Tasmania and moving to a farm near Melbourne when he was four years old, Jim was a keen student at Caulfield Grammar, before running the family farm while his older brothers served in World War II. It was during this time, when his father served in the Victorian parliament, that Jim became active in the Australian Country Party, which ultimately led to his nomination in 1964 to fill a casual vacancy of the Senate.During his political career, among Jims most significant achievements include his work for the environment and for Australias Antarctic research efforts, establishing the national maritime science research centre in Hobart and the CSIROs Australian Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong. Another tremendous achievement that Jim secured was his work in ending pirate whaling. He was instrumental in introducing the Indian Ocean Whale Sanctuary.Jims service to Australia did not end with his time in the Senate. After his resignation in 1980 followed his appointment as Australias High Commissioner to New Zealand, a position he held for four years, before returning to farming in his home state of Victoria.On behalf of the National Party family and this entire House, we extend our sincere condolences to Jims loved ones, his four sons and four grandchildren, and express our heartfelt gratitude for his tireless service to Australia.

152,0,1,0,0,1,"Butler, Mark Christopher MP","HWK","Hindmarsh","ALP","N/A",713," I thank the member for Macnamara for his question. I know hes been closely engaged with his community about the impact of the global outbreak of monkeypox here in Australia, and hes closely engaged with me as well.Its only been 13 weeks since the first case of monkeypox outside the endemic countries in Africa, which have experienced that virus for many years, was notified in the UK. In that time more than 25,000 cases have been reported across 76 different countries outside of Africa, countries that have not experienced monkeypox before. More than 6,000 cases have been reported in the US, almost 3,000 in the UK and more than 4,000 in Spain.This is a self-limiting illness that is usually mild to moderate, but over the past week or so we have started to see reports of deaths not only in the endemic African countries. There were also four deaths in countries that have not experienced monkeypox before. Since the first case was reported here in Australia on 19 May, 58 cases have been reported in Australia. On the day after that first report, 20 May, the Department of Health and Aged Care began negotiations with Bavarian Nordic, the company that manufactures the new third-generation vaccine for monkeypox. Since that time, there have been 27 meetings with that company in a very competitive, highly constrained global market, and Im pleased to announce that we have secured the supply of 450,000 doses of this new state-of-the-art vaccine for Australia. That will provide not just pre-exposure protection, as a vaccine would be expected to do, but also post-exposure treatment for people who have contracted the virus.Well be rolling out that vaccine through state and territory clinics, and I thank the states and territories for their very constructive engagement over recent weeks. Weve also been working over recent weeks to increase clinical awareness and clinical capability to identify, isolate and treat cases as quickly as possible.I want to mention community engagement, though, because the member for Macamara has been very focused on this. Its important to say that any person can contract monkeypox, but across the world it has particularly affected gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, so weve been closely engaged with organisations like AFAO, the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations, and the clinicians at ASHM, leveraging their networks and the capability that theyve built up over the last four decades to make sure that communities across Australia have maximum awareness and are able to take up the opportunities that weve been able to secure over the course of this week.","Monkeypox","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[4]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BUTLER (Hindmarsh—Minister for Health and Aged Care and Deputy Leader of the House) ","(14:19):"

As she alluded to in her question, the governments priority is to make sure that multinational corporations pay a fairer share of tax where they make their profits. What I hope to do in the next day or two is to release the discussion paper, which is the consultation that we committed to when it comes to the implementation of the multinational tax policies that we took to the election. They are our priority, and they will, hopefully, be implemented as we described them in the election campaign. If that consultation process brings to our attention some issues around the implementation of that promise, then obviously we will take that seriously.In addition to that, as the member is no doubt aware, there is a big agenda around multinational taxes from the OECD, which the Americans and others have been leading. When I was with the governor of the Reserve Bank at the G20 meetings in Indonesia, one of the topics of conversation with Secretary Janet Yellen and others was about how the world can work together on the two pillars of the OECD agenda to try and make sure that we fix this problem in the global economy, and certainly in our economy, where its too easy for multinational corporations to move their debt, or move their profits, around the world in a way that sells countries short and makes it harder for us to fund the things that we really care about, like healthcare, education and all of those federal government programs that we need to fund in the context of all of our other budget constraints. Once again—a bit like the answer to the question from another colleague in the House earlier this week, if not last week—we dont intend to go down the path that you are asking us about, but we do intend to take meaningful action on multinational tax.","Taxation","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[5]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr CHALMERS (Rankin—Treasurer) ","(14:22):"

Before the parliament returns for the next sittings of this place, on 1 September and 2 September the Albanese Labor government will be hosting a Jobs and Skills Summit here in Canberra. This is our opportunity to bring Australians together to address the big challenges that we confront in our economy, whether it be labour shortages or skills shortages or stagnant wages. Its our opportunity to work together to create more opportunities for more people in more parts of our country.On this side of the House we recognise that a better future relies on bringing people together. So bringing people together isnt just the aim and the guiding instinct of the Jobs and Skills Summit, it is also the aim and the guiding instinct of this government and of the Australian people that we serve. We want to ensure that there is a good, qualified worker for every business that needs one and a great, well-paid, secure job for every Australian that wants one. We want a bigger, more productive and better skilled workforce with strong and sustainable wages growth as a defining feature of our national economic success. Thats why the summit will bring together workers and their unions, employers and their peak organisations, community groups, experts and other levels of government as well. And its why this month there will be proper consultation, whether it is by portfolio or in different communities around Australia, as we conduct some genuine consultation in the lead up to the Jobs and Skills Summit. I will be doing some of that in Central Queensland next week. There is a hunger in this country for a real talk about our economic challenges, there is an appetite to work together to address them and there is a willingness in this country right now at this moment to see things through the prism of our national economic interest.It is time for those opposite to decide whether they want to be part of the solution here or whether they want to continue to be part of the problem.

The CFMMEU has given over $10 million to the Labor Party since the last watchdog was abolished. Is the Prime Minister aware of the case of a female operations manager being targeted and verbally abused to the extent that she cried, felt fearful and ill? Why does the Prime Minister keep dismissing this issue when the welfare of 150,000 women working in the construction sector is at stake?","Workplace Relations","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[7]/question/talk.text/body/p","Dr WEBSTER (Mallee) ","(14:29):"
163,0,1,0,0,1,"Albanese, Anthony MP","R36","Grayndler","ALP","N/A",714," I thank the member for Mallee for her question. As Ive said repeatedly, behaviour such as that which she has described is completely unacceptable. Thats why the Fair Work Ombudsman will be responsible, along with Fair Work Australia, for ensuring that industrial relations law is appropriately applied to any union or any employer. Its as simple as that.My principle is also that all workers should be subject to the same laws and regulations as others. Its not a radical proposition that were putting forward here. Our workplace relations system must be based upon fairness, mutual trust, respect and obeying the rule of law. Thats our position. Its as simple as that. What we have from the ABCC, though, is that theres substantial commentary about how it was supposed to have improved the way that the sector might operate. Wed expect, during the period the ABCC was the regulator, for there to be improvements in labour productivity in the construction sector. You would expect that to be the case. But, if you look at the facts, in 2017-18 productivity was down by 2.4 per cent; in 2018-19 it was down by 2.6 per cent; in 2019-20 it was down by 2.6 per cent also. The ABCC is supposed to be improving the way that the sector operates, and yet we have labour productivity going down year after year after year.You would expect, also, the issue of construction costs to be there. The construction costs of the last five years in the heavy and civil engineering sector have risen by up to 20 per cent. Of course, if you look at the total expenditure on the ABCC, since it was established—from 2016 up to this year—its total budget is some $233 million. This year alone, it was some $34 million. During that period, the ABCC boss, Nigel Hadgkiss, had to resign in 2017 because he was caught breaching the Fair Work Act himself. So we take a very clear view, which is: bad behaviour is unacceptable, full stop, of either employers or employees. Bad behaviour is unacceptable. All workers should be subject to the same laws and regulations as others.","Workplace Relations","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[7]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Prime Minister) ","(14:29):"

I know she joins with me in our advocacy for getting cracking on aged-care reform in the House this week.You only get one bill to be the very first bill to go through the new parliament, and that bill, for the Albanese Labor government, was aged-care reform. Thats how seriously we take it. We have now delivered 17 royal commission recommendations in just our first 100 days, compared to only nine royal commission recommendations that the Morrison government achieved in 17 months. We have, therefore, endorsements from the Council on the Ageing, who said:These bills are crucial steps in a reform process that, when fully implemented, will ensure Australia will finally enjoy the quality aged care system all older Australians deserve.The HSU said:For the first time there is a crack of light at the end of the tunnel.Catholic Health Australia said that the bills really fire the starting gun on reform. The Older Persons Advocacy Network said that the bills represent a watershed moment for older people and their families. Opal HealthCare said they were delighted to see the new bill will enshrine mandated standards.The most important endorsement of all is from the people who care for our older Australians. We are joined in the gallery today by Tara—you guys are going to make me cry again!—who works in residential aged care in Jimboomba and cares for Maxine and for Sylvia. Conwell joins us from Thursday Island. He works in the only residential aged-care facility on Thursday Island. Marina has joined us. She supports older generations in Perth, and she says that she wants more transparency and accountability and that the actions she saw in the House this week, for the very first time, gave her hope.

We are going to do better by you than you ever received under nine years of neglect by the previous Morrison government. You were the focus of our first bill through the House.

The member for Macquarie knows all too well the benefits of action on climate change and I thank the member for friendship and her very, very strong climate advocacy. The passage of the Albanese governments climate bill through the House today—89 votes to 55—represents the will of the parliament and the will of the people. The Australian people voted for action on climate change and today the Albanese government delivered action on climate change. Today represents the opportunity for the parliament to stop arguing about whether to reduce emissions and to start working together on how to reduce emissions. That is what happens today.There has been broad support for the passage of the Albanese governments reforms through parliament in the lead-up to today and in the last few hours. Weve seen the Business Council of Australia say:The nation cant afford to go back to the future, we must move forward now to secure a frontier economy powered by affordable, reliable, secure and low emissions energy.43 per cent is a sensible, achievable target which can be delivered alongside new industries and better jobs with coordinated action.Thats just a representative statement of the views of the business community. Unsurprising, perhaps, because from opposition we worked with the business community on our climate change policies because we want to work in partnership with people of goodwill in this parliament and beyond the parliament to get emissions down and to get jobs up. Thats our plan: to get emissions down and jobs up.The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have said:This is a missed opportunity for the opposition. The announcement today demonstrates that the climate wars are over. This must act as a moment of unity of purpose.We agree with Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Some in this House think they know more about business than the Business Council and more about commerce than the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. But we dont know on this side of the House and nor do members of the crossbench, because today, 89 votes to 55, the Australian parliament spoke the will of the people. But we know the work does not end today. The work begins today. Now we have to rewire our nation. Now we have to ensure that our biggest emitters reduce their emissions through the safeguard mechanism. Now we have to develop a national electric vehicle strategy and thats exactly what we will do. Now we will roll out 400 community batteries across our country. Now we will roll out solar banks across our country. Thats what this government will do. Today does not mark the end of the work. Today, the work just gets started. We are just starting the work that the Australian people elected us to do.","Climate Change","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[10]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BOWEN (McMahon—Minister for Climate Change and Energy) ","(14:41):"

222,0,1,0,0,1,"OConnor, Brendan Patrick John MP","00AN3","Gorton","ALP","N/A",718," I thank the member for her question and her keen interest and advocacy in tackling skills shortages in this country. Given the sheer scale of this challenge, the government has hit the ground running on this very important issue. Now, it is true to say that we didnt just inherit a massive fiscal debt; we also inherited a massive shortage when it comes to skills in the labour market. Thats the reality, and, for that reason, we need to do everything we possibly can to address this problem, because, over the last decade, there has been a mismatch between investment in skills and the skills that are in demand.So theres a lot of work to be done by this government, because, whether you look at the aged-care sector or disability care, you see skill shortages. Whether you look at advanced manufacturing or the tech industry, or hospitality, tourism and retail, there are skill shortages. There are skill shortages in the traditional trades and in personal care services. There are even shortages amongst the teachers and trainers that are needed to equip the workforce with the skills that are in demand. For that reason, we need to get on with this very quickly.Thats why, as the Treasurer said earlier in question time, were convening the Jobs and Skills Summit, bringing together businesses large and small, unions, training providers, state and territory governments and other experts to drive this agenda and make sure we work together to deal with this problem, this shortage—in many sectors of the economy its a crisis—thats actually being experienced in those areas. Its also why weve committed to 465,000 fee-free TAFE places. We want to put TAFE back at the centre of the VET sector in this country, finally. That is absolutely an important vehicle to bring about change.This government understands that, for Australia to succeed and for us to maintain and improve living standards, we need to have a skilled workforce. A skilled workforce is a productive workforce. A productive workforce means a stronger economy, and it means cheaper goods and services. But, as a Labor government, we also understand this: training working people means that this provides them with the dignity and, indeed, the sense of fulfilment of having a good job, because, if you train workers in areas of demand, you provide security of employment for those workers; you provide career progression. So its not just important for our economy. Its not just important for businesses in this country. It is critical for workers, who deserve a decent go and deserve secure work.","Employment","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[12]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr OCONNOR (Gorton—Minister for Skills and Training) ","(14:49):"

Just last week, we had a very constructive one-on-one meeting about how the government can assist people in the Fowler electorate, around the Liverpool area in south-west Sydney, an area that Im very familiar with. The member is quite right to point to the socioeconomic disadvantage thats there in Fowler. It has a much higher proportion of new migrants to Australia than is the average across the country. In particular, many newer groups have gone to south-west Sydney to settle and to make Australia their home.Over a period of time, what I know is that communities like the Vietnamese community in Fowler—just like the one in Marrickville in my electorate, where I recall the member for Fowler living some years ago when we first met—have proven to be a great success. But newer communities, such as the Syrian community—people whove fled war-torn Syria in recent times—of course require additional support, and my government is very conscious of that.Thats one of the reasons why Ive encouraged the member to engage in the Jobs and Skills Summit process, to have a local forum, and Ive offered the governments support to provide advice and speakers—to provide the full force of government to have local forums. That is on offer to anyone around this chamber as well. What we need to do is to work with the local business community, TAFE and the three levels of government. Today at the national cabinet I discussed with Premier Perrottet, along with other premiers, how we can make sure that, arising out of that, we give Australians more opportunities for jobs through better TAFE funding, better training and making sure that we identify those opportunities which are there.One of the things we know is that long-term unemployment can be a scourge. In particular, Im aware that in south-west Sydney there are large pockets of housing estates where disadvantage is entrenched. When I was asked a question the other day about social housing, I spoke about the need to have a mix of housing as well. I have raised with state premiers, as well as with local government, how we get better investment, as part of this governments commitment to our Housing Australia Future Fund and other investment vehicles, to get increased support for a mix of housing so that you dont have people growing up in communities where they cant see people that they can aspire to be one day.I thank the member for Fowler very much for her question. I look forward to working constructively with her, and I thank her for her engagement with the government up to this point.

237,0,1,0,0,1,"Burke, Tony MP","DYW","Watson","ALP","N/A",719," I thank the member for Lyons for asking an excellent question. Its fair to say that I like this parliament better—significantly better. One of the things that Ill say weve had, particularly if you look at the debate that happened this morning, is: how long is it in this parliament since weve had a situation where the crossbench move an amendment, the minister listens to the speech and the parliament then makes a decision based on the debate? For nine years the debate didnt even occur. For nine years the amendments werent even allowed to be moved. And today what I saw in the parliament was a situation, finally, where different members of parliament—regardless of where they are in the chamber—brought forward their ideas, the debate mattered for the outcomes, and the parliament voted. I note there were no amendments from those opposite—no amendments from those opposite at all. As well as there being no amendments, even when they were voting no, there was not even any enthusiasm. It was not even as if they wanted to be here. But the procedures that have allowed us to be able to do this have changed whats possible in the parliament.First of all, Ill pay credit. From the 35 new members, we have had 24 first speeches now, from members on this side, that side and the crossbench. It is good to have those first speeches so early in the new parliament. But what we have also achieved, against those opposite saying it would be the end of democracy, are new procedures which have allowed people to debate.

Those opposite keep repeating the same acts over and over again, which are to stand here and just give working Australians a reminder that theyve never seen a union they didnt want to undermine and that theyve never seen industry super funds that they didnt want to get rid of and undermine and weaken. That is why, when they came to office, they had a royal commission into superannuation. What that found, indeed, was that industry super funds perform much better than the retail funds and that industry super funds, which those opposite have played with over and over again—the increases that were there for the super guarantee up to 12 per cent theyve undermined, consistently, the whole way through.

We have hit the ground running. This is a government that promised not to waste a day, and were certainly not doing that. Our government has had a real impact on peoples lives, whether it be the minimum wage increase, whether it be dealing with floods or whether it be delivering antivirals and fourth shots around the country. Our plans are to build the foundations of a better future: 43 per cent reduction in our emissions, which is about creating economic opportunity; jobs and skills, with the Jobs and Skills Australia legislation, which is up, and the Jobs and Skills Summit, where well get business, unions and civil society together to talk about how we advance; aged care, where weve already passed legislation where weve stood up for the workers—who we see today in the gallery—who need a pay increase; and rebuilding relationships around the world, making us stronger at home but making us stand on our own two feet and be secure in the world.Its not just what we do; its how we do it. How you do it is: bringing people together by being more inclusive, something that those opposite never sought to do. They were always looking for division. We look for unity. We look for that sense of purpose and our common interests, such as working with business, unions and civil society on climate change, finding strength in our common purpose. Good government changed my life, and good government helps people put a roof over their head. Good government supports young people who want to learn a trade or get a degree. A good government ensures older Australians can live out their later years with dignity and respect. A good government creates opportunities for families to get ahead. A good government gets wages rising. A good government boosts productivity. A good government makes it possible for Australia to make things here again. And a good government uplifts the whole nation by advancing the interests of the nation by recognising that our history did not begin in 1788 and by recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our national birth certificate, our Constitution.Together on economic policy, on social policy, on environmental policy, we will build a better future. We will form alliances and work with all people of goodwill, and that is what we saw when the parliament passed our climate legislation bill this morning.

Jess Stenson triumphed in the womens marathon but soon after embraced her teammates and fellow mums Eloise Wellings and Sinead Diver to share the moment with them. In the T53/54 wheelchair marathon, Maddie de Rozario triumphed again. Ariarne Titmus won gold and set a games record in the 400-metre freestyle. She won the treble—200, 400 and 800. Sprinter Evan OHanlon claimed the Australian athletics teams 200th Commonwealth Games gold medal, winning the mens T37/T38 100-metre sprint. Our oldest team member, 63-year-old lawn bowler Cheryl Lindfield, at her first Commonwealth Games, won the silver medal in the para-pairs B6-B8 with partner Serena Bonnell. The mens wheelchair basketball team won gold in the 3x3. Nina Kennedy cleared 4.6 metres to win gold in the womens pole vault. The womens rugby sevens team claimed their first ever Commonwealth Games gold medal, defeating Fiji 22-12. Paralympic swimmer Ellie Cole finished fifth in Birmingham, in her very last event before retirement—a true champion.In coming days we look forward to the Diamonds, our women cricketers and Peter Bol in the 800-metre final.

But having 46 gold and a total of 123 medals so far is a great credit not just to the athletes but to the trainers and to their family members—all of those back here and those who have been able to travel—who have sacrificed an enormous amount, including the sacrifice that the parents made during the athletes childhood in turning up to training regularly. It is a credit to the coaches and to all of those that have provided sponsorship. It is an incredible accomplishment not just personally but for those who love and surround those athletes.I want to acknowledge the top four Australian individual medal winners being women, the rugby sevens win and the Australian womens cricket, netball and hockey teams, to name a few still in the medal hunt. It shows the strength of womens sport here in Australia.I want to say thank you very much to all of those who are glued to their TVs, providing encouragement and sending messages.

286,0,0,0,1,1,"OBrien, Ted MP",138932,"Fairfax","LNP","N/A",737," In December last year—it was the Friday after the last sitting day—the now Prime Minister and his now Minister for Climate Change and Energy had all the theatrics set in place, and they made this extraordinary announcement to the Australian people of their climate change policy if they were to win government. That climate change policy consisted not of one but of two targets. One target was a 43 per cent reduction in emissions. The other target was a $275 reduction in power bills. Two numbers: 43 and 275.In this sitting, the first sitting of the parliament, the government had the opportunity to put its policy into a bill. Both these numbers did not appeared. Forty-three and 275—guess which of these wasnt in there? Was it the 43 or the 275?An opposition member: I think we know.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TED OBRIEN (Fairfax) ","(15:21):"

This represents the first broken promise of the Albanese Labor government.This is the first promise, and they didnt waste their time. They made sure they broke their first promise in their first sitting of parliament, a promise that goes to the heart of every living room across Australia. Every single household is copping higher power bills. Every single household knows very well that they have a new government in town that went to the people making a promise of cutting power bills, and every time they open up their power bills from now on, they will be reminded that this Albanese Labor government made them a promise that their power bills would go down and not up. This is a broken promise.What I find extraordinary is that, despite having broken a promise to the Australian people so blatantly, despite having the Prime Minister and the minister in this place over the last two weeks confirming they have abandoned this promise to the Australian people, the Australian Labor Partys official website still claims they will deliver on that promise. Still to this day today, the Australian Labor Party are untruthfully claiming to the Australian public and to Australian businesses that they will cut their power bills.You can look it up right now. Thats what the Labor Party promises, still to this day, but the Prime Minister and the minister have refused in this place, in this chamber, to confirm thats what theyre going to do. But we know theyre going to abandon that promise. When they made the promise in the first place—and weve heard it from the Prime Minister already in this sitting—it was the most comprehensive economic modelling apparently ever done by any opposition. Thats their claim. The $275 was based on the most comprehensive economic modelling ever done in the history, since Australian Federation, of any opposition. They are already walking away from it.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

291,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation",138932,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr TED OBRIEN: The ministers own departments website—they know. I dont know if theyve told the minister, but they know the truth. This government, although it was elected with the promise of delivering a cut in power prices, has abandoned it, and the ministers own department knows it. Thats why you do not find that $275 promise on the departments website, but the Labor Partys fine with still promoting it. Thats the game they play. Thats what they do.Can we go back to the most comprehensive economic modelling ever done since Federation? I almost said muddling. It would have been an interesting pun. The $275 in the spreadsheet that was done for the modelling—listen, Labor guys, who are trying to ignore it because its really important for you to know this, colleagues—drives an assumption of 306,000 jobs. For those on the Labor benches, who do not know their own policy: in addition to making other promises, they had promised 604,000 new jobs as a result of their climate change policy. Of those, 306,000 jobs—in other words, well over half of the jobs that they have promised through their climate change policy—are predicated on the cheap power prices that they have now abandoned.So theyve abandoned the power prices, and theyve cut, by over half, the number of jobs they claimed that that would deliver. This is despite the Prime Minister standing here in this sitting period, saying, Oh, we stand by the modelling. The Prime Minister stands by the modelling, but can he confirm that he will deliver on the promise of a $275 cut in power prices? He cant answer it. He abandoned the promise. He abandoned the promise of power prices, and he is abandoning the promise of jobs. They go hand in hand, based on the very modelling that the Labor Party claims is the most comprehensive in the history of our nation.One of the reasons that prices are skyrocketing at the moment, and they have been since this government was elected, is the lack of gas being poured into the Australian market.As soon as the minister was appointed to his role, we in the opposition, in the coalition, were very clear in saying: Power prices are going up. You need more gas in the system. Please, minister, call an emergency meeting of gas CEOs. Get them around the table and put pressure on them. If need be, threaten to use the gas trigger, otherwise known as the ADGSM. Guess what he did: absolutely nothing. Instead of calling a meeting with gas CEOs, do you know who he wanted to meet with? Other politicians around the country. A great, big, fat lot of good that did, didnt it—a whole bunch of politicians coming in a room, from states and territories, umming and ah-ing. Guess what tangible activity came out of that: nothing, not one thing. It took two months until, only days ago, the ACCC tabled a report that said, Guess what: you need to pour more gas into the market. Two months it took until the new resources minister said: You know what? Maybe we should start threatening to use that gas trigger after all. It took two months of absolute inaction.This is why the Australian people, unfortunately, can have no confidence that the Labor government will deliver on its $275 promise, because its inaction in the domestic market will make it absolutely impossible. This is the first broken promise of the Albanese Labor government.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[11]","N/A","N/A"

294,0,0,0,1,1,"Conroy, Pat MP",249127,"Shortland","ALP","N/A",738," At the outset, Ill make it clear that Ill only be speaking for seven minutes, to allow three divisions to get done before adjournment. I want to make that clear to the House. Labor speakers, government speakers, will similarly be curtailed for the good operation of the House.Let me start by repeating what the Prime Minister has said repeatedly over the last few days: we stand by our policy commitments, including to make power bills cheaper by increasing renewable energy in the system. We stand by our policies, and those policies are part of our broader climate and energy policy package.The rank hypocrisy of a political party in putting forward this MPI on a day when the climate bills passed through the House of Representatives just demonstrates how irrelevant they are over there. On a historic day, when every member of this chamber—except for the Liberal and National parties—was relevant, participated in the debate, made speeches, moved amendments and contributed to helping end the climate wars, those on the other side were stuck on repeat. They were stuck on Groundhog Day and stuck on perpetuating the climate wars. In the end, what those opposite did was vote against cheaper power prices. Those opposite voted against cheaper power prices through their actions today.Thats not a surprise. You only have to look at their record in government. Whenever there was an opportunity to push power prices up, those opposite took it through their 22 energy policies—and I sadly dont have time to repeat all of them. We had the clean energy target. We had the emissions intensity policy, which lasted for 12 hours. Josh Frydenberg got up in the morning and said, Lets have an emissions intensity policy. By the afternoon, hed abandoned it. We had NEG 1, NEG 2 and NEG 3; we had UNGI; and we had my favourite—the big stick. It was so effective!What was the member for Humes last act as energy minister? What was the member for Humes last, pathetic, desperate act in the last days of a tawdry, sordid nine-year-old government? It was to change the law to hide an almost 20 per cent increase in power prices. Its not a surprise and is entirely characteristic of a man of that sort. Its not a surprise, because in 2019 the member for Hume, the current shadow Treasurer—well see how long he lasts in that role; if he keeps accepting the questions his tactics committee give him, I dont think hes going to last too long—promised that, by the end of 2021, wholesale energy prices would be $70. Well, wholesale energy prices averaged $106 by the end of 2021. Guess what they were in the month of May. Were they $70? No. Were they even $100? Had he managed to keep them stable? No. They were $341 a megawatt hour. He managed to triple it, which is pretty good given his performance in other parts of his portfolio!This is only one small part of his and that horrible, neglectful, decadent governments history. We saw four gigawatts of energy leave the system with only one gigawatt coming in. We saw Snowy Hydro 2.0. We had Malcolm Turnbulls leather jacket moment followed up by the member for Hume, who couldnt answer a question in this House on energy without referencing his relatives, who actually made a contribution. I will pay respect to his relatives who built something at the Snowy Hydro, unlike the member for Hume. And we had $1 billion to support 3,800 megawatts of new power generation, where not one dollar was delivered and not one watt was delivered. Thats a great contribution! The other side are great at wasting money, but they couldnt get the money out the door. Thats how incompetent the last government were on energy policy.Now, theyre trying to wipe away the record—apply a bit of Mr Sheen to their record to wipe it away, wipe it away with a bit of spit and polish, a bit of Mr Sheen. The truth is they lost the election. They had their heartland wiped out. They lost their blue ribbon seats because of their obsession with the climate wars, with 22 energy policies and now theyre trying to wipe it out. But, now, theyre starting to think about their future. When you have just been wiped out, when you have lost your heartland, when you start thinking about the future, who do you consult? Are there some young dynamos in their party room who will drive this? Is there an energy minister about to leave parliament? Who do you get to talk about the future for the Liberal Party? John Howard.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CONROY (Shortland—Minister for Defence Industry and Minister for International Development and the Pacific) ","(15:31):"

Whenever they get in trouble, they grip it and the member for Fairfax is obsessed with it. He loves it. Hes obsessed with it. What does it mean for power prices? Well, the CSIRO came out with their power price research. They found that firmed-up renewables are $46 a megawatt hour and coal is $141 a megawatt hour. If this is their grand plan, if this is their policy, if this is their vision to get relevant again, youd think nuclear power might be cheaper than renewable energy and it might be under $41.

298,0,0,0,1,1,"McIntosh, Melissa MP",281513,"Lindsay","LP","N/A",739," The Australian people deserve honesty from their Prime Minister. Before the election, the Prime Minister repeated his promise to cut electricity bills by $275 on no fewer than 15 occasions. Labor were elected on this promise to the Australian people. It was very clear. This was the Prime Ministers commitment to Australia before the election. What has happened since the election? I will tell you what has happened: the lights have gone out on the Prime Ministers commitment. In fact, do members of this House know how many times the Prime Minister has repeated this commitment since the election? Zero. The Prime Minister has not mentioned it once. In fact, he seems to be more concerned about playing politics than honouring his commitment to ease cost of living pressures for Australians. Weve asked him every single day in question time, multiple times, if he is going to deliver on his commitment to the Australian people, but he has shown us very clearly that he has abandoned Australians. Much like their commitment to have a plan to tackle the cost of living, to get wages moving, to back industry and to make more things in Australia, this promise to reduce power prices is no longer. So ashamed are the government of their inability to deliver for the Australian people that they now just want us to forget. But families and businesses in my electorate of Lindsay arent going to forget. Families who are dreading the next power bill arent going to forget. Small businesses fighting rising costs arent going to forget.ABS data shows electricity prices increased on average by 12.9 per cent when Labor was last in government compared to just 0.3 per cent during the last coalition government. Weve spent the best part of the last two days debating climate legislation that isnt necessary, that is simply an exercise so the Prime Minister and his government can gloat and parade around as though they have delivered meaningful results for Australians. I know one thing for sure: the coalition between Labor and the Greens on climate change will not lower power prices. It will not see a reduction in household power bills. It will only drive up the costs as the government becomes beholden to the Greens radical climate agenda.This broken promise from the Prime Minister, though, shouldnt surprise us. After all, this is a Prime Minister who did not know the cash rate, didnt know the unemployment rate, didnt know Australias borders were open and didnt know his own NDIS policy. If he didnt know these important bits of information, how could anyone expect him to know how to honour a commitment to reduce power prices?In June, the Leader of the House told Sky News:Were behind the modelling that was there and the impact of what were going to do, particularly through transmission that allows you to get cheaper energy on the grid.I wonder if the member still stands by that statement today. In that same week, the Prime Minister was asked by the Weekend Australian whether the power bill cut was out the window. His response was to say:… we are dealing with a circumstance which is a direct result of a failure to give business the certainty that they needed to invest.This is a Prime Minister who always blames everyone else.Meanwhile, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy is more interested in standing at the dispatch box and trialling his stand-up comedy routine than delivering power price reductions for struggling Australian families. The people of Australia are not interested in this governments jokes. It is fast becoming obvious that this government doesnt have a plan beyond empty, hollow campaign announcements.We have a message for the Prime Minister: government is all about making tough decisions in tough circumstances and delivering what you have promised to the Australian people. The Prime Minister said its the job of a Prime Minister to deal with the challenges that Australia faces and not to constantly blame someone else. Well, its time, Prime Minister. Its time that you fess up to the Australian people, take responsibility and deliver those cuts in power prices that you promised during the election.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs McINTOSH (Lindsay) ","(15:38):"

What a missed opportunity this MPI is. On a day when something historic has happened, when this parliament has come together and said, You know what—we do give a stuff about the future and we do care about what we leave for our kids and our grandkids, we have an MPI that has no substance whatsoever. Im going to work through a couple of the elements of it.I am disappointed in the member for Lindsay, someone who I know values the Blue Mountains World Heritage area, that she would say that we have spent this week debating legislation that isnt necessary. People who live in the electorate of Macquarie, the neighbouring electorate, and those who live on the extended part of the river—we share rivers, the member for Lindsay and I—think this legislation is necessary because it actually has the potential to change the future of our region in a positive way.Rather than talking about claims that there are broken promises—and Ill come to that, because there are definitely no broken promises—what I think we could have used this for is to stop arguing about whether or not we need action on climate change and to have an adult debate about the way forward. Lets talk about the different options that we now have with our commitment to a 43 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030 and look at how we get there. I know I should not have expected an adult debate from those on the other side. Weve never seen one in the six years Ive been here, and, clearly, nothing is going to change, even though theyre now on the other side, so I mourn the missed opportunity.Im in awe of the Minister for International Development and the Pacific. He can remember more of the energy policies of those opposite than I possibly can. We have an absolute conviction in our commitment to make power bills cheaper, and Im just going to give you a really simple lesson. The more energy at a cheaper price we can get into the grid—which we will rewire so it actually can get from where its generated to where it needs to go—is going to be the thing that is real gold for energy prices, for manufacturers who need reliable energy at a cheaper price, for households and for small businesses. Its really simple maths, and Im disappointed, given the intellectual firepower opposite me, that those opposite have not been able to do the maths and work it out.But its not going to happen in nine weeks, and lets be clear about that, so Im very pleased to say: watch this space. We will keep our commitments because we know that renewable energy is going to be better for our entire economy.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) ","(15:43):"
300,0,0,0,1,1,"Pearce, Gavin MP",282306,"Braddon","LP","N/A",740," For three years, the effects of the COVID pandemic have changed our lives, challenged our livelihoods and taken an unspeakable toll on all our loved ones and families. Today we still live through these challenging times. Theyre far from over, and what most Australians continue to feel is pain. The challenges havent simply snuck up on us. They havent jumped out in the dark overnight. Hopefully, one thing that all politicians in this nation and in this place can agree on is that we continue to face significant obstacles preventing us from resuming our treasured way of life.In the lead-up to the May election, it was very clear to me that the most significant challenge in my electorate would be felt very long after the election was over, and that was, of course, the cost of living. Without a doubt, the cost of living for families and businesses is the No. 1 grassroots issue that is being talked about, and electors ring me every day in order to discuss it. Its what they talk about in normal conversation. Its what they talk about in the crib rooms right across the electorate of Braddon, and Im very sure that, in that way, Braddon is very similar to other rural and regional electorates right across the nation.Whoever won government during that election knew that managing the impact of the rising cost of living was their major and immediate challenge. When I enter the Albanese governments address, issues and answers to the cost of living crisis into any search engine, all I get is a lot of data from prior to the election. But since the election it has been radio silence. Since the election there has been very little. Alarmingly, if I search the governments pledge to cut power bills by $275, which would be a normal thing to search for, it seems that all indications are that the government is now backtracking. It is crab-walking away from this important responsibility. Instead, the measurable promise of cutting power bills by $275 by 2025 seems to have been replaced by a general statement that the government has a policy of doing what they can to assist cost of living pressures—what they can.I come from an electorate of real people, practical people—small-business owners, sole traders, partnerships—people who work hard every day. They get up at four oclock in the morning to milk the cows. They work all night to get the crops in ahead of the rain. Theyve taken a risk. Theyve borrowed money. Theyve employed people every day in their business. These are the people who dont discuss where the next wind farms going or what pronoun theyre going to use today. Today theyre talking about how theyre going to pay their power bill, which is increasing; how theyre going to find that extra money; what theyre going to cut out of the grocery bill in order to meet the rising costs of living and the rising interest rate; how theyre going to put clothes on the backs of their kids as they go into their winter uniform; and how their little boy is going to get his new shoes so that he can go to school. These are the questions that burn in the minds of my electorate. These are the questions that they raise with me every day.Obviously, when they raise these questions, they expect a response back. Theyve learnt that over the term that I have been their representative. When I give them an undertaking to get back to them, thats exactly what I do: I get back to them. Im as good as my word, and I put it to this government that it needs to do the same. Take a leaf out of that book. If you promise the Australian people a reduction of $275 off their power bill, that is exactly what you should do, or you should explain why youre not going to do it rather than crab-walking and backing away into a tiny corner. Otherwise, rather than calling the government full of policy, electorates like mine will call the government something else: they will assume that you are full of—empty promises. The creation of 604,000 jobs, with five out of six of those new jobs being created in the regions, is a mammoth task, and we will wait and see whether this is just going to be another empty promise that will just continue to fail—","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PE ARCE (Braddon) ","(15:46):"

I guess we could forgive them for being simplistic creatures and getting hung up on this one little detail of what is a very comprehensive plan, because they are a group of politicians who dont realise that a comprehensive plan lasts for more than 10 weeks or for more than two days.If they were worth their salt and had actually read the plan that Labor took to the last election and that were now implementing—the Powering Australia plan—they would know that how we get to the money that Australians will get back on their power bills is by implementing the plan. We need to rewire the nation. We need to build more renewable energy. We need to build community batteries. We need to work with local and state governments, with ourselves and with industry. We need to work with all the community and business stakeholders that have come on board to back our plan to get our energy grid. We need to transition it to a grid that actually helps people power themselves. We are coming from a place of neglect where the previous government did nothing. In fact, they actually did worse than nothing. Environmental vandalism is what they did—the way in which they destroyed our energy security in this country. So I guess we should be a little bit forgiving of the fact that they are stuck on one sentence.Australians, I can tell you, have a lot more faith in their government. They know its going to take a lot of work to rebuild our grid. The previous government failed to do things like build the interconnector in Kerang in regional Victoria, which would allow all those renewable solar energy projects around Mildura and the north-west to be built—investment waiting to happen that didnt happen because of the previous governments complete inaction. Instead they were talking about the never-never of nuclear power. Instead they were talking about funding the building of coal-fired power stations. Thats how out of date the previous government were.We know and the Australian people know that through the action weve already taken and the work weve already started—building renewable energy projects that are in the pipeline and rewiring the grid—energy bills will be cheaper, and Australians will celebrate that day. But were in a dark place right now because of the inability of the previous government to do anything. At the end of the day maybe its because they are really upset about the results of the last election. It has been 10 weeks. They should know, because in 10 years they failed to do anything, that it actually takes more than 10 weeks to build an interconnector in Kerang. It takes more than 10 weeks to reverse the damage of a decade. That is the reality of where were at. We will have cheaper bills. Maybe theyve just played this hand a little bit too soon, because it has been only 10 weeks since the election.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CHESTERS (Bendigo) ","(15:51):"
304,0,0,0,1,1,"Willcox, Andrew MP",286535,"Dawson","LNP","N/A",741," I rise to speak about a matter of public importance, the rising cost of living and Labors scuttling of its own promise to cut power bills by $275. During the election campaign Mr Albanese visited my electorate of Dawson, in January this year, where he told local media outlets that Labors emissions plan would see a reduction in power bills, on average, of $275 by 2025.Labor says it was elected on a promise to create jobs, cut power bills and reduce emissions. We all know what has happened to the second part of that promise. The commitment to cut power bills is dead in the water. There is a gaping hole in the Climate Change Bill—no mention of power prices. The Prime Minister has sat on the commitment he made in my Mackay electorate in January for six months knowing that he could not keep it.It gets worse. Labor made this commitment to the electricity consumers 15 times before election day. The Prime Minister finally confirmed he could not keep his promise in his first question time, making it clear to all Australians that this government cannot be trusted. The Albanese government is more committed to playing politics than easing the cost-of-living pressures on Australians. It goes downhill from there.The concessions this government has made to the Greens will be ruinous for the economy. At the time of rising inflation, rising interest rates and rising living costs Labors restrictions on the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, Export Finance Australia and Infrastructure Australia will make it hard, if not impossible, for these agencies to recommend or provide finance and insurance projects in the energy, resources and agricultural sectors.This is on top of the governments decision to back-pedal on its ill-advised move to scrap the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia. You know that the decision is wrong. The resources that come out of the north are the lifeblood of the Australian economy. How is this government going to fund the roads and infrastructure if it keeps squeezing the life out of the north and denying it funding for energy, resource and agriculture products that are so vital for our export earnings? This will also deny finance to provide important regional infrastructure projects, upgrades to the freight corridors. Ports and gas pipelines will have to go begging because they wont be able to get finance. The Prime Minister promised he would not ban coal and gas projects, but that is exactly what hes doing by denying them finance. A ban by stealth is still a ban.The Prime Minister is selling out Australians in regional areas, like my electorate of Dawson. Investment in jobs will simply disappear. We have already seen power prices in the National Electricity Market more than double, and in some cases triple, compared to the same time last year. On top of that, we have a Treasurer who admits life is going to get harder and more expensive, but Australians will just have to grin and bear it. If Australians think the cost of living is high now, wait until we have a government that cannot afford to pay its bills, because it is cutting off the flow of money from the north. And when it runs out Labor will just go back to its tired old playbook: raising taxes.Unlike the coalition, this government has no plan to address rising cost-of-living pressures for the 3½ million families that have a mortgage. Our record speaks for itself. Emissions have fallen by more than 20 per cent since 2005, while our economy grew by 45 per cent. We beat our Kyoto target by 459 million tonnes.

You arent responsible for the trillion dollars of debt or the failure to establish an energy plan in any shape or form, but youve joined the mob that were, so try and get them on board, because the future of the north, which were a part of, is pretty vital. The renewable energy future is really important for the north. I wasnt going to mention this, because Ive got limited time, but those opposite deceived the Australian people prior to the election, and that was absolutely unforgivable.

I want to reflect on how important the passing of our legislation today was for my constituents. The Northern Territory is one of the hottest parts of Australia. Darwin is certainly the hottest city.

Climate change is critical everywhere, but an increase in temperature will be felt acutely by us and many that live across northern Australia. Im committed to doing my part, as part of our great government, to make sure that we are able to adapt to climate change and to maximise renewables in our system. This government is going to get on with it. Weve committed to a 43 per cent reduction by 2030 and weve committed to being carbon neutral by 2050. We cant have a continuation of the ideology we had from those opposite. Its just not going to get us anywhere, so get with the program. You are on the wrong side of history.I just want to give those opposite a bit of an idea. I went to Queensland recently and visited Barcaldine. In Barcaldine, the home of the Labor Party, where it all started, there is the Barcaldine renewable energy zone, BREZ. I recommend you go and have a look at it.

The government stands by its commitment to make power bills cheaper because we have a plan to make it happen, but Rome wasnt built in a day; we have to first deal with the 10 years of the coalitions inaction on climate change, a decade of chaos and failed policies.Today we began the march to change. Today in the chamber we passed the first real climate change bill in many, many years. Its the first step to implementing the Albanese governments mandate to take real and meaningful action to address climate change right now.The facts are clear. Cleaner energy is cheaper energy and everyone knows that, except perhaps those sitting opposite. The CSIRO and the Australian Energy Marketer Operators GenCost report recently released confirms wind and solar are the cheapest source of electricity generation and storage in Australia. The Albanese government knows that solar and wind are cheaper. We also know that our Powering Australia policy will see renewable energy rise to make up 82 per cent of the natural energy market by 2030. Powering Australia will deliver 604,000 jobs across our nation. The government is also investing $20 billion in upgrading the electricity grid to allow more renewables into the system to bring costs down.Australia has the highest uptake in the world of home solar but just one in 60 households have battery storage, because of the upfront costs. Up to 100,000 Australian households across the nation will benefit from those 400 community batteries, including one in Corangamite in my electorate. Community batteries offer better economies of scale than household batteries, with lower capital, installation and maintenance costs. These are just some of the mechanisms the Albanese government will use to bring down energy costs. But, unlike the previous government, we will ensure that the Australian consumer will always come first.The Albanese government supports work to prevent anticompetitive behaviour in the market being undertaken by the Australian Energy Regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Energy Market Operator. By contrast, under the previous government, we had nine years of wasted opportunities, denial and delay; nine years of stop-start energy policies, with 22 energy policies abandoned; nine years of hearing from some of those opposite that climate change is not even real. We saw a government attempt to abolish and then water down the Renewable Energy Target.The previous government constantly undermined both the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. They demonised renewable energy and disparaged large-scale battery storage as being as effective as the big prawn. Who can forget when the previous Prime Minister said electric vehicles would end the weekend? We saw the previous government dragged kicking and screaming to net zero by 2050. We even know that the previous government changed the law to hide recent energy price increases of up to 19 per cent from the Australian public before the last election.By contrast, Australia now has a government with the right policies to put downward pressure on energy prices, to make energy bills cheaper and to honour its commitment to all Australians.The DEPUTY SPEAKER: There being no further speakers, the debate has concluded.","Cost of Living","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms COKER (Corangamite) ","(16:09):"

If this bill doesnt pass through the House, theyll incur a tax liability, and nobody on this side of the House wants that to occur.The bill comes back to us in substantially the same form as it was presented to the House by the government, with one amendment, which Ill explain to members of the House now. It removes a longstanding exemption in our corporations laws which has existed since 1995 that exempts certain large private companies that existed prior to 1995 from public disclosure of an audited annual report to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the provision of tax data to the Australian tax office, which could then be made public.During question time a number of questions were asked of the Prime Minister and the government which went to the importance of transparency in corporate affairs. Id expect, given the tenor of those questions, that members of the coalition will rise and support the government in removing these exemptions from corporations and taxation law. They go to the heart of transparency. They ensure that all large private companies are treated in exactly the same way. They must present to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission an audited copy of an annual report, and they must provide certain information to the tax commissioner, which would be treated in the same way as any other private companys tax information. These are simple, straightforward amendments. They werent in the governments original bill but they are, word for word, a reflection of amendments that Labor moved in opposition on numerous occasions.I want to pay tribute to the work for the member for Fenner, now the assistant minister to the Treasurer, for the tireless work that he has put into ensuring that these issues were a part of public consciousness and public debate here.

The amendments moved in the Senate by the Greens, which were not part of the original bill—lets be very clear—and which were accepted by the government, do increase red tape and compliance burden in the economy and for private companies. These are not public companies; they are private companies. It removes the regulatory certainty thats been there—which is something that those opposite ask for all the time—for a limited class of companies, and it constrains the ability for ASIC to make instruments to implement its regulatory decisions.The other effect of this amendment is to increase red tape for Australian owned companies over their foreign owned competitors. This will mean Australian companies are put in a position where they are less competitive than their foreign competitors, at a time when we need Australian companies to be as competitive as they possibly can in a brutal international and global environment. Many of these businesses know how difficult it is to compete globally and win. And winning is what we want Australian companies to do, because that creates jobs and drives investment and drives opportunity. That, of course, is the key to Australians realising their aspirations: Australian world-beaters out there on the world stage without absolutely unnecessary red tape and compliance being imposed on them.The opposition supports reducing red tape for compliance.

319,0,0,0,1,1,"Stevens, James MP",176304,"Sturt","LP","N/A",747," It continues to be a concerning development of the Labor Party, walking away from a commitment that they made in the election to my constituents of Sturt and to all the people of Australia to reduce electricity prices by $275 a year. In question time, when this was repeatedly asked of the Prime Minister and other ministers, none of them committed to stand by that figure, but many of them suggested that we look at the policy they took to the election—Powering Australia. I thought Id take the opportunity to re-read it and have a look at some of the things they claimed in that. It reminded me of some of the peculiar elements within that policy and how they suggest that they are going to achieve this $275 reduction. One in particular is this Rewiring the Nation fund that theyre creating—a $20 billion fund, according to the fairly scant detail in their policy document—that they say is going to contribute towards reducing electricity prices for Australian consumers. I really do struggle to understand how that is at all possible.Lets think about the fundamentals of how transmission works in the National Electricity Market, which Paul Keating established—lets not forget—in the early 1990s. When that market was established, we moved to a situation where consumers met the cost of every component of electricity. So, instead of the previous situations, where state and territory governments would build generation, transmission, distribution et cetera and then they would charge households—at times, political considerations would be taken into account there, and perhaps the correct market rate wasnt charged, because, for a political reason, a government didnt want to necessarily appropriately pass on electricity costs—Keating established the National Energy Market. That included, on the generation side, having a market and, on the transmission side—where you cant have a market—having a regulated asset. That was because you cant have different transmission companies competing with each other to transfer electrons from one point to the other. Youve got to have a monopoly market, because you could never seriously replicate those assets that you only need one unit of. Therefore you have a regulated asset base.The regulated asset base means that that is independently valued. In my home state, ESCOSA—the Essential Services Commission of South Australia—determine what the return should be on the value of an asset which is in a monopoly market, like transmission assets are. Owners of those assets need to achieve a fair rate of return, so ESCOSA might say: If your asset is worth this amount of money, this is the return that you should get on that. You also get a reasonable cost that you can charge for your transmission. In the case of transmission, as were discussing here, you can add that in there, and that is passed on together through that determination to the consumer—that is, the electricity consumers.The simple reality is that if Labor are proposing to increase the value by putting another $20 billion of transmission into the total transmission network then the charge for transmission will have to increase to the consumer. Thats just a mathematical reality that is impossible to refute. They are talking, in fact, of this unleashing $70-odd billion of additional transmission. Again, that is putting $70 billion of extra recoverable charges into the marketplace through transmission charges. Danny Price, from Frontier Economics, whos very highly respected by the Labor Party as an energy economist—hes someone the South Australian Labor government use regularly to undertake modelling and analysis of some of their policies—made this point very simply in April when the policy was being debated during the election campaign. It is simply impossible that, if youre putting $20 billion worth of additional transmission assets into the system, that is not going to increase the transmission charges to consumers by whatever the determined return on that asset is by the independent regulator. Its impossible for anything but that to occur.This is one of the many significant flaws in Labors policy, and its why we will not see them stand by that $275 figure and say it—the Prime Minister or ministers in this place. But I tell you what: when you go to an election and you tell the Australian people that youre going to do something, and that turns out to be a lie, and, instead of power bills going down by $275, it is very likely that they will increase, then the Australian people will mete out a very tough punishment to the Labor Party for that lie.

320,0,0,0,1,1,"Murphy, Peta MP",133646,"Dunkley","ALP","N/A",748," Ive spoken in this parliament a number of times about the concept of a wellbeing budget and why governments delivering wellbeing budgets is a progressive step not just in measuring GDP and economic growth but in measuring what matters. Some of this comes from a quote that Ive used before, from Senator Robert F Kennedy way back in 1968:… the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.If we, as parliamentarians, are going to be part of trying to bring in policies that make life worthwhile, then we need to be able to judge, to measure, whether in fact thats whats occurring. Its why I am so pleased that Treasurer Chalmers has announced that his first budget, coming up in October, will include a new wellbeing statement. It will be aimed at measuring how Australians, how we all, are faring in our daily lives so we can better inform policy development and pursue growth, but pursue the right sort of growth, pursue economic growth that takes everyone with it, economic growth that reduces inequality, doesnt expand it.As the Treasurer has said, Australians should judge policies against agreed markers of progress. That begins with measuring what matters—not instead of traditional economic indicators but in addition to them. GDP is important to measure, but measure what matters to peoples daily lives—the impact of that GDP growth or otherwise—as well. So Im very much looking forward to hearing the Treasurer deliver budget statement No. 4, which is going to be dedicated to a broad-ranging discussion of our options, drawing on best practice from around the world as the basis of our engagement and further development.In Australia we used to be world leaders at measuring indicators of wellbeing, but we arent anymore. Weve been overtaken by New Zealand, by France, by many of the countries in the OECD. The UN has the Sustainable Development Goals. It is an important and worthy activity to engage in to say: We are going to look at what matters: mental health; child poverty; inequalities faced by our First Nations people; how the reforms and innovations of a digital age can be spread more evenly across regions and cities—people from advantaged backgrounds, people from disadvantaged backgrounds; how we are going in transitioning to a low-carbon economy; how our environment is faring. We talk about the importance of all these things in a policy sense, but we dont do enough at the moment to hold ourselves to targets and measure our process in a transparent way and a way that this parliament can be involved in.I want to congratulate the Treasurer for moving us in that direction. He knows this, but I remind him of how interested I am in being part of that development. I was going to talk about local sporting champions, but Ive used up almost all of my time. Thank you, Speaker, and see you next time parliament sits.","Wellbeing Budgets","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MURPHY (Dunkley) ","(16:36):"
321,0,0,0,1,1,"Tink, Kylea MP",300124,"North Sydney","IND","N/A",749," I rise today to speak about how the deteriorating health of Australias environment, due to the pressures of climate change, habitat loss, invasive species and pollution, is impacting my electorate of North Sydney. The North Sydney area has always been seen as the green belt around the CBD and Sydney Harbour, but the grim reality is that our green spaces are shrinking, not only across my electorate but right across the state.TheState of the environment report published in 2021, but only released by the new environment minister last month, was a shocking read. It provided a long list of animal and plant species in decline, habitat destruction and clearing, introduced species thriving and diseases and invasive pests wreaking havoc on our land. The report is clear: our climate is changing. Were experiencing more extreme high temperatures, more bushfires and more intense rain events. Sea temperatures are also continuing to rise. Each of these factors in turn affects the liveability of our cities.Adding to the changing climate, most major Australian cities are growing at a faster rate than other developed cities. This is driving increased urban heat, congestion, pollution and waste, with each in turn impacting our urban areas and biodiversity, green and blue spaces alike. A tree canopy cover of at least 30 per cent in a neighbourhood is needed to provide benefits such as urban cooling and resilience to heat waves, yet more than half of Sydneys councils have lost urban forest cover since 2013. The resilience and sustainability of the places we live in are being challenged.To effectively respond to these challenges, it will be critical for all three levels of government to collaborate and take a holistic nationwide approach to developing resilient frameworks that not only sustain our cities but regenerate them. In my electorate of North Sydney, there are three major infrastructure projects for which we are not seeing effective, modern, resilient planning responses. They are the upgrade to the Warringah Freeway, the Western Harbour Tunnel and the Beaches Link. We must not take these projects individually but look at them together and understand their cumulative impacts.The North Sydney community has been largely ignored in a rushed consultation process, and our residents are going to lose out. From the outset, these projects have been yet another example of short-term thinking, using infrastructure approaches from the 1960s to plan for tomorrow. Frustratingly, North Sydney will pay the price, with more traffic congestion on our streets, more air pollution around our schools, a loss of more than 3½ thousand trees, mangroves and sea grasses and the loss of 15,000 square metres of green space from our parks and reserves like Cammeray Park and Flat Rock Gully.The Warringah Freeway upgrade is already underway, but, on behalf of my community, I call for the two tunnel projects to be suspended until the community can be sure that all viable alternatives have been explored and the potential impacts of these projects, as they currently exist, are mitigated. We know we need solutions. We just wonder whether weve found the right ones. To this point, I wish to thank those in this space, particularly Minister Gallagher and Minister King and their teams, for confirming that there is currently no federal funding allocated for the Western Harbour Tunnel. The absence of such funding, I would suggest, further challenges the very basis of the project.There are also a myriad of local developments, which constituents have raised with me, that will also have a negative impact on our green canopy and our natural and cultural heritage. For example, my community is opposed to Transport for NSWs proposed linear cycle ramp on the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The ramp would have a serious and deleterious effect on the national heritage value of the bridge and its curtilages, as well as the trees and green spaces in Bradfield Park North. There is an alternative solution supported by North Sydney Council, the community and many organisations, if only the levels of government involved would listen to the community.Plans are infinitely adaptable where political and community will align. It is time we start approaching major infrastructure projects like these differently, with transparency, true community consultation, sustainability and integrity at the heart of them. These are the remedies that North Sydney is seeking, and I look forward to seeing the response from the government, the environment and this parliament. We must, and we can, do better for our environment.","Environment","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TINK (North Sydney) ","(16:40):"

323,0,0,0,1,1,"Gillespie, David MP",72184,"Lyne","NATS","N/A",750," Saving the best till last—or almost last! I wish to alert the House and the nation to the nature of our electricity system and the alarming nature of the growing problems it has, particularly with the transmission and distribution system which is colloquially known as the grid.We have had built in this country a series of world-class grids, built by state governments around the country. On the east coast theyve all been joined up by interconnectors and operate in a so-called market, which is actually more like a racket—a series of rules and regulations to favour variable renewable energy at the cost of an almost universally available and cheap electricity.Increasing amounts of variable renewable energy, which by its very nature is not generated in a synchronous AC manner, is creating huge problems for the grid. If we keep going hell for leather on introducing more and more variable renewable energy with this consequent loss of system inertia, which is a very important physical capability, we will destroy our grid. All grids around the world operate on alternating current and are running at certain voltages and frequencies depending on where you are in the grid, either in the high transmission or the local distribution network. The magic number is 50 hertz, and it has to work at that frequency. With variable sources of energy, if theyre coming from photovoltaics, theyre converted from direct current into alternating current, and there is no inertia with that.So the whole premise of our transition to the brave new world is actually full of a lot of major, serious electrical physics problems. We will have increasing instability in our grid, even though on paper the numbers theoretically add up. But that is because people are confused—and I fear there are a lot of bankers and bodies whove invested in this. They equate the nameplate capacity of a variable renewable setup with the actual energy delivered, whether its a wind farm, a solar farm or someones rooftop.Installed capacity is not what is delivered. It depends on how much of it is available over time. For solar energy, on average—even in Australia—its available about 22 per cent of the time. For wind, offshore wind is probably better, at closer to 35 per cent, while onshore wind is about 30 per cent. Thats on average, but there are huge periods of our calendar year where those figures are actually four per cent. Thats why, on average, on some beautiful, sunny, perfectly windy days it might be 50 or 60 per cent. Some days you can have a sweet spot, and the whole bang lot in a little state like South Australia, which only needs about 1,900 megawatts, can boast: Wow! Were 100 per cent renewable! Yes, but electricity systems run 24 hours a day, seven days a week.I might mention the cost. The member for Sturt mentioned it. The whole premise of the Integrated System Plan that AEMO has released relies on huge, vast overbuilds of grids going everywhere, as well as huge investment in grid-style batteries and everyone else getting batteries. But we are already seeing the voltage in the system. Its not advertised, but instead of our traditional 240-volt system its often running on 220 volts. If we keep going at this rate, we will imminently have major city blackouts like South Australia did.The International Energy Agency has documented this. Im not making this up. They have an integrated system plan and they say that once you get above 10 per cent variables you will run into problems. They say its almost impossible to maintain it regularly once youre above 30 per cent. So weve got non-generating condensers, big, huge bits of kit that are trying to mimic the effect of electrical generators coming from traditional base-load plants.This story that variable renewable energy is the cheapest—as a standalone entity, yes, but the whole system doesnt just come from a standalone; it comes via a grid. Grid costs are going through the roof, stability is going down, and we are headed for a major calamity.","Energy","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr GILLESPIE (Lyne) ","(16:48):"

We currently have so many cases being treated in hospital by incredible teams of health workers supported by incredible ancillary staff. Its important to note that statistics have names and faces. Each death is a beloved family member no longer at the dinner table. Each patient is a human being struggling for oxygen. Each healthcare worker is an exhausted nurse or blistered cleaner working on the front line.Were yet to see the impacts of long COVID, a potentially debilitating condition which follows the acute or early phase of COVID infection. Symptoms have been shortness of breath, fatigue, fever, headaches and brain fog. Theres a fear amongst many professionals that our health, welfare and disability services are underprepared to support the growing number of Australians with long COVID. This is a challenge recently acknowledged by the Minister for Health and Aged Care, and I welcome his commitment to seek advice from the experts to address long-term impacts of this virus.There are five key requirements at a national level that have been recognised by the University of Sydney. The first is surveillance for long COVID to track rates, symptoms, and impact on work and quality of life over time. The second is to provide better support and resources for GPs to treat long COVID in primary care. The third is more specialists for long COVID clinics for those with more complex problems. The fourth is disability supports for people whose problems have become long lasting. The fifth is research to understand long COVID.A division having been called in the House of Representatives—Sitting suspended from 10 : 04 to 12:47","COVID-19","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"
330,0,0,0,1,2,"Elliot, Justine MP","DZW","Richmond","ALP","N/A",753," Today I rise to speak on the Albanese Labor governments decisive action on climate change. Our country needs desperate action, and finally we have a government thats acting. The climate wars are over. The decade of inaction is over. Our country needs this, both environmentally and economically, to drive the jobs of the future, to bring down power prices and to make our country a renewable energy superpower.The risk of climate change is real, the science of climate change is real and the impact of climate change is real. My community on the New South Wales North Coast understands this, because we have been living it with the devastating floods that hit our region. The floods destroyed lives, livelihoods and homes. Local economies were devastated and communities heartbroken. So many people are still very traumatised following these horrific floods. We understand how real the need to take action is, because we are living it. We are living it in terms of the climate emergency. The Prime Minister made it very clear yesterday that, after a decade of inaction, the climate wars are over. Of course, the Labor governments climate bill has just passed the lower house today.To the people of Richmond: you elected me to be your strong voice in a majority Labor government and deliver action on climate change, and we are delivering on that mandate with a plan that will reduce emissions by 43 per cent by 2030, reduce power prices, get us to net zero by 2050 and create 600,000 new jobs, with half a million of those in the regions. This is a plan supported both by business groups and by environmental groups. This plan gives us the economic certainty that our economy needs. Id like to acknowledge all those groups in my region that have worked so hard on this issue for so many years.Weve had a wasted decade of denial and inaction. At the last election, people in my electorate voted overwhelmingly for this to end. They voted for a strong government with a focus on a better future for all. They voted for a government that takes climate change seriously. They rejected all of those years of inaction by the Liberals and Nationals, who had 22 plans and didnt actually do anything. And what has been their response now? Theyre just pushing nuclear power. Yet again, they are pushing nuclear power, with the Leader of the Opposition announcing a review into nuclear power. The fact is that nuclear power plants can be dangerous and expensive and, of course, they use too much water and need to be located near water. I always stand with my community in firm opposition to nuclear power, and I will keep fighting this. We need investment in renewables, not nuclear. Only a Labor majority government could deliver on this vital economic and environmental reform, which our country needs—acting on climate change and ending the climate wars.","Climate Change","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ELLIOT (Richmond—Assistant Minister for Social Services and Assistant Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence) ","(12:47):"

He was the Chief Executive Officer of the Bushland Health Group, and he has retired after 43 years of service. Denis has overseen a massive transformation in the Bushland Health Group, a community not-for-profit organisation that delivers a broad range of services, including aged care, home care, disability care and retirement living. Denis began his career with the main roads department in 1969. Ten years later, he then went on to complete his uni studies in health administration, working in the public hospital system as an administrator, before moving back to Taree to take up an administrator role with the new Bushland Health Group, which was known as Manning Valley Senior Citizens Homes back in 1979.Working with the board of directors, Denis has shown outstanding leadership. When you look at what he has accomplished in his time as CEO, its second to none. From that small group, they went on to run a private hospital for a long while, but theyve also developed residential aged-care facilities at Banyula Lodge, Alkira Lodge and Karingal Gardens and retirement living facilities at Jacaranda Avenue, Jarrah Place, Warrana Place, Parklands and Bushland Place. I am very proud to say they are also at the forefront of delivering a massive project on the banks of the Manning River.As the federal member, I worked with the Bushland Health Group to get a federal government grant to support the headworks—like roads, traffic lights and sewerage—for the Figtrees on the Manning project, which Bushland Health Group is delivering. It will enable subsequent further sites for Bushland Health Group to deliver retirement living complexes. Its just down the road from the Karingal Gardens residential aged-care facility. The absolute economic boost to the Manning Valley will be huge because, following them, other owners of land in that area will invest up to $500 million—thats in 2011 dollars, when this was first proposed—for more residential and commercial development in that space.Denis, from all of us who know the work youve done in the Manning Valley for residential aged care and for general support of the community: what a fantastic career! Well done! We all salute you and your family. Enjoy your retirement.","Hawkins, Mr Denis, OAM","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr GILLESPIE (Lyne) ","(12:51):"

334,0,0,0,1,2,"Young, Terry MP",201906,"Longman","LNP","N/A",754," Its an honour to be back. Thank you to the people of Longman for putting your faith in me to represent you in federal parliament. Thank you to all the people who helped in my campaign, in whatever capacity that was. Thank you for standing in the rain and putting up with the horrendous behaviour and the lies being told by the unions and some of the volunteers of other parties. Thank you for sticking to our values and not stooping to their level, and for behaving in a manner that Im proud of. Thank you to my family for the sacrifices they made during the campaign.When I first came to this place, I was determined to be a different politician. I wanted to be someone who didnt make it personal, to be someone who stuck to policy, and to be someone who focused on the needs of their community and did their best to meet those needs. I said then that, if I were to win, I wanted to win by talking things up, not by tearing other people down. Many told me I couldnt win with a positive campaign and by not bagging other people, but here I am. Im proud to say that we ran a local campaign that didnt tear down opponents—a campaign that just contrasted the differences between the different parties, policies and results. I stuck to what we had delivered for the people of Longman and what my vision and plan for our community is. All I can promise you is more of the same.There are so many issues and changes Ill be pushing for in this next term. The one I want to speak on today is integrity and honesty in political advertising—particularly during campaigns, when many people are more politically engaged than they normally are. I know it would surprise many in this House that many Australians just get on with their lives and dont give a second thought to politics until elections roll around.I find it incredible that private businesses have to ensure truth in advertising, and yet political parties and politicians dont. In my retail background, if we advertised a product that was on sale and had been reduced in price, we had to substantiate the original price or there would be consequences—and rightly so. Surely the leaders of our country should be setting the example when it comes to honesty, integrity and respect.To me, any proposed advertising, marketing or statements made by parties should have to be fact-checked, and, if they are found to be false or misleading, then the perpetrators of the falsehood should be forced to retract them and apologise and should face substantial fines and other consequences. When casting a vote, the Australian people deserve to be able to make a decision based on facts, not on fairytales and lies.Here are some examples of these lies that were told in the last campaign in my electorate of Longman. We had one candidate saying they were going to keep interest rates below three per cent for five years, which, of course, no government can guarantee. We had several candidates and parties saying at a federal election that there would be no more vaccine mandates—there are no federal mandates, only state mandates—which is misleading and preys on peoples emotions. We had one candidate and party saying that the coalition was going to implement the cashless debit card for age pensioners, which is a straight-out lie and caused stress and angst for our most vulnerable, all to try and win votes. Its simply disgusting.Then there was the practice of making election promises on things that I had already announced as decisions of government. I speak of the $5 million for the Caboolture PCYC, which I announced in January this year as funded and done; the veteran wellbeing centre, which I announced in April this year; and the change to the DPA status so that medical practices in Longman could recruit more GPs, which I announced I had already achieved in January and March. These were already happening. These were budget decisions of the previous coalition government, and yet this party and candidate tried to again mislead the people of Longman by making out they were going to deliver these things if they were elected.That dishonest behaviour had no consequences. Something must change in this area. The Australian people expect it and deserve it. In closing, I say to the people of Longman and Australia: I will continue to be your voice on issues that matter to you. I will endeavour to act with honesty, integrity and respect when representing you, and I will continue to talk up our great community, and country, as long as I have the honour of doing so.","Federal Election","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr YOU NG (Longman) ","(12:54):"
335,0,0,0,1,2,"Reid, Gordon MP",300126,"Robertson","ALP","N/A",755," I rise in the chamber today to discuss an issue that is deeply affecting the residents of Robertson. However, this issue is absolutely not limited to Robertson; it is felt right across the country. This is not a new or recently emerging issue. This is an issue which affects us all, no matter your age, gender, ethnicity, income or postcode. This is an issue that affects peoples lives each and every day. This issue is access to a general practitioner, or GP.Time and time again in the emergency department, I saw countless patients presenting throughout the day or in the middle of the night—both adults and children—as they were unable to access a GP. Chronic illnesses like hypertension—high blood pressure—or hypercholesterolaemia—high blood cholesterol—are spiralling out of control and resulting in extreme consequences, like acute myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents, more commonly known as heart attack and stroke. Diabetic patients have blood sugar levels spiralling out of control, resulting in significant micro- and macrovascular complications like retinopathy and nephropathy. All this is due to the inability to access a GP for ongoing management.When I talk to the people of my electorate of Robertson on the phone, when I knock on doors and when I attend street stalls, one of the major issues raised is access to health care—in particular, access to a GP. The role that general practitioners undertake is vital. They provide holistic preventive care, ensuring patients do not deteriorate and end up needing critical intervention, such as the emergency department. Preventive medicine through general practice is an essential part of our healthcare system that must be supported. Preventive medicine eases the burden on our hospitals. Preventive medicine is preventive.The inability to access a GP should not be an issue within this country, yet, sadly, it has been for quite some time, without any action being taken to rectify this escalating crisis—until now. Just weeks into the term of our new government, weve hit the ground running. We have—together with the Minister for Health and Aged Care and the members for Shortland and Dobell—announced that the entire Central Coast region will be classified as an area with a shortage of medical practitioners, known as a distribution priority area, or DPA. This classification opens the available pool of doctors able to come to our region, improving access to health care for all. Labor recognises the need to improve access to health care, as, without this vital access, we fail to manage the health of our community and the financial burden on our economy escalates dramatically.From my time in the emergency department, I clearly recall a particular patient who could not have made any clearer to me the consequences—both health and economic consequences—of failed access to primary care. Although I will always recall this patient as such a strong example of these consequences, she represents just one of the vast number of patients who presented each shift with an unnecessary deterioration of their overall health. This patient—a kind, friendly 67-year-old woman—had a urinary tract infection. At first she experienced only mild symptoms and sought the services of a GP for basic investigations and the likely prescription of oral antibiotics. Had she been able to access this time- and cost-effective service, her infection would likely have resolved quickly. However, she was not able to book a GP appointment for nearly three weeks, due to service availability. While she waited for her appointment, her symptoms worsened significantly and her infection became systemic, resulting in sepsis. She was rushed to the emergency department by ambulance, critically unwell. Not only did she now require the services of an ambulance and her local emergency department; she required a bed in a ward and the intensive care unit, with intensive nursing care, extensive monitoring and extensive follow-up from additional services. Unfortunately, each service—each bed in a ward—comes with a heavy price tag. How is this an effective way to manage our communitys health?Members of our community should not have to schedule to be sick. Thats why Labor is making it easier to access a doctor in my home electorate of Robertson, with the establishment of an urgent care clinic. Thats why were cutting the cost of medications and expanding access to the Commonwealth seniors healthcare card.","Medical Workforce","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr REID (Robertson) ","(12:59):"
336,0,0,0,1,2,"Spender, Allegra MP",286042,"Wentworth","IND","N/A",756," I want to talk in this time about the youth of Wentworth and some of the issues that the youth of Wentworth are facing. There are three issues that I would like to touch on, the first being public education, the second being youth mental health and the third being housing. I speak of these issues because these were the issues that were raised most often with me by parents as well as young people in Wentworth. These are some of the most crucial issues that young people face—except climate change, in relation to which, Im very delighted to say, Australia has taken a very positive step forward this morning in this parliament.Let me start with public education. I spent the last four years of my career working with over 200 public high schools and 40 businesses, helping young people to be prepared for the world of work, by bringing together students from education and people from business. These are wonderful schools, but you wont really find them in Wentworth, because Wentworth has only one public high school. Despite having a population of over 120,000, Wentworth has only one public high school and very limited public education choices at the high school level. That doesnt represent the desire of the Wentworth constituents. There is a high degree of public education at the primary school level, but the dearth of opportunities in public education at the high school level means that Wentworth as a community is no longer really engaging with public education at the high school level.I think this is a significant issue, because the community of Wentworth wants educational choice. We have the most expensive schools in the country. The average year 12 fees for a private school in Wentworth are around $35,000 a year, which is out of reach for so many families. But, because theres only one public high school in the area, there is not really that education choice.The second piece that I want to talk to is youth mental health. Again, this is a significant issue for the community of Wentworth. When I was campaigning, a young man whom I remember very vividly came to talk to me. He asked me, What are you doing for young men? I said that I think youth mental health is probably one of the biggest issues that young people—young men, in particular—face. Tears came into his eyes, and he shared his own experience: that two of his friends had committed suicide the previous year and that he himself that day was actually on his way to get some help for his own mental health. That is one of the images from the campaign that has stuck the most in my mind. I will forever remember that young man, and I will also remember those many other people I met during the campaign.Doing some further analysis on this, and talking to experts in the area, such as Professor Hickie, I see that there is an opportunity to do more in youth mental health, particularly in a community like Wentworth. This is not just about spending more money but also about doing government better. That is what Im seeking to represent in my role in the parliament—that its not always just spending more money that achieves better outcomes. Certainly that is part of it, but its actually about getting the states and the federal government working together and truly mapping where the gaps are in mental health and where this community can be better served. Im really pleased to note that Wentworth has its own Lifeline opening up this month. Thats going to give an opportunity for Wentworth volunteers to come and support young and old in mental health. I really want to congratulate Lifeline Australia and also Daisy Turnbull, who have stood up for this and are pushing it forward.The last issue I want to raise is housing, because that is the other key issue that people raise with me in relation to young people. Parents raise it with me. They say, I dont know how my children are ever going to be able to afford a house. I acknowledge what the government is doing in this space, but I think we are fundamentally missing some key actions around housing supply and around stamp duty reform. If you look at Australias housing, we have only 400 dwellings per 1,000 people. That puts us among the lowest in the OECD. House prices went up by 140 per cent between 1990 and 2015, and the housing stock is just not increasing with our population; over that period, it just flattened. So I will be urging the government and working, in my position as a member of parliament, to seek some remedy such that we can address housing for our youth in the long term.","Wentworth Electorate: Schools, Mental Health, Home Ownership","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SPENDER (Wentworth) ","(13:04):"
337,0,0,0,1,2,"Templeman, Susan MP",181810,"Macquarie","ALP","N/A",757," I may have been here in parliament for our first sittings, but my thoughts have not been very far from the flood affected Hawkesbury residents, where anxiety about another flood is very high. And, understandably, with more rain forecast and the declaration of the Indian Ocean Dipole by the Bureau of Meteorology, people who are now facing a big job repairing, cleaning up and rebuilding after the July flood now feel overwhelmed and a bit in limbo because of these forecasts. But of course it isnt a given that a flood will occur. What should be happening, though, is there should be action being taken by the New South Wales government. They should be doing everything that they possibly can right now to mitigate the risk of flood, and that includes drawing down the Warragamba Dam to reduce the level, which has stayed close to a hundred per cent for weeks, if not months. People are understandably asking the question: Why wont the new South Wales government just act? Its hard to fathom the deaf ear that these calls are falling on. Again, I plead with the New South Wales Premier: Please listen to my community.We know you cant stop floods, but we also know that the conditions right now are unlike anything in memory—the soggy soils with very little ability to absorb local falls and the heavy rain forecast to fall somewhere in the coming months. I congratulate the New South Wales opposition leader, Chris Minns, and his shadow ministers Rose Jackson and Jihad Dib, who came and met with Pitt Town residents, because they are willing to act. Theyre also willing to look at improving the evacuation routes that places like Pitt Town so desperately need. Unfortunately, we cant wait for a New South Wales Labor government for this to happen. We really need the current New South Wales government to act on these measures. Lowering the level of the water in the existing dam, using the resources that we have right now, would allow for a buffer, and it must be something that the New South Wales government tries. If it doesnt, should we see more heavy rains, I fear the New South Wales government will find the anger in the community towards them will be almost uncontrollable.While people are worrying about the future, though, theyre also dealing with the past, and that means the clean-up and recovery. Three new grants have been made available, and theres been good collaboration between the New South Wales government and our federal government in the last few weeks. There are three new grants, including a grant for renters of 16 weeks of support, because we know you dont get back home in a matter of a fortnight. Theres a new grant for rural landholders of up to $25,000 for those who are not eligible for the other funding—the primary producers grant or the small business grant. Theres also, just announced, the homeowners grant of up to $25,000 for people who need to do things to get back home. I know that theres more to do, but these are fast actions to try and make the recovery from this disaster as quick and as painless as it can be. We know there is much more that needs to be done, and Ill continue to advocate for those things.One of the really significant pieces of legislation that we passed in this sitting fortnight has been around aged care. This is an issue very close to my heart and to my communitys. I want to talk through what those changes will mean. Theres more to do. Were not finished with aged-care reforms. Weve really only got started. One of the changes that weve made will lead to a more equitable funding approach, which means it will better match the providers costs in delivering care to residents than the previous governments regime did. This is going to make a difference to aged-care providers in my community.What well also be expecting, and well be starting to see later this year, is the publishing of star ratings for all residential aged-care facilities. That will be in place by the end of this year. It will put a spotlight on the sector and it will allow people to actually compare the quality and the safety performance. It will no longer just be gossip and word of mouth; people will be able to actually go and see the data. The legislation also includes measures to extend the serious incident response scheme to in-home care providers. I see this as a really significant start to the many issues that we face in fixing home care, which is such an important part of our aged-care services. All of this means greater transparency and is a really significant step forward for aged care.","Macquarie Electorate: Floods, Aged Care","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) ","(13:09):"
338,0,0,0,1,2,"Rae, Sam MP",300122,"Hawke","ALP","N/A",758," Deputy Speaker Chesters, Ill begin by commending you on the admirable balancing of your role as representative for the people of Bendigo with your amazing parenting craft. I think it was clear to the House this morning that I have much to learn from your example!I rise to speak on the very important matter of safety in the road transport industry. Road transport is Australias deadliest industry. We see and hear the tragic stories all too often. Back in 2008, the National Transport Commission found that low rates of pay for heavy vehicle drivers were linked to dangerous road safety outcomes for those drivers, the workers across the industry, and the community more broadly. In response, the then Labor government established the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal to secure minimum pay rates for these workers and lift safety standards across the industry. However, in 2016, the then coalition government abolished the tribunal entirely. Tragically, in the six years since, over 1,000 people have lost their lives in truck crashes across the country, including 259 truck drivers.In terms of the relevance to my electorate of Hawke, the folks of Hawke have been severely impacted by these tragic losses. Those opposite spent their decade in government letting Australian workers down across all industries. We wont waste a single moment. We wont waste the opportunity to stand up for these workers and ensure that all workplaces across Australia are safe for these workers.Roads are the workplace of so many Australians, particularly those in Hawke. Thats why Im absolutely committed to supporting the Transport Workers Unions struggle for safe rates and better conditions for every transport worker in this country. Last week I met with a delegation from the TWU, including TWU Victoria/Tasmania Branch Secretary Mike McNess and Assistant Secretary Mem Suleyman, to discuss their campaign, and I was extremely proud to sign on to the safe rate pledge.Our road transport workers are the backbone of our nations supply chains. We found that during COVID. Supporting our transport industry by paying our truck drivers fairly means safer and more secure work conditions for those workers and safer roads for our community. Pressure on our nations truck drivers has real-life consequences, and those consequences, as we know, can be disastrous. The industry is marked by alarming rates of death, injury and chronic health conditions, as well as wage theft and pressure upon workers to work under dangerous conditions.Road transport workers, alongside all other workers, deserve the right to go home to their families at the end of the day. That is why it is so important that our government works with industry and its members to establish a clear path to safer roads. Safe rates are the key to achieving that. We need to look vertically to the wealthy clients who are squeezing supply chains from the top. The demand for low-cost transport contracts forces operators to slash rates to remain competitive, compromising the safe working conditions of those Australians who keep our nations supply chains in operation.We need to work alongside the Transport Workers Union to facilitate constructive collaboration between industry, clients and the workforce. We need to empower the Fair Work Commission to set minimum rates and standards for all workers engaged in employee-like work, including transport workers. This protects workers and employers alike and ensures that our roads and communities are safer.I commend Minister Tony Burke for his dedicated work on these matters. Transport workers should not be pressured to work harder, longer and faster just to make ends meet. They keep our country and our community moving. No transport worker should struggle to put food on the table or a roof over their familys heads. Every worker in Australia deserves a safe workplace, and the workplace that is Australias roads will not be safe for our transport workers or our communities until the fight for safe rates succeeds.Question agreed to.Federation Chambe r adjourned at 13:19","Road Safety","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RAE (Hawke) ","(13:14):"
