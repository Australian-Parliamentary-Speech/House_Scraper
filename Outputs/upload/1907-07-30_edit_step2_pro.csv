I regret to have to announce to the House the resignation of the Treasurership by my late colleague, the right honorable member for Swan. The letter in which he announced to the Prime Minister his intention to resign is as follows -Grand Hotel, Melbourne,July 30th,1907.My Dear Deakin, -I very much regret that I feel compelled to tender, through you, my resignation of the office of Treasurer in your Government.This action is very painful to me, when I remember the terms of intimate friendship which have existed between us for so long, and is made more so owing to your recent illness, from which, however, I am glad to learn you are becoming convalescent.In my opinion, however, the outlook in Parliament, and the necessary observance of my election platform leave me no alternative.Assuring you of my personal regard and esteem,Believe me to remain,Yours very sincerely,John Forrest.To that the Prime Minister replied -Melbourne, 30th July, 1907.My Dear Sir John, -Your regret is not greater than mine at the sudden discontinuance of our official relations, though of course those which have so long existed between us personally undergo no change.I hope you will always enjoy the same harmonious associations that have existed in our Cabinet.I am all the more reluctant to lose the great advantage of your assistance in the. Government, which is highly appreciated by all your colleagues, and especially by myself, because there is not, and has not been, anything rendering your retention of your high and responsible office in any way a sacrifice of principle or departure from your election platform. In all such matters ones own sentiments properly count for a great deal. Each must judge for himself and sensitively what his obligations may demand before taking a step so unfortunate for all of us in the present state of business, but in respect to which I can only accept your resignation in the same regretful spirit in which you have tendered it.With kindest regards, .Your very truly,Alfred Deakin.The Right Honourable Sir John Forrest,P.C., G.C.M.G.I desire to say, on behalf of every member of the Cabinet, that we sincerely regret the step which has been taken by the right honorable member for Swan. He is a gentleman who is esteemed throughout Australia, having held office for many years as Premier of the State of Western Australia, and having been a  member of a Commonwealth Ministry, and a colleague of many of the present Ministers almost ever since Federation began. His relations with the members of the Cabinet individually have been most harmonious, in fact, I may say, in rebuttal of statements which have been circulated- at various times, that the harmony has never been disturbed. We have been a united family, as a. Cabinet should be. There are, of course, occasions when Ministers differ,, as they must when their principles compel them to do so ; but, although there have been slight differences of opinion, there has never been acrimony in the relations between the right honorable member for Swan and his late colleagues. That fact makes it the more regrettable that he has left us at this time. In view of his past career, and the work he has done for Australia, not only as a politician, but as an explorer of the interior of the Continent, a very large number of people must also regret his determination. It is no doubt an inconvenient time for him to leave; but I am sure that his relations with Ministers will continue as cordial and as sympathetic as they have been in the past.","Re-arrangement of Portfolios","RESIGNATION OF THE TREASURER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

7,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORREST, John","KFJ","Swan","Protectionist","Treasurer",1085,".- I crave the indulgence of the House to say a few words. First of all, I desire to thank the Prime Minister for the friendly letter which he addressed to me in accepting my resignation of the Treasurership in his Government. Our friendship has been a lengthy one. We have not always been in agreement - and at the present time I differ widely from him as to the course that should have been taken - but the harmony of our personal relations has never been disturbed. I regret, owing to his unfortunate illness, that I have been compelled to take this step at this particular time ; but I felt that unless I took it now, when Parliament is fresh from the elections, it would be impossible for me to take it later on. I had always intended to resign if the parliamentary outlook became what it seems to rue to be at the present moment. In my letter to the Prime Minister, I stated in a very few words the reasons for my resignation. I am not satisfied with the outlook in Parliament, and if I am to conform to my election platform, I do not think I can consistently continue ;to hold office under present conditions. I wish to say to the House, and to every one, that my action is my own. There is no_ one on this side of the Chamber, who heard of it from me, and there are only two honorable gentlemen on the Government benches who were in my confidence. Therefore, I wish to disclaim any idea that there has been any cabal or any agreement or any understanding with regard to the action I have taken. I wish also to say that in taking my seat on the front cross Opposition Bench, I do not intend that of itself to be regarded as a hostile act to the Government. My reason for taking a seat here, is that I consider that my place in the House must be consistent with my platform when before the electors in December last, and it must appear so as well as be so. The public of Australia cannot go into intricacies in regard to matters of this sort. They judge by what appears, and my seat and my conduct in the House, must not on j be consistent with my election pledges, but must be patent to all. This, sir, is the reason why after careful consideration, I have taken the very grave step of taking my seat in the House alongside those who, like my colleague from Fremantle, and all the others here, were elected on exactly the same platform as myself. I am of the opinion that the public can see but little difference, and that the public of my own State will see no difference between habitually taking support from a party, and being in alliance with that party. My friends in the Labour corner - and I think I may call them my friends-Labour Party Members. - Hear, hear !","Re-arrangement of Portfolios","RESIGNATION OF THE TREASURER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

My friends in the Labour corner would have resented my conduct if I had delayed taking the course I have taken. They could fairly say,  It is pretty hard on us to support a Government which includes a member who strenuously opposed us at the General Election, and did his best to defeat our party in Western Australia. Of course, I should have an answer to that. The party tried to drive me, and- the Prime Minister, too, out of public life, but that was only tit for tat : I was doing the same thing with regard to them.","Re-arrangement of Portfolios","RESIGNATION OF THE TREASURER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

10,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORREST, John","KFJ","N/A","N/A","N/A",1085,"- I wish to say this to all my friends who were not in Western Australia - and my Western Australian friends will bear me witness, I think- that all through the campaign, I never mentioned the name of any member unless, perhaps, I mentioned the leader of the Labour Party by quoting something which he had said. I dealt with principles only, and not in any way with personalities. I can assure honorable members that I fought the election fairly ; but I did my best to defeat them, and I have no doubt that they did their best to defeat me. However, that is all past now. We are not going to carry the animosities of election time into our lives. Still, I can make a good deal of allowance for some honorable members who were put to considerable trouble and perhaps some expense in fighting their elections, and who may think that I had much to do with that. It is only reasonable that they should resent keeping me in office on a good fat salary after all I had done, or was thought to have done, to defeat them in their electorates. I think that they are right. I do not believe in fighting a party at election time and then, finding the need of that party,- taking them to my bosom afterwards. And if there are any members of that party who resent such action by me or by any one else, I consider that they are quite right, and I should be very much inclined to do the same, although I should be perhaps a little more polite in doing it than some of them were to me. I am of opinion that the course I have followed is much more creditable and honorable than the course of holding on to office by the favour of those I had so strenuously opposed. I should not have been surprised if they had despised me if I had continued in office, and submitted to be contemptuously treated, knowing all the time that they had a dominating influence and control over my remaining in office. These are the reasons which have actuated me in the course I have taken. As my friend the Minister has said, I have had a long career in this country, working in the public service and the public interest all my life. I have tried to hold up my head as a public man, so that no one should say that I had ever done anything that was discreditable to me. If there is one thing I do value it is my good name and the good-will of the people who know me well and among whom I have lived and worked; and I certainly shall not now, at the age of sixty years, do anything that will bring discredit upon myself, as I feel that I should have done if I had held on, under existing conditions, to place and power. My career in the public service has beer* a long and arduous one, extending over forty years. I have enjoyed supreme power for a long time in my own State before I came to this House. I have had six years experience of Ministerial office here. I am not going to say that they have been six years of pleasure, because I have had to face great difficulties, and to undergo great* trials in filling the office of a responsible Minister during the first years of Federation. But I can say that, although I have relinquished office, although I have surrendered place and power, I never felt freer from baneful influences or more bold in my desire to do right than I do to-day, because I . have the knowledge - and this will sustain me - that I am doing what is right. During the recent election campaign- I was asked the question twenty times by my opponents,  What will you do should? the Deakin Government meet Parliament in a minority, and if you are dependent for your Ministerial existence upon the support of the Labour Party ? Every time that question was put to me, it was in my mouth to reply,  I will not continue. to hold office should such a contingency arise. I felt that that was the only honest answer which I could give. Perhaps I was not so outspoken then as I am now, and I replied,  That is a hostile question, and I am not bound to answer it. I will take the fence when I get to it. I have reached the fence today, and I have taken it. I wish to say to my friends in the Labour Party that F entertain no personal feeling against them. Some of them are mv best friends, and T hope will be my friends always. If during the years in which I have filled the position of a Minister, or if in my capacity as a private member, I have done anything to offend any honorable member of this House, I ask him to  rub it off the slate, and let us begin again. I thank honorable members for their kindness in permitting me to make this statement.","Re-arrangement of Portfolios","RESIGNATION OF THE TREASURER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Our desire shouldl be to secure success from the outset. New Zealand flax will grow only under certain conditions, and it is an open question whether it could be profitably produced in circumstances different from those in which it grows naturally in the sister Colony. For many years I have had large plants of New Zealand flax growing in my own garden, alongside a river where they have done well ; but we have to carefully consider whether it can be profitably cultivated in circumstances differing from those obtaining in New Zealand. If it can, then we shall be able to establish a very important industry, and put to profitable use large areas of swampy land at present considered to be of practically ho value.

80,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"LIDDELL, Frank","L1H","Hunter","N/A","N/A",1091,".- On the occasion of a recent visit to New Zealand, I observed that flax was being largely cultivated there, although the production of the fibre, as an industry, was still in its infancy. I found it difficult to obtain accurate information about the growth of this plant, and am very doubtful whether the Industry is one that ought to be bolstered up by means of a bounty. If, as is said, large profits are to be made from it, we may well leave private enterprise to establish the industry without State aid. I agree with the honorable member for Corangamite that we should first of all establish an Agricultural Bureau to instruct intend- ing growers, among other things, in the steps necessary to the successful cultivation of flax. It was pointed out to me, while in New Zealand, that the successful cultivation of flax there is due largely to the fact that the supply of the necessary labour is adequate. The treatment of New Zealand flax involves work of such a disagreeable character, however, that I am inclined to believe we should find it difficult to secure the requisite labour. In order to insure success in its treatment a man has to stand up to his middle in stagnant pools - and such pools in Australia would be infested by mosquitos - and thresh the leaves in the water in order to separate the fibre from them. The report of the expert? sets forth that two tons of dressed fibre at .£20 per ton will yield ,£40. That is self-evident, but I was informed in New Zealand that the price obtained for dressed fibre was only £8 or £9 per ton. I am not satisfied with the experts report, much of which, by the way, has been culled from the Encyclopaedia Britannica. That is not the sort of thing we expect.

Flax cannot be grown for fibre without the linseed being grown at the same time. The two things are interdependent. There appears in one of this mornings papers an article on the production pf flax, and the extraction of the seed from the flax as it is bought from the growers. Flax has been grown in Victoria for many years. I have attempted to grow it myself in the Western District. A large quantity was produced there at one time, but the farmers gave up the industry, as they found there were other products which paid, them better with less trouble. At the same time, there is a large area of. land throughout Australia which is suitable for flax cultivation. To give a bounty of £8,000 for flax and hemp, and another of ,£5,000 for flax seed, is practically to double- bank the .bounty on flax. Both the fibre and the seed are valuable products. The manufacture of the fibre into linen, twine, rope, &c, is a very important industry, and the seed is extremely valuable for the feeding of stock and the extraction of linseed oil. The honorable member for Laanecoorie asked me if the fibre and the seed could be obtained at the same time. I may tell the honorable member that, according to the article in this mornings paper, most of the manufacture of flax in Victoria is carried on at Pentridge by the prisoners. The governor of the gaol buys the raw material from the farmer. It is broken, and the seeds taken out at the gaol. The fibre is then retted, broken, and scutched. The finished product, in the shape of fibre, is then sold to the manufacturers, who make it into twine, rope, and other articles. The seed, on the other hand, is sold to those who use it at the present time in Victoria, not so much for the extraction of oil as for conversion into crushed linseed and linseed cake for the feeding of stock. There is no necessity for double-banking the bounty in the way proposed in this schedule.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Probably the honorable member, with his extensive knowledge of agriculture, has, through a little slip of memory, for the moment forgotten the facts pointed out on page 10 of the memorandum. The following there appears -Flax, when grown thin, is a prolific seed producer, but when cultivated for fibre, the more valuable product, the great aim of the grower should be to produce a plant with a single seed boll on top.A heavy crop of seed cannot be obtained at the same time as a large yield of fibre, or even a small one, of good marketable fibre. (Flax Culture, J. J. Wilson.)The experts recommended the granting of two bounties, because flax grown for the fibre will not give the same results as that grown specially for the seed. It is therefore necessary to have one bounty for flax used for the production of fibre and another for the plant grown to obtain linseed.Item agreed to.Item -Jute. 5 years, 20 per cent, on market value,£9,000.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The goats can be grazed on country that will not carry anything else. They will do well on scrub country that will not carry sheep, and will practically carry only rabbits, but rabbits can live only on the ground floor, whereas the goats can live on anything up to 6 feet in height. The general experience is, that to graze Angora goats greatly improves the land, as the scrub is eaten out. At the same time, the establishment of a herd is most expensive, and their natural increase is very slow. The danger of Angora goats, like other goats, getting out of bounds and straying on neighbouring property is also great. It is, therefore, important to consider whether the inclusion of this item in the schedule is justified by the probable value of the industry to Australia under present conditions.

Of all animals the Angora goat is the most independent; and I did think that so independent a gentleman as the honorable member for Corangamite would have been the last to attack its qualities. The main objection to this item, to my mind, is that it appears to be an easy matter to establish flocks of Angora goats in Australia without the aid of a bounty. Two years ago a friend of mind told me he was establishing a flock on the highlands of north Queensland ; and if members of the general community are prepared to enter this industry without a bounty, what possible reason can there be for placing this item in the schedule? There is one point I have heard discussed in connexion with the production of mohair. I understand that mohair will practically never wear out ; and, if that be so, it may prove a serious matter for our wool industry.

It is only where land is very poor that it pays to run goats ; and there is any quantity of poor land that would justify a person entering- this industry, more especially in view of the fact that after the goats have cleared it, sheep will thrive on the land.

At the exhibition in Sydney only a few days ago Angora goats were selling at£5 a head; and the production of mohair pays adequately when people can be found with sufficient enterprise to take up the inferior lands of the country with that end in view. There is no better sphere for this industry than the Northern Territory ; indeed, honorable members, when passing through the Territory recently, travelled for three days amongst no other stock but goats, which thrive well in that hot climate.

I think the statement is rosier than is justified by the facts. At the outside there are not more than 300 Angora goats in Victoria. There are several flocks in Queensland, and in that State experience has shown that the returns are sufficiently promising. I find this in the Queensland report on the subject -There are several flocks of Angora goats in Queensland. The fleece weighs from 3 lbs. to 5 lbs., varying according to individual animals, and the quality varying with the purity of the breed. The fleece of the buck weighs from 6 lbs. to 9 lbs. The goats require little more attention than sheep. If we average the fleece at 4 lbs., at is. 3d. per lb., each goat will produce 5s. Thus, on 3,000 acres, sufficient goats might be reared to yield a gross income of about ^750. Shearing, at £1 per score, would amount to ^150, and this, with baling and freight, would be the principal item of expenditure. Besides the mohair, the skins are valuable, and there is always surplus stock for sale.At the present time there are only a limited number of these animals in Queensland, and I understand that there are a few also in South Australia and Tasmania; but the industry contains within itself the elements of success, and therefore it is one which we can strongly recommend, especially in view of the fact that it can be pursued in some instances as a subsidiary industry in association with other rural operations.

The proposal to give a bounty on the production of mohair seems to me to afford some opportunity of employment to the aboriginal natives of Australia, because I understand the Angora goat flourishes in the most arid regions. From a humanitarian point of view, therefore, I feel strongly inclined to support the proposals. But I am very much grieved to find that the Ministry have altered the construction of the Bill. Under this Bill it is only the aboriginal natives who will have a chance to look after the Angora in the arid regions of the Northern Territory. In the last Bounties Bill the Ministry submitted a more broadminded provision to this effect -The employment of any aboriginal native of Australia or of any coloured person born in Australia, and having one white parent, in the growing or production of any of the goods specified in the schedule shall not prejudice any claim to a bounty under this Act.There was some liberality in that provision, inasmuch as an aboriginal, and in addition any coloured person born in Australia of parents, one of whom was white, would be permitted to be employed in these industries. Under this Bill, the coloured children of parents, one of whom is white, would not have an opportunity of earning the bounty. In the far north, a child of an aboriginal and a white parent would be placed in a very unfortunate position, since, if the child were engaged in attending to only one Angora goat on a large plantation, that would be sufficient to destroy a claim to the bounty.

The Angoras first tried there were kept in the country at the back of the Mount Lofty hills, and did fairly well, breeding freely, and producing good fleeces. But, as the honorable member for Corangamite pointed out, it is difficult to keep these animals within bounds, and in settled districts they are liable to do considerable damage to adjacent properties. Consequently, the raising of Angoras was abandoned at the place I speak of; but it was afterwards followed with great success at a station called the Peak, which is situated near Oodnadatta, in arid country which has a rainfall of only six inches per annum. Although the industry thrived there, the herd was dispersed because of the death of one of the partners, and the animals were sold and sent to other parts of Australia, and to South Africa. I do not suppose that a bounty of £2,000 per annum will lead to the importation of many goats.

A point which has been overlooked is that the sale of mohair depends very largely on fashion. For the last two or three years there has been a run on the article; but every experienced person knows that a few years ago it was practically unsaleable; it was not a remunerative crop. I think that where the Angora goat has been tried, the experience has been that where it will live a merino sheep will live, and that the latter will give perhaps a 200 per cent, better return than the former. I am relating the experience of other persons. The chief use of the Angora goat seems to be in eating up rubbish and cleaning the country, and wherever it has been found that it will be carried by the country, the merino sheep has taken the place of the Angora goat. If any great quantity of mohair were produced, the great probability is that before the bounty was payable, the article would be almost unsaleable; certainly it would not be sold at a remunerative :price. We are asked to grant a paltry bounty of £2,000 a year to establish an industry amongst a class of men who, if there is anything in the industry at all, do not want any assistance from this Parliament. .If the Angora goat is to be a success in Australia, it will not be because of that trifling bounty, but because in the experience of practical men it is better and more remunerative than sheep. So far as I know, that has not been proved yet in any part of Australia. If it is proved, we shall have immediately the answer that the pastoralists who find that the Angora goat is more remunerative than the sheep, do not want a paltry bounty of ,£2,000 a year. I am altogether opposed to the payment of these bounties, because I believe that they will entirely fail to achieve the laudable object of their advocates. But if it is intended to give bounties at all, do not let honorable members fritter away the money on trifling industries which will only be a failure when the money is paid. Let -us assist an industry that will give employment to the people. There is no one who will venture to say that the bounty in question will employ one additional person. It will not establish an industry, because wool is very much more remunerative than mohair. In nine seasons out of ten, the wool will fetch a very much better price than the mohair, and the carcase of the sheep is of infinitely greater value than is that of the goat.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[19]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This industry is on a par with a great many others in Australia, but I do not say that that in itself should recommend the bounty. Nearly thirty years ago I shore Angora goats. There used to be a very fine flock of them at Mount Bute Station in this State. They were thriving well there, and I am quite confident that if they were as profitable as sheep, there would have been many thousands of them in Australia to-day. It may suit a few persons who have Angora goats to get the value of their flock increased, but I have not much faith in the idea that by the payment, of this paltry amount we should establish an industry.

Mr. Maurice had a very successful run in North Australia, which required no protection. The only reason for breaking up that flock was because there had been a death in the family, and then the animals found their way all over Australia. There was a demand for the Angora goat. Why ? Because they prevent disease from taking place among flocks of sheep. They are good for poor country. As high up as they can reach on their hind legs they will eat off the young shoots. There is an inducement to have goats on land; but any goat is suitable for such a purpose in Australia. It takes five crossings to produce Angora goats, so that persons would first have to import animals before they could establish an industry, and become entitled to claim the bounty of £2,000 a year. It seems to me that the Government are merely killing time. Why do they not go on with the Tariff if they have one to bring forward, instead of wasting the time of honorable members -on a mere hoax. The industry, so far as it does exist, is a success. Mr. Blaxland, of New South Wales has written to say that, so far as he has gone, he has found it a most profitable industry. Any one who has sheep will buy goats if he can get them, because there is an inducement to have goats among sheep.

They say, further -The Angora is able to prosper under adverse conditions, and its fondness for scrub is a strong point in its favour.Obviously, all that is required to establish a profitable industry is that persons who have large tracts of waste land shall import Angora goats. That opinion is strengthened by reference to the report of the Queensland expert, who says -There are several flocks of Angora goats in Queensland. The fleece weighs from 3 to 5 lbs., varying according to individual animals, and the quality varying with the purity of the breed. The fleece of the buck weighs from, 6 to 9 lbs.. The goats require little more attention than sheep. If we average the fleece at 4 lbs., at is. 3d. per lb., each goat will produce 5s. Thus, on 3,000 acres, sufficient goats might be reared to yield a gross income of about £750. Shearing, at £1 per score, would amount to£i$o, and this, with baling and freight, would be the principal item of expenditure. Besides the mohair, the skins are valuable, and there is always surplus stock for sale. The owner of 160 acres could make a good addition to his income by keeping merely fifty Angoras, allowing them plenty of scrubby country for a run. The mohair from them would be worth diaper annum, the increase could be sold, the old goats could be replaced by young stock, and the skins of the former would bring IS. 8d. per lb. A skin weighs from 4 to 5 lbs.For the Government to ask us to sanction an expenditure of £2,000 by way of a bounty upon mohair in the face of that report is preposterous. Obviously, if there be such bright prospects for those who choose to embark upon this enterprise,, there is no need for them to be more than informed of the fact. If it be once demonstrated that the industry is a profitable one, I am satisfied that many persons who have small selections will utilize them for the purpose of rearing Angora goats, especially those portions which are not fit for grazing sheep. In another portion of their report I notice that the experts declare that after Angoras have been running upon country for some time the land becomes useful for sheep grazing.

Why should we waste public money on encouraging the keeping of animals which are generally considered to be only fit to eat rubbish? Does the Minister seriously think that any good will be derived bv the Commonwealth from the expenditure of this £2,000? The honorable member for Boothby has told us frankly that there is no scope for the industry in South Australia. We should spend money on industries which will lead to the employment of the people, and will be more valuable to Australia as a whole than goat-breeding would be.

The prolonged debate on this one item shows that the representations made last week by various honorable members were quite justified. I earnestly hope the sense of the Committee will be distinctly against this item, not only because it is undesirable in itself, but also as an indication of the objection of the Committee to the general principle of bringing in all these minor amounts. I protest against the inclusion of the item, and I hope it will not be sanctioned.Mr. PALMER(Echuca) ^5.15]. - I intend to vote for the deletion of the item.  I do not believe its inclusion will add a single settler to the land, or tend to encourage any industry substantially worth encouraging. It is also open to the objection which I raised at an earlier stage of this discussion, that the whole of these bounties, if they are agreed to, will probably go into the pockets of those who have already embarked upon the industries specified in the schedule. I find in the report of the Conference of Experts, the following extract from the Pastoralists Review -The stud Angoras shown at the Royal Show, Sydney, by Messrs. Blaxland and Knox, were sold by auction ; one fetched 6 guineas, two 4 guineas, two 5 guineas each, one s£ guineas, and one Si guineas. These goats were just six months old.This shows that Angora goats have already been introduced, and that certain individuals have flocks of them established. I take it that the only object of a Bounties Bill is to encourage people to enter into some industry which is languishing or some other which is entirely new. It has not been shown that this industry is either languishing or entirely new. It is probably being entered upon by a class of individuals who are financially strong enough, and generally well able to embark on any industry without State assistance.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[28]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As I read the Bill, if we omit this item, it will simply leave, included in the total appropriation, a sum of money which can be applied to any of the other items in the schedule. The Government, having £530,000 available under this Bill, if it becomes law, will have power under clause 9 to vary the sums set out in the fourth column of the first schedule as the maximum amounts. If this item is struck out, it will mean that a sum of £2,000 a year for ten years is freed, and I do not see any legal objection to the Government varying the sum set down in the fourth column of the first schedule as the maximum amount payable in any one year -for ginned cotton from £6.000 to £8,000.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[30]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The question then would be, whether a regulation of that sort would be inconsistent with the Act, and a very nice point of law would arise. As the Bill would pass, the amount for ginned cotton would be £6,000 a year. Then a regulation, claimed to be consistent with the Act, would vary the amount from £6,000 to £8,000 a year, and in one sense it could be held that that was inconsistent with the Act. I am sure that aspect of the matter requires looking into, as some question of the kind might be raised, although I do not know that any one would have any interest in raising it. We have the fact that the Angora goat has been established in Australia for a great many years, and that this is no new industry, or one which requires any initial capital, except that which is involved in every industry. As the goat thrives on arid land, we have a country eminently suited for it ; and there are no preliminary difficulties in the way. In view of these considerations, I feel inclined to give this money to some more important industry. It is quite clear that this industry is natural to many parts of Australia. From the useful report of the committee of experts, I learn that Angora goats are shown and win prizes at agricultural shows, and that there are sales of stud stock.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[30]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is a pity that such language should be used within these walls in regard to any industry. Whether an industry be great or small, it is desirable to encourage it - that is, if it is desirable to take any action whatever in that direction. Some honorable members have said that it is not necessary for us to deal with small industries, but that we should confine our attention to great industries. In my opinion, however, it is our duty to study every industry, whether great or small, and, in proportion, do as much for one as for the other. In many grazing countries a great deal of briar and other rubbish has been permitted to grow, and goats are very useful in clearing such land ; certainly goats are better than rabbits, which are also prevalent on many large properties, the owners of which allow those growths to flourish. If we can encourage graziers, whether large or small, to employ goats in keeping down these objectionable growths, it will be a great gain to the Commonwealth. The production of mohair would encourage its manufacture, which could be as well carried on in Australia as anywhere else.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[34]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am prepared to agree that the industry of the manufacture of copra in Australia is one of very great value. Copra is obtained from the cocoanut, which in the Commonwealth is grown only in the Northern Territory, northern Queensland, and the north of Western Australia. I believe that at the present time copra is everywhere a product of black labour. The question is, can we produce copra in Australia with white labour? If so, I am prepared to vote for the item to encourage its production. We should know by whom it is to be produced, and how the cocoanut tree is to be planted and looked after in the future, and whether the small grower is to get the benefit of the bonus proposed to be given. If this money is to be given to the small farmer to encourage him to open up and develop the tropical regions of Australia, this may be considered one of the best items in the schedule; but it would be a very undesirable one if the bonus were to get exclusively into the hands of large manufacturing companies. I hope that we shall have an assurance from the Minister that every precaution will be taken to insure that the bounty is paid to the small men, upon whom we must rely for the opening up and development of tropical Australia.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[36]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They seem, indeed, to be indigenous to the Northern Territory, where one sees them growing near the waters edge, as they grow in the Pacific Islands. The white ant is, however, a very serious pest there. I have seen palms which had been hollowed out by the ants, so that the first gale of wind would blow them over, and at the Church of England at Port Darwin I was shown evidence of the fact that the ants had eaten through the mortar of a stone wall 18 inches thick, in order to get at the pews and other furniture. This pest will be a trouble to those who try to grow cocoanuts to obtain copra ; but I do not think there is any need for the granting of a bounty for the cultivation of an indigenous palm. It takes from seven to nine years, according to the character of the soil and the climate, for cocoanut palms to come into bearing, but, while waiting for a crop, farmers could grow maize and other products just as in the South Sea Islands they grow maize and copra.Item agreed to.Mr. FRAZER(Kalgoorlie) [5.49I. - The method which we are adopting in dealing with the items in the schedule does not give fair opportunity for proper discussion of the proposals of the Government. I do not think that it offers an opportunity to honorable members to accurately express their intention. There may be some honorable members who, whilst they are not prepared to vote for the deletion of an item, may be prepared to vote in the direction of amending it. For instance, in regard to the item of copra, I think that there was a desire to have an understanding that the operation of the Bill shall not relate to trees or to plantations -which are in existence. The question of the number of years may come into consideration regarding some Items, but it may be only a question of months in regard to other items. I wanted to suggest that after the last item nad been retained the bounty should be limited to only five years, but when a vote is taken in such a way that if the amendment be defeated the whole item is disposed of, it does not allow honorable members an opportunity to express their opinion in regard to amendments which might command a majority.

It was open to the Government to propose a bounty on the production of seed cotton, or to encourage the finning of the raw cotton here, the extraction of the seed, and the use of the by-products in Australia. Instead of proposing to give a bounty on the production of seed cotton, it was thought advisable, as in the case of other fibres, to give a bounty on the production of ginned cotton. There will not be two bounties paid. A bounty will be paid on the value of the fibre in one instance, and then a bounty will be paid in respect of the seed. If a bounty were paid en the seed cotton, which contains the seed, it would be a case of double-banking. The worlds price for ginned cotton varies from about 3Jd., per lb.

The real question at issue is whether that commodity is entitled to anything in the form of a bounty. The honorable member for Lang, having been defeated upon that point, ought to be prepared to grant the Government the amount for which they ask. Throughout the whole of this discussion I have been favorable to offering encouragement to the cotton industry. To my mind, it is an industry which may rival our wool industry. I maintain that if we can foster the production of wheat, wool, or iron, we shall do some good. But I object to bounties being offered to assist the production of all the small items specified in the schedule.

267,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BOWDEN, Eric","JRH","Nepean","N/A","N/A",1108,".- If there is one item in the schedule that ought to be struck out, it is that relating to olives. I hope that the Committee will not agree to it. The report of the experts laid before us by the Attorney-General shows us that the olive industry is already well established in South Australia, as well as elsewhere. Pure olive oil is a commodity which commands a ready sale. There is a safe mar-. ker for it. It has been demonstrated in South Australia that the industry can be conducted on a commercial scale without a bounty. I venture to say that if any one goes into a shop in Sydney and asks for the best olive oil, he will be offered oil from South Australia. I learn from the Statistical Register of South Australia, that there has been a great increase in the industry in recent years. In 1896, there were 49,609 olive trees in South Australia, and the olive oil manufactured amounted to 6,512 gallons; in 1897-8, there were 51,824 olive trees, and 5,310 gallons of oil manufactured ; in 1898-9, there were 57.337 olive trees; in 1899-1900, 61,557 ; in 1901, 61,740; in 1901-2, 66,852; in 1902-3, 78,642; in 1903-4, 80,560; in 1904-5, 83,138; and in 1905-6, 85,443. These figures show a steady growth in the industry during the last ten years. I need not trouble the Committee by repeating all the figures relating to the quantities of olive oil produced, but I may state that they show an increase from 6,512 gallons, in 1896-7, to 17,762 gallons, in 1905-6. The industry is, therefore, being conducted on a payable .scale, and is thoroughly well established. The report of the experts shows that the olive tree grows slowly. Very little fruit is produced .until a tree is seven or eight years old. The proposal of the Government is that the bounty shall be paid straight away. That means that the money will be paid to those who have the trees already established, and will not, therefor ?, encourage the development of the industry. If growers start to plant at once, their trees will not begin to bear until more than half the period to which the Bill applies has expired. The report states that the number of olive trees in South Australia is 85,433, and that the production of olive oil is 15,202 gallons per annum, as compared with 17,762 gallons shown in the South Australian Statistical Register for 1905-6. I do not know where the figures quoted by the experts are taken from. There is surely no need to vote money for the encouragement of an industry that is already flourishing, and in which the producers are already doing so well.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[50]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

282,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"JOHNSON, Elliot","K99","Lang","N/A","N/A",1110,". - I move -That the item be left out.This question was thoroughly debated on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, and it was clearly demonstrated that there was not the slightest excuse for proposing a bounty on the production of olive oil. I do not know whether olives are being grown at present at Mildura, but when this question was under consideration in the last session of last Parliament, it was pointed out that olive plantations at Mildura had been uprooted for the reason that there was no market for their product. The honorable and learned member- for Bendigo also told us on that occasion that he procured either . from Mildura or Sir Samuel Davenport a number of olive trees and was very successful in their cultivation, but that he had to uproot his plantation, because, like settlers at Mildura, he found there was no market for their product. In the report of the experts, it is stated-At the same time there is a safe market for the pure oil  of olives, and it has been demonstrated in South Australia on a commercial scale that the industry is of a payable nature.The cultivation of other commercial trees has, however, appealed more strongly to Australian orchardists, and the olive has not received the attention which its importance merits.The reason for this is that orchardists themselves find that they can direct their energies into more profitable channels. I would draw attention to what seems to be a remarkable discrepancy between two statements appearing in the report of the experts as to the value of olive oil imported into the Commonwealth. We find under the heading of  Olive Oil  a statement that the imports in 1906 amounted to 29,547 gals., the value of which was £6,437. In another paragraph, in the same report, we have the statement that  the annual importations of olive oil into Australia represent a value of .£35,000. There is a very great discrepancy between the two sets of figures. The report is so misleading - so absolutely contradictory as to facts, and the conclusions drawn from them, that it is impossible to attach any great value to it. But apart altogether from the question of whether there is, or is not, a market for the Australian product, we have the fact clearly demonstrated that the industry has been established for a great many years - nearly half a century in fact - in South Australia, which seems to have been largely the home of olive production in the Commonwealth. A very considerable proportion of this bounty for some years will find its way into the pockets of those who have already established the industry, as a payable concern. For the first five or six years these people will exclusively draw the bounty as an addition to their ordinary commercial profits. The total expenditure to which we are called upon to agree for the purpose of encouraging this industry is £37##>5°##°- We are asked to grant £2,500 per annum for fifteen years, and for about five years, if not longer, this annual expenditure will be an absolute and unconditional present to those already engaged iri the industry. Another point worthy of note is that the bounty is to date from the 1st inst., so that as soon as the Bill becomes law those who are already making a handsome profit out of this form of production will receive a present of £2,500 a year, and give the community nothing in return. For these reasons, as well as for others, which I gave at length on a previous occasion, I hope that the Committee will agree to omit this item.Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.45 p.m.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[52]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member for Nepean stated that in any shop in Sydney any one asking for olive oil would be given South Australian oil as the best that could be produced anywhere. It was very pleasing to me to- hear that statement, especially from the source from which it came. It shows that Sydney has awakened to the fact that Australia can produce an article superior to what can be produced outside the Commonwealth. I support the bounty on olives, because I know that the trees will flourish all over the Riverina, and through the northern parts of Victoria. I am personally aware that if the Bill passes, notwithstanding all that has been said against it, a number of small farmers will be prepared  to plant olive trees, and wait the few years necessary before they can reap a return. It was said during the second-reading debate that the olive tree took something like nine or ten years to become profitable. Only fairly wealthy men could afford to wait that length of time for a return, but farmers need not wait half so long for the trees to produce a fruit equal for commercial purposes to any .fruit of a more mature age. As the object of this measure is to encourage industries, not only in South Australia, but in other States of the Commonwealth, and to give the farmers an opportunity of adding something to their general routine of cultivation, the Committee should pause before they accept the amendment.

There may, of course, be some difficulty in the payment of this bounty, just as in the payment of the bounties in respect of other plants that will not come into bearing for a number of years. I should like to see a provision introduced to enable people who come in later on to reap the benefit of the bounty, so as to insure the making of new plantations. Even on the information now before the Committee, there is ample reason for the retention of the item. According to the report of the Conference of Experts, we import 29,000 gallons of oil annually, and produce only 15,000 gallons. Consequently we import nearly twice the quantity we produce. That is a very strong and sufficient argument for this bounty. The whole of the olive oil consumed in Australia ought to be manufactured in Australia. I can quite understand some of the speeches which have been made against this bounty, seeing that the speakers are against every item. The example of Mildura has been quoted by some of those honorable members ; and I may say that I asked the Protectionist Association of that settlement to pass an opinion on this particular item, knowing that it would meet with some opposition here. The ProtectionistAssociation of Mildura is representative of the whole settlement, and this is the reply I received -In respect of olives we coincide with the Conference recommendation that a bonus of 10 per cent, be paid for fifteen years to the grower of olives.- With a little encouragement, the olive would probably be more extensively planted here in hedges. It does better here in hedges than planted throughout a block, and the same result - the production of olives - is. gained. We note that the minimum quantity on which a bonus will be paid is one ton; and a hedge round a ten-acre block will .in time produce several tons, though probably we would not be able to collect any bonus for five or six years, as the olives scarcely pay for picking before then.That is the opinion of experienced men, and it is an unanswerable reply to the statement that has been made that the settlers are pulling up the olive trees at Mildura. Had such been the case, it is not likely that they would have even suggested the continuance of the industry. There is manufacturing plant in Australia, and the reason that it is not utilized seems to be the shortage of the supply of olives. In this connexion the bounty would carry out the object we have in view, by encouraging the further planting of the olives.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[54]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We know, however, that the olive grows well in parts of Australia, and that 10 acres will produce sufficient of the fruit to give immense quantities of oil. According to the honorable member for Riverina, the olive grows well in the dry climate of his district. We can quite believe that the olive will grow just as well in the Riverina as in South Australia, or wherever there is a dry climate similar to that of parts of Queensland. . The olive also thrives in the Wimmera, but that is under cultivation - artificial cultivation - not natural to that part of the country. The industry is in existence in South Australia, where it has been made to pay ; indeed, the salad 011 grown in that State is preferred, and asked for, by every consumer throughout the Commonwealth. As I understand, a bounty is usually granted to encourage a native industry that can not be established without such assistance.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[55]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If protectionists are of opinion that further protection is needed, let them propose to raise the duty, so as to exclude the foreign product, though the duty of is. 4d. per gallon is fairly high already: If it. be desired to give a bounty. why not give it to the Government of South Australia, seeing that the olive oil in that State is- largely produced by prisoners? We must not run away with the notion, however, that this is a bounty to establish an industry. How is it that there is no proposal to give a bounty on table olives, which are a very nutritious food? There are parts of Spain where the people live on nothing else but olives; and why not encourage their cultivation in Australia, and thus enable us to get rid of indigestion? It is through lack of. enterprise that this class of olive has not been produced, and a bounty might establish the industry. Thirty years ago I saw olive trees growing in South Australia. I remember that the honorable and learned member for Adelaide, who was in charge of the Tariff, when it was under consideration, referred to the cultivation of the olive, and I was able to remind him of a fine lot of trees on his fathers estate which I saw when I was a boy. If it be desired to further protect the local product, raise the Tariff - though I would not support that - but why throw away thousands of pounds? Is it because they would be afraid, when the Tariff comes up for discussion by-and-by, to propose the imposition of a duty of more than1s. 4d. per gallon on olive oil ? Is it because that would make the duty prohibitive so that no revenue would be derived from this source? If duties were raised all round there might be a plea raised for new taxation in the form of an income tax.  Really this humbug is irritating. The protectionists know that I am against them, but I ask them to go for something real, and not to humbug Parliament and the country by proposing to throw away money for the establishment of an industry that is already established. If honorable members desire to give those who are producing olive oil at present in the Commonwealth an advantage of more than1s. 4d. per gallon, let them do so in revising the Tariff. In my opinion, this proposal is not sincere. We should know something also of the financial aspect of the question. It seems that, with numbers, it is possible for the Government to carry anything, but the Committee will not be humbugged all the time. If the protectionists would advocate legitimate protection instead of a proposal to throw money away in this direction, they would obtain more credit in the country.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[55]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I base my attitude on sworn evidence given before the Tariff Commission when in Adelaide. We there examined Mr. Cleland, the representative of the olive growers and olive oil manufacturers of South Australia, who asked for neither a bounty nor an increase of duty, but merely for protection against compounds adulterated with cotton seed oil.He informed the Commission that £50,000 is invested in the olive oil industry in South Australia. No fewer than 83,000 trees there are now yielding oil - the output for 1905 amounting to 20,000 gallons. The oil is sold wholesale at prices ranging from 8s. 6d. to 9s. 6d. per gallon. To use Mr. Clelands own words, the industry is a growing one, and they can not keep pace with the demand. He mentioned that the local production has greatly increased of late years, because Inter-State free-trade has given access to the whole Australian market. What the olive oil growers in South Australia were opposing was the application of Messrs. Lewis and Whitty for the reduction of the duty on cotton seed oil. That was opposed because it was said that cotton seed oil is used as an adulterant in compounds which compete with olive oil. If the duty of 2s. per gallon on cotton seed oil is retained, the olive oil makers of South Australia will be content to leave things as they are.

We should confine the bounty to those who are struggling. We should not give it to those who want no assistance.Mr. BATCHELOR(Boothby) [8. 2 si- There seems to be a determination on the part of many honorable members on the other side to make an onslaught on this proposal to benefit a South Australian industry. It reminds me of a great fight which took place here a few years ago in connexion with another industry of South Australia, and that is the salt industry. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo said that the growers of olives and the manufacturers of olive oil in South Australia are doing so well that they are not asking for a bounty or an increased Customs duty. That is so, but he did not mention the fact that the majority of the growers and manufacturers - and in. most cases they are both - have had their olive plantations in existence for periods ranging from twenty-five to fifty years, and that, until the last five or six years they had not got any return from them. That cannot be denied. The growing of olives in South Australia was first begun by Sir Samuel Davenport at Beaumont, and Mr. Sheriff Boothby, with the aid of prison labour, in the Adelaide Park lands. Eight or ten years ago I went through the Adelaide gaol in order to see the methods of producing olive oil. At that time the olive oil produced by the Adelaide Corporation, with the aid of prison labour, was hardly saleable. The industry was not flourishing then. The olive plantations at the foot of the hills were certainly not successful.. It cannot be described as having been in any sense as a very thriving industry until quite recently. Since the passing of the Federal Tariff, and the better advertisement ofSouth Australian oil as a pure olive oil; the industry has been placed on a better footing, and the growers who at that time had established their plantations are doing fairly well. They are not asking for a bounty, ind as the honorable and learned member for Bendigo said, they have not asked for an additional duty. But I desire to draw attention to the fact that, under the Bill, it is proposed to give a bounty to the chief competitors with the producers of olive oil. Of course one of the difficulties in Tariff legislation is that if we put a tax on the raw material of one manufacturer, it may affect other manufacturers. But under this Bill, what we hare done so far has been to sanction the payment of a bounty to the producers of cotton seed. Cotton seed oil is the adulterant which is chiefly used in producing the cheap oil, that enters most into competition with the pure olive oil.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[57]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It also includes a bounty to the) growers of olives, and I certainly had no right to assume that honorable members proposed to establish a new industry by giving a bounty on the production of cotton seed, and at the same time to knock out the industry of olive growing by creating a bounty-fed competitor. Perhaps the principal reason why the olive-growing industry did not pay for so very many years was because there was some difficulty in regard to picking. An honorable member has interjected that the picking is done by child labour. It must lie done by boys, but they can hardly be said to be children, because their ages range from twelve to sixteen years. They do the picking during their holidays. Olive-growing has also been successfully established at Renmark. I have never heard of olive trees having been pulled up there. Mr. Charles Chaffey has a very good plantation at that place, and I think that the industry is fairly thriving. The other difficulty which had to be contended against by the producers of olive oil was the competition from the adulterated article. That still goes on, and it is only by a gradual recognition of the superior quality - from, a medicinal and food point of view - of olive oil to cotton-seed oil that we can hope to induce any greatly increased consumption on the part of the population.

It would take from eight to ten years for the olive trees to bear in payable quantities, and in default of a provision of that kind, the bulk of the bounty would naturally go to the present producers. I do not wish to see that take place. We desire to assist in increasing, if possible, the extent of country which is planted with olive trees. On the other hand it would be inadvisable to adopt the amendment proposed by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo. During the past few weeks there has been a very large increase in the number of olive trees planted in South Australia, and if we were to enact that the bounty should be payable only upon the fruit of trees planted after the passing of this Bill we should be inflicting a great injustice upon those individuals who have already planted their trees. At the present time they are reaping no benefit whatever. Certainly eight or ten years must elapse before they will be in a position to produce the oil. What the honorable and learned member really wishes to do, I tiling, is to insure that the bounty shall be payable only upon fruit produced from trees which come into bearing after the passing of this Bill.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[58]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They will have to wait eight or ten years before they can obtain the slightest return upon their capital, and then they will not be able to get the bounty. This year we shall just about double the number of olive trees in South Australia. Indeed, planting, is going on all over Australia. The trunnions from which the olive trees are propagated are being distributed free to almost anybody who chooses to ask for them. This distribution will probably result in a very great increase in the production of olives, irrespective of whether or not the payment of the proposed bounty be authorized. I admit that if it were not for the competition of cotton seed oil, and the fact that we have already sanctioned the payment of a bounty upon cotton seed, we should not be able to make out a very strong case for similar encouragement being offered for the production of olives. But seeing that we have decided to offer a bounty for the production of cotton-seed, and that cotton-seed oil is the chief competitor of olive oil, we cannot very well avoid offering similar encouragement to the olive Industry which, although comparatively successful at present, has undergone a long struggle, and has experienced a very bad time generally.Mr.SPENCE (Darling) [8.39].- It seems to me that the more we discuss this proposal the more difficulties we discover. As I understand the matter, the object of granting bounties is to encourage private individuals to start new industries, by affording them State assistance. But it now appears that we are getting into this position : An industry may have been started fifty years ago, and proposals may then be submitted to give it a  lift. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo has embodied a still more novel idea in his suggested amendment. He proposes that certain individuals who have had the courage to pioneer an industry, shall be faced with competitors just when that industry is becoming a payable one. It seems to me that the Government proposal is much fairer than that. Under it, we are asked to grant pioneering firms some reward for their pioneering work. But the question which presents itself to my mind is,  Is it necessary to include olives in the schedule? I took up a similar position when this matter was being discussed in the last Parliament. The olive oil industry is an established and payable industry. Under such circumstances, surely, there is sufficient private enterprise in our midst to successfully carry it on without the aid of a bounty to the growers of olives ! It seems to me that private enterprise must be in a very bad way indeed. As a matter of fact, we have not heard much of it since the last elections. If it cannot continue the olive industry after the way has been paved for it. I am justified in asking whether it is utterly dead? The honorable and learned member for Bendigo is becoming more of a Socialist than members of the LabourParty, inasmuch as he is prepared to help any industry, even although that industry may be already in existence. His proposal opens up a very big field indeed. It means that though an industry has been established in one State, the Government ought to assist its establishment in another State. Personally, I am of opinion that it would be far Letter to eliminate this item from the schedule. Concerning the difficulty to which the honorable member for Boothby has called attention, I would point out that after the bounty has ceased to operate, the competitor to which he referred will remain. Seeing that we have already authorized the payment of a bounty upon cotton seed, it would be unfair to do anything which would damage the olive industry. That being so, the Government might very well recommit that portion of the schedule relating to the payment of bounty upon cotton seed. The adoption of that course would be preferable to advancing money to assist an established industry. I think that bounties should be granted only for the purpose of encouraging persons to start new industries in the Commonwealth. When an industry like that of the cultivation of olives and the manufacture of olive oil has been established, unless we intend to go in for its control by the State and for State Socialism, it should be carried on by private enterprise. South Australia has done many good things, and the establishment of the olive oil industry is one of them. Some of its enterprising residents have successfully engaged init. I repeat that the Government would be acting wisely if they eliminated this item, and reconsidered the effect of granting a bounty for the production of cotton seed upon the established industry of olive-growing. It must be recollected that cotton seed is largely used as an adulterant of certain kinds of olive oil, and we ought to come down heavily upon any article which is used as an adulterant. Certainly we ought not to unfairly handicap those persons who have been struggling for many years to establish the olive oil industry.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[58]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
348,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MCWILLIAMS, William","JUV","Franklin","N/A","N/A",1117,". - I agree with the honorable member who has just spoken, that the system of granting bounties could not be more effectually held up to ridicule than it is being now. We are asked to grant a bounty on the production of an article which is already being produced without one. Olive oil has been produced in Australia for fifty years, and now a bounty is to Le granted on olives, not to . those who have succeeded, but to others who are to compete with them. My sympathies are rather with the men who have had the courage to enter upon the industry without any Government assistance, and who, after fighting for years, have at length made a market for themselves. But the moment they are getting a fair return on their capital, as is the case with the South Australian olive-growers, what kind of encouragement are we asked to give them? We are asked to say to them,  Because you have battled and succeeded, because you have had the pluck to go into this industry and build it up by your own energy, we will encourage people in other States who have not had the pluck to make a market for themselves, to compete with you. Absurdity could go no further than that. I agree with the honorable member for Darling that it is not for us to consider whether the olive industry has succeeded in Victoria or- New South Wales or not. The question for us is - has this industry been firmly established in Australia, and has it succeeded in winning its way in the Australian market? The whole of the evidence placed before the Tariff Commission, the whole of the evidence laid before this Committee, and the whole of the evidence which some of us have obtained from personal inquiry, shows that the olive industry has been established in South Australia, and has failed in Victoria. When a number of us went on an interesting trip to Mildura, we saw there heaps of olive trees which had been chopped down for firewood. I inquired the reason for this, and was told that the industry did not pay, because the price of olives was not remunerative. As one man put it to me, It pays. us better to grow something else. I do hope that the item will not be passed. We have discussed other items about which something like a case was made out - though not to my mind certainly. But on this question of olives not the slightest pretence of an argument has been adduced to show why we should grant a bounty. The honorable member for Bendigo has told us, as the result of his experience as the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, that one of the manufacturers of olive oil came before the Commission, and stated that no additional duty was required, but that what they wanted was to be protected from the very thing on the production of which we have just agreed to pay a bounty. The honorable member for Boothby is driven to vote for this proposal, because the Committee has agreed to a bounty on cotton seed, the oil of which is used to adulterate olive oil. What possible argument can be given in support of a bounty on olives, except that its production has been a success in one State and a failure in another? Every one who has had any experience in production in Australia knows that our markets are subject to fluctuations, and that producers very often meet with failure. Take the hop industry of Tasmania. I am not going to ask Parliament for a bounty for its benefit, but I am quite aware that ruin faced the men who founded the hop industry in that State. For years they had to carry on their business, some of them not merely without a profit, but in the face of heavy losses. During the present year they have had to pay as much as 3d. per lb. for picking, and I know of producers who have been hawking their hops round Hobart for 8d. per lb. The industry has, in fact, been subject to the most severe conditions, but we do not ask for a bounty because it has failed in one particular instance. Nor is it fair to ask for a bounty on olives because the growing of olives has not been a success in Victoria. It has been tried here, and to a considerable extent has been a failure. A large amount of money has been lost in it. Is it, then, fair to say to the men who have made a success of the industry in another State,  We are going to do nothing to help you, but intend to bolster up competition where the industry has been a failure  ?","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[59]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member for Wimmera has shown us what a serious injustice we shall be doing to the taxpayers in giving a bounty on an article which is already subject to duty, and with which we shall have to deal again in a few weeks. Are we to have a double-barrelled shot at this business ? After we have agreed to a bounty, are we to give the industry the benefit of an increased duty under the Tariff? I am prepared to leave the Tariff as it is, but if we are to have increased duties let them be imposed fairly and squarely as protective duties. The history of bounties in Australia has shown that they have not succeeded in establishing industries. One honorable member after another has acknowledged that bounties have been a failure. But we could not do a more absurd thing than to give a bounty to create competition against the very men who are making a good living out of an industry. Personally, if bounties are to be given, I would rather give them to the men who have battled and established industries without Government assistance. I cannot see my way to support the course advocated by the honorable member for Bendigo, which would really penalize the men who have had the pluck to go into this industry without bounties.

I know that some of the manufacturing establishments have olive plantations, but we are now engaged in discussing a proposal for the encouragement of the cultivation of olive trees. It is admitted that the demand for olive oil has not been overtaken by local production, and the reason for this is that the supply of olives is insufficient.

Some honorable members who oppose this bounty were prepared to support one for the encouragement of the cotton seed industry, although cotton seed oil is used to adulterate olive oil. Is that the way to encourage the production of a first-class article? We have heard much in praise of the olive oil manufactured in South Australia, but not a word in condemnation of the adulterated oil with which it has to compete. A much larger quantity of olive oil would be sold but for the fact that the South Australian oil is used solely by those who recognise that it is the only pure article on the market. The mass of the people will always Buy that which is cheapest, unless they know that it means poison. I did my utmost to secure the insertion of a clause in the Commerce Bill that would have been of great value to the olive oil and other industries. A good many members of the Opposition supported me, but, unfortunately, my proposal was defeated. We compel importers of what purports to be olive oil to place a true trade description upon their goods, but as soon as those goods enter the Commonwealth, and are passed through the Customs, they can be adulterated. If we . had insisted on the true trade description remaining on the bottles or packages until they reached the consumer, I should not have supported this bounty on olives. If we insisted upon the true trade description remaining on the imported article until it reached the consumer, local manufacturers would not have to compete with adulterations, and the growers would not ask for a bounty. But until we amend the Commerce Act and the States supplement our efforts by passing Pure Foods Acts, we ought to do all that we can in this direction to encourage the expansion of industries that produce honest commodities.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[60]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It was for that reason that I supported the bounty on cotton, and if we had confined out assistance to the production of cotton alone, instead of also granting a bounty on cotton seed, the oil from which is used to adulterate olive oil, a more effective step would have been taken. I would far rather reverse that decision, and do away with the duty on cotton seed, than resort to what seems to be an ineffective means of counteracting the injury we appear to have thus done to the olive oil industry. It would not be wise to grant a bounty on the production of olives simply on the ground that we have agreed to a bounty on cotton seed. I repeat that I would rather reverse my vote in favour of the cotton seed bounty - a vote that I gave merely because I considered that the bounty proposed on the cotton itself would be utterly inadequate. I took the view that the cotton industry would be assisted by. every bounty granted in- respect of its by-products. We are told that we should agree to this item because of the competition of .-the adulterated article, but I fail to see how this bounty would assist the olive oil industry to overcome that competition. There is a1 proper way to protect an industry from such competition, and I will give all the assistance necessary in that direction. I do not think it is reasonable, however,, to prostitute the objects of this Bill in order to right that wrong. The Bill is designed to encourage- people to enter upon new forms of productive enterprise, and all the evidence we have had goes to prove that the olive oil industry is not only wellestablished, but progressive. The honorable member for Nepean has shown that during the last ten years there has been a steady rise in the output of olive oil.

392,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"REID, George","F4P","East Sydney","N/A","N/A",1122,".- The Attorney-General has become so enthusiastic over the Bill that he speaks of a  big market which is to be secured by means of a bounty totalling, if the . £2,500 per annum is paid for the specified term of fifteen years, £37,500. As a matter of fact, the value of the imports of olive oil in 1906 was only £6,437, we, in this Parliament, are speaking of the consumption which that represents as if it offered a great market which we ought to secure. Of course, an industry which may be small to-day, may grow to great dimensions in days to come, but why should we single this industry out of a hundred other agricultural industries ? . There are numerous industries which have been carried on in connexion with cultivation, and which are open to all sorts of vicissitudes and difficulties. Why are these not to be the subjects of bounties? This olive industry is spoken of in the report in such words as these -The olive tree grows to perfection in most of the States of the Commonwealth, and produces large yields of fruit. Pure olive oil is a commodity which commands a ready sale. . . . Pure olive oil of good quality commands a high price. ... At the same time, there is a safe market for the pure oil of olive; and it has been demonstrated in South Australia on a commercial scale that the industry is of a payable nature.Surely there are more struggling industries which could better be assisted by means of bounties. This is to me one of the least excusable items in the schedule. We desire to see our industries encouraged and developed; but as we are not proposing to give bounties to them all, why should we select this particular industry, which has already acquired a sturdy growth, and has a safe future before it? But there is the complication suggested by the amendment foreshadowed by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo. That honorable and learned member suggests that we should distinguish between olive trees which are already in existence, and olive trees hereafter to be planted, giving the bounty in respect of the latter. I confess that my sympathies are all the other way. It would be cruel to thus distinguish between men who have had the courage to found an industry without assistance and men who have not had the same enterprise, or shown themselves to. be capable of the same sacrifices. The man who has pioneered an industry without help is more worthy of recognition that he who says,  I will not go into the enterprise until you have put cash down to make the attempt safe for me. I have the greatest possible respect for the settlement at Mildura, which I think is one of the grandest in Australia, and one of which we ought to be proud. But I do not suppose there is any land within the Commonwealth which is more profitable to its holders. If we wander over the lands of Australia, and note the annual yield, and if we then turn our eyes to Mildura, we shall find that there men get a more handsome return for their industry than they do elsewhere.

The late Sir Samuel Davenport established and engaged in this industry for years without any assistance or profit, and in the circumstances it seems to me that it would be absolutely unfair now to give a bounty only to those entering afresh upon the industry. 1 cannot see how any private individual could be induced to launch out into a new enterprise in Australia if there were to be kept hanging over his head the possibility that the Commonwealth Parliament might subsequently pass a law to give assistance to others entering into the industry to compete with him. No private individual in the world would embark upon a business under such conditions. I do not know that the olive-growers of South Australia have ever asked for this bounty or that they need it. My own opinion is that the item should be struck out. It should, be remembered that olives can be grown in other parts of Australia as well as South Australia.

In the report of the Queensland Agricultural Department it is stated that the older trees fruit heavily, and what little oil has been made sells readily at 10s. per gallon. Thus we have a production in Australia amounting in value to something like £7,000 a year, and it is proposed to grant a bounty to encourage the production of the oil to a further value of £6,437, which represents the importation for 1906. It appears to me. to be a monstrous proposal to give a bounty to such an industry as this when it would be productive of such a poor result. It is a very big mountain indeed to produce such a very little mouse.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[65]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Whatever we do in this matter, we should treat on an equality all persons concerned in the production of olive oil. If the bounty were paid only to beginners in the business, it would be sufficient to enable them to wipe out those already engaged in it. The honorable and learned member for Bendigo cannot have given the matter full consideration before making his suggestion. If the bounty were to be paid only in respect to fruit yielded by plantations made after the passing of the measure, we should be legislating eight years before the event, because it takes practically that period for an olive tree to come into profitable bearing. I suggest that a way out of the difficulty is to be found by limiting the amount of bounty to be paid to any particular producer. If the bounty were paid as proposed in the Bill, the large producers would undoubtedly get the lions share; but if we provided that not more than , £100 per annum should be paid to any one producer, we should give encouragement to a large number of small growers. This suggestion may appear to conflict with my earlier contention that those already in the industry should not be penalized ; but £100 would be a very considerable amount for any producer to receive.Colonel Foxton. - A coach and horses could be driven through a provision of that sort.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[66]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I believe that a few years experience of its operation will much more effectively convince the people of Australia of the absurdity of these proposals than any argument could do. The electors having declared their partiality for a protective policy, and, incidentally, for the giving of bounties, I am willing that they should have a few years experience of legislation, of this kind, because I think that the effects will be highly educative to them. I have listened with some amusement to the arguments brought forward in support of the proposed bounty for the production of olives. The contention, which seemed to me pre-eminently absurd, is that, because the production of cotton-seed oil, which is used as an adulterant, is subsidized, the production of olive oil should be similarly encouraged. I regret that the laws against adulteration are neither so effective nor so universal in their operation as they ought to be throughout the Commonwealth. But we have nothing to do, I regret to say, with the matter of adulteration in connexion with the productions of the Commonwealth. It lies therefore with the States to see that no adulteration is practised. I believe that one of the reasons for the success of the olive oil industry in recent years is that stringent adulteration laws have been brought into effect in several States, and in that way the people have been educated into an appreciation of olive oil which is undoubtedly far superior to any mixture of olive and cotton-seed oil. I am also pleased to say that, in my opinion, the olive oil of South Australia is entitled to all the advertisement which it is getting out of this debate. But I should be very sorry to see the Committee take such a step as has been suggested by at least one honorable member, and that is to rescind the bounty on the production of cotton-seed, because cotton-seed oil fulfils a very useful function in the industrial and commercial world. Incidentally, I may say that the existence of a protective duty on olive oil which operates against the importation of cotton-seed oil has been the means of interfering with the establishment of what would otherwise have been a very important and profitable industry to the Commonwealth. I refer to certain evidence which was put before the Tariff Commission in connexion with attempts made to develop the maceration of animal fats in order to produce an article which is largely used in cooking, and to establish an industry for which I believe Australia offers a very favorable field. Owing to the existence of the Customs duty on cottonseed oil that industry has been prevented from being started at all, simply because cotton-seed oil is used in order to macerate the animal fat, which ultimately is reduced to the useful article I have referred to. I have listened very carefully to the reasons for and against a bounty being given indiscriminately on the production of olives.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[67]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It keeps out the cotton-seed oil, or only allows it to come in at such an enhanced price that it cannot be used in connexion with the industry I have alluded to. That is a striking instance of how a duty, which was put on to advantage one industry, seriously interferes with another, perhaps even more important. I am inclined to think that the argument for giving the advantage of the bounty to existing growers of olives is largely a sentimental one. Why should the pioneer grower, we are asked, be deprived of the advantage of the proposal?

441,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FOWLER, James","JWG","N/A","N/A","N/A",1126,"- That question might very fairly be asked. I do not think that the old pioneers in the olive oil industry require the State assistance that has been suggested for their benefit. I think it has been shown very clearly to-night that they are in a highly enviable position. I fail to see how any proposal to give a bounty only to the new growers of olives will mean the slightest disadvantage to the present growers, at least for many years to come. I admit that it is somewhat absurd to say that the bounty should not go to all who cultivate the olive. But it seems to me a still greater absurdity to give the bounty to those who do not require it. The Minister in charge of the measure has to-night stated emphatically the object of the bounty, and that is to increase the cultivation of olives. If that is so, I contend that we are going away absolutely from the purpose of the bounty, if we give it to those who are already producing and profitably producing olives. We want to be as logical and consistent as we can ; I admit that it is very difficult to be so in political life, but in this case I think we can be. I hold that we ought to keep before us the distinct object of a bounty, and that is to give an impetus to an industry which has not yet come into successful operation. Although we have the industry established in one State, still, apparently, it has not been successful in other States, and, therefore, the object, in my opinion, should be to direct the bounty to those parts of Australia where evidently such an artificial stimulus as this is required. That is the logical and consistent intention of the bounty. With regard to the contention that olive growers will be penalized by such a bounty, if applied to only new olive growers, I would point out that there is a very simple and obvious way of getting out of that difficulty, if difficulty iris. We are asked to enact that the bounty shall operate for fifteen years. It is a fact, I believe, that olive trees do not come into bearing until they are at least eight years old.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[67]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I think that if the proposal is adopted by the Committee the difficulty as stated by many honorable members will be overcome, but I certainly intend to support the proposal of the honorable member for Bendigo, and will also move in the direction of reducing the term of years during which the bounty is to be payable from fifteen to eight, that is, assuming that the Committee is still prepared to give that protection to an industry which I think does not require it.Colonel FOXTON(Brisbane) [9.53]. - I do not want to dwell on this matter unnecessarily ; but on the second reading of the Bill I intimated that I had some difficulty in regard to the general propositions which it contains, owing to the fact that our experience of bounties in Queensland has not been altogether satisfactory. I said then, and I think so still, that there will not be any great permanent advantage derived from the granting of the bounties comprised in this schedule. At the same time when a considerable majority of the Committee appears to be quite willing to grant bounties of this kind, and when most of the products which are made the subject-matter of them are peculiarly adapted for growth in the State from which I come, I think I should not be doing my duty as a representative of that State if I did not accept the good things which a majority of honorable members propose to confer upon that State together with other States and portions of States in which the various commodities can be grown. My opinion may be entirely wrong - and I hope it may be - and the opinion of the majority may be entirely right. It is quite possible that a very considerable benefit may ultimately be derived from the permanent establishment of some of these industries. Upon a previous occasion I threw out a suggestion which, if adopted, would, I think, have met every objection that has been raised to the amendment suggested by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, and to other proposals which have been made as to the best method of dealing with the olive-oil industry. I am entirely in sympathy with the views entertained by the honorable member for Wide Bay and others, who have pointed out that it would be most unfair to authorize the payment of the bounty only upon the fruit of trees which may be planted after the passing of this Bill, because it would, when paid, subject the pioneers of the industry to most unfair competition.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[67]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The suggestion which I threw out on a former occasion was that the incidence of the bounty should not commence until a sufficient period had elapsed to enable the  new  growers to claim the bounty. Then it could be shared equally by the growers of olives, irrespective of whether they were old or new. In other words, the bounty should not be exclusively enjoyed by those who are already engaged in the industry, during the six, seven, or eight years which must necessarily elapse before the new growers will be able to claim it. We have been assured that the industry is already established in South Australia upon a sound commercial basis. If that be so, those who are engaged in it at the present time do not require the aid of a bounty. As the Attorney-General interjected while the honorable member for Echuca was speaking, these bounties are intended by the Government to establish new industries, and not to feed well-established ones such as the olive-oil industry in South Australia.

One honorable member has said that there is no more justification for authorizing the payment of a bounty upon cotton and cotton-seed than there is for granting similar encouragement to the production of olives. Surely the answer to that statement is obvious. As has already been pointed out, the production of olive oil is equal to one-third of the consumption in Australia.

I am opposed to the principle of bounties, and I intend to vote against this particular item. The report of the experts upon olive oil states -Pure olive oil of good quality commands a high price, and this fact has induced manufacturers to use a cheap substitute. At the same time there is a safe market for the pure oil of olives, and it has been demonstrated in South Australia on a commercial scale that the industry is of a payable nature. . . . Notwithstanding the perfection to which the olive grows in Australia, the demand for pure olive oil is greater than the supply. . . . The industry, although established in South Australia, is not as popular as it might be - and now comes a choice expression or opinion - and if a bounty will improve matters there are many reasons why it should be provided.My idea is that the production of olive oil should not be encouraged by the payment of a bounty. I am firmly of opinion that cotton-seed oil, which has been so much maligned during the course of this debate, will gradually come into use as a substitute for olive oil. It is a very much cheaper commodity, and it is that consideration alone which has caused growers in Mildura to uproot the olive trees which they had planted.I am going to quote from a book issued by the American Government. This volume alone is an object-lesson to us. It is the Year-Book of the United States Department of Agriculture. Why should not something of the same sort be issued in Australia? It contains most valuable information about cotton-seed oil, palm oil, olive oil, sisal hemp, and numbers of other commodities. It is produced by the American Government for the use of farmers and others. The money that we intend to spend on bounties could be far better utilized in the establishment of agricultural colleges and the publication of information in the form of volumes such as this. Speaking about cotton-seed oil, it says -Its first introduction into trade and commerce was as an adulterant ; and, as is usually the case with adulterants, its own title to consideration as a product of inherent comestible value thereby became considerably impaired in the popular esteem.It adds that 30 per cent. of the cotton-seed oil now manufactured in the United States is purchased by packing houses. That does not refer particularly to the packing houses in Chicago. it is utilized -In the manufacture of various substitutes for lard. In fact, the price of this oil is now largely regulated by the fluctuations in the price of lard. Subsequent important uses to which this product has been put are as a substitute for olive oil in the packing of sardines and similar fish, as an ingredient in the manufacture of artificial butter, and for giving a natural butter colour to oleomargarine From the foregoing, it becomes apparent that the chief use of cotton-seed oil is the preparation of human food. Practically all the high grades are utilized for edible purposes.Itis evident that this oil is gradually sup planting olive oil.","N/A","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[68]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
