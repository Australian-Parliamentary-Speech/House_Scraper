I received this morning, from a soldier who has been four years at the Front, . a letter which is typical of the representations that have been made to me. This man, who was gassed and wounded while on active service, and is now suffering from bronchitis, states that his landlord has notified him that- he intends to raise his rent 2s. per week. About ten days ago the mother of a soldier also called on me, and complained that it was the intention of her landlord to raise her rent 4s.. per week. I am speaking now only of Melbourne cases, and I do not propose at this stage to give the names of the landlords or the persons complaining. I do not know what power the Commonwealth Parliament has in. this matter, but I desire to say that this Government will not, and the Parliament ought not, to permit this sort of thing. My soldier correspondent points out that his landlord is a rich man. An ex-colleague of mine used to describe himself as a  poor landlord. I do not know whether there are any poor landlords; but there can. be no excuse in this case, as the landlord is rich, and, in all probability, there is no excuse, save in very few instances. The practice, at all events, ought not to continue. I hope that landlords will accept this public intimation that in future the first step I shall take on receiving such a complaint will be to publish as widely as the press will give publicity to my utterances the names and the particulars in each case, so that these people may be pilloried by the public. The next thing I shall do -will be to exhaust every possibility of punishing those persons and preventing them from continuing their action.","Increases of Rent","LANDLORDS AND SOLDIER TENANTS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If issued to sisters (married or unmarried) they could not, of course, convey the same meaning, and the issue would necessitate an alteration in principle to the regulations. A wide distribution of bars would be entailed, thus detracting vastly from the value now attached to the bars . issued to mothers only. Such alteration is not considered advisable.In the case under review the person (mother) entitled to receive a badge was stated to be living during the absence of the sons on active service, and her right to the badge and bars was established, and in accordance with the information given in the House on the 18th September (Hansard, page 12530), such badge and bars would in the ordinary course on the decease of the mother revert to her heir or legatee - not the heir or legatee of the soldier - in this instance probably the father or the married sister in question.The sister in this case claimed a badge, but apparently in her own right, and not as the legatee of her mother. If the sister sent neither husband nor son to the war she is clearly not in her own right entitled to any bars, and in the event of a claim being made by the father as legatee of the deceased mother, the badge issued to the sister (with bars added) would legally revert to the father. If the sister is the heir or legatee she is entitled to receive both badge and bars.If particulars of the soldiers in question are furnished, the matter will be fully investigated.","FEMALE RELATIVES WAR BADGES","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[27]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This afternoon the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) stated that he did not know whether the Commonwealth had power to deal with people who are increasing the rents of houses occupied by returned soldiers. I hold the opinion that, without going to the people for additional powers, the Government can deal effectually with profiteering, and that they are in exactly the same position as when the proclamation was issued in 1914 declaring that we were in a state of war. That proclamation has not been lifted, and will not be until we ratify the agreements for the settlement of the war. We have the power to control the position, but, for some reason or other, we fail to use it. To endeavour to hoodwink the people for electioneering purposes is useless. We should tell them that we still have the power that we possessed during the war. Why procrastinate? Why adjourn to-morrow in order to attend an agricultural show in Melbourne?

If the Prime Minister thinks that by adjourning over tomorrow, or until next week, this House will put him in a better position to proceed with business, I am prepared to assist him to that extent, so that he may bring in the legislation that he has promised so freely, but which he seems to be so tardy in producing.","Royal Agricultural Show","SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That appears to be a most alarming expenditure, but whether or not it would be a beneficial expenditure depends entirely on the point of view. As the meeting of the House tomorrow night would probably cost £15 8s. 6d., or something like that, I can understand that in the interests of economy it would be advisable to adjourn until Friday. I think the Prime Ministers proposal is an eminently proper one. I am certainly of opinion, as the result of previous visits to the Show, that it is an advantage for members to see what is there.

124,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HUGHES, William Morris","DQC","Bendigo","NAT","Prime Min,ister and Attorney-General",12678,". - I mover -That this Bill be now read a second time.This is a . Bill to approve the agreement made1 between- the Government of the United Kingdom, the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Government of New Zealand, the terms of which are set out in the schedule.Before I proceed to deal with the agreement itself, some general observations are necessary in regard to Nauru, its pre-war position, the circumstances in which it was- taken over- from Germany, and the value and nature of its phosphatic deposits. Nauru, a a honorable members are, no doubt, aware-, is a very small island, about 5-,0(J0 acres in extent, situated a few miles to the south of the equator, and in about the same latitude as Ocean Island.Before the war this island was part of the German Empire, and on the outbreak of the war, or shortly afterwards - in fact, on the 19th August - the British authorities suggested to the Commonwealth Government that it should occupy Nauru, in common with all the rest of the islands of the Bismarck Archipelago. In November, the- intervening time having been spent in the occupation of New Guinea and the adjacent islands, Australian Forces from Rabaul took possession of Nauru, andi are there now, having remained in occupation ever since. So much for the sovereignty of the island.. It was German before the war,, it was occupied at the outbreak of the war, or almost immediately after, by the Australian troops, and is garrisoned by them now.Now, a word, as to the mandate-that is to say; the tenure under which the sovereignty of the. island is held at present. In considering the question of the mandates, the Allies and Associated Powers decided that all the islands in the Pacific south of the line, excepting Samoa and Nauru, should be vested in the Commonwealth of Australia. . Samoa went to New Zealand, and the Council of Four decided that the mandate for Nauru was to be vested in the- British Empire as distinguished from, any particular part thereof. Nauru then became a domestic question to be settled by the various members of the Empire amongst themselves.On behalf of the Commonwealth, I pressed the claim of Australia to control Nauru under exactly the same terms and conditions as the other islands of the Archipelago. I shall not trouble honorable members with any further reference to the negotiations that ensued beyond saying that they were long, difficult, and finally settled by the agreement which honorable members, have now before them. The joint control, of this island was conferred upon Britain, Australia, and New Zealand by the British  Delegation - that body, as I said* previously in. this House, which is usually called the Imperial Cabinet - a body made up of representatives of the various self-governing Dominions of the United Kingdom and of India. The mandate was vested by the Council of the Four in the British Empire. It was left to the various members of the Empire to decide who should administer, it- and work the phosphates. . ,This brings me to the next point to which I wish to draw the attention of honorable members. Before the war the ownership of the island:, as distinguished from its sovereignty - that is to say, the ownership of the phosphates and the right to work them- had been acquired by a British company,, in which . there was at that time a very large German, holding. The German element has been of course, eliminated. .I am not prepared, to say what is the nature of the title of this British, company to this island-. I am not prepared to admit that it has- any title. I am here to protect the interests of the Commonwealth,, but honorable members, if they look, at the agreement, will see in- what way the rights., if any, of this company, or any, company, to this island- are to be acquired. The purpose of the agreement, is to make the phosphates available at cost price to the three parties to the agreement - the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Dominion of New Zealand - on the basis of the agricultural requirements of .each. That is to be the basis cai which each one of these parties , is to participate in the phosphatic deposits of Nauru, subject to the terms of the agreement as set out in the schedule, which defines clearly the proportions to which each one is actually entitled.Phosphatic deposits are immensely valuable. I do not speak now of the phosphatic deposits on Nauru only, but of phosphatic deposits generally. They are essential not merely to our agriculture, but to agriculture the world over. The worlds production of rock phosphate before the war was about 7,000,000 tons a year. Of that the United States produced about 3,000,000 tons, and Algeria and Tunis between them another 3,000,000 tons, the balance being made up from Ocean Island, Christmas Island - which is in the Straits Settlements - and Nauru. The pre-war production of Nauru was somewhere between 90,000 and 100,000 tons a year, and that of Ocean Island about 250,000 tons.Before I deal with the extent to which phosphates are at present required for agricultural and pastoral purposes in Australia, I should like to say something as to .the estimated value of this island. As I have said, its actual output before the war was between 90,000 and 100,000 tons a year, while the f.o.b. price before the war was 30s., and, during the war, about £2. It is difficult to get a reliable estimate of the extent and value of the phosphates on the island, of Nauru, for the estimates given differ very widely. A conservative estimate puts it at S0,000,000 tons, another even as low as 42,000,000 tons. Beyond stating that it is a very valuable property, I shall not commit myself to any definite figure. To all intents and purposes, the whole island is made up of phosphatic rock, which some of those best able to judge consider to be worth hundreds of millions. In an article in the West Australian on the 23rd August of this year, Lieutenant Gordon Clifton states that the island is practically one mass of phosphates; that there are approximately 80,000,000 tons in view, and that scientists assert that there are between 430,000,000 and 450,000,000 tons of phosphates available. That writer also states that it is calculated that, given reasonable shipping facilities, the deposit is -sufficient to supply present-day de,mands- -that is the whole worlds demands - for at least 100 years. That, of course, is a statement for which the writer must take full responsibility, but I give it for what it is worth. It is quite as valuable as the one I quoted previously, and the man who wrote the article has, at least, had the advantage of seeing the place, and is, I believe,, an expert. Then, again, in giving evidence before the Inter-State Commission, Mr. King, of the Pacific Phosphate Company, speaking of the value as dis.tinguished from the amount of phosphates, said -From Nauru in 1914 there was exported between 90,000 and .100,000 tons of phosphates. It was estimated that, of the- 5,600 acres which formed the total area of the island, 4,500 acres contained phosphate deposits to the extent of some 300,000,000 tons. The total value of the deposits on Nauru might be put down at £375,000,000.I am unable to say how far such evidence may be regarded as conclusive, but merely give it for what it is worth. That the phosphatic deposits on Nauru are valuable is beyond all question, and it is also certain that our share under the agreement is ample for our requirements for the next hundred years.Without .phosphates Australia cannot progress. .We are a progressive nation, and year .by year require a greater supply of this necessity. Thi3 agreement, which vests in us, as one of the parties, 42 .per cent, of the total output of the island, gives us a most valuable asset, not one that endureth for- a day, but an asset that will last for a century or more. It will give the agriculture of this country, at a reasonable .rate, the material which is its very life blood. We shall be able to sell phosphates to the farmer at cost price; that is- to say, the price at which the Commission is able to get the phosphatic rock into the ship, transport it to the port of discharge, and there turn the rock into the form in which it is immediately available for use by the farmer. The agreement, therefore, is of immense importance to the agricultural, and even the pastoral, welfare of Australia, and will be some set-off against the huge expenditure which -we incurred during the war.I call the attention of the House to  some figures bearing on the terms of the agreement, the application of which honorable members will readily see for themselves. It is estimated that the requirements of Australia in imported phosphates for the next few years will be 200,000 tons per annum. We imported during the year 1914-15 173,000 tons, and during the year 1915-16 .190,000 tons of phosphates from Nauru and Ocean Island. No less than 88 per cent, of all our imports of phosphates of all kinds were rock phosphates from those two islands. The United Kingdom imported only 50,000 tons of rock phosphates from the Pacific Islands, although it imported 562,000 tons from all countries. Thus the United Kingdom imported less- than 10 per cent, of its requirements .in the form of rock phosphates from the Pacific. The prices given to me, which I give to the House for what they are worth, assuming that they are . 1914 prices, although they may he 1915 prices, are: Guano, £4 5s. per ton; superphosphates, £3 3s. per ton ; and rock phosphates, £2 7s. 8d. per ton. Of guano, we imported only 100 tons in 1914-15, and 90 tons in 1915-16, but 13,000 tons in 1916-17, when  we were unable to get superphosphates.The artificial manures used in Australia, covering, not merely phosphates, but all varieties, amounted in 1915-16 to 381,000 tons, and in 1916-17 to 346,000 tons, so that 58 per cent, of all the artificial manures used in this country were rock phosphates. Honorable members will, therefore, see what a tremendous influence this agreement will have on the welfare and progress of the agriculture of the Commonwealth. We shall have at once an assured supply at the cheapest possible rates that can be obtained in the world, because the article will be obtained at cost price. I direct attention, also, to the fact that we get, in addition to this, our share of any profits on the sale of all phosphates over and above what we consume in Australia. .This very valuable property is to be acquired in the way set out in the schedule, at a fair valuation. Article 7 provides -Any right, title, or interest which the Pacific Phosphate Company or any person may have in the said deposits, land, buildings, plant, and equipment (so - far as such right, title, and interest is not dealt with by the Treaty of Peace) shall be converted into a claim for compensation at a fair valuation.That means that if any right, title, or interest is held by an enemy it ils covered by the Treaty of Peace, and . we need not concern ourselves with it. If it is held by a British company, or by some person other than an enemy, it is to be acquired at a fair valuation. The method agreed upon between Lord Milner, Mr. Massey, and myself was that Lord Milner should endeavour to make an agreement with the company at what was considered by all of us to be a fair price, and that, failing an agreement, the matter should go to arbitration in the usual way. I do not intend to indicate to the House what we consider a fair price. If I gave too low a figure, I should mislead the House, and if I gave a figure higher than that which it is worth it would be used by the company in the proceedings before the arbitrator, or in their negotiations with the Secretary of State. I did, however, mention a figure, to the Secretary of State, beyond which we are not prepared to go without consultation. If the matter comes down to a direct affair, and is not referred, to arbitration, that figure, of course, will be presented to this Parliament, which can express its own opinion on it.An important point not raised in this agreement, but nevertheless dealt with during the course of the negotiations between the Governments of Great Britain, New Zealand, and the Commonwealth of Australia, as represented by their respective delegates, is the acquisition of Ocean Island. Its acquisition is quite outside the agreement, but it is owned- by the same company. They say,  You are going to acquire Nauru, and one of two things will happen. Either you will ruin our business, or we shall- compete with you in those markets where you must find openings for your excess products. Probably. the consideration which moved them in the matter at all was the disastrous , effect that our competition would have upon them. It is evident that when a company which had a monopoly, as this company had, for all practical purposes in the Pacific, is faced with an agreement which takes that monopoly from them, and raises up not merely a powerful competitor, but a competitor which can defy them, the value of their shares is forced down on the market, and the value of their property seriously depreciated. So it is probable that we shall ask Parliament to consider the taking over of Ocean Island also. That, however, will form the subject of another agreement. The taking over of Ocean Island would be of incalculable benefit to Australia, and I can think of no better business deal to which this country could commit itself. We shall go into that business, of course; with the United Kingdom and New Zealand, but with the United Kingdom, anyhow. If by any chance New Zealand should not ratify this agreement, Great Britain and Australia - assuming this Parliament will ratify it - will take the whole thing over. Therefore the position is one for this Parliament to determine for itself. I hope that I have made the position clear in regard to Ocean Island. Under this Bill we incur no liability in regard to it, . but it is very much to our interests to secure it, in order that we may be in a position to work both deposits or either to meet the requirements of the market. We shall be able to work the two of them more cheaply.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Administrator is to preserve law and- order. He is responsible for the government, of the country as prescribed by .the mandate; that is to say, there shall be no slavery, or forced labour, and no sale of alcohol to indigenes; the .island cannot be fortified, and. so on. In all respects otherwise he is vested with the powers of an ordinary Administrator or Governor in regard to the maintenance of law and order. His functions are quite- distinct from those of the Commissioners. Article 1 provides that he shall have power to make Ordinances for the peace, order, and good government of the island subject to the terms of the agreement, and particularly - but so as not to limit the generality of the foregoing provisions - to provide for the education of children on the island, to establish and maintain the necessary police force, and to establish and appoint Courts and magistrates with civil and criminal jurisdiction. The first Administrator is to be appointed for a term, of five years by the Australian Government. All the expenses of the administration, including the remuneration of the Administrator and of the Commissioners, so far as they are not met by other revenues, are to be defrayed out of the proceeds of the sales of the phosphates.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

130,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HUGHES, William Morris","DQC","N/A","N/A","N/A",12681,"- The Administrator is in quite a different position. He is to be appointed by the three Governments. They take it in turn to make the appoinment.He is limited by the terms of the agreement. He must not interfere with the -Commissioners in the working of the phosphate deposits. He cannot go outside the terms of the agreement nor of those of the mandate, but under the agreement there are certain duties imposed on him, such as the education of children and others I have already mentioned. Civil administration is one thing; the conduct of a business quite another. Governments have a right to control civil . administration, but this is a business proposition in which three Parliaments, possibly with conflicting interests, are concerned. Who would set his name to an agreement which could be rendered- absolutely worthless by the interference of a Parliament over which we had absolutely no control i Whatever we. may think of doing in this country, we cannot allow other people to interfere and say what we are or are hot to do.Article 7 provides for the taking over of the interests of the Pacific Phosphate Company at a fair valuation, . and the amount of the compensation decided upon is to be contributed by the Governments of the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth of Australia, and the Dominion of New Zealand, in proportions to be mutually agreed upon, or, in the event of their failing to allot proportions, within three months of this agreement coming into force, then in the same proportion as the first allotment of phosphates under Article 14. That Article says that each of the three Governments shall be entitled to an allotment of the phosphates produced each year in the following proportions : -United Kingdom - 42 per cent.Australia - 42 per cent.New Zealand - 16 per cent.Those are the proportions in which we shall contribute towards the compensation to be paid to the Pacific Phosphate Company. We shall pay 42 per cent... the United Kingdom 42 per cent., and New Zealand 16 per cent. In turn, we are entitled to 42 per cent, of the output, the United Kingdom to 42 per cent, of the output, and New Zealand to 16 per cent, of the output.Article 9 provides that the deposits shall be worked and sold under the direction, management, and control of the Commissioners, subject to the terms of the agreement, and .that it shall be the duty of the Commissioners to dispose of the phosphates according to the agricultural requirements of the United Kingdom; Australia, and New Zealand. This article is of fundamental importance. There ds no fixed proportion for the distribution of the phosphates; the agricultural requirements of the three countries are to be ascertained, and upon that basis each has a right, to a proportion of the phosphates on the Island of Nauru. I have already explained that 88 per cent, of Australias importations of phosphates came from the two Pacific islands, Ocean Island and Nauru Island. On the other hand, Britain took less than 10 per cent, of her total importations of phosphates from these two islands. Naturally, our geographical position, compared with hers, serves to prove that we shall be the greatest gainers under this agreement, because we are near at hand while she is far off. She can get her phosphates from Algiers, Tunis, and America. If Britain takes her supplies from Nauru or Ocean Island she must pay freight on a water carriage of 13,000 or 14,000 miles. Australia, on the other hand, is within 2,000 or 3,000 miles of the deposits. Article 10 provides -The Commissioners shall not, except with the unanimous consent of the three Commissioners, sell or supply any phosphates to, or for shipment to, any country or place other than the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.The Commissioners, cannot, without general consent, sell to any country other than the three parties to. the agreement.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

132,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HUGHES, William Morris","DQC","N/A","N/A","N/A",12682,"- The word  agricultural would cover all requirements relating to the land, but not those relating to manufacture, and certainly would not cover treatment and export. Suppose that Great Britain took 100,000 tons of phosphates, manufactured it, and exported it, she would not in that case enjoy the benefits of Article 9. If Britain does not use her fair share of the output, Australia and New Zealand would be entitled to the quantity not required by Britain, in the proportions of 42 and 16 per cent. On the other hand, if Australia sells to the world that portion of Britains share, the three parties to the agreement - theUnited Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand - will be entitled to the profits arising from such sales in the proportions of 42, 42, and 16 per cent.Article 11 provides -Phosphates shall be supplied to the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand at the same f.o.b. price, to he fixed by the Commissioners on a basis which will cover . working expenses, cost of management, contribution to Administrative expenses, interest on capital, a sinking fund for the redemption of capital and for other purposes unanimously agreed on by the Commissioners and other charges.Any phosphates not required by the three Governments may be sold by the Commissioners at the best price obtainable.These charges must be unanimously agreed upon, but they . are such as are usually debited against any ordinary business. It is very important to note the last paragraph in that Article, in view of the evidence of Mr. King, that the value of the phosphates on Nauru Island alone is £375,000,000, and another statement, by Lieutenant Clifton, that the deposits are estimated at between 430,000,000 and 450,000,000 tons. It is only fair to say that, although the output of Nauru was only 100,000 tons per annum, it can be increased to 300,000 tons per annum without any trouble whatever. I ask honorable members to note that we not only get our own agricultural requirements but, if we like to develop the deposits, we can have an abundance to sell to the world at the worlds price, and we shall share in the profits resulting therefrom on the basis of 42 percent, each to the United Kingdom and Australia, and 16 per cent, to New Zealand. Article 12 amplifies what I have already said. Article 13 states -There shall be no- interference by any of the three Governments with the direction, management, or control of the business of working, shipping, or selling the phosphates, and each of the three Governments binds itself not to do or to permit any act or thing contrary to or inconsistent with the terms and purposes of this agreement.I have already dealt with that condition ; but I again emphasize it, because in my opinion it is very necessary. It would be a monstrous thing if by some political action the Commissioners for New Zealand or the United Kingdom could interfere with our interests to our detriment. Political action, therefore, is eliminated entirely. We have control, over- our Com missioner; we can substitute another if we choose; but we cannot, and we have no right to, do anything more. The position is very much the same as it is in any ordinary company. Every shareholder has an interest, and every director is appointed to represent such interests. The shareholders may remove a director, but they cannot alter the memoranda of agreement except as prescribed by law.With Article 14 I need not deal further, except to point out that besides prescribing the proportions in which the phosphates are to be allotted, it provides that such supplies shall be for home consumption for agricultural purposes in the country of allotment, and not for export. That is. most favorable to Australia, because, perhaps, ten years hence we shall be using half as much again, and possibly twice as much phosphates as we use now. We are near to the source of supply, whilst Britain is afar off. She can get phosphates much closer at hand, and no matter what the f.o.b. price of the deposits at Nauru Island may be, it will probably always pay Britain better to get some, if not all, of her phosphates from America and Algiers. Another paragraph of Article 14 reads -At the expiration of the period of five years from the coming into force of this agreement, and every five years thereafter, the basis of allotment shall be re-adjusted in accordance with the actual requirements of each country.That again is favorable to us. Consider the circumstances of Britain contrasted with those of Australia. Britain is a country whose opportunities of agricultural development . are obviously limited. She may expand still further in that direction, but such . expansion must necessarily be small. Australia, on the other hand, has just begun to till the soil. People -who are living 100 years hence will look back upon, these days, and speak of what we are doing, as the Americans of to-day look back at the men who clustered about Washington, or lived prior to- his time. Because honorable members must remember that the strides made now not only in production generally, but particularly in primary production, are such that no man can set a limit to what this country will produce fifty years, or even twenty years, hence.I call attention to the next paragraph -If in any year any of the three Governments does not require any portion of its allotment, the other Governments shall be entitled, so far as their requirements for home consumption extend, to have that portion allotted among themselves in the proportions of the percentages to which they are entitled as above.If Britain does not take all the phosphates to which she is entitled, Australia and New Zealand may claim the balance, which is to be divided in the proportion of 42 to 16. If we use that portion for agricultural requirements, we shall get it at the f .o.b. price. If, on the other hand, we sell it elsewhere, then, of course, as already stated, the three countries will share in whatever profit is made over and above the cost of production and marketing. The last paragraph of Article 14 reads -Where any proportion of the allotment of one of the Governments is not taken up by that Government, that Government shall, when the phosphates are sold, be credited with the amount of the cost price as fixed by the Commissioners under the first paragraph of Article 11; but if such phosphates are sold to a purchaser other than one of the Governments any profit above the said cost price shall be carried to the surplus fund mentioned in Article 12That is to say, we shall pay the f.o.b. price for it. . If, on the other hand, it is sold in open market, where it may fetch twice as much as the f.o.b. price, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand will share proportionately.I do not think I need say any more in explanation of the Bill. The agreement is very clear, and speaks for itself. It is the result of long negotiations, and I commend it most heartily and unreservedly to the House. By virtue of this arrangement, Australia gets access to a commodity which is vital to her primary industries. It gives the Australian producer an opportunity by providing cheaper manures to compete on more equal terms with competitors in other parts of the world. It does something to remove that handicap which is imposed upon him by reason of his remoteness from the great centres of Europe where he finds his market. It provides him with a cheaper article, thereby making farming more profitable, and therefore more desirable, and so is a direct incentive to land settlement. The most effective ways of getting people to settle on the land is to make work on the land profitable. When you have done that you need not write prospectuses or stories about  Back to the Land. People will go always where they can get a good profit; that is human nature. This is a very material and obvious means by which the lot of the man on the land can be made more desirable, because more profitable. I wish . to emphasize again the fact that we are dealing with a matter of tremendous value, not only to the farmer, but also to the people of Australia. In all human probability, we shall take over the control of Ocean Island as well as Nauru Island, but even if we do not, we shall be dealing with an asset of immense value. The deposits on Nauru may not be worth £375,000,000, as was estimated by Mr. King, but they are obviously worth £80,000,000, £90,000,000, or £100,000,000. The island will produce more phosphates than Australia will require. . We can sell some of the surplus in the markets of the world, and so relieve the taxpayer of some, although not much, of the burden which otherwise would fall entirely on his shoulders. For all these reasons - because this agreement is good for the farmer, because on the basis of land settlement the welfare of Australia must rest; because our problem now is to get people from the great cities on to the land ; because at- this particular time, when our young men have returned from abroad with their minds unsettled, it is of the highest importance to get them to see in the land an avenue that opens wider and wider, and becomes more and more attractive, and is less limited than are avenues provided by the great cities; and because these phosphates are an asset of great value to the whole community, I hope that the agreement will be ratified without delay.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Prime Minister says that, as a result of this agreement, the Government will be able to give the farmers cheap manures; but if the conversion of the phosphatic rock into manures is to remain in the hands of private companies there is no foundation for such a statement. It would seem that the Prime Ministers promise in regard to this matter, like many others made in. the course of an election campaign, is a promise made only to be broken.I have been reading up this question, and I find that while the deposits on Ocean Island are probably the best in the world those found in Nauru compare very favorably with them. Under the Treaty of Peace the disposition of the Island of Nauru is determined, while under this agreement provision is made for the payment of compensation to the Pacific Phosphate Company which controlled the export of phosphatic rock from the island before the war.  Before the war the whole of the island was nominally controlled by Germany, but the export of its phosphatic deposits was controlled by the Pacific Phosphate Company, which, I believe, also owns Ocean Island. While the agreement was under discussion in England it was stated in the press that that company intended to make an enormous claim for compensation.

One of these relates to the treatment of the natives. . Under the terms of the mandate granted to us the natives are not to be supplied with alcohol or firearms, and fortifications on the island are prohibited. Missionaries are to be permitted to continue their work on the island, and, according to articles I have read, many missionary societies, are competing for the good-will of the natives. It has. been stated that in order to compel the natives or coolies to work for it, the Pacific Phosphate Company has been destroying the cocoanut trees, and in other ways making it impossible for the natives to exist unless they work for it. It is said that there has been in the past a system of forced native labour on both Ocean Island and Nauru. I hope that when the Administrator takes charge that system will not be tolerated, and that the natives will be allowed to secure a livelihood without being forced to work on- these deposits.In the first article of the agreement it is provided that the administration of the islands shall be vested in an Administrator who shall be appointed for a term of five years by the Commonwealth, and that thereafter the Administrator shall be appointed in such manner as the three Governments decide.

Mr. Thomas J. McMahon, in an article in. Worlds Work, says -There are hundreds of Japanese employed at Ocean Island, and hundreds of Chinese at Nauru, supplemented by hundreds of natives from the Gilbert and Ellice Group, the Marshalls, and the Carolines, and small numbers of Ocean and Nauru islanders.These phosphatic deposits are of great importance to our farmers, because in Australia their application has resulted . in an increased yield. The Germans, instead of utilizing these deposits, were, as stated in the article to which I have referred,  walking on millions. Their objective was a submarine base, and they had there one of the most powerful stations, if not the most powerful, in the world, from which, even after the war, they could speak to Berlin. This island has now been taken over by the various Governments, though not in accordance with this agreement, because the destiny of the island was fixed by the Treaty of Peace. The natives of this island, according to the article in Worlds Work, sent a petition to King George after the occupation by the Australians, asking that under no circumstances should they be returned to the administration of Germany.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Although both islands are under the same management, Nauru has been worked to a great extent , only since the Avar began, before which there was not much export of phosphates. The reason for this was that the island was in German occupation, and the company did not get to work; and, on the face of it, it would appear as if the company had anticipated making  something good out of the enterprise. That is why I expressed the hope that great care will be exercised in the appointment of the arbitrator who has to decide what price shall be paid.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At the time the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) was negotiating the agreement, a cable message appeared in the Herald objecting, in the interests of . Australia, to the price asked by the company. Although this island was held by the Germans, the British company practically controlled the whole, and the employees were Australians . and other Britishers. As in the case of Ocean Island, the company pretty well ruled the place ; but since the war the British Government have made both Ocean Island and Nauru a Crown Colony under a Governor or Administrator. Since the Avar, Japan has started to work other material from the Carolines,which is said to be of inferior grade; but before the war Japan took nearly as much phosphatic rock from Nauru as Ave did from Ocean Island. Since then, however, Japan has gone to the Carolines. British and German experts, we are told, say that there is not the unlimited quantity of phosphates at Nauru that some persons imagine. It has been estimated by these experts that the quantity is about 40,000,000 tons, and not 400,000,000 tons, as stated by others. It is quite possible, of course, that if the company was trying to attract more capital, the larger figure may have been mentioned in the prospectus.Although there is to be a triple ownership of these islands, I presume that the agreement will provide for one. set of officials; that, although there is to be an Administrator and three Commissioners appointed by the Governments concerned, the Administrator will confine himself to civil matters, and the Commissioners to the business side. At any rate, I hope there will be only one set pf officials, and not three.I should have preferred, before we were asked to vote on this agreement, to see the mandate about which we have heard so much. As matters stand, we are .asked to assent to this agreement before we have even seen the conditions. I hope that the rosy picture painted . by the Prime Minister will be realized, and that our farmers will be assured of an adequate supply of phosphates.

They were most unworthy reflections, because it is well known that no section of the community played the game during the war to a better or greater extent than they did. They did not in any way take advantage of war conditions, or seek to increase their profits; on the contrary, they satisfied themselves with a modest return on capital. I remember reading in the newspapers some time ago a statement by one. of our largest manufacturers, with property, plant, and machinery worth something like £250,000 for the manufacture of superphosphates, that during the progress of the war his return did not exceed more than 3 per cent. It is well known that very few, if any, manufacturers of superphosphates charged or received more than 5 per cent, during that period. They refused to put up their prices against the farmer. They were content with a smaller price, and are entitled rather to credit for having done so than to reflections such as have been made by my honorable friend, with, I am sure, a want of knowledge of the facts.The island of Nauru, is so far as its ownership and control are concerned, is to be transferred from the German Empire to the British Empire. That is a matter concerning which we have to offer our distinguished delegates our heartiest congratulations. In this, as in other respects, they have, indeed, made a most excellent bargain. By it they have given a certain amount of guarantee to the agricultural interests of Australia that they will not lack fertilizers in the future. That will be a useful factor in regard to agricultural development. But what gave me most gratification in the Prime Ministers speech was the statement that this undertaking was to be conducted absolutely as a business proposition, without any political interference whatever.The right honorable gentleman gave the specially valuable information that negotiations are to take place for the acquisition of Ocean Island also. If we were to be confined to the management of Nauru Island, we could not hope to produce rock phosphates there at anything like the price at which they can be turned out by the present private company, which has the great and all-important advantage of working the two islands together, under one manager, one set of engineers, one supervision and organization, one supply ship for stores, and so on, and above all, the control of the same markets. .","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The weather is an all-important factor, because, when particular winds prevail, they are unable to work Nauru ; but the same winds are advantageous to the working of Ocean Island. The adverse wind of one island is the favoring wind of the other. That is a very important consideration, so far as shipping is concerned,, when questions of demurrage arise. Unless arrangements can be made for the working of the larger concern, we cannot hope to effect the same cheap production that would otherwise be the case.The question arises of the price at which the phosphatic rock can be delivered. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) has assured us that it is to be sold to the Australian public or the Australian manufacturer at the cost price. That is very re-assuring; but what is that cost price to be? This is particularly important in view of the heavy expenses about to be added to the cost of . production ? Indeed, I fear that the farmer is going to be disadvantaged to a considerable extent, if it is only intended to work the one island, and if all the cost of administration, including the salaries of the Administrator and! his staff, and of the three Commissioners, is to be superadded to the present cost of production. If that is to be the case, and it is, as we see so provided in the agreement, then the farmer cannot possibly hope to get the product at any cheaper rate, or even as cheaply as he does now. I have had the advantage of a talk on this matter with a mau who is not interested in the island or the company at all, but who is interested in the cheap production of rock phosphates and their ultimate manufacture. He told me, and the Prime Minister has mentioned this to-night, that the sale price of the company to the manufacturer is 30s. per ton f.o.b., and that the cost of production, including ls. royalty, is 23s. . per ton, which leaves a profit to the company of 7s. per ton, out of which head office charges, directors fees, and dividends are paid.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am merely dealing with what I saw in the newspapers, and the point I am making is that, superadded to present cost of production and cost of administration, to which I have already referred, there will be, for a period of about forty or fifty years, the cost of setting aside so much each year to provide interest on capital and sinking fund.The Prime Minister has said that the output is capable of more or less definite extension, but on further investigation I think he will find that he is npt correct in that statement, because I am told that the output cannot fairly exceed more than about 150,000 tons per annum, when the island is worked on the most economic lines.

But the competition will be great from other quarters. The French have great rock phosphate deposits on Makatea Island, and, what is more important, the Japanese have Angaur Island, which they are working as hard as they can, and where there are enormous deposits. In addition to the advantage of having their own labour, the Japanese are shipping the rock phosphate to Japan, where an unlimited supply of sulphuric acid is readily obtainable for the purpose of manufacturing superphosphates. In this regard Japan is undoubtedly the great competitor of the future. We may protect ourselves fiscally against Japan, but it is essential that the cost of production at Nauru should be reduced to a minimum if we are not to be overwhelmed by the competition from, other quarters. The Prime Minister has already mentioned that there are vast deposits in America and in the north of Africa.While I rejoice in the transfer of this island to the British Empire, and approve of the step which has been taken, I am exceedingly anxious that the utmost care should be exercised, but I am more than doubtful as to the wisdom of creating the administrative machinery provided in the agreement. I do not oppose the agreement; on the contrary, I realize that we have been committed to it by our representatives, and, on the whole, I think the result will be satisfactory, but at the same time, unless, being a business proposition, it is managed on rigid business lines, I feel it will not achieve the glowing anticipations indicated by the Prime Minister in his speech to-day.Debate (on motion by Mr. Poynton) adjourned.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[26]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
227,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"POYNTON, Alexander","KYD","Grey","NAT","Acting Treasurer [6.5]. -(By leave.",12692,"- I desire to announce the present position of the Eighth War Loan, which is known to the public by the name of the Peace Loan. Full details have not yet been, received from all centres, but, so far as can be seen, the total subscriptions amount to £20,000,000. In some respects, this is a satisfactory result, and shows the fine public spirit which exists amongst the great majority of Australians. In considering the total, it has to . be remembered that Australia has previously subscribed about £200,000,000 to war loans, and that before the war the flotation by a State of £1,000,000 or £2,000,000 was considered a good achievement. Taking these things into account, it is . possible to heartily congratulate the many thousands who have done all that they could towards the success of the Loan.I am advised that, undoubtedly, many persons withheld subscriptions, because they thought their money was not needed, and relied upon others. To give these persons an opportunity of doing what, no doubt, they will recognise as their duty, and give a final opportunity to others who, perhaps, would not subscribe under ordinary conditions, though able to do so, it has been decided to keep the Loan open for fourteen days, from the 23rd September. The Government ask that the Central and District Peace Loan Committees, the banks, and all other workers will continue their efforts during the extended period.As I announced a few days ago through the press, the Government are hopeful that voluntary subscriptions will bring the whole amount of £25,000,000, but it would be wrong not to add that, should the Loan be not fully subscribed by the 7th October, the Government will ask the Parliament to impose, a measure of compulsion upon those who have not done their duty. The Bill now before the House may have to be amended somewhat, birt, generally speaking, it is to be expected that the Bill, as it stands, will be passed.The Bill provides that every person may be required to subscribe to the Loan a sum which is equal to six . times the annual average of his Federal income tax paid during the last three years. Those whose taxable incomes are £250 or under are exempt, and compulsion will not apply in respect of income derived from personal exertion by returned soldiers. The first persons to be called upon for compulsory subscriptions will be those who have not subscribed to War or Peace Loans; but, should an insufficient sum be obtained from such persons, it will be necessary to call upon those who, while holding some bonds or stock, have not contributed in accordance with their means.My advice is that every person should subscribe as much as he or she possibly can irrespective of present holdings. Any one called upon for a compulsory subscription may appeal, and the Appeal Board may grant relief, but where the Appeal Board compels a person to subscribe, he will be automatically fined, and the amount of the fine will be one-third of the compulsory subscription. The fine will not relieve the person from the necessity to make the subscription. This automatic fine will operate if the person does not subscribe voluntarily before the date of the closing of - the Loan. The Bill applies to companies as well as to individuals.The Government have entered into arrangements under which, on paying 10 per cent, towards a subscription, any person may obtain a loan from a bank of the remaining 90 per cent., and will have eighteen mouths in which to pay off the overdraft by instalments. Thus, persons without ready cash may subscribe.","N/A","PEACE LOAN","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We shall have not only that economy in the saving of the profits that would have gone to the company, but, in addition., we shall have a guarantee against being squeezed by the company in the future, and that is a consideration of immense importance to Australia.I was astonished to read in the newspapers, in connexion with the Peace deliberations, that there was any dispute at all in regard to Australias right to this island, and I intend to state to the House my reason. I hope there will be an inquiry into the matter, because evidently somebody connected with the Commonwealth bungled in regard to this Possession, to the immense detriment of Australia. I lay no charge against the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) or the existing Government. When the right honorable gentleman went to England in connexion with the Peace Conference, he found that he had to meet things as they were. He put up a stubborn fight, and, in the circumstances, he brought us this agreement; but if the facts are known - and I hope they will be known and those responsible ibr the bungle will be singled out for blame. - this island should belong to Australia in toto. I was in Sydney just before the war broke out, and immediately afterwards. The Prime Minister of that day asked me to go- to Sydney so that the interests affected by the collapse of the ordinary commercial laws owing to the state of war, might approach me, and I might act as a channel of communication between them and the then Attorney-General (Sir William Irvine). People of all kinds came to me, and amongst the first to interview me were two gentlemen who understood the islands well, and who explained to me the enormous prospective value of Nauru. . As a result, I immediately telephoned to Melbourne and asked that the Australian flag be hoisted at once on Nauru, because it was essential that we should make our claim early. The Government acted with promptitude, a ship was immediately despatched, and the Australian flag was hoisted at Nauru just as it was hoisted at Rabaul. The hoisting of our flag at Rabaul was the basis of the complete mandate given to us . over New Guinea. But, having taken possession of Nauru, apparently, in order to. avoid the cost of keeping a few men on guard on the. island - because it was not necessary to garrison against attack while the Empire controlled the ocean - somebody in Australia said to the British Government, Will you stand the racket? And for the sake of saving 8s. per day for a few men, Great Britain and New Zealand were admitted into a contract that should have . been purely Australian.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The phosphatic deposit there is an enormous asset, and the working of it could be simplified to a great extent if we had sole control of it, because any system of mixed responsibility in. respect of the island is bound to. be expensive, to a certain extent. Not only that, but I have a faint glimmer at the back of my mind, that if Australia were dealing with the company that controlled the deposit, we might deal, with them with greater justice than they may receive through the tripartite arrangement. My view of this matter is different from that of the honorable member for Kooyong. If a man deliberately gives up his own sovereignty, and takes from a foreign Power anything in the way of a Government lease, I do not regard that man, for the purposes of that lease, as one of my co-nationalists. The value of that mans lease, from my point of view, is determined by the power of the country that gave it .to him to guarantee him the value of the lease for the whole term of its currency.This is a British company which had a German interest. The German-interest shares were sold out during the war, and I fancy that the value given for that German holding, unless the company was, so to speak, very long-headed and got in first, might be a fair indication of the real value of the whole companys interest when the sum of it is added up lock, . stock, and barrel. Unfortunately, we have apparently, in some way, invited the Mother Country to share the island, of which we took possession in the first place, and we have to abide by tha result. The only course open to us is to ratify the agreement.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

For that reason., when other peoples come to us and say,   Here are treaties which you must ratify, or pay us the compliment of asking us to subscribe our signatures to a victory to which our troops have contributed to a far greater extent than their numbers would suggest, it is advisable for us to sign those treaties.

260,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MATHEWS, James","KNH","Melbourne Ports","N/A","N/A",12696,". - The Island of Nauru, as a valuable Possession, has for some time been under the notice, not only of the Australian people, but of the world; and if there is one product that this country is interested in it is superphosphates, which have rendered fertile what were at one time regarded as barren wastes. This has been the case not only in Victoria, but in South Australia and New South Wales; and though I am told that in Western Australia these phosphates are not so essential, I have my doubts as to that. When the Peace conditions were being laid down, and a fight for the spoils was going on, some of these spoils were to be found in Australasia, and I was surprised at the undignified attitude which the Australian representatives had to take in fighting the- New Zealand representatives for the possession, or partial possession, of this island. Be that as it may, I do not think that the outcome is obviously to the advantage of those in Australia who wish to use superphosphates. We were told that the late war was not one of conquest, or for commercial interests; but the dispute about this island proves, in itself, that commercial interests dominate everything. I suppose that we in Australia are justified in claiming our share of the good things of the world ; and the Government may, under the circumstances, readily excuse themselves for fighting for Nauru as an Australian Possession, even though it be held under what is known as a mandate.It seems strange to me that an expensive establishment, estimated to cost about £10,000 per annum, is to be set up when, as has already been pointed out, an agent is all that is necessary. For the purposes of the civil government, there might be appointed what is called an administrator or a governor, as in the case of the Norfolk Island; beyond that, I do not see where any expense is necessary. In any case, it will only add to the cost of the phosphates when they arrive in. Australia or elsewhere. The only trouble the Commissioners will have, so far as I can see, is the allocation of the quantity of stone for each of the parties interested in Nauru; and surely that part of the business could be done beforehand.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

262,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MATHEWS, James","KNH","N/A","N/A","N/A",12696,"- So I understand. We have been told that the output . of phosphates at Nauru is 150,000 tons a year; but, from information I gleaned seven or eight years ago; I think it ought to be somewhat larger. The three parts of the Empire interested in the island are surely not trying to get the best of each other; and all we require is an agent to see that each gets its proper share, and no more.The Commissioners must be men of some business knowledge, and such men will require fair salaries, and an approximation to civilized conditions, to induce them to submit to a sort of imprisonment on this island. It is not like Papua or Norfolk Island, where there is something of interest -to be found, and no man will care to go to Nauru unless the inducement is good enough. We know that gentlemen who carry the title of Commissioner never do any work, which is invariably left to some one else; and each Commissioner will have a secretary, with the inevitable clerks and typists. This seems to me a farce.; but I suppose, if we accept the mandate, we must accept the conditions as laid down. The arrangement, however, does not, to me, display much common sense, but rather poverty of mind, on the part pf those who drew it up. It must be remembered that every additional expense means an addition to the cost of the phosphates to the farmer. I have a vivid recollection that not many years ago the price of Nauru Island was said to be about £600,000, but I have heard that the company ask about £3,200,000. Now, £3,000,000 at 5 per cent, represents £150,000, or an additional £1 per ton, to be added to the price of the phosphates. At one time, when the importers . tried to fight the local manufacturers, the price sank as low as £3 17s., or thereabouts, though at one stage it was somewhat higher. I am not a farmers representative, but I am interested, inasmuch as superphosphates are treated in the constituency which I represent; and the higher the cost of the superphosphates the less chance there is of fair wages and conditions in an occupation which I can almost say is not fit for white men. The sulphur-room is an abomination ; and altogether the industry is one that justifies good payment to. those employed. The farmer will naturally object to any increased charge; and the only way to lower the charge will be to decrease the wages of the men employed. Against such a policy as that, I should raise my voice very strenuously, and would expect support from both sides of the House in favour of proper living conditions.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When the island was valued at £600,000, German and British capitalists were mixed up in the ownership. The German interests have been wiped out; and I wish to know whether those who purchased the German shares will be given the advantage of their enhanced value since. The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) has admitted that in commercial circles the German has still plenty of friends in England; and it does not require a very astute business man to realize that high-class detectives would be necessary to ascertain whether Germans are not still interested in the island. Commercial interests held by Germans in British businesses were well covered up during the war; and there have been alarming statements to the effect that such interests are repaid by hundreds of millions of pounds in England now. If that be so, in the case of Nauru, the British Government. ought to see that the purchasers of the German shares do not reap the advantage of the enhanced value. We have made a great parade of what we did in getting rid of German interests iri the metal trade, but, personally, I do not see that we gain anything if we take interests from the German sharks and hand them to British sharks; indeed, the latter are the more difficult to deal with, for directly any steps are taken regarding them they wave the flag.There are many islands, including both French and Japanese, which produce this stone; and the honorable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) has pointed out how the Japanese, with their peculiar methods of labour, may be able to undersell in the markets of Australia. On the Island of Nauru all the labour is coloured with the exception of the supervisors. I understand that the original natives formed themselves into a sort of trade union in order to get better treatment. Thereupon the Hindoo was introduced; but, on a similar stand being taken by him, Chinese were brought in. It will be seen that, though there are not many on the island, the population is a curious mixture; and the pay and conditions are no better than those under the Japanese administration. . We must, therefore, look elsewhere for a reason for the higher price of the Nauru phosphates. Capitalism has no country and no accent - it speaks only one language, and that is the language of profit - and it. operates, as it were, in circles. If a man desires to float an Australian gold mine in England, he must deal with one circle which always undertakes ventures of the kind, and so  with, metals and other investments. Wherever money came from for these phosphate islands it has been  international. I believe it is still so to-day. I hope the Government will tell us straight out if it is impossible to alter the agreement. I suppose we have to accept or reject it. The mandate is as strong as the original mandate covering the islands, and if we reject it we shall get nothing out of it.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am not going into the question of whether it was a good or bad thing to allow the United Kingdom to be the senior partner, and to let New Zealand have a cut. I believe, judging by information furnished from various sources, that an inexhaustible supply of an all-necessary commodity has been secured for the farmers by the agreement. In the best interests of the country it is well that the agreement should be ratified. I had the privilege this evening of reading a very fine article that appeared from the pen of A. W. D. Tocke, in the Melbourne Argus of 15th March. It contained a great deal of information about this island, and I commend it to the attention of every honorable member. It shows that the island is about five miles long by three miles wide, and that for the four years ended December, 1918, about 147,000 tons of phosphate had been removed. The author points out that there is seemingly an inexhaustible supply there, and that notwithstanding the difficulties regarding ports and anchorages, about 100,000 tons per annum could easily be removed under normal conditions. We are also told that the little village on the island is fitted up with electric light and up-to-date machinery. It is, therefore, not exactly as barbarous as some people would have us suppose. The point that interests me most as a producer is that we have evidently secured by the agreement an inexhaustible supply of an all-necessary commodity, and can treat it afterwards according to the will of the Federal Parliament. Any argument as to what may or may not be done afterwards is futile at this stage. We have secured the raw material, and it will be an indictment of our capacity if we do not use it and put it into the hands of the producers in the highest, best, and most concentrated form, and at the cheapest possible rates.We have a very real grievance regarding the- superphosphate furnished to us through the ordinary channels of trade. I am not going to lay any charge of corruption or malpractice against the people engaged in that business; but it is clear to the ordinary practical man, and there is evidence to support it, that huge quantities of sand are used in the preparation of superphosphate for farm uSe. I quite understand that it is necessary to use some such material to enable the superphosphate to run property through the ordinary drills; but a much cheaper and better method might be devised. It should be possible to provide the superphosphate in a concentrated form, and let the farmer, by some expedient or invention, add sand in due proportion, so as to .save him the huge expense of paying £5 a ton, or more if he is hundreds of miles away from the nearest port, for large quantities of sea sand, as is very often the case.I would point out, in answer to a statement made this evening, that there has been a serious advance in the price of superphosphates since the war began, and also a deterioration or reduction in strength. Any practical farmer will tell you that that is so. I admit that the rise has not been nearly so great as in other instances. I use, on the average, about £100 worth of superphosphate every year. Before the war I paid about £4 15s. a ton, not including freight. Since the war I have been paying £5 0s. 6d., with freight at about 7s. 6d. per ton. Every one is urging us to move forward and secure a higher standard of production, and since scientific production and distribution must be our goal if we are to succeed in the huge task which confronts us, the supply of high-class phosphates to the farmer will be a very great aid towards that achievement. The United States of America spend about £13,000,000 per year on agricultural education. As the result of the building up of systems of agriculture there, although the best judges say they are only on the fringe of possible developments, the annual net increase in the value of agricultural products for the ten years preceding the war was, on the authority of the Director of Agriculture of Victoria, £90,000,000 per annum. That opens up a wide vista of progress for Australia, to emulate. If we bend ourselves to the task we can undoubtedly do a great deal more than we are now attempting. It is idle for the man on the land or the man in the workshop to say,  I must have an increase in the price of my commodity or my labour on account of the increased cost of living, and to sit still until that higher price or value materializes. We must realize, as Australian producers, that for the greater part of our products, both agricultural and pastoral, we must seek foreign markets. We are greatly handicapped by the tremendous distances which we, as a competitor in the worlds markets, must span in the face of the great shortage of shipping brought about by the war. We must, therefore, bend ourselves to the task of making our lands infinitely more productive for a given amount of labour than we have succeeded in doing in the past. While it is our duty to fight for the best markets and the best conditions, the achievement of the greatest progress lies with ourselves in the shape of increased . efforts to secure scientific production.. We must make a mans labour far more effective than it is to-day on a given area of soil.I remember selecting, over thirty years ago, on what was then a fairly large run, where only about 20,000 ill-bred sheep were raised and fed. After twenty-six selectors had taken up holdings, aggregating more than half the run, and had spent a few years in improving them, the part still held by the station carried actually more sheep than it did before. They were of a better character, they were more productive; and, as a consequence, the net revenue derived from half the area of that station was infinitely greater than for the whole area under the old system of administration. I may add that the twenty-six selections carried more sheep than the . station did, and their chief crop was wheat. With all the aids that science is for ever putting into our hands, and with the higher intelligence of our better-educated class of farmers, it is almost impossible to define for the future what is a sufficient area to enable a man to make a decent living. What is possible in a little instance of the kind I have described is taking place gradually throughout the country ; and apart from the question of land monopoly, the great lion in the path, I have no doubt that when the Australian people are given the opportunity of becoming their own employers on the soil, with the assistance of those aids which a parental Government can provide - superphosphates will play a very great part in such work - we shall easily solve the problem which seems so difficult now, that of maintaining a large population on the soil of the country and at the same time providing the operatives in the factories of the cities and towns with much cheaper food.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

281,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"LYNCH, John","KIL","N/A","N/A","N/A",12700,"- That is another aspect of the question. There is no honorable member more awake than I am to the robbery perpetrated under the name of distribution, a problem that will need to be attacked ; yet to me there seems to be too general an opinion that all that has to-be done to solve the problem is to devise some means of getting a grip on what is being produced. That is not so. We have to prevent the best brains in the community, backed up by a good deal of capital, from stepping into what may be called the intermediate occupations in the work of distribution and by speculative enterprise preying on the actual producer, as well as the consumer. It is hard to put ones finger on the man engaged in such a line as the real profiteer; but while the inducement exists to the man with brains and intelligence not to engage in the actual work of producing new wealth, but to juggle with what is already produced under some system of speculative buying, we shall continue to have what, unfortunately, we already have in this splendid country of ours, people in cities and towns paying for their foodstuffs a greater price than they ought to be paying. In this House, it has been demonstrated to us that one of our best breeders of cattle in New South Wales put five-year-old bullocks on the market as fat as they could be made, and within four days under the present wretched system of . distribution, the meat was being sold to the people off the butchers blocks at an increase of 300 per cent, upon the price obtained by the man who had produced it during five long years. I am a producer, and am growing grain and meat for a living, and I realize that the producers are just as wide-awake as others; if they get an opportunity of making a bit by speculative buying and selling, they utilize it. Until a paternal Government recognises that the cobbler should stick to his last, and that the man on the land who is producing should get the biggest profit of all under any new system of distribution, that tendency will continue to exist -among many genuine producers.We have the assurance of the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) in regard to this agreement, that every care is to be taken ; we have the actual wording of the agreement, and we have heard the criticism of men qualified to express an opinion upon it. I think the consensus of opinion will be that, in the circumstances, it is a fair and reasonable document. Unhappily we have not discovered on the mainland of Australia any great deposits of phosphates suitable for the farming industry. At Nauru Island we have that for which we have been looking for a long time, but I hope that when the work of supplying Australia with phosphates is thoroughly entered upon, the whole trade will be inquired into, and the whole industry overhauled. I hope that the questions I have touched on, if only for a moment, and they are practical questions affecting the well-being of the farmer as well as of the consumer, seeing that the proper handling of them would mean cheaper food, will be thoroughly gone into. If the institution of State works to deal with this product is necessary, we should have them. While at all times supporting governmental interference where it is essential, I remind the House that, finally, the highest expression of socialized effort by a Government can only mean that it may. do for individuals what the individuals cannot do for themselves. Combinations of capital and labour operating under company law are really applying the principles of Socialism, the only difference being that they operate these principles for the benefit of the private individual, whereas if the Government get equal service they must operate them for the general good, without paying regard to the matter of securing dividends. All the advantage should be with Government establishments. Unfortunately, in practice, it does not work out that way, because there seems to be a feeling among people that it is no crime to rob a Government. Services which are cheerfully rendered to a private employer whose keen eye is upon one are altogether set aside in the case  of a Government. In fact, we are accused, perhaps with some justice, of being careless as custodians of the public purse, and of not regarding the public finances as we would regard our individual concerns. There is much truth in that indictment, but in a matter of this kind, involving a practical question, and one fraught with such important consequences to the development of the material progress of the farming community of Australia, the Government are to be commended upon the action they have taken. As a representative of farmers. I must say that whilst this agreement will be of inestimable advantage to producers, it must also be of benefit to the country, and I heartily indorse and support its ratification.There is no need for one who does not claim to be capable of clearly analyzing the provisions of the agreement to attempt to enter upon such an analysis; nor is there need to go into the question of why the United Kingdom has been allowed a share of these deposits, although I think it is rather a good thing to have a partner of the strength, power, and prominence of the Old Country. I do think that all it was possible to do in the interests of Australia and Australias producers has been done in the direction of conserving our right to these deposits. I hope that the Government will show an equally practical mind when turning to other matters also of great interest to producers and consumers alike. In the meantime, this effort meets with my sincere, and cordial indorsement.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Every one admits that it is necessary for Australia to get au unlimited supply of superphosphates to fertilize our lands. As the honorable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lynch) has just said, the cost to the consumer depends upon, the cost of production. Whatever the cost of fertilizers may be to the producer, so will the percentage pf cost be to those who purchase the product of his labour. But I -disagree with the honorable member when he says that he will make no attempt to analyze the agreement. I think -that we ought to be careful in analyzing every agreement or Bill which comes before us in order to ascertain if it bestows evenhanded justice upon the people we represent.. I have some doubt as to whether this agreement is the best that could have been drafted. We appoint an Administrator to look, after the affairs of the people who may be working on the island, and, no doubt he will be paid a very large salary; yet, in- addition, there are to be three Commissioners - one representative of each Government concerned - to superintend the breaking of the rock phosphates and sending it away as allocated under the agreement.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is not a very difficult proposition to work these phosphate deposits, and it is a ridiculous proposition to appoint three highly-paid Commissioners to supervise the labour that will be engaged in the work. It is a ridiculous step on the part of representative men to agree to saddle the farmers of Australia with the additional cost of paying the salaries of these men. It . is supposed to be a business proposition.

We are supposed to protect the farmers of this country so far as their interest in these phosphates is concerned. How are we to do it? Under this agreement neither the Government nor Parliament has any say in the matter at all. I have never before read such a document. It does not protect the producer, or even this country. Three Commissioners are to be appointed to look after an undertaking that any one man could attend to without the slightest difficulty. All that he would be required to do would be to attend to the allotment of the product in the proportions stipulated, and get sufficient men and up-to-date machinery to enable him to get the highest possible output. Yet we are asked to agree to the appointment of three men at high salaries to do the work of one man.

305,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CHARLTON, Matthew","JXA","N/A","N/A","N/A",12703,"- When, the honorable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) was speaking, I interjected a question regarding the fair valuation, and his opinion, as a lawyer, coincided with mine as a layman. I recollect an occasion when, as a member of the New South Wales Parliament, I advocated that two private railways in that State should be taken over by the State Government. I made out the best case I could. The Minister for Railways of that day (Mr. Lee) said the proposition was a fair one. On making inquiries, he found that the Act governing one railway provided that the Government might take it over at its value, but the Act governing the other provided that it should be taken over at a fair valuation. The fair valuation had to be determined by arbitration, and the Minister found that the arbitrator had to take into consideration the future prospects of the line. If future prospects must be taken into consideration by any Court of Arbitration that is dealing with the rights of the Pacific Phosphate Company, what will be the result? For purposes of argument, I shall use the figures quoted by the honorable member for Kooyong, although I do not say they are correct. The honorable member said that the output of the company was 150,000 tons per annum, on which the company made a profit of 7s. per ton. That is equivalent to £52,500 per annum. The company had a right to work those deposits for 100 years, and their annual profit multiplied by 100 would give an aggregate profit of £5,250,000. In any arbitration proceedings the company will have a perfect right to make the most of their case, .and they will put forward those figures regarding past and prospective profits as evidence that ought to influence the Court. The Court must give a decision based not on sentiment, but on the facts, adduced. There is a danger in Article 7 that those deposits may be taken over at a very big price. If. we have to pay 5 per cent, on  a purchase price of £5,250,000, there will be an interest charge of £262,500 per annum which the farmers of this country will have to pay.

It is all very well for honorable members to say this will happen and that will happen. I have heard predictions of that kind before, but when the practical test was applied we found that we had been trapped and the people had to pay. It is in order to avoid that possibility that I have made this comparison; not because I am opposed to the agreement. Our interest in Nauru will be a good asset to Australia. It will help us to cheapen production in Australia, but we ought to see that no injustice is done to the farmer or to the general public. I venture to assert that, under this agreement, it is quite possible that we may have to pay considerably more for our interest in the island than we ought reasonably to be called upon to give for it.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
312,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FENTON, James","KEV","Maribyrnong","N/A","N/A",12704,". - The more one looks into the agreement set out in. the schedule to this Bill the more one feels the necessity for further information in regard to it. In the absence of the particulars with which, we ought to be supplied, we may commit this country to a very considerable expenditure. I quite agree with the argument advanced by the honorable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton), that if the island and its phosphatic deposits are to be worked as a commercial and profitable enterprise, it is quite possible that we shall erect under this agreement a small public service in connexion with, the operation of the mandate. That at all costs should be avoided. Whilst we may be getting a very good asset, if we are to pay men high salaries to administer the island, we shall find in it but another addition to our many expensive- luxuries. We seem to be all too prone to take over unprofitable enterprises. Many such undertakings could be enumerated, and I fail to see why we should still further burden ourselves with an expenditure of the kind I have indicated. I also indorse the position taken up by the honorable member for Wentworth (Mr. Kelly) when he inquires why Britain has any share in the administration of Nauru. It seems to me that the Pacific Phosphate Company has been at work, and that even while, the representatives of the great Powers were engaged in drawing up the terms of the Peace Treaty, and apportioning various parts of the earth, men possessing interests in this island have been, using their influence to secure that Britain shall have some voice in its management. It may be said that I have a sinister motive in making this suggestion; but it is an undoubted fact that speculators, company mongers, and others interested in big flotations have a better opportunity, putting it plainly, to get at the British Government than they have of getting at the Commonwealth Government. I quite agree with the honorable member for Wentworth, who, I think, should, have carried his argument further than he did. He plainly hinted that, in his opinion, Britains participation in the island, and the benefits accruing- from it, needs to be further examined.It is said by some that, under this agreement, we shall be taking over a very valuable asset. Superphosphates play a very important part, not only in the raising of crops, but in fertilizing grazing land. I fail to understand why the word  agricultural  is used in the agreement. Fertilizers are used in connexion with land employed for pastoral as well as agricultural purposes. I have here a quotation from the Industrial Australian and Mining Standard showing that many of - those who are raising cattle and sheep are using manures of various kinds to recuperate the soil, and to give to it greater fertility -The great arid plains of the Edwards and Mumimbidgee rivers of New South Wales produce sheep that are most conspicuous for frame and constitution. Probably the best merino sheep in the world are grown there - certainly the sheep that return most money per head to their owners. And this largely because there is some wonderful virtue in the soil of these plains that is transmitted through the pasture and herbage into the animals that graze upon it.The writer goes on to point out that there are some soils in Australia which possess considerable natural virtues, and impart those virtues through the pasture and herbage into the animals which graze upon them. There are other grazing lands which, by means of a top dressing of manures, are greatly recuperated to the benefit of the animals depastured on them. I am wondering whether the employment of the word  agricultural  in this agreement will debar the use of these phosphates in . the manufacture of manures to be devoted to grazing lands.Like other honorable members, I have been reading of Nauru and other islands. T learn from an article in Life that Nauru does not consist only of rock. The writer states - iNauru is appropriately called  Pleasant Island. It has a circumference of 12 miles, with wide foreshores, and in the centre a bunch of low-set hills, in which phosphate of lime is found. A. fine road encircles the island, and running through it is a beautiful avenue of coconut palms. Shallow lagoons, on seashore and in the -heart of the hills, mirror the beauties of palm groves, native villages, and make the island a photographers paradise.According to the writer of this article the estimated quantity of the phosphatic rock on the island is not 400,000,000 tons, as stated by the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes), but only 40,000,000 tons. If the Prime Ministers. information as to the tonnage of phosphatic rock is incorrect, it may be wrong in regard, to many other items which have been submitted by him to the House this afternoon. These facts all go to suggest that there should be a closer investigation of the whole subject.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member is always delighted to hear something concerning the social environment of people of other countries, and he will perhaps be. interested in a further quotation from this article setting out that -The King of Nauru,  Oweida, is a most charming and affable old gentleman, with the heartiest laugh imaginable. He is to be seen very often riding about on his bicycle, attended by his Master of the Bike, a sturdy young native, who looks after the Royal bicycle, sees that the tyres are in good order and the machine in repair.  0\\aida  is to the fore in all patriotic movements of the island, especially those in aid of the Bed Cross, and invariably has stuck out from the back of his bike a lon pole with a small Red Cross Hag. At public functions His Majesty wears a tall hat, frock coat, coloured vest, nicely creased trousers, black patent-leather shoes with brown laces, a stiff collar, and smart- tie; a walking stick completes the turnout.We are now looking at Nauru, not from the pleasant picture point of .view, but through legislative eyes, with the object of discovering in it some of those potentialities of which the Prime Minister spoke when introducing this Bill. We have to ask ourselves whether we are really getting such a wonderfully good going concern as we might at first imagine. I do not know whether a Court, in determining what compensation should be paid to the Pacific Phosphate Company, would take into account what the future is likely to develop in regard to the fertilization of soils. France, for instance, is not keenly interested to-day in -the addition of phosphatic elements to her soil. . Scientists and chemists there are fertilizing the soil by means of electricity. Marvellous crops of wheat, barley, asparagus, and other produce have been obtained there as the result of the application of electricity. The day may come when the application of phosphatic manures to the soil may give place to a cheaper and more effective process. Prospectively, there may not be nearly sr> much attaching to our having a mandate over the Island of Nauru as the Prime Minister has suggested.We must be careful not to make the island a place wherein luxurious billets may be found. If we do, then, unless we are going to make it absolutely impossible for the farmer to obtain cheap manure manufactured from this rock phosphate, we shall never be able to compete with other countries. The honorable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) said that, unless we erected a fairly high Tariff barrier, we should not be able to compete with Japan in the supply of superphosphate in Australia. I suppose that the honorable member for Calare (Mr. Pigott), with his Free Trade proclivities, would rejoice in Japan being able to undersell the Commonwealth Government in the supply of superphosphate.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

322,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FENTON, James","KEV","N/A","N/A","N/A",12706,"- Probably because it suited her to . do so. Japan intends to develop the islands over which she .has obtained a mandate, and I believe it is correctly stated that the valuable deposits of .phosphates in the Caroline Islands and elsewhere will be developed by her by means of cheap labour. The product of that cheap labour will pour into this country, and local manufacturers will be crowded out. All these are matters which we shall have to consider. Superphosphates from cheap-labour countries should not have the same opportunity here as those manufactured under reasonable conditions of labour.When the question of compensation is under consideration, will the arbitrators take these facts into consideration, and have regard also to the future? Unless they do, we shall burden the industry, and in all probability cripple its success. If it be true that the company has made an average profit of £52,000 per annum, and that it paid Germany £600,000 for the right to mine for phosphatic rock at Nauru, it ought to be satisfied with that amount of £600,000, without taking into account the prospects of a hundred years ahead. We must be careful we do not pay too much even for this valuable asset.Another suggestion 1 would make is that the Government should take the control of this industry from beginning to end. The Government ought not to be satisfied to merely quarry the rock and carry it on ship to the various ports of Australia; but they should undertake the work of turning the rock into the finished article to he sold to our farmers. -We shall never be able to pay our way by taxing and borrowing alone, and the Government, therefore, ought to take in hand good paying industries, such as the one we are discussing. We expect in three years to own a mercantile marine running into 100 vessels, to be used for the purpose of carrying our produce to the other side of the world, arid if it is a good, policy to own. vessels in that way, we should use them to bring this raw material to Australia, in order that, the profits may not go to private persons, but into the public Treasury. If we are to have the  new world  of which we hear, the Government will have to take a more active interest- in the industries .of the country ; and, unless .they do so in the case of these phosphates, I cannot see how they can be turned into a paying proposition.I hope that at the end of five years, if not before,. Australia, as her share, will be getting, not 42 per cent., but 84 per cent, of the phosphates, leaving to New Zealand the 16 per cent., which is all that is required by the Dominion. The 5,000,000 people in Australia have incurred a debt which represents a burden that will not only bend, but crush, them unless our ordinary sources of revenue from taxation and borrowing are supplemented. An industry such as this, properly managed by the Government from start to finish, should be as profitable, or even more profitable than our mercantile marine.Of course, the agreement has been made on behalf of Australia by the Prime Minister, and I suppose we cannot alter it now; but if there were an opportunity we should certainly see that the United Kingdoms share was transferred to us. The Prime Minister has told us that the United Kingdom is not likely to require 42 per cent, of the phosphates, for the simple reason that she can obtain supplies from Algeria and America, and it seems unlikely that she will come 12,000 miles for raw material of the kind. I think that we, as a Parliament, might, by making proper representations, have the agreement varied in that way; at any rate, I see failure for the whole scheme -unless the Government intend, not only to mine, but to manufacture the phosphates. We ought to remember, too, that our supply of fertilizers does not come only from such deposits as these. I understand that the Mount Lyell Company manufacture certain by-products into fertilizers, and that there are supplies from other quarters. The chemist is now at work, and if ever he were needed he is needed on the farm and in connexion with our soils. One of the great failures on the part of the States is shown in the fact that there is not a proper analysis of Australian soils, whereas we ought tq know exactly the kind of soil to be found in any part of Australia, and be able to add to its fertility by chemical processes, the application of electricity, and other methods. We ought to be most careful how we give our support to a Bill of this character ;: but I suppose we shall simply have to agree to it.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is a purchase at a fair valuation. If the quantity of phosphates is high, the price will be high; if it is low, the price will below. Article 7 of the agreement provides that the island shall be taken over  at a fair valuation. Several honorable members have thrown doubts on the possibility of getting a fair valuation determined. As a matter of fact, the sovereignty of the island now passes in trust to the three parts of the Empire concerned - to the United Kingdom and to Australia in respect of 42 per cent, each, and to New Zealand in respect of 16 per cent. They are the trustees for the League of Nations, by whom the mandates are declared, and they take charge of it for the League; but the absolute, sovereignty has passed away from Germany and is vested, for purposes of application and administration, in the trustees, who are appointed in accordance with the mandate. Those trustees are the parties to the agreement.  Australia is one of them to the extent I have mentioned. They have the sovereign power under the mandate to declare, as we can declare in this House, the proper method of ascertaining what is a fair price to be paid. They can declare that it shall be ascertained by valuation, or by any other means, if an arrangement is not come to. The honorable member may rest assured that the provisions of the agreement can be so carried out that the price paid by the nations concerned shall be absolutely fair. It will not be based on. any speculative ideas of what the island may be worth in twenty years to come.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There arc three parties interested in the agreement, in shares in the proportion of 42, 42, and 16, and each party must have a representative on the Commission. The question of whether one of the parties in a particular year consumes the whole of his share for agricultural purposes or not may have to be investigated. There is a good deal of business to be done. Sales have to be conducted, and the rate to be paid for treatment has to be determined by the Commissioners. Honorable members also talk about the possibility of the price going up because there is no direct provision in the agreement as to how the phosphates are to be treated before the product is actually delivered to the farmers. That, again, is a matter for the Commissioners to determine. If they arrange with existing bodies here to treat the raw phosphatic rock, they can lay down the terms on which this will be done. They can protect the consumers by actually declaring the conditions upon which the purchases are to be made.

Sir William Macgregor, who ought to know something about this subject, contributed to The United Empire for March, 1918, a very interesting article upon   The Pacific and its Political Settlement. He says -One of the most important of the German islands is Nauru, or Pleasant Island. It lies half-a-mile south of the equator, and has an area of 3 square miles, and 1,538 inhabitants. It rises only 20. feet above sea-level. It has no harbour, is surrounded by a reef, and its lagoon is dry at low water. It is composed of coral lime, and is reported by Dr. Paul Hambruch to contain some 83,600,000 cubic metres of from 83 per cent, to 00 per cent tricalcium phosphate. It has shipping means to load 100 tons an hour. Another island, Angaur, contains a considerable quantity of phosphates. It was taken possession of by the Japanese Forces soon after the outbreak of the war.This is one of the best bargains the Commonwealth could possibly have made. These islands in the Pacific were handed over to the Allies, and it became a question of who was to get them. The Prime Minister stuck out most forcibly for our acquisition of Nauru. The estimates we have show that it is a wonderful island for phosphates as regards, not only quality, but quantity. I have seen the quality compared with that of some of our own phosphates, and it was held to be high. On the whole, this is an excellent agreement, obtained after long and difficult negotiations.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
356,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PIGOTT, Henry","KYA","Calare","N/A","N/A",12710,".- The honorable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) maintained that as the return from Nauru Island was £52,000 per year, and the company had a 100 years right, the compensation to be paid would be £5,000,000. But the present value of £5,000,000, payable in 100 years, is only about £500,000. A bill of £100 payable in six months, discounted now, is worth only £97. The honorable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) twitted me on my Free Trade principles, and expressed the hope that a high import duty would be put on these phosphates, with the object of preventing Japan from sending phosphates here. Before the British took possession of the island, Japan obtained most of her phosphates there, so that if this proposal is carried out we will slam the door in the face of Japan, and there will be no occasion to put on a heavy Tariff to keep her out. The honorable member quoted an estimate that there was only 40,000,000 tons of rock phosphate on the island. The Prime Minister gave an estimate of 80,000,000 tons, mentioning his authority, and stated that the German estimate was 450,000,000 tons. A great friend of mine, who visited the island two years ago. told me that he . estimated the quantity at 300,000,000 tons. He added that the phosphates were being taken by America and Japan from the island at the cost in royalty of 4s. per ton. Subsequently a ships captain engaged by the British Phosphate Company gave me practically the same information regarding Nauru and Ocean Island. During the last elections I said we were justified in sending our delegates to England to look after our interests so far as these islands were concerned. I said that Japan and America were getting phosphates from there at a royalty of a few shillings per ton, and that the product was sent back to Australia and our farmers had to pay £4 or £5 per ton for it, after it had been mixed with sand and other materials to reduce its strength. If our delegates did nothing else than give us control over these phosphates, they more than justified their visit to the Old Country. In years to come the island will be invaluable to us. It is distant 2,800 miles as the crow flies. There is no other deposit in the world so rich and at the same time so convenient to Australia. The official Customs statistics show that in 1917-18 New South Wales consumed 539,600 cwt. of phosphates from these islands, Victoria 1,727,000 cwt., South Australia 919,000 cwt., and Western Australia 457,000 cwt., making a total of 3.643,000 cwt., or 182,153 tons, valued at £433,940. I support the Bill, and am sure that Australia will benefit for years to come by the action of the Government in taking over the island of Nauru.Question resolved in the affirmative.Bill read a second time, reported from Committee without amendment, and passed through its remaining stages.","Second Reading","NAURU ISLAND AGREEMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We are told that Parliament is going to do all it possibly can to adjust matters between the consumer and the producer, so that they will be on a satisfactory basis, yet here at the first opportunity the Minister, who is so anxious to protect the public against the profiteer, refuses to accept an amendment which would place the public in a position to learn the value of commodities entering Australia. We condemn- secret* treaties, which have led nations into all sorts of trouble, and we all join in demanding that international negotiations and agreements should, bear the light of day, yet people in this community are not to be permitted to know what an importer pays for the- goods he brings into Australia.

We ought to break down these practices and introduce new customs which will let the daylight in. The amendment may have no effect in regard to the fixing of the prices the public will have to pay, but it would let the newspapers and the public know exactly the value of an imported article. The consumer would be able to say,  Here is an article which is imported at the cost of £1, and yet we are obliged to pay £3 for it. Who gets the difference? The amendment would have some effect on the profiteer. He would realize that for once in his life his actions were being exposed. He would have to show why he charged £3. for something he had obtained for £1. That at least would be doing something, and surely we in this Parliament are going to make an effort to control commodities in the interests of the people. Are we to give a free hand to those who have been proved to be robbing the people in regard to the commodities they are obliged to purchase? The amendment, if accepted, would be one of the greatest eye-openers the public could have. The retail prices of many commodities exceed the import prices by 100 and 150 per cent. That is where the profiteer comes in. Yet when we ask this Parliament to take the first step to do something in the direction of controlling commodities in the interests of the people, the- request is refused. Probably next week the Government will say that they want additional powers, and ;that they propose to ask for an amendment of the Constitution to deal with these matters, but here is a -case where they have the whole thing in their hands, and yet they do nothing. As a matter of fact, I contend that at the present time we can control all commodities, because we are still in a state of war. Here is a simple amendment which will not interfere with the Bill, and yet the Minister objects to it. Is there some objection which has not vet been fully explained or which might be acceptable? The people, if given the opportunity of expressing an opinion, would say at once that they should be put in the position of knowing the cost of goods entering Australia.

It is better to make a start when we have the opportunity of doing something. We should watch every such opportunity. When I saw what was going on I determined that I would lose no chance of referring to it. There are thousands of people in Australia, who are not able to get the necessaries of life or clothe their families as they should be clad. It is well known that during the war importers bought so much suiting material from the Old Country at the fabulous prices obtaining there and paid duty on it, and then got three-fourths of their suiting material requirements . manufactured locally, and charged the people what was paid on the imported article. That is bare-faced robbery which we should prevent. We are not justified in permitting it to continue. What is the use of talking about taking these problems into consideration ? There is to be a party meeting to decide as to whether there should be an election, and as to whether there is to be an amendment of the Constitution, but Ministers cannot hoodwink the people all the time. They may hoodwink them some of the time, but there will come a day when the people will see through it all. I am surprised that the Minister should say so calmly that he cannot accept the amendment, and yet should give no solid reason for his refusal, except the statement that if it were included in the Bill it would have no effect. If this is the way in which the affairs of the country are to be administered I am sure it is time the people took charge and sent persons here to look after their interests. I hope that we shall have an election speedily. It is useless going upon the public platform and talking, as Ministers do, if no honest attempt is made to redress these things when the opportunity presents itself.

We talk of the need for population, but here in Australia we are making it almost impossible for people to rear families. This is a question of paramount importance, yet we make no attempt to deal with it. I do not think the Government can justify their attitude in saying that the amendment would have no effect even if included in the Bill. If it can have no effect on the Bill, surely they can allow it to be included, so that the people may learn what the importer is paying on certain articles which come into Australia. It is the only method of letting a little daylight into these matters. It would have the tendency of curbing the extortionate profits. Unless we are prepared to do something of the kind it is time we went to the people. There is urgent work to be attended to before we do so. but if we are to allow the people to be robbed in the meantime we might just as well let the urgent work stand over and give them the opportunity of saying who are to represent them here, and of seeing that they get redress for the grievances under which they are now suffering. Bv agreeing to this amendment we shall show that this Parliament is endeavouring in a bond fide way to let the public know what is paid for certain imported articles. Why should we shield the importers by keeping secret the prices they have paid? Everybody can know the business of the masses of the people, but apparently a small privileged section who are making fortunes in the country must be protected in every possible way. I hope the Minister will reconsider his decision, and I shall be surprised if honorable members on the Ministerial side vote against the amendment. If they do they must take the consequences, but the amendment is fair and reasonable and ought to receive the support of members on both sides of the Committee.

In the past there has been too much secrecy about the transactions of the importer and the manufacturer. We know what the farmer gets for his wheat, meat, and butter, but nobody is permitted to know the prices at which the importer buys or the manufacturer produces. Whenever any inquiry is held whether by a Prices Board ox a Tariff Commission or an Inter-State Commission, these transactions must be hidden behind a veil of secrecy. When I was Minister for Trade and Customs I desired to ascertain whether the raw material certain manufacturers were using was of Australian origin and what proportion the wages paid bore to the price at which the goods were sold to the warehouses or retailers. I was immediately told that I was asking for the information for party purposes. I replied that I would keep the information secret. The honorable member for .Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) recently asked for information from the Taxation Department in order to be able to tell the (public how certain persons in the country are piling up big fortunes. Sir Alexander Peacock, when Treasurer for Victoria, in order to show the enormous increases in the incomes of many people, quoted before the State Parliament 245 persons and firms, which he indicated only by figures.

Travelling in a train last week I listened to a commercial traveller and an auctioneer denouncing the coal miners in New Zealand, who were reported in the press to be earning £2 per day. I said to them,  How much would you take per day to work in a mine? They said they would not do that work at any price. But they denounced other men for asking for what they considered a fair remuneration. We know what the seamen were earning before the recent strike, but when we ask that the Comptroller of Customs should make known certain information regarding the prices of imports, the application is refused in the interests of commerce.","N/A","CUSTOMS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We were told in the House a few weeks ago that galvanized iron was sold over and over again between the time it left the original shipper abroad and the time it was landed in Australia. There were half-a-dozen different commissions and profits to be paid before the article could be sold to the public. We might provide for a limitation of profit, but that would be futile unless we prohibited excessive re-selling. The people do not know how much they have to pay for excessive handling and distribution, apart from the profit made by the manufacturer and importer.

There is a strong conviction on the part of many people that the excessive cost of many articles is due, not to the high cost of production, or ordinary systems of handling, but to excessive trading amongst middlemen. If the Government is sincere in its declaration that it wishes to do away with profiteering, if it is honest in its declared intention to see that the people get a fair deal at the hands of these middlemen, it should accept this amendment. The amendment aims directly at making public what is the fair market value of goods when purchased by the original importer. I cannot see that it is likely to do any injury to business men. That is a point, however, that seems to cause much concern to the Minister for the Navy (Sir Joseph Cook).

It has been pointed out in this House again and again that undue trafficking can be stopped. The Government have adopted a socialistic system of running steamers, and that policy might well be extended. If the Government find that the middlemen associated with any particular industry will not treat the public fairly, it is open to them to deal with the product of that industry just as they have done with our shipping. Is it impossible for the Commonwealth Government to become direct importers just as they have become shipowners?Even if the effect of this amendment would be to do some injury to a business man here and there, I think that the safety of the Government of the Commonwealth is of more importance than is the safety of one or two individuals. In allaying the suspicion in the public mind that undue trafficking is taking place, I feel that we should be doing a most important work. We should be rendering a service, not only to the people, but to constitutional government. I feel very strongly that this amendment, if carried, would do much to help the people to find out whether or not they are being robbed by profiteers. If, as a result of its operation, the people ascertained thu there was no profiteering going on, it would enable them to come more closely together, and to realize that the burden they were called upon to bear was a just one. If, on the other hand, it went to show that profiteering was going on, the people would know what to do, and would force the Parliament to take action to protect them.Mr. CORSER (Wide Bay) [10.101.- I fail to recognise that the carrying of this amendment would be of any advantage to the people. If honorable members opposite were familiar with the whole of the circumstances associated with the importation of goods, they would recognise at once that the first cost described on an invoice represents but one portion of the total. There have to be added to it freight, insurance, exchange, shipping charges, agencies, stamps, interest, Customs duty, and cartage. That being so, the publishing of the initial cost of imported goods, as shown on the invoice, would not convey any accurate information to the people. A point which honorable members opposite have, perhaps, overlooked is that the price of goods is largely regulated by the quantity purchased. In connexion with the sale of wool, sugar, or any other commodity, the rebate allowed is in proportion to the quantity purchased.","N/A","CUSTOMS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[3]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Many people, for instance, are both exporters and importers. An exporter who has on the other side of the world money available to pay for goods that he is importing, is in a distinctly better position than a man who has not the money there, -and who has, therefore, to pay interest upon it from the day that the shipping documents are handed over to the bankers. I feel that this amendment would be of no value to the public. It would not enable them to arrive at the actual cost of any goods, but, on the other hand, would be calculated to give rise to serious misunderstandings. In many cases, it would lead the people to suspect profiteering where it did not actually exist. I mention these facts for the information of those honorable members of the Opposition who have not been in business. I urge them to consider, these points, and not to attempt in this way to deceive the public. I have no dealings with soft goods; but I would point out that under the system proposed by the honorable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton), a large importer of soft goods might be charged with profiteering when there was absolutely- no justification for such a charge.

420,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WEST, John Edward","KZA","East Sydney","N/A","N/A",12716,".- This debate is likely to enlighten the general community, which at the present time has not that respect for the Parliament that it ought to have. The .reason is that the Government make no attempt to alter the present undesirable state of affairs. Precedent has laid it down that some particular line of action must be taken, and they are so overweighted by precedents that they remain idle while the public suffer. Not many years ago we had a Commission inquiring into the cost of patent medicines, and it revealed facts of which the public had previously not the slightest idea. The people were then paying 5s. and 6s. for, amongst other things, boxes of pills, the chief component part of which was goats manure. Honorable members may smile, but I nin. relating an actual fact. The honorable member who last addressed the House described himself as a business man ; and I may say that I at one time did business on behalf of an association of the committee of which I was chairman. For some goods that we required such an enormous price was asked that I advised my committee to allow me to indent them direct from the producer abroad, and the adoption of my advice resulted in a saving to us of 44 per cent.During the last twelve months the InterState Commission has been making inquiries; and if honorable members on the Government side have taken no notice of the finding of the Commission, I can assure them they have been taken to heart by members on this side. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) admits the enormous difference in the price of articles when first invoiced and when they reach the consumer, but. he tells us that the amendment before us would prove of no use. Under the present circumstances, there is no possibility of knowing the original cost of an article. Goods from other, parts of the world are shipped to Australia, and in the last two or three years we have had instances of their changing hands three or four times while in transit, each change meaning increased profits and commissions with, of course, a huge increase in price to the consumers. The men who do this sort of business have only a very bare kind of office, but they can afford to go to races and live in very comfortable houses. If the Government are in earnest about their desire to stop profiteering they now have an opportunity to do something; but if we may judge from their conduct in the past they will every time support vested interests. Any attempt we on this side make in the direction . I suggest is rejected by the Government and their supporters, on the ground that, if adopted, it would interfere with . somebody. Personally,I am an out-and-out Protectionist, and, in my opinion, duties to be effective should be prohibitive. Our present fiscal arrangements are like a domestic colander - full of holes, so far as the protection of our industries is concerned; and that is not a desirable state of things in a country which seeks to be self-contained. When an opportunity like this presents itself we ought to show that we are genuine in our condemnation of the unnecessarily high cost of living, for which there must be some limit, just as there is to borrowing money. And in this latter regard the present Government have enjoyed much greater opportunities than any previous Government; they have been in office during a period of inflation, and have lived on loans in a fools paradise. At a meeting of my electors at Paddington, Sydney, it was gravely proposed that all profiteers should be executed as worse offenders than burglars. At the present time there are men obtaining . profits beyond all reason, while other citizens cannot get sufficient to fill their stomachs. This is a dangerous state of affairs, for we all know that the French Revolution and other upheavals were due to want of food; and we may face a similar crisis unless something is done. However, we are not going to meet to-morrow, because, I suppose, the Government have decided to hold a party meeting. We had a recess of five months, and yet here we are asked to take another holiday instead of doing the countrys business. I cannot understand how the members of the Government and their supporters can so far forget their duties as representatives of the people; indeed, I regard them as traitors to their country in the same way as I regard men who run away from the battlefield. I ask leave to continue my speech on a future occasion.Progress reported.","N/A","CUSTOMS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In a report headed  Mr. Hughes and the Farmers  in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, of the 17th instant, the Prime Minister is reported to have addressed the farmers and settlers delegates as follows: -I was . able, before I left England, to sell 1,500,000 tons of wheat at 5s.6d. per bushel.A Voice. - Too low.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

427,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HUGHES, William Morris","DQC","N/A","N/A","N/A",12718,"- I could have sold more wheat at a better price if it had not been for the fact that our wool had been sold while I was on the water going to England. . . . I said to the people in England,  You cannot pick and choose among the goods in our shop window, taking the wool and leaving meat and wheat. If you take the one, you must buy the others, too. But that wool - the last lot was sold behind my back. I would not have agreed to that sale. If it had not been sold, we should have been in a very much better position at this moment.Almost exactly the same words were used by the Sydney Morning Herald in its report of the same date. Yesterday, the Prime Minister, addressing the farmers and settlers at the luncheon at the Royal Agricultural Show in Victoria, said, as reported in the Argus of this morning, 24th September -Some remarks I made in Sydney have been construed as a reflection on the Central Wool Committee. Nothing was further from my thought than to reflect on the Committee in relation to the last sale to Great Britain. . . For the sale of that wool I was responsible. What I desired to make clear was, had I known when the wool was sold -as much as I know now, we should not have : sold the wool for the definite period of the war.I am sorry the Prime Minister is not here, because I would like to impress him with the necessity of being a little more accurate in his statements to the public. The other day he said that he told honorable members on this side all about the arrangement made with Japan in connexion with the Pacific Islands, and, further, that I was present at the Cabinet meeting, and all the members on this side were present at the Caucus. When we denied his statements, the Prime Minister said,  I did not say that ; what I said was this, and then, in almost the same words, repeated the offence. When the people of the Commonwealth- become more accustomed to the Prime Minister, they will pay very little attention to his public utterances.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[3]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
428,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GREGORY, Henry","KFE","Dampier","N/A","N/A",12718,".- A little while ago, the adjournment of the House was moved with a view to ventilate the grievances of country members regarding country, . mail and telephone services. There is no desire on -the part of honorable members to move the adjournment again, but I wish to impress upon the Government the necessity for some reform in this matter, more particularly as it is being recognised more day by day how important it is that we should try to induce people to settle on the soil. The conditions of the mail and telephone services in the back country now are extremely harsh - harsher than they have ever been under the States or the Commonwealth. If there is to be retrenchment, and there is ample room for it in the public services, it should not be wholly and solely at the expense of the people who are pioneering the country. I hope the Government will take this -matter into consideration, because it is most serious. Moreover, we do not desire, if it can be avoided, to again move the adjournment of this House to ventilate our grievances. If there is one section &£ the community who should receive consideration, it is those who are going out and developing the very best parts of Australia.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A duty of 5s. 6d. on an article valued at 3s. 6d. appears to be a gross over-charge, and it should only be necessary to mention the matter to the Minister for him to take steps to see that such a thing does not occur in the future.The Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) was through my electorate on Saturday week, and promised the electors there that he would endeavour to Tectify the existing conditions by restoring them to their normal employment. Some of my constituents have been to see me since, and have asked me to shake up the Prime Minister about his promise. The sooner he restores those conditions the better for all concerned. I shall be glad to hare my remarks- brought under the right honorable gentlemans notice, so that he may give effect to his promise as goon as possible.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If there is any justice at all in the Department, that gentleman should get the benefit of it. The matter has been outstanding for nome years, and there ds no justification for the Commonwealth Government escaping from its clear obligations. Now that we have no Wednesdays available for the purpose of discussing private, members business, it is only right that on grievance day Ministers should have the courtesy to be here to listen to what honorable members have to say about particular cases. I hope the Minister will give me a reply as to his intentions in this matter.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

On the 18th September the honorable member said in the House, regarding myself -He was a member of the War Council and circulated private and confidential memoranda affecting Japan* Who desired such information from, him, and what, right had he to give.it?Then the honorable member proceeded to. pass criticism on me upon that basis. At no time in my life has any memorandum, from the Government come into my hands, confidential or otherwise, dealing with Japan, so that it has been impossible for me to circulate any such thing. There is absolutely no. foundation whatever for the honorable members statement. In any statements I have made regarding Japan, either in this House or outside it, I have not made use of any confidential information given, to me anywhere. If any honorable member, from the Prime Minister (Mr.Hughes) down, has any complaint to make in that respect, and will tell me the item on which the complaint is based, I will produce the authority from outside sources upon which I have founded any statements that I have made.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A similar meeting was arranged last year between the Minister for Repatriation - and his Committees, but it lapsed on account of the influenza scare, just as it appeared that it was going to be useful and fruitful. Although this notice is very short, I hope the Assistant Minister will be able to bring under the notice of the Minister this opportunity of doing something really practical in the shape of getting into close touch with the local Committees, from whom so much is expected, and who have been throughout prepared to render the fullest possible assistance. If the Minister can at least get a responsible officer from his Department to be present at the meeting, so that the attitude of the local Committees may be learned, and closer co-operation brought about between the State and Federal Ministers regarding the question of Repatriation, a great deal of good will be done. This is a grand opportunity, and there is still sufficient public spirit left in the local Committees to render very valuable aid as regards both land settlement and the general question of Repatriation.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The whole case was referred to the Public Service Commissioner., who has reported that he does not think Mr. Henry has any reasonable ground for complaint. Recently, when he was removed from Broken Hill to Adelaide, he was given, as a special act of grace on the part of the Department, double the removing allowance to which he was entitled by the Public Service regulations, in view of the special circumstances of his case. I think, so. far as I am able to judge from the records in the Department, that Mr. Henry has been treated with justice, and in some cases with special consideration.I can only tell the honorable member for West Sydney (Mr. Wallace) that the amount of duty which he complained about on the article he mentioned is due to the fixed rates of duty, which I have no power to alter.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
