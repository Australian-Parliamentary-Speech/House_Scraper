12,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SPEAKER, Mr",10000,"N/A","N/A","N/A",3539,"- I should like to refer to a matter, mentioned in the House during the present sitting, regarding the revision of Hansard proofs. I felt it was necessary for me to take some notice of certain observations and criticisms made in this chamber, and therefore I asked the Principal Parliamentary Reporter to furnish me with a report in such terms as he thought advisable. The report is as follows: -In reply to Mr. Speakers inquiry concerning proof revision by honorable members, and with special reference to an alteration made by the Prime Minister, to which exception has been taken, attention is directed to the following extract from the memorandum attached to each set of proofs issued to members: -Honorable members are respectfully requested to note that emendations which alter the sense of words used in debate or introduce new matter are not admissible.The terms of this memorandum were determined by Mr. President Baker and Mr. Speaker Holder in response to a request by me, dictated by a desire to preserve the fidelity of the official report, that honorable members in revising the proofs of their speeches might be restricted to the correction of errors. This suggestion was founded upon much reasonable criticism of the extent to which certain honorable members exercised the privilege of revision, and was also put forward in the discharge of what I conceived to be my duty as the officer responsible to Parliament for the production of the reports.In accordance with instructions I then received, all cases in which doubt has existed as to whether the limits laid down in the memorandum have been exceeded have been referred to Mr. President or Mr. Speaker for acceptance or rejection of the proposed alteration. In these instances members have sometimes desired to employ verbiage which apparently altered the sense of the words used in debate, and in other cases have sought to introduce new matter. Applying the decision of the Presiding Officers in these instances to the alteration recently made by the Prime Minister, it should certainly be accepted. Al though the alteration unquestionably qualified the phrase originally used, it could not, in my judgment, be regarded as an alteration of sense within the definition of the terms laid down by many Presiding Officers decisions, nor, according to similar decisions could it be designated new matter. If it be considered that my discretion, in this instance, was wrongly exercised, it would be necessary to in future reject a considerable number of emendations which have hitherto been accepted without question as not infringing the rule.Further experience of the latitude allowed to honorable members in proof revision, however, induces me to again suggest that they should be strictly confined to the correction of errors in the report. The alterations in phraseology made by some honorable members are frequently so extensive as to render it extremely difficult, in the very limited time available for the purpose, to determine whether or not the rule has been infringed. In the interests of the trustworthiness of the reports,  for the purpose of reference, and as embodying an accurate record of debate, I respectfully invite the reconsideration by the Presiding Officers of the existing practice.B. Harry Friend,Principal Parliamentary Reporter. 25th January, 1918.With reference to this report I desire to inform the House that, while honorable members generally exercise the privilege of revision only to the extent of correcting errors, and some members not at all, others do so with a considerable amount of freedom, not only in the direction of amplification and qualification, but also in otherwise altering the phraseology of their speeches.Where this has been done within reasonable limits and without altering the sense of their utterances or introducing new matter - although in some cases it has caused inconvenience and delay in checking and re-setting - such emendations have been allowed to pass.It not infrequently happens that the effort to crowd a number of subjects and arguments into a time-limited speech, especially when the train of thought is disturbed by interjections or other distracting influences, betrays some honorable members into expressing themselves in terms which, when read in print, are found either to obscure their meaning or to convey an erroneous impression. And I am not prepared to say that in such circumstances honorable members are not entitled to make corrections necessary to convey the meaning they intended when speaking.In a publication which circulates so largely among public libraries in various countries, in literary institutes, in universities for the use of students of constitutional history, and in shorthand schools for the purpose of dictation, alterations involving improvement in literary composition, greater elegance of diction, or lucidity of expression should perhaps be encouraged rather than otherwise; but if the general trustworthiness of Hansard is likely, in consequence of emendations, to be seriously affected, its value as a reliable record of our debates will be greatly impaired, and it may be necessary in the future, unless the House otherwise decide, to confine emendations strictly to the correction of obvious errors.","N/A","HANSARD PROOF REVISION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Under the existing system, every assistance and consideration is given to claimants.There is no objection to an applicant submitting the evidence of his own medical officer at any time if he so desires; such evidence would receive full consideration. Therefore, there would be no advantage derived from the personal attendance of his own medical officer at the hearing.

In August. 1017.Prior to the formation of this Board, the New South Wales Government had taken control of the coal supply in the State of New South Wales.In order that the interests of the whole of the States, as regards coal supply, should be secured, it was decided to form the Federal Coal Board in the various States) controlled by the Central Coal Board, Melbourne.For the purpose of working uniformly with the New South Wales Board, it was arranged that two members should be added to the existing Board, namely Captain Glossop, CB., R.N., and Captain Waley, R.A.N.B., and this Board then became the joint Federal-State Board of New South Wales.2.

At the desire of the Premier of New South Wales, Captain Glossop was appointed chairman of the Board.3. In regard to the 12 per cent, and 4 per cent, in question, there are no such charges in the sense referred to.The overseas ship-owners and the Inter-State ship-owners have agreed, for the purpose of facilitating rapid despatch of steamers from the port of Sydney, that the whole of the coaling of these vessels should be administered by the Sydney Coal Board; and they have agreed to a flat charge of 28s. 6d. per ton, to cover costs of coal and all incidental charges, such as labour, freight, trimming, &c, provided that, if it is found that in carrying out of the operations in regard to the supply of this coal, the cost of same shall exceed such flat rate, the companies shall pay such excess pro rata to the tonnage of coal supplied to the steamers of the respective companies; and, conversely, should it be found that such flat rate shall exceed such cost, a refund shall be made to the companies accordingly on the same pro rata basis.4. These charges varied in accordance with the conditions of work, nature of steamers, and quality of coal, and the prices at which the various contractors were prepared to do the work.5.

Experience shows that many of these payments are not entered in the pay- books.For these reasons it is impossible to pay soldiers in full on discharge without involving the Department in serious overpayments. The balance of active pay as per pay-book is paid to the soldier within two or three days of his return, and 75 per cent, of his deferred pay is paid on discharge.

No price has been fixed for secondhand bags under the War Precautions (Prices) Regulations.The conditions relating to wheat differ so entirely from those applying to wool, that this request cannot be complied with.The weight of wheat harvested in recent years is ten times as great as that of the wool clip, hence the wool clip can be shipped much more easily than the harvest. Difficulties of wool storage are comparatively few, but in regard to wheat, they are exceedingly great. Wheat is apt to undergo deterioration, to which wool is not subject. Further, the whole of the 1916-1917 harvest has not yet been sold - over 30 per cent, still remaining unsold.

142,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"IRVINE, William","KJE","N/A","N/A","N/A",3554,"- My recollection may be inaccurate in the matter. I am sorry that we are not likely to meet earlier, though I hope that the Government may be able to call us together sooner than the date spoken of. I realize that the extraordinary circumstances connected with the formation of this Government make it necessary that Ministers should have some time in which to consider what their policy is to be, and I take this opportunity to say a few words on the remarkable political situation in which we find ourselves.I shall shortly refer to what has been called a pledge, and what the Prime Minister designated as in the nature of a threat, the public declaration of policy contained in the announcement of the Ministry that they could not continue to carry on the government of the country without conscription. I am personally concerned with what has followed, being one of those who backed the Governments bill absolutely. I stated that I would be bound entirely by the pledge that had been given.Three questions will arise in the minds of the public in connexion with the return of Ministers to office. The first of these is, Has any change in the circumstances of the war, or of Australias participation in it, occurred which affects the declaration made b$ the Prime Minister in November last? I think that the answer which will occur to every one present is  No. The Prime Minister today -indicated that there is some possibility of peace negotiations. That is a very cheering thought to us all, and we sincerely hope that peace may soon come; but in the absence of anything definite, the circumstances of the war and of our participation in it are the same now as they were in November, or certainly not any better now than they were then. The second question is, Does the Government intend to introduce conscription? The answer to that has been practically given by the Prime Minister, who has decided that at the present time it is impracticable - politically, at all events - to introduce conscription by Act of Parliament, and that it would be impracticable to go to the country on the question, even were a dissolution obtained.This brings m© to th© third question, which is of vital interest to the Government and the party that supports it. If circumstances have not altered, and if conscription is not going to be introduced, although in November last it was declared after full consideration to be vital to our participation in the war, the people will naturally wish to know if the Government has any definite or alternative method of obtaining the needed reinforcements. That is the plain issue before us, I do not think that the Government have yet, or had when Ministers re-accepted office, any definite alternative scheme in mind. If it had, that scheme should, have been stated long ago. Therefore, the time that will elapse before w© meet again seems to me to be given the Prime Minister and his colleagues to try to devise an effective substitute for conscription which will procure. 7,000 recruits a month. I do not think it will be possible to get quite so many as that, and I do not know what suggestions have been made, but I say emphatically that a declaration of the kind made by the Prime Minister cannot be lightly put aside. No change of circumstances, no decision of honorable members, can alter a definite engagement of the kind that was given. To my mind, the warrant of Ministers for retaining their seats on the Treasury bench must depend on whether they can between now and the next meeting bring forward some definite and complete scheme which will have a reasonable chance of proving an adequate substitute for conscription. If the Government asks us to indorse the continuation, or any variation, of -that wretched system - wretched in its later development at all events - of hysterical appeals to the sense of shame of persons who> have no sense of shame, which for some months, or for some weeks, before conscription was declared to be vital, had (resulted in the number of recruits dwindling down to a small stream, consisting almost entirely of schoolboys lately arrived at the age of eighteen years, of soldiers who had been patched up and were ready to return to the Front, and of family men who, having managed to settle their affairs, found themselves able to volunteer, as they had all along intended to do- if we enter again on that wretched system, I say now, and I desire to place it on record, that not only shall we fail in our duty to the Empire, but that Ministers will be in a position of having failed to honour the pledge which they gave to the people. Whether they will do that or not remains to be seen. During the conscription campaign I was asked on many platforms whether the Government would keep its pledge, and I repeatedly said that it was unthinkable that an engagement of honour, given under such circumstances, would not be maintained in substance as well as in the letter. The only way in which it can be so maintained is by the Government finding some effective alternative to conscription. The Prime Minister has to-day mentioned a large number of very important matters that will engage the attention of the Government in the immediate future : Repatriation, finance, industrial legislation, and so on. These matters are of extraordinarily great importance, but, overshadowing them all at the present moment is the absolute and paramount necessity of not allowing our divisions at the Front to be depleted and broken up, and our promise to the Empire to fail. Conscription, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, is necessarily put aside for the time being - many honorable members think for all time, though I do not. I have said before that I do not believe that there will be any method whereby we can get anything like the necessary reinforcements unless both parties cordially co-operate  in the attempt to get them, and I had hoped that, before we parted, the Leader of the Opposition would have been in a position to say whether, on this one point of getting recruits, honorable members opposite were willing to co-operate with the Government and the party on this side in any way that might be devised without any breaking of pledges owed by them to their party outside. I cannot get it out of my mind the impression that honorable members opposite are not entirely free in this matter. At any rate, I understand that alliances or coalitions with any other party are not permissible to them. It is not my desire to stir up conflict, rather do I seek to still it, if possible; but, assuming that I have stated the position of honorable members opposite correctly, I would like to know from their leader whether, despite all that has been said during the heat of the recent debate, it is not still possible to have-some form of co-operation, short of coalition, for i this purpose 1 I have already suggested a meeting of all members who are anxious to find a way out. The Government are obliged to go into the question of trying to find recruits, and the only bar to honorable members opposite joining in the same task is, as one gathers from their own expressions, the fact that they cannot co-operate with this Government. It is unfortunate that we have had no statement from the Leader of the Opposition that his party will be ready - within certain limits - to meet our party for the purpose of considering what means may be taken to the end of securing reinforcements, and for the prevention of a humiliating disaster to this country, which seems possible if, through our failure to provide our men with sufficient reinforcements, our divisions have to be broken up. Surely it is not too late for the honorable member to give some indication of co-operation of a limited kind - whatever it may be - in the future, even to the extent of sharing in a National Government. At any rate, for the present, an announcement from the honorable member that his party will share in the task of attempting to arrive at some effective policy of getting recruits will be most acceptable.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[3]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I refer to the dispute between the British Medical Association and the friendly societies. It may be said that this is not a matter of Federal importance, but, as friendly societies play a great part in the community, and have been the means of alleviating more suffering than has any other form of organization, it behoves all Governments to see that the good work which they are carrying on is not discontinued. I have no desire to go into the merits or demerits of the case, because I do not wish to prejudice any action that I would like the Federal Government to take. The British Medical Association has made a demand on the friendly societies for payment of 6s. per annum in excess of what has been paid in the past under certain agreements. The friendly societies have agreed to give 50 per cent, of the advance asked, and there the matter rests. The State Government appointed a Judge to consider the matter.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Of the members of the friendly societies in this State, 19,000 have enlisted. These men are practically made free members of the lodges, but their payments to the doctors are still maintained, and their lodge fees are kept up for them. This responsibility has placed a considerable expense on the societies. At the same time, funeral allowance payments have been greater than would otherwise have been the case, and sick payments have also been greater than would have been the case if there had been no war.. I mention these matters in order to show that this is a question of national importance. The Federal Government should have some degree of responsibility, because these societies relieve the Treasury of considerable disbursements which otherwise would have fallen on the Commonwealth finances.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[4]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

147,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MATHEWS, James","KNH","N/A","N/A","N/A",3556,"- On the 31st instant, I am a trustee of two or three of these societies. In one case there are sixty men at the Front, and many of the men have left dependants here who will be without medical attendance at the end of this month. Seeing that it is a matter of national importance, could not a regulation be framed under the War Precautions (Moratorium) Regulations deferring the resignations of the doctors for another month so that some arrangement may be come to between the two parties ? But for the war having depleted the number of eligible men available, the friendly societies of Victoria would not be in their present position, as they would have been able to secure other doctors to take up their work. Let me say that there was a truce declared between the societies and the doctors until the war was over. I mention that as another justification for action by the Prime Minister, because it goes to show that the difficulty is one which has arisen out of the war. A statement appeared in the press that the legal representative of the British Medical Association, Mr. Stanton Crouch, asserted that there was no truce; but I have seen a letter from this gentleman, dated some time back, charging a certain friendly society with having broken the truce. Such a letter could not have been written if Mr. Crouch had not recognised that there was such a truce as I have referred to. It may seem a somewhat strange request to ask the Prime Minister to compel medical men in Victoria to attend members of friendly societies, and give them professional advice; but I am not asking the right honorable gentleman to say that the doctors should continue to render their services to members of friendly societies for the fees they are getting  now, but  that a definite break between the medical men and the societies should be postponed for another month, to give time for an amicable settlement of the difficulty. The State Government have signally failed to deal with the matter. Perhaps I should not have said that, but there can be no doubt that their efforts in that direction have not been successful. I do not know whether the Prime Minister has been watching the press references to the matter, or has given it, so far, any consideration; but if he will take action to postpone the breach for another month, to give time for a friendly settlement of the difficulty, I can assure him that the whole of the friendly societies of Victoria will be keenly appreciative of h:s services.Mr. SAMPSON (Wimmera) [3.551-1 shall not refer to recent incidents arising from the Federal situation further than to say that my attitude towards the Government in connexion with the Bendigo pledge is well known. I regretted very much, indeed, and I think the bulk of the honorable members of this Parliament, and probably the majority of tha people of Australia, equally regret that Ministers should have given such a pledge.I have been pleased to hear the statement made by the Prime Minister tL t during the recess it is the intention . of the Government to consider questions of prime national importance, and that when Parliament meets again, the Government will be in a position to make a declaration as to their policy. I trust that their policy will include satisfactory proposals for providing reinforcements which will relieve the Administration from the serious criticism directed against it in connexion with the Bendigo pledge. I hope that the policy will have regard, also, for the promise made at Bendigo prior to the last general election, when the National party was returned with such a large majority. Consideration must be given to the relations between i capital and labour, and every effort must be made to enable Australia to increase its production if we are to get back to normal conditions after the war without delay. I shall not attempt to discuss details of industrial legislation, but I suggest that representatives of the Labour organizations and of capital in Australia might be brought together to consider how far it is possible, not only to introduce a fair system of piece-work, as has been proposed in connexion with the shipbuilding scheme, but also to secure cooperation between capital and labour in connexion with all primary <»nd secondary production. There is no country in the world in which the conditions are more favorable for the adoption of satisfactory industrial legislation, and the Government led by the Prime Minister will earn the lasting gratitude of the legislators of the world if they are able to bring about industrial harmony in the way I suggest, and so provide for increased production generally, with better conditions for the industrial section of the community.I hope that during the recess action will be taken by the Cabinet to relieve the Prime Minister of some of the duties that he is now called upon to carry out, and particularly that some other Minister will be called upon to relieve him of the work connected with the shipbuilding, scheme.I am glad that the Prime Minister has referred to the question of primary production, because it is so closely associated with transport. I believe there are good possibilities for the extension of trade in the Far Eastern countries and in the United States. By associating the shipbuilding proposal with the matter of primary production, the transport of our products may be provided for in such a way as to enable us .to finance our obligation in connexion with the war, and to be of great assistance to us when the war is over.I trust that when Parliament re-, assembles the Government will come forward with proposals which will justify us in giving them such combined support as will enable Australia to carry out her part in the great war both at home and abroad. Action should be taken to bring about better terms between the presentMinistry and the Opposition in order that justice may be done in the matter of providing recruits for our Forces, and the stimulation of our industries. I am sorry that Parliament is to be in recess for so long a period. I should have preferred that the important legislation that has been foreshadowed, and some of which has been already delayed too long, should be undertaken immediately. We are informed that we are to go into recess for two months, but I trust that it will be possible for Parliament to meet earlier than is at present anticipated in order to deal with the important legislation indicated by the Prime Minister this afternoon.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[4]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I wish to refer to it in somewhat the same spirit as that adopted by the honorable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine). It is impossible that we should fail to realize the extraordinary seriousness of the present position. We must all feel that the position of our own country and of the Empire demands the most serious attention. Whilst the Prime Minister was speaking, I could not help the recollection of a statement he made in Bendigo in April of last year, to the effect that the question of conscription having been decided by the people it would not be resurrected or revived. At that time the Government were consequently faced with the necessity of finding a policy to carry on the war without conscription. Yet at this time of the day, after an interval of nearly ten months, the Prime Minister tells us that the Government are going to consider their policy. It is the most damaging admission of bankruptcy in government that, I think, Australia has ever been faced with. The Government set out to win the war; they announced themselves as being ready to proceed vigorously with measures for winning the war last April.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That would be a stupid thing for me to do, and it is equally stupid, unnecessary, and impertinent for Captain Glossop to interfere in Australian political affairs. There is too much of that among both military and naval officers.The position of . Australian civilian prisoners in camps in Germany has for a considerable time been most unsatisfactory. I have brought the matter repeatedly before the Prime Minister with very unsatisfactory results. I was told by the Government to-day that it is proposed to defer any action until the High Commissioners letter of 7th December is received. The Australian civilian prisoners in Germany found their position so intolerable, and the conditions under which they were placed so unpleasant, that they sent a statement to the High Commissioner pleading for his assistance. They received no reply, but I understand that the Government have been informed by Mr. Fisher that the Central Prisoners-of-War Committee now desire to place all overseas civilians under the care of their respective Governments. I am informed that the committee mentioned in London have undertaken to look after the welfare and comfort of the civilian Australian and other prisoners in Germany - will honorable members notice the difference between prisoners of war and civilian prisoners? - but ask that £2,500 per year should be allotted to them to cover their necessary expenses. That is where the difficulty seems to have arisen. Mr. James OConnor, a returned Australian, made the following statement to the Sydney Morning Herald of 5th November last: -The treatment of the civilians interned is wicked. If they depended upon the food the Germans supplied, all would have been dead long ago.The Australians, he says, should be permitted to have the food which their friends supply, and not be forced to rely entirely on the goods Bent by the Prisoners-of-War Association. The Kew Zealanders, who are supplied through the High Commissioner, are faring much better than the forty-eight Australians. Three out of five prisoners at Ruhleben are barefooted.Mr. OConnor says that civilians in Germany are without petrol. The civil population have no wool or linen, and women are wearing paper underclothing; but the organization of the army is so wonderful that it will take three years to knock it out. The Germans hate the very name of Australians and Canadians, who are regarded as the most doughty fighters in the Allied armies.The Government should give favorable consideration to any proposal, even if it costs £2,500 a year, that will secure comfort, as far as possible, to the civilian prisoners now in Germany. They are suffering severely. . I know one gentleman in Sydney whose son, unfortunately, happens to be there. Through mutual friends in Holland he has been able to send his son a parcel of food regularly every month. I have here the invoice of one lot of goods sent on 3rd June, and amounting in value to £1 3s. 7d.

Nothing could be further from the truth. A great deal of fuss was made as to an alleged conspiracy that was going on; but the statement made to the press by the honorable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine), the honorable member for Wimmera (Mr. Sampson), the honorable member for Indi (Mr. Leckie), and myself was an exact and complete recital of the whole facts of the case.

Knowing the circumstances, so far as we were concerned, he ought not to have kept his mouth shut when the newspapers were making bitter attacks upon us, but should have explained the position of those responsible for the proposed amendment. If he had any knowledge that other members of the party were scheming for the downfall of the Goment, he should  have named them straight out.

It had all the appearance of never having been considered, and, since then, it has been covered up with a considerable amount of doubt and suspicion. He said that, if he were in the way of that effective cooperation, so much desired at the present time between members of this Parliament, he would get out.As a result of the discussion that took place in this House last week, it is apparent that a majority of honorable members hold the belief that the Government can be better led than by the present Prime Minister.Surely Parliament is not so bankrupt of resource as to be unable to arrive at a better understanding. If honorable members had great private interests of their own at stake, they would not merely introduce an important matter such as this, and then dismiss it in a casual way, as has been done by the Government in regard to this suggested co-operation. The mere fact that the proposal has not been followed up consistently shows that there is nothing behind it. The Prime Minister, after making this casual offer in an offhand manner in Parliament, went outside, and did not hear a solitary speech from either side of the House during the whole of the debate. We were told by the Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Watt), by way of interjection, that he would read it in Hansard.

Further, could it be supposed for a moment that if any negotiations were possible with the Government, the party on this side of the House would be offered equal representation with the Ministerial party, which has nearly twice its strength? We know perfectly well we would not, and that there would be in Cabinet a majority dominated by members on the other side of the House, with, the result that the Labour party would be burdened with responsibilities for decisions arrived at by a Government in which the majority was against its representatives. This party could not accept a situation of that kind. A coalition is, therefore, impossible both on the grounds of principle and expediency.We do not want office unless we can be in a position to carry out our policy. But, whilst we do not want office, we never have, and never will, shirk our responsibilities; and there is no doubt in the world that, had the Governor-General accepted the assurance given him by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor), and had we been called upon, we would have met this House as a Ministry, and have placed a war-time policy before the country. It would then have been for this House to reject that policy if it were thought to be unsuitable.

There are, however, one or two questions which should be out. of the way before there could be any sort of co-operation by honorable members on this side. There must, for instance, be a guarantee -That conscription shall be finally and absolutely abandoned for service upon foreign battlefields, as well as a guarantee against industrial conscription in Australia.Therestoration of industrial organizations and trade unions by reestablishing the legal rights and privileges of which they have been deprived since the conscription referendum of 1916.3 ) The restoration of victimized workmen to their employment.There has been some talk of cooperation in regard to the voluntary system, but it seems to me that we have reached that stage when there would be a constant suspicion, especially in view of the qualified utterancesof Sir William Irvine, and in the absence of any direct statement from the Government. There is a suspicion that manoeuvring will take place to have another shot at introducing conscription. Until conscription is finally and definitely abandoned, and an assurance of sufficient force given to the public that they can believe it, it seems to me that there cannot be close and active cooperation between the parties. Honorable members know quite well that a large number of industrial organizations have been badly damaged, and some of them smashed altogether, by administrative actions of this Government, which got votes from the soldiers overseas on the pledge that not one stone in the temple of Labour would be disturbed.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[7]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Government have, in a number of cases, destroyed preference to unionists, which the unions had legally won in the Courts. . That is the act of the Government who pledged themselves to the trade Unionists overseas that if they would vote for the Prime Minister and those supporting him not one stone in the temple of Labour would be disturbed. There is a suspicion that the power of the Government under the War Precautions Act is to be used to smash organized Labour.The outstanding principles which I enunciated are recognised by a number of honorable members on the Government side. The honorable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr. Austin Chapman), in a press interview published in Sydney, stated distinctly that it was necessary that conscription for overseas should be definitely abandoned, and that industrial harmony should be restored in the manner I have indicated this afternoon in order to enable that co-operation which is so desirable in dealing with the great problems that confront the country.The honorable member for Henty (Mr. Boyd) stated this afternoon that from his observations it would have been the easiest thing in the world to have displaced the Government last week. That admission supports the statement that I have made that the majority of members in this House are being led by a Prime Minister, if not by a whole Government, in whom this House has no confidence, but the operation of the party machine on the Ministerial side prevents the voice of the dissentient minority of Nationalists being heard.We have read in the press that those honorable members who have gone to the extent of allowing it to be thought for. a moment that there is anything serious in their objections to the manner in which the country is being governed to-day will run the risk of having the party rule run over them, and they must either knuckle down and support the Government or leave the party.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[7]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Some honorable members on the Government side pledged themselves on the hustings to what are known as elective Ministries. Why not let us have an elective Ministry now? The Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy (Mr. Joseph Cook) have said that they are prepared to go out of office. Let all the Ministers leave office and let us substitute an elective Ministry chosen by every member of Parliament, but confining the portfolios to members of the National party. We on this side do not seek any office.

282,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CATTS, James","JWO","N/A","N/A","N/A",3567,"- I have pointed out time after time that our Standing Orders are really designed to gag Parliament. People- outside this building imagine that we have an opportunity of transacting business here. As a matter of fact, the whole parliamentary machine is designed to prevent us transacting the business of the country.There are twenty-five notices of motion on the business-paper to-day, many of which have been there for months. Yet Parliament adjourns from time to time without considering them. We have pleaded with the Prime Minister to give us an opportunity to consider these proposals, but all our appeals have fallen upon deaf ears. ^ To-day I again ask the Government, instead of closing Parliament for two months, to afford us an opportunity of discussing proposals of urgent public importance which have emanated from both sides of the House. But nothing is al lowed to come before us, save through the mouthpiece of some half-a-dozen men.If it be the desire of honorable members that a Ministry should be formed with which the entire Parliament can co-operate, Parliament should be afforded an opportunity of electing that Government. Honorable members upon both sides of the House would then be able to submit their proposals and to secure their discussion in a non-party atmosphere. The Prime Minister has referred to some of the matters with which the Government propose to deal when the House re-assembles. . He spoke of the organization of industry, and of a scheme of industrial legislation. Are the Government going to use their majority - a majority gained on a win- the- war policy - for the purpose of reorganizing the industrial legislation of this country, whilst practically excluding from their councils representatives of the industrial sections of Australia? Before this proposed legislation is submitted to Parliament, no industrial representative will see it. When it is presented for our consideration, the rules of Parliament will again be enforced, to support the tyranny of a majority, and to suppress those who really represent the workers. Apparently, the power of the Government is going to be used to overturn the stones in the temple of Labour, which the Government have pledged themselves shall not be done. Representing, as I do, a large industrial centre, I say that upon those matters which are outside of party controversy, I deplore that there is contention in this country.I believe that the questions which are of non-party concern in Australia to-day are greater than those which are of party concern. They include the defence of Australia and recruiting for service overseas. The trouble is that there is in Australia an imperialistic domination which is willing to entirely disregard the future of the country so long as the last man can be dragged out of it for service overseas. Whilst I would do everything possible to assist Great Britain and the Empire to win the war, I hold that any action we can take in that direction must be based upon a consideration of the countrys vital needs. If this Parliament were afforded untrammelled opportunity of considering the problems with which we are confronted, I would join heartily in giving effect to the decision of tie majority. But by denying us a chance to discuss these matters in Parliament, it is impossible to coerce a minority. If we had an opportunity of considering our position this Parliament would very soon reach an agreement.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[7]/continue[19]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I, however, think better of him than that. If there are in Parliament members who do not desire to reach an agreement, it will be impossible to do anything; but I believe that on each side there is a majority desirous of co-operating in matters of supreme importance to Australia that are far outside the scope of party. To believe anything else would be to believe that members generally are absolute traitors to the country, and I do not think that of any member. The main obstacle to cooperation upon vital matters is the want of opportunity to reach an agreement, and it seems to me that the Government does not desire that an agreement shall be reached. I am convinced that there is at the disposal of the Government, and of members, means for arriving at an agreement for dealing with matters of vital concern to the people of the country.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[7]/continue[22]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The division was to have been taken at half-past 3, but it was only at 10 past 3, that is, only twenty minutes before the time fixed for the division, that the Whip was informed of what was being done. It is no secret, because the facts have been published in the press, that there were only two dissentients when, at a meeting of the National party, it was moved that Mr. Hughes be leader of the party.

I decline, under any circumstances, or on any occasion, to be identified with trickery such as that of last week; because it was nothing else. For men to descend to such practices as were followed is not fair. What was to be done should have been done openly and above-board.

We are hot allowed to do it  he said - not actually in these words, but in words to that effect -  What would happen if I did ? I would not get the indorsement of the party. For purely personal and selfish reasons the interests of the Empire and of the country are sunk. That is what the honorable members words mean. And the same feeling animates honorable members opposite. They do not participate in a coalition because their principles are against such, an action, nor because they do not believe in what is being done on this side; they refuse to join with us in trying to do something in the Empires time of need simply because their own seats are aD stake. When the honorable member for Cook (Mr. J. H. Catts) was speaking, the honorable member for Darling Downs (Mr. Groom) interjected,  What do you mean by Australian interests.

331,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FENTON, James","KEV","N/A","N/A","N/A",3571,"- It did not. One of the main reasons actuating the people of Australia in returning the Labour party with a majority at the elecions held in 1914 was the fact that the party, in matters of defence, both naval and military, did not only talked, but acted. There have been frequent interjecions to-day relating to the attitude of Labour parties in other parts of the world, and particularly to that of the party in Great Britain. The attitude of the Labour party of Great Britain to-day concerning the war and its general conduct is very different from what it was at the commencement of the war. 1 will men- tion two prominent members of the Labour party in the Old World - Mr. Thomas, ex-Minister for Munitions in France, and Mr. George Henderson, an ex-member of the War Cabinet, and a leader of the Labour movement in Great Britain. They are just as earnest as ever in regard to the successful prosecution of the war, yet both of them, particularly Mr. Henderson, are engaged in preparing for the next election. At present Mr. Henderson is not only leading in the great Labour Conferences in England, but he is seeing to the selection of at least 300 Labour candidates to contest various British constituencies at the elections which he considers are quite likely to take place in May next. No one lean doubt that there will be a general election in Great Britain before the war ends, and probably at a much more critical period in the history of the war than the present. Elections have taken place in all parts of the British Dominions during the; progress of the war, and in my humble judgment the only way of clearing the atmosphere in Australia today is to permit the constituencies to express their views as to the persons by whom they shall be represented in this Parliament.The Prime Minister has this afternoon outlined a programme as extensive as any ever submitted in a Governor-Generals opening speech. Having mentioned a variety of important topics, he said that these were matters of great importance, demanding our immediate attention, and he then proceeded to move the adjournment of the House until the middle of April. We are returned to this Parliament to do the work of the country. We look to the Government to prepare the necessary legislative measures, and yet they are asking now for an adjournment of two months. There might be some justification for the proposed adjournment if it were asked for by an absolutely new Administration. I suppose that in tile records of Parliament the present Ministry will be referred to as a new Government; but we know that it is the same old Government, composed of the same men occupying their old offices, those which they have held for the past eleven months. In spite of this they are pleading for more time for the consideration of the vital measures upon which Australia and our boys at the Front depend so much.I repeat that there is one question, and only one, dividing this Parliament and the community at the present time, and that is the question of conscription. The blame for the introduction of that contentious question must rest on the shoulders of the party opposite. If it had not been introduced we would now be in a far better position in regard to the part which Australia is taking in the- war than we are. So much has been said and done since the introduction of that question that it will take the united effort of all the members of this Parliament to compose the feelings of the people outside, and bring them into a mood to take the same active part in the matter of recruiting that they were taking at one time.We may differ materially in our political ideas, but every man knows that it is impossible to take a step in advance with any hope of success unless the sympathy and support of the workers of the country have been secured. Take the workers, men and women, out of the community, and the British Empire would crumble up to-morrow.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[9]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Most of the members of the Ministry in this chamber, and in another place, are Free Traders, and the bulk of their followers are either Free Traders or fiscal atheists. What could be expected in the way of Tariff reform from a mixture of that kind ? It may seem a contradiction of my previous statement, but I say that, in respect of some of our Australian industries, no mere increase of the Tariff would be sufficient to prevent them going out of existence, and the men engaged in them being thrown out of employment, because the competition with which they are confronted is impossible for them to meet.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[9]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At present, there is no hope of saving some of our Australian industries by taking any action short of absolute prohibition of goods which we can produce and manufacture here. I would make the prohibition apply to imports from the Mother Country and New Zealand, as well as from other countries. I say that our first duty is to look to the preservation of Australian industries.What have the Government done in this matter ? Some time ago the Prime Minister, with a great flourish of trumpets, said,  I have established a Science Bureau. From that was to be evolved a great revival of the industries of Australia. I want to know, here and now, two years after the establishment of the Bureau of Science, what it has done for the industries of Australia. What are we, as a Parliament, going to do for those industries? If we are prepared to throw men out of employment, and let our soldiers come back to find their fathers out of work, they will say,  This is not how we left the country. They will want to know what their parliamentary representatives have been doing whilst they were fighting for the country abroad. There is no doubt that the returned men will be very emphatic in asking that question.

I brought the subject under the notice of Mr. Fisher when he was Prime Minister, and also under the notice of the present Prime Minister on more than one occasion since 1914. If the honorable member who interjects cares to turn up the Hansard report of the 21st October, 1914, he will find that certain suggestions I then made were favorably received by the then Prime Minister, who said he would invite the Premiers of the various States to collaborate with the Commonwealth Government in  some scheme to give Australian industries an impetus so that we might be prepared for the aftermath of the war. Employment is becoming scarcer every day, notwithstanding the fact that over 300,000 ofBorne of the best of our manhood have gone overseas. This I regard as a serious reflection on the Legislature of a free country.The Minister for the Navy announced yesterday that the American shipbuilders would turn out the first ship for Australia by March, presumably ready for business, and the question now is - When are we to i have the first ship built in Australia? What is the use of the Prime Minister spending time in endeavouring to make this or that arrangement? Why not start straightway with the building of ships ? We all know that nothing is so much needed by the Empire and her Allies as tonnage, and there ought to be no further delay. Instead of adjourning for two months, we ought to be engaged in passing measures to assist Australian industries, to rescue those which are now practically dying, and to establish new avenues of employment. It is about time that the Government woke up; and I hope, with the honorable member for Flinders and others, that the recess will not be so long as has been indicated, but that we shall be called together at an early date to discuss the measures outlined this afternoon.Great and necessary schemes have hitherto been carried on practically under the sole control of the Prime Minister; and, in this connexion, we are entitled to much more information than we have yet received. We have not had a full balance-sheet in regard to the purchase of the fleet of fifteen mercantile ships, so that we are in ignorance as to the relation between their cost and their earnings. In the case of all the Commonwealth factories we have annual financial statements, and similar information ought to be afforded in connexion with shipping, with the sugar industry, the Wheat Pool, and other commercial undertakings in which we are interested. Such information is only our due, seeing how much the Commonwealth is doing in financing the schemes; but members of the Commonwealth Legislature are left in ignorance of what is being done, although, as a matter of fact, we are the first who ought to be informed. It is left to the Auditor-General to find out and tell us of serious leakages here and there; and it is undeniable that the greatest care ought to bo exercised, because, in the future, every penny will count much more seriously than it has in the past.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[9]/continue[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I regret that tittle-tattle in the House should be made the subject of discussion; but when the honorable member for Herbert (Mr. Bamford) mentioned my name as that of one who had possibly intrigued with somebody on the other side, I gave the suggestion the most emphatic denial. I have since been puzzling my mind as to how any idea of the kind could have originated. The honorable member for Fawkner indicated that he knew something about the matter, and I saw him in regard to it. That honorable member assures me that I walked over the chamber, and, across him, said Something to an honorable member in the Government corner. I had no recollection of any such thing, but something has since come into my mind that may clear the position. The honorable member for Franklin (Mr. Mcwilliams) was speaking from that corner at the time, and I should like to be allowed to read a few words from his remarks, which may be found on page 3106 of the current Ilansard. The honorable member said -The one thing that overshadows everything else, to my mind, is the obtaining of reinforcements for the men at the Front. In view of the fact that the greatest bitterness that has ever existed in this country was created by the late referendum, and that there is a personal hostility to an extent that has never previously existed against any Government in Australia against the present occupants of the Ministerial bench, I have been thinking for a considerable time that it would be in the best interests of obtaining reinforcements if another Government occupied the Treasury bench.It is of no use to close our eyes to the fact, for it is impossible for any man to go into any portion of Australia and not find that the hostility existing between the Labour organizations and the present occupants of the Treasury bench is so intense that it is having a very serious effect on the obtaining of recruits under the voluntary system. Holding that view, it is my duty - and I take the responsibility, whatever happens - to give expression to it.I remember now that, when the honorable member for Franklin sat down, I walked across to him, and, though I do not remember the exact words, said, in effect, that if there were sufficient men on his side of his way of thinking there could be some business done. It may have been that I did mention the number - fourteen; but I gave an emphatic denial to the suggestion made this afternoon, because I had never calculated how the numbers would show on a division, and I could not understand how I could have mentioned that figure.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[9]/interjection[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That suggestion came practically from every speaker on that side, and on the back of that came this intimation from one of the leading members of the Official Labour party to one of the malcontents on the Nationalist side,  Fourteen will do it, which implied that fourteen from this side, plus the number on the other side, would just about do the trick.

It would not go beyond the one honorable member, I should think, in the immediate vicinity. The honorable member also knew that I was politically unsophisticated, and that he might safely communicate that little confidence in my hearing.I am sorry the honorable member for Cook, in frequently making what seem to me to be valuable suggestions, should so often destroy their value by his hesitancies, qualifications, and, at times, exaggerations. The one question on which we are all agreed is the immediate importance of finding sufficient reinforcements for our men at the Front. I do not suppose there would be one dissentient from that proposition on either side. That being so, I agree with the honorable member for Cook that in the future, if the best is to be got out of the voluntary system of re bruit ing, we must as a party recognise that conscription in Australia is dead, and ought to be buried. I adopt that position, and think it is quite futile for the honorable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine), who seems to be obsessed with the idea of conscription, to drag it in on every occasion. I am sorry that when we have had such an emphatic pronouncement from the people he should persist in the suggestion that it may yet be necessary to bring the question up again. I should think that after two such pronouncements as we have had from the people on the subject, we ought to be satisfied. In the recent campaign I took up this position: I said, This question has been discussed from every point of view by the people, and whatever may be the result on the 20th December, I am bound as a true Democrat to accept the decision of the people. I intend to accept it, and if in the future I find any attempt being made by the Government to bring in conscription by a side wind, it will receive my most uncompromising opposition. If we are to get the best out of the voluntary system, we must bury Conscription. I have done my utmost on the voluntary platform, and did my utmost on the conscription platform. I recognise that conscription has been put out of of the way, and that we must go back to the voluntary principle. It was quite impossible at any time to induce the people to accept conscription unless we made a united appeal to them. Had we been unanimous, or anything like it, in the House on the necessity for conscription, I believe we would have carried it, but as matters stand, it is, and has been, and -will be, absolutely impossible. If we are at one as to the necessity of raising recruits, and are thrown back on the voluntary system, then I say, without any qualification, Let us make common cause.I urge honorable members of the Opposition not to be scared away from the voluntary platforms by the action of the honorable member for Flinders (Sir William Irvine) in again holding up the bogy of conscription or the possibility of it in the future. Let us come together and make common cause. That is tie suggestion I offer. I intend doing, in my constituency, everything I can to renew interest in recruiting from the voluntary point of view. The way to make the most effectual appeal is for honorable members representing both parties in this House to come before the people and to show them, by such an object lesson, that we are at one on this most important matter.Let the Opposition pair with members of the National party, and go out upon a voluntary campaign, saying to the people,  We are at daggers drawn on a large number of questions. We are constantly at one anothers throats in regard to all kinds of matters that we deem important; but here is one about which there is no difference of opinion, about which we are agreed. There is no room for any difference of opinion. That being so, with united voice we make our appeal to the manhood of Australis, if that be done I believe the result will be all that can be desired.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[10]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If the Minister thinks the people of Indi differ from me in this matter, I am quite prepared to test their feeling.We are now to adjourn for a couple of months, and in the interim the Government will have time to decide how they will keep their pledge, or a semblance of the pledge they gave the people. Their pledge that they would not continue to govern if conscription were not agreed to will not be kept by merely drifting along and not actually governing the country. Such a course of action would be one way of appearing to keep the pledge that was given, but it would not be satisfactory to the people or the Parliament.

Not one Minister would be able to answer the question, however, without ringing up Mr. Mackinnon. I have nothing to say against the Director-General of Recruiting.

I did not intend to speak on this matter, and should not have done so but for some of the speeches made here to-day on the subject.I rose, particularly, to ask the favor-, able consideration by the Minister representing the Minister for Defence of a request on behalf of those racing clubs concerned in a recent Regulation further limiting the number of race meetings per annum. I believe it is necessary that in war time racing should be restricted; but-I say, also, that this course of action does not produce the results looked for. It is quite right that a large number of people should not be allowed to spend too much of their time during the war in an over-indulgence in racing; but I point out that many country clubs, which have been holding race meetings for forty and -fifty years, are now unable to arrange for the usual meeting because of the Regulation issued recently by the Defence Department. These clubs, moreover, are prepared to devote all the proceeds to patriotic purposes ; and several have done so up to date. Not long ago a conference was held between representatives of the Government and racing authorities, and the result, I understand, has been that seventy-nine race days have been allowed metropolitan clubs, and the balance allotted to country clubs. The object is two-fold - to prevent commercialism in racing, and the too frequent attendance of young men at such gatherings. Both objects are perfectly legitimate, but I point out that the Regulation absolutely cuts out way-back country race meetings which are held only once a year. They have not held these meetings in a spirit of commercialism. They have bred some horses in the district, and the racecourse is their place of meeting. They bring their hampers and fraternize.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[12]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

400,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"RODGERS, Arthur","KZT","N/A","LP; NAT from 1917","N/A",3579,"- No;. they are the ordinary meetings of country clubs. The Government have cut out those fixtures altogether, and have asked the Victoria Racing Club, as one of the bodies governing this sport, to say where the holding of races would be most likely to promote horse-breeding. How do the Government advance war interests by prohibiting these country meetings? Young men do not hang about a district all the year through because of the races. These engagements do no more than provide the amount of pleasure necessary to distract the minds of the average people from the worry of the war. We approached the State Commandant with a request that he should allot us a day for a meeting. His reply was that the number of race meetings had been fixed, and that he could do nothing in the matter. We went before the Victoria Racing Club, and the reply of that body was that it had been consulted only as to what dates would be best for the holding of the prescribed number of meetings. Now we have been told that we may hold our race meetings, but only on an unregistered course. What difference does it make whether the meeting is held on a registered or an unregistered course if it brings the same people together for the sarner, purpose? To begin with, meetings cannot be held on an unregistered course, because every country course is registered; Secondly, every person who participates in racing on an unregistered course, whether as owner, trainer, jockey, or bookmaker, is disqualified from participating in a registered meeting.  Cannot the authorities see that they are merely throwing dust in the eyes of the country people ?","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[12]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I make- an appeal to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence to interest himself in this matter at once. It will be of no use his telling me that he can do nothing. The Government can undo what they have done. They can allot more days for racing, and, in the interests of decent, clean, country sport, I ask them to review their decision. Many of these clubs have, by means of working bees, made their own race-courses, and the people in the district have bred horses. The holding of country races  will not interfere with the war, and will give pleasure to people who have far too little opportunity for recreation. What I should like the Government to do is to place a further limitation on the proprietary racecourses. The men who pocket the profits of racing have been allotted more dates than the big clubs, which, on one day, raised over £20,000 for repatriation. I ask the Minister hot to merely pass this matter on for an official investigation and report, but to act at once, otherwise the whole of the country club fixtures for the year will be wiped out.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[12]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Owing to somebody having given to the press a report of a meeting of the National party, I have been regarded as one of those who have been trying to cause trouble to Ministers. I knew nothing whatever of the suggested amendment to the no-confidence motion until 3.30 on Friday afternoon last. I condemned the proposal at once, because I took the view that we should adjust . our differences upstairs in the party room and not in this chamber. On the other hand, I was not satisfied in regard to certain things that had happened, and I had made up my mind that I would not vote on the want of confidence motion, I did not vote, but I say candidly that I would have done so if the life of the Government had been in danger. Having regard to the reports which have appeared in the press concerning the war policy of the Labour party, I could not afford to allow the conduct of the war to be intrusted to honorable members opposite.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

From the many conversations I have had with him, the honorable member knows well how desirous I am of bringing all political parties together for the sake of a more effective effort in regard to recruiting. I indorse the remarks of the honorable member for Fawkner (Mr. Maxwell) in that regard. It is our duty to do all we possibly can to stimulate recruiting, and I would sacrifice almost everything to the one great- aim of getting sufficient reinforcements for our men at the Front. I know members on both sides are strongly desirous that we should put our best foot forward in recruiting and all I desire is that we shall do something to bring parties into co-operation in a vigorous recruiting campaign.Parliament is to be adjourned, and the Government have told, us of the matters that are to be considered between now and the date of our re-assembling. So far as the abandonment of conscription is concerned, I make no promise. The honorable member for Fawkner has asked the Government to give a definite promise that the conscription issue will not be revived during the life of this Parliament. But what is to happen if recruiting again fails? I believe that we lost our opportunity through the wretched promise made by the Prime Minister before the last elections that this Parliament would not endeavour to enforce conscription. From the very commencement of the controversy Parliament should have dealt with the matter. I do not believe there is another country in the world, having the same franchise as the Commonwealth that would have polled so creditably as Australia did in the first referendum.  But conscription is an issue which appeals to everything that is selfish and bad in human nature, and should have never been submitted to the people. I ask the Government not to give any promise that conscription will not be proposed in future.
