I refer to the particularly disturbing report of the Australian Bureau of Statistics into social trends in our country which was released last week: in particular that single parent families are increasing; that the gap between rich and poor in Australia is widening; that the number of people over 16 on some form of social security benefit has doubled under Labor to over three million; and that Australia now ranks fourth in the world for youth suicide.

But, be that as it may, we have nothing to apologise for in terms of the social record of this government over the last 10 or 11 years.The truth of the matter, Mr President, is that the governments social welfare policies, such as Medicare, social security, education, child care, employment, and labour market programs, have contributed to a significant increase in living standards and disposable incomes for disadvantaged groups in the community. The ABS survey to which Senator Hill refers, which compares incomes between 1973 and today, does not take into account non-cash benefits such as access to concessions, health services and public housing. These have been greatly expanded during this period and they have significantly improved the standard of living of low income Australians. Moreover, the survey, as it has been reported, focuses on individual rather than household incomes. It ignores the changes in the composition of the work force, which have been quite profound since 1973.The study by Harding released two weeks ago found that, due to government policy, there had been a marked improvement in the real incomes of the poorest Australians. The government, of course, will be spending $3 billion over the next four years to fight unemployment through the white paper package. Major improvements to the family assistance system delivered significant real increases to the incomes of families, especially low income families. Rent assistance was extended to low income families in 1987 and has since been significantly increased and indexed.The Labor government has delivered real increases in rent assistance of 80 per cent for people without children and up to 139 per cent for families with children. Since 1983—to give you some more numbers, numbers man—the value of the pension has increased in real term by 14.9 per cent.Moreover, income test changes, which were announced in the Working Nation white paper, will provide greater incentives for unemployed people to do part time and casual work to supplement their income support payments. The government has also broadened the income tax base, closed down the rorts—something that the opposition could not and would not do when it had the last chance to do so—and improved equity throughout the tax system. That is a record for any government in this country to be proud of, and we stand on it.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

What steps is the government taking to put in place an environmental management infrastructure in Australia that will ensure ecologically sustainable development?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[1]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Following the Working Nation white paper, which incorporated an industry statement, the Environmental Management Industry Association of Australia, the organisation of environmental technology companies, hailed the initiatives in the white paper in very glowing terms in a press statement by its chief executive, Dr John Cole. Without quoting all of it, let me quote the salient part. He said:The raft of initiatives announced in the white paper and related industry statement will give impetus to growth of the Australian environment industry and will result in new jobs.It is a matter of historic record that the Australian government has been pursuing the environmental and development issues on a sustainable development basis as a major theme. That has caused us to harmonise the working together of industry and environmental policies. That is a key thrust echoed in the Working Nation statement.We need to ensure, in our view, that there is a closer relationship between investment in environment and environment management and infrastructure. The environment industry in Australia, in terms of its commercial aspects, is a growing and sophisticated industry. It is presently calculated at being worth, in Australian dollars, between $2 billion and $3 billion per annum.Internationally, the market is estimated at being between $US200 billion and $US300 billion, and is anticipated to increase in value by about 50 per cent by the year 2000. Australia is in a position, because of its high environmental standards, to pick up a significant part of that growth. Our strengths are in clean water management, in waste water management and in general solid waste management as well as air and land management; the ability to provide expert environmental monitoring; and an ability to recover used mining sites, and site remediation in general.The industrys strengths are being further developed through practical links in our scientific and research base. The Cooperative Research Centre for Waste Management and Pollution Control, for instance, provides a major focus for integrating the research and development activities of major Australian research institutions and environmental management companies. New products and processes are being funded as well through the industry innovation program, and international research links and market access have been established through the international science and technology program. A prime example of this was recently announced in the Australia-Germany water and waste water cooperative program.The Working Nation statement will enable our local industry to build on all the successes through a whole raft of initiatives set out in that statement, particularly some of those that go to finance accessibility for small to medium companies, the uptake of new technology, encouragement for the commercialisation of Australian technology, right the way through to the promotion of Australian infrastructure development and support services that we propose to undertake in the Asian region.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Is the minister also aware of the recent statement by leading investment bank Salomon Brothers that the budgets reliance on higher growth to reduce the deficit is `inherently risky?

If one looks, though, at the projections for the Australian economy and at the settings of the Australian budget, one can see immediately that, overwhelmingly, the response to the budget by the Australian business community has been positive and that this economy—a developed economy in terms of OECD economies, or, if one likes, peer economies to the Australian economy—is one of the best performed economies in the OECD world.We do have a growth forecast of 4 1/2 per cent in this budget.

I do not see that that is unusual. There are a lot of those who praise and support the government initiatives, too. Balancing that, we are confident that the economic settings we have in place are the appropriate ones and that the Australian people can look forward to improved economic conditions, a greater improvement in employment and, with the white paper initiatives checking in to ensure that the jobs compact starts to bite and get people back to work, a better scenario overall for those who are unemployed.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[2]/answer[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

That is what this government has said as well. To then imagine that a prudent comment objectively delivered is to be distorted into some reference for doom in the economy is, of course, a parody of economic responsibility from the opposition.

Could the minister outline to the Senate the key policy achievements of his recent visit?

18,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator McMULLAN","5I4","ACT","ALP","N/A",820,"—This area of growing interest is, as Senator Colston correctly outlined, very important for Australia. Trade with Latin America last year was worth $1.5 billion, and it has been growing strongly at 13.6 per cent annually over the past decade. So it is important and of growing significance, and it has been so seen in a bipartisan way by this Senate. A Senate committee, chaired by then Senator Maguire, did a very good job in promoting interest in trade and outlining a number of recommendations, many of which have been reflected in subsequent government actions, and some of which were taken up during the course of the visit. It was, of course, picked up by my predecessor, Senator Cook, who initiated this visit on which I have just been and, if I might say so, even by the National Party, which sent a delegation to that area recently and I appreciated the opportunity to talk with its members before I went there. I thank them for that.While I was there we had some productive discussions on a government to government basis, some of which were quite important and some of which, if I get time, I will refer to in response to the latter part of Senator Colstons question. The most important thing in terms of concrete trade outcomes was the activity of the business delegation that travelled with me to the region and, in particular, the focus on mining and telecommunications—which Senator Colston referred to—and food processing and services.The timing of the visit was determined by the Expomin—the Santiago mining exhibition, the biggest mining exhibition in Latin America. This time Australia had 34 Australian companies participating. Two years ago it was only six and the expectation is that in two years time it will be about 60. Many of those there did good business and, most importantly, generated significant business opportunities for the future, and the Austrade survey of participants was extremely positive.There was a second significant trade event. In Argentina on behalf of Australia I signed a memorandum of understanding which will promote Australia-Argentine relations and, amongst other things, remove obstacles for Australian companies doing business in the mining services and technology field. Flowing from that, an agreement was signed by the Australian Geological Survey Organisation to carry out a contract to survey for minerals in Argentina, which will be of particular importance not only profitably for that company but also for the Australian mining industry.While we were there, we were also able to promote—and I am sure all senators would welcome that—Australia as a beachhead or springboard for commercial entry into the dynamic Asia-Pacific market. We had discussions in a number of countries about the possibility of joint activity between Australia and those countries both in Latin America based in those countries, and into Asia based in Australia.In the areas Senator Colston referred to there are also some other important initiatives under discussion. There is a very significant Australian interest through BHP in the $6 billion Bolivia-Brazil pipeline project. If that is successful, it will be important for BHP and other countries. There is also significant benefit in telecommunications.I want to take the last few seconds to comment on the important issue that Senator Colston referred to about economic and political reform in Latin America. There has been a remarkable transformation, both economically and politically, and great interest in Australia in the reforms, many of which are seen as an example or a model. In many instances the reforms are very similar to those which we have undertaken. It is the success of those reforms which is creating the economic opportunities which the Australian private sector is seeking to take advantage of both in the visit the people concerned made with me on this occasion, and independently.

It is not a question of the Australian government supporting or otherwise a decision of the Philippines government. But I have to say it is a matter of disappointment that it was not possible for this matter to be resolved in a way that would allow free debate to take place on what manifestly continues to be a subject of international concern.As to the second question, I have no information as to whether or not Mrs Shackleton has been, as Senator Bourne puts it, black listed. The Australian government has normally taken the view that policy matters relating to border controls are for the individual country concerned. But, again I say it is a matter of disappointment—the position of Mrs Shackleton to one side—that it has not been possible to resolve this issue in a way that did not involve restrictions on freedom of international movement.As to the third question, if an Australian university decided to host a similar conference would we react in the same way, all I want to say is that, subject to the right we always reserve in relation to the entry of particular individuals whose presence, such as that of Mr David Irving, may be thought to be undesirable and against the national interest, the answer is no.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

What role did Australia play in this decision and what is the significance of the sanctuary for the international protection of whales?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[5]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
22,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FAULKNER","5K4","NSW","ALP","N/A",822,"—It is great news that the proposal for a major whale sanctuary in the Southern Ocean was adopted by almost all the participants of the International Whaling Commission meeting in Mexico last Friday. The Antarctic sanctuary is a great achievement for global conservation and it will provide important long-term protection for all species of great whales. This sanctuary, in conjunction with the Indian Ocean sanctuary, will ensure that there is a vast area of the southern hemisphere where commercial whaling will be prohibited.I think it is also fair to say that this is a really great achievement for Australia. Australia has been fighting for whale protection for many years and we played a key role in the establishment of this sanctuary. When the sanctuary was proposed by France—it was first considered by the IWC in 1992—I think it is fair to say that it did not have very much support. But Australia was in there from the outset and we have taken a very active role in promoting this sanctuary.After the 1993 IWC meeting we hosted an intercessional meeting on Norfolk Island to further develop the proposal. The Norfolk Island meeting set the scene for the successful outcome of last weeks Mexico meeting at which the Australian delegation played such a key role. Communities throughout the world are increasingly recognising that commercial whaling is unacceptable, that whale products are not essential and that whales are a very precious part of nature and must be protected.There is also increasing recognition of the economic value of the whale watching industry. Australia now ranks third in world terms with an estimated value of over $30 million for this industry. I do not think anyone could dispute the benefit to local economies such as Hervey Bay and Warrnambool. This establishment of the sanctuary means that all whales existing in Australian waters will have protection from the Antarctic to the tip of Cape York. For the people who are part of the growing whale watching industry and for the largest number of people of all who simply want to see whales have better security, this sanctuary really is tremendous news.Finally, I would like to congratulate the Australian delegation, led by Dr Peter Bridgewater from the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, for all its efforts over a long period and for a job very well done.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[5]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am further advised that the AFP has not provided assistance or information to the CJC regarding these allegations which go to state criminal offences. There is a Queensland CJC inquiry. The CJC, I understand, is also bound by secrecy provisions, although someone it would seem, if Senator Chapmans assertions are right, is ignoring such provisions.

Will information regarding the disposal of uranium be made available to this parliament to enable proper scrutiny of this potentially destabilising trade? Does uranium fall under `category 1—significant military goods subject to control under the guidelines for exporters on the export of defence and related goods?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[7]/question[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
51,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COOK","RF4","WA","ALP","N/A",825,"—The Commonwealth uranium stockpile was announced for disposal in the 1989-90 budget. We did not proceed to dispose of it immediately because the spot price for uranium on the world market was quite low at that stage. The spot price has increased. Overall, I think we have something like 2,262 short tonnes of uranium in stockpile and the spot price now is $9.35 per pound. We have disposed of a significant part of that stockpile and will continue to do so for the balance of this financial year. We expect to have disposed of all of it in the 1994-95 financial year.Senator Margetts asked who we will be consulting. Australia is, of course, a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The International Atomic Energy Agency is the relevant authority in that regard and, where we need to be guided, it is the significant authority with which we consult and discuss these matters. Senator Margetts asked about information being made available to the parliament. There is a great deal of information about this on the public record already. The governments policy is to dispose of this in an orderly way, not dump it on the market and depress the price. Of course, we have been going about doing that.With regard to the shipment of uranium, we operate under very stringent safeguards to ensure that the shipment is carried out in a properly conducted and safe manner. For any future shipments, as has occurred in the past, we will conduct consultations with the community and unions involved. All the material that we are disposing of is going for electricity power generation in the United States of America. It is not going for military use. I think, therefore, the third part of the honourable senators question about significant military goods is not an appropriate question in this context. It is for civil use, for power generation.The details of the contracts involved are, of course, commercial-in-confidence between the commercial partners, but we will make available as much information as we possibly can that does not impinge on our obligation to observe those confidences because of their commercial character.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[7]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The situation is as I have reported it to the Senate. The uranium stockpile that we are selling down is being sold for commercial use in the United States. Of course, the United States is a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and operates under the stringent safeguards of that treaty. This is a commercial relationship; it is not a military relationship in any way.From time to time there have been questions about what other nations do in terms of the observance of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. It is sad to report that at relevant times not all nations were signatories to the treaty and thus bound by it. Australia always has been, and has always been militant in encouraging other nations to sign and be bound by those safeguards. We cannot set up here an alarmist pattern because some countries have been, in my view, delinquent in not embracing the safeguards proposal that we are operating under.

I refer to the AAP report last Friday following the coroners report on the tragic death of a ready reservist in a grenade accident. Is it correct as claimed in a rider to the coroners report that the range officer issuing the grenades had not been instructed in their preparation? Is it correct that the senior range officer, the bombing officer in charge, had not handled a grenade for four years and had never seen the type of grenade involved? What other range officers were involved—NCOs, warrant officers and officers? What was their training, what was their experience and how recent was that experience?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[8]/question[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
55,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","VIC","ALP","N/A",826,"—Let me say at the outset that the death of any member of the Defence Force in a military accident is always taken very seriously. The review of this inquiry and the subsequent action taken to reduce the possibility of it recurring support the commitment that the Defence Force has to protecting its members from death or injury when dealing with live munitions.The army board of inquiry conclusions concur with the coroners finding that the accident occurred due to inadequacies in training in terms of splaying the grenade pins. The army board of inquiry further concluded that this practice had evolved over the years and was exacerbated by the imprecise and ambiguous statements in the relevant training pamphlet. The relevant army pamphlet was amended immediately after the board of inquiry and was based on its findings to ensure that the pamphlet is precise and unambiguous. A separate army directive was released immediately after the board of inquiry making it clear that the pins on the grenade were to be inspected and not modified—that is, splayed—before throwing.Army is extremely conscious of the adequate training and safety issues relating to all aspects of conducting weapons exercises. The modification to the grenade which killed Private Glembin was done because it was thought the action would improve safety following a previous grenade incident during range practice. The coroners findings will be studied by the army to determine whether further action is required.When these sorts of issues arise they need to be investigated thoroughly. In this case they were investigated not only by the board of inquiry but also by the coroner. Their findings are disturbing in as much as they show that the practice then adopted by the army was incorrect or imprecise. As I said, very firm action has been taken to try to remedy this situation.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[8]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Has this not removed Australias 100,000 farmers from the attention they deserve from CSIRO?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[9]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
59,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COOK","RF4","WA","ALP","N/A",827,"—I remind the Senate that in this budget we have increased baseline funding to the CSIRO. Also, the CSIRO expects to increase its commercial earnings. It will be able to access the jobs compact and increase its staff employment in support areas as well. Overall, funding to the CSIRO is up, and up significantly.Before I turn to the questions, I might add one other rider. This is a one-line appropriation by the government. We appoint a board to the CSIRO in which we have great confidence and faith. It makes the allocations to the scientific priorities of this nation, unadvised by the government. It makes choices as to how it expends the funds within the CSIRO.In response to the first question, restructuring proposals are being considered within the CSIROs Institute of Animal Production and Processing. These proposals are designed to enable the CSIRO to better support the changing needs of its stakeholders in the animal food and fibre industries for the next 10 years. The proposals are currently being put to staff, stakeholders and unions and include the proposal that the institute consolidate its research effort from the current 27 sites to 17 sites, thereby cutting overheads and administrative costs.The proposals would result in a consolidation of animal health and wool research at Geelong and of tropical animal and plant research at St Lucia in Brisbane. They would include the transfer of wool technology staff from Ryde in Sydney to the main laboratory in Geelong, and the transfer of animal health staff at Parkville in Melbourne to the Australian Animal Health Laboratory also at Geelong. It is also proposed to move tropical animal production staff from Indooroopilly in Brisbane to the Division of Tropical Crops and Pastures at the University of Queensland, St Lucia, and to Rockhampton and to reduce poultry production research in the Division of Animal Production.It is further proposed that a number of sites be disposed of, including part of the Glenthorne site in Adelaide, Yallanoon in Western Australia and Longford at Armidale in New South Wales. All of those proposals are in line with CSIRO policy to consolidate its efforts on fewer sites but—here is the rub—no decisions will be made before extensive discussion has been carried out and the final options are put to the CSIRO board.To the second question about woolgrowers and the levy, the answer is no. Most of the centres in question were purchased over 40 years ago and woolgrowers contributed relatively little to their purchase. In the interim, the CSIRO has cared for, maintained and expended funds on those facilities.To the third question about whether woolgrowers had been consulted, the answer is yes. Dr Donald of the Institute of Animal Production and Processing has briefed the directors of the NFF and the Wool Council of Australia and has been invited by the Wool Council of Australia to talk to it on 9 June. He has also offered to speak to the board of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation.In answer to the last question, the relevance of which I do not see, the CSIRO worked with McKinsey and Co. in 1993 to examine the technological needs of Australias small to medium businesses. They were defined in that study and in subsequent policy considerations within CSIRO as ranging from 20 employees and/or a turnover of $2 million per annum to 500 employees and/or a turnover of $100 million per annum. It has absolutely no effect on CSIROs research in the rural industries area.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[9]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It was my privilege to chair a meeting of the Cairns Group during the course of my recent visit to Latin America. It was unanimously regarded as a highly successful meeting. I think interested senators would be delighted to know that that meeting has reaffirmed the important continuing role of the Cairns Group in encouraging and facilitating fair trade in agriculture, because that is very important to Australia.The meeting clearly established a sense of direction and purpose for the group in the post-round environment to which Senator Forshaw was referring. It signalled very much to the world that the Cairns Group is still in business as an effective voice promoting fair trade in agriculture. I think senators would also be pleased to know that, following some speculation, there was unanimous support for Australia continuing to chair the Cairns Group. We will be continuing to do that, and we welcome the support of those other member countries. We are grateful for it.The key thing that came out of the meeting was a clear and unanimous message to the major agricultural markets and those with policies which distort those agricultural markets that the Cairns Group will insist on and exert all the pressure it can for full and prompt implementation of Uruguay Round commitments and will be vigilant in the resistance to any backsliding or circumvention of obligations. That is a proper issue for us to be concerned about. There is a serious possibility that people will seek to do that. Some people are already applying their minds to ways in which they can avoid the legitimate obligations into which they have entered, minimal as they are from a Cairns Group and Australian government point of view.The Cairns Group—and Australia as a member of it—will work to ensure that the world trade organisation, and in particular its agricultural committee, is effective in its monitoring role and in promoting the environment for further agricultural trade reform. We are trying to make it very clear that, welcome as the small amount of progress which we made in the Uruguay Round relative to the overall size of the task is, it was a very important first step. Those who were involved should be congratulated. But it is only the first step down a long road of agricultural trade reform.A significant change in the operation of the Cairns Group is that there has been agreed a wide-ranging work program, research, coordination and other such activities conducted not only by Australia but by many of the other member countries which have taken on particular obligations for research and information. Australia will continue to play its coordinating function in its capacity as chair of the Cairns Group. That broad participation by members on a range of issues has, I think, made very clear the level of continuing commitment.As part of this particular exercise the Cairns Group will be taking a close interest in policy development in those countries which have a significant impact on world agricultural trade—the United States, the European union, Japan, et cetera—to seek and to encourage policies in those countries which reduce distortions to both production and trade. It is very important that we maintain the momentum for reform that was established in the Uruguay Round. This Cairns Group meeting made a significant contribution to maintaining that momentum and, I think, advanced Australias interests and the interests of agricultural fair traders around the world.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[11]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In terms of an AAP report, if Senator Boswell had relied on the AAP then it would never have got here in the first place. I do say to Senator Boswell, though, that it really behoves all of us in this place when dragging up issues like this to recognise that, when one talks about operational matters, the enforcement agencies have a responsibility to keep them as operational matters and to keep them out of the political arena. It also behoves us, I think, to ensure that: firstly, we do not trawl peoples names in here without justification; secondly, we do not find them guilty by parliamentary innuendo, attacking and naming here; and, thirdly, we do not jump to conclusions for political reasons. Dare I say it, but on this matter the opposition is involved in all of that. It is really trawling a persons name in here and trying to make a political issue out of it.I must say that, in terms of hypocrisy, if this opposition is concerned about issues that the electorate is concerned about, if the oppositions polls are showing that the electorate does not want parliament to become a gutter, then Senator Boswell as leader of his party in this place has a responsibility to desist from dragging this sort of stuff into this place. It is utter sewage. Senator Boswells leader who, at the same time, has come in here professing a new approach ought to steer away from the hypocritical approach we are seeing from his side of parliament today. It is pure hypocrisy to claim a gutter free approach from the oppositions side when, as I say, the opposition has a mortgage on the gutter—it has taken over it.As I said to Senator Boswell at the start of this answer, I have not been officially briefed about anyone, nor would I ask because when it comes to operational matters it has been quite understood by people involved in this policy issue in this place that we should not ask, we should not be involved. As long as there is no political interference, and that should be the concern of the parliament—the Senate and the House of Representatives, and the government—we should not be trawling peoples names through this place.In terms of the NCAs obligations and its conduct, we have determined as a parliament—and we in the Senate were quite insistent on this clause going into section 50 of the NCA act—that the authority should operate in private. The charter that we have given the AFP ensures that it, too, operates in private. The Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland also has secrecy provisions which, as I say, may not be being met at the moment. It does Senator Boswells reputation no good, nor does it do the reputation of the opposition or the parliament any good, for Senator Boswell to come in here slinging dirt like this.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[12]/answer[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

76,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SCHACHT","4J4","SA","ALP","N/A",830,"—I did see the article in the Weekend Australian , written apparently by Professor Des Ball, which suggested the waste over the next decade could be $100 million. The government is calling for tenders at the moment for a nine-year contract to continue the Coastwatch service in Australia, beginning in 1995-96. The terms of the tender have been very carefully and scrupulously prepared by the Customs Service and other relevant government departments. It is to increase the area of surveillance from 200 to 300 nautical miles as a result of requests from client agencies, whether they be in the quarantine area or immigration, to name just two. We should note that Australia has a 37,000-kilometre coastline. The defence forces do provide cooperation for the work of Coastwatch in Australia, but from the very beginning the Australian government believed that the provision of Coastwatch should not be done to compromise the operational effectiveness of the defence forces. That is why we have a separate service.We do not accept Des Balls comment that much of what Coastwatch will be doing over the next decade could be effectively done by the defence forces. There are two different functions and we are looking at civilian surveillance. The most important figure I want to refute is his figure of $100 million. There will not be a waste of that amount. We would anticipate that the contract, subject to the tendering prices that would be accepted, for the enhancement of the capability of Coastwatch would be around $5 million a year over the nine-year period of the contract on what is presently paid. So we are not talking about a $100 million enhancement at all but something considerably less. In response to the demands of the community, we want to ensure that Australias coastal surveillance is maintained at a level with which the community would be satisfied. We believe that with this contract, which will go through this proper process, we will end up with an excellent Coastwatch service for Australia.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[13]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

80,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COULTER","TF4","(South Australia)","AD","N/A",831,"—by leave—I move:That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), to a question without notice asked by Senator Coulter this day, relating to the funding of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.I observe that there are some 187 scientists in the agricultural divisions of the CSIRO who are really hanging on by the skin of their teeth at the moment and are likely to get the chop within the next fortnight. This involves probably the closure of two divisions of CSIRO. For the minister to suggest that these sacked scientists should then go on to some sort of a jobs compact under the white paper proposal is ridiculous indeed. To suggest that these persons be sacked and that some younger raw recruits might be put in their place is equally ridiculous. The figures from the CSIRO over some years indicate that this trend is continuing. We note that there were 103 scientists sacked in CSIRO in 1991-92, and 67—65 per cent—occurred in agriculture. In 1992-93, there were 62 sacked in agriculture out of 115 scientists sacked in CSIRO as a whole, or 54 per cent. In 1993-94, 114 agricultural scientists were sacked out of a total sacking of 182. So this government has presided over a steady downturn in the expenditure in science research, specifically in CSIRO, and what we see in this budget, despite the ministers protestations, is simply a continuation of the same trend.This contrasts very markedly with the oft repeated claim that this government is presiding over a clever country. It is certainly not a clever country which seeks to sack some of its best and most experienced scientists working in an area which has been of undoubted major significance to Australia and will continue to be for a very long time into the future. It is also not a very clever country which, at a time when private funds are being cut because of the downturn in rural industry and because of the inability of farmers to pay levies in various areas, such as the wool levy, cuts its funding. I understand that the wool levy has been reduced from a return of some $35 million to about $21 million.Of course, it is precisely at this time that the government needs to increase its funding into these areas. This is a time when clearly the industry needs further support to make it more profitable, develop new processes, and so on, to come out the other side of that recession with a better and more vibrant industry.I conclude by reflecting on the way in which this government has forced science into a position in which it attracts a considerable amount of its funding from private sources—some 30 per cent in the case of CSIRO. According to the former minister for industry and commerce, Senator John Button, 20 to 25 per cent of scientists time is spent in applying for grants and obtaining money from those sorts of sources, so not surprisingly the whole research effort then becomes driven by that private funding. When that private funding dries up, government simply withdraws its own funding and those divisions close down.That is not a clever country, and yet that is what this government is forcing on the CSIRO. The science base of this country needs to be more heavily supported, not simply cut. The minister, in pointing to the increased funding which he claims that CSIRO is getting, in fact is participating in some figure shuffling. Some $20 million of expenditure from next year is being brought back into this year, which makes the figures for this year look better. CSIRO will be in an even worse situation next year. I strongly appeal to the government to reconsider its funding for CSIRO and substantially increase its funding, particularly in the area of agricultural research and agricultural science.","N/A","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
81,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COOK","RF4","(Western Australia-","ALP","Minister for Industry, Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science)",832,"—I am rather surprised that someone of Senator Coulters respect and eminence in this chamber should raise a point like this and debate it in a way which borders on misrepresenting the facts. I have a great regard for Senator Coulter, but not when it comes to this question.When I answered Senator Coulters question at question time, I said three things about funding which ought to be repeated frequently. The first is that we have in this budget increased the baseline funding for the CSIRO for the next three years. That is a palpable increase. The second thing is that the CSIRO will earn more funds on its projected earnings by commercial activity in the forthcoming triennium than it did in the last. That is not surprising because its services are in great demand by industry, and it will receive a handsome payment for that. So its overall funding will increase as well.I said thirdly that it has another source of funding in support services by accessing money made available under the jobs compact for training schemes. I explicitly did not say what Senator Coulter just said I said. I did not say that the CSIRO would utilise jobs compact funds to train scientists. That is a laughable proposition. I did not say it. Senator Coulter now says I did. I deny it.If Senator Coulter had been available to attend the Senate estimates committee hearing last Thursday, when CSIRO funding was before the committee, and at which I would have expected any senators in this place who had anything like a passing interest in science funding to have been present to put their questions directly to the CSIRO, he would have heard the full presentation of what the jobs compact might mean to the CSIRO in terms of potential staff gains and additional funding for support, maintenance and other such types of positions.We have here an allegation continually repeated until people are left with the impression that there has been a cut to CSIRO funding when, I repeat, the baseline funding has been increased. There are some figure shufflings; that is true. The figure shufflings are not made by the government. The first thing we have done is respond—my colleague, Mr Simon Crean, did that when he was science minister—to a CSIRO request that we fund it not on an annual basis, but for a triennium, three years in advance, so it knows what it can commit over the long period. Science needs that in order to conduct its proper research.We have continued that proposal and have announced in this budget funding for a triennial period, so there can be a long period of commitment. The funding we apply is a one-line appropriation. We do not fund specific divisions within the CSIRO, or units within it. We do not say to the CSIRO, `You must put all your funding in this basket and not in that basket. What we do as a government is fund one block of money to the CSIRO and trust in the perspicacity and scientific honesty of its board to make an assessment about what the national priorities for Australia in science research and CSIRO activity should be.We have an eminent board. This is a board that flatters Australia with the type of people it can attract. It is a highly regarded board in scientific circles. But science priorities do not stay static; they change. The very nature of science is that it is an ever-changing outward frontier of new knowledge and new research. From time to time the CSIRO board alters its priorities according to what its perception of national interest might be. That results in funding changes within the structure of CSIRO.What this argument is all about is that because the CSIRO board is consulting—not yet having decided—about switching some of its priorities, somehow the government must be attacked. My brief says, `The critical research capacity—referring to the agricultural areas that have been under debate here—`would be retained and the net decrease in research staff would be about three. On that basis, what we have been witnessing here is a tremendous beat-up, the introduction of horror stories and the pretension that something is happening which is not.","N/A","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
82,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PANIZZA","JI4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",833,"—I would like to enter this debate for a few short moments to follow up on something Senator Cook told us earlier about closing CSIRO agricultural stations. I will not comment on the ones proposed to be closed in the eastern states but I definitely want to address the one that is supposedly closing at Bakers Hill in Western Australia—the Yalanbee Research Station. Senator Cook told us that there was consultation with the NFF and so on, but he is totally wrong. The NFF is far removed from anything else in primary industry in Western Australia, let alone what is going on at Bakers Hill. Senator Cook—and he is running away like the coward he usually is; he has done that to me before—told us that that was not correct, that it was bought out of wool growers fees and levies.Yalanbee at Bakers Hill was bought with wool growers levies some 20 years ago. It is not up to the NFF based here in Canberra even to comment on what Bakers Hill does. The point is that there is an attempt to sell off Bakers Hill and remove the research to Katanning in Western Australia. As a former Western Australian, Senator Coulter knows that the climate at Bakers Hill is totally different from that of Katanning. It is a totally different environment in which to carry on the same experiments with crops and animal production. That has to be looked at. Bakers Hill was bought with wool growers funds in the first place and now the government wants to sell it from under their noses without consultation. That is the point about Bakers Hill. To say that the government has consulted with the National Farmers Federation, sitting here in Canberra, is not consulting with the farmers in Western Australia.I have a few other matters to put on the record. There has been a change in priorities for CSIRO research, initiated by Senator Schacht and Mr Griffiths—remember him?—through the McKinsey report, which put agricultural research as CSIROs least important priority. The McKinsey report recommended that CSIRO concentrate on small to medium business. A small business has been defined as employing at least 20 employees and having an annual turnover of $2 million. It has to be a fairly big farm in Australia to turn over $2 million. There are not too many that do that. We, on the agricultural base that I come from, can take it that CSIRO research has definitely lost any preference for the average farmer. This will disenfranchise about 50,000 farmers throughout Australia who do not come into that $2 million bracket. Not many of those 50,000 farmers would come into the $500,000 bracket let alone the $50 million.There is a lot more to be said in this debate which will be said another time. Cutting CSIRO funds for primary industry research will have major repercussions in Australia for many years to come unless that funding is turned around. I believe this is serious enough for this Senate to conduct an inquiry into the funding of CSIRO in total, not only into primary industry, and the chamber will be hearing more from me about that later on.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
83,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"The DEPUTY PRESIDENT",10000,"WA","LP","N/A",834,"—Order! By letter dated 12 May 1994 Senator Crane has raised with me a matter of privilege pursuant to standing order 81. The essence of the matter raised by Senator Crane is that a witness may have been penalised on account of his evidence to a Senate committee in that he was deprived of an appointment which he was otherwise to receive. The evidence for this allegation is a press report which suggests that the witness was told that his evidence to the committee was a barrier to his appointment, and this is claimed to have been in the nature of a punishment.Under the standing orders I am required to determine whether a motion to refer the matter to the privileges committee should have precedence over other business, having regard to the following criteria:(a)the principle that the Senates power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and(b)the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.Past presidential rulings have indicated that a matter will be given precedence if it is capable of being held by the Senate to meet criterion (a), and if there is no other readily available remedy. Past rulings of the President, past reports by the privileges committee and action taken by the Senate in relation to those reports indicate that any suggestion that witnesses have been penalised on account of their evidence is taken very seriously.In its 42nd report, which was endorsed by the Senate, the privileges committee stated that `any possibility of interference with or molestation of a witness must be examined and determined. Resolution 1 of the Senates privilege resolutions requires committees to conduct investigations where there is any reason to believe that a person has been improperly influenced in respect of evidence which may be given before the committee, or has been subjected to or threatened with any penalty or injury in respect of any evidence given.Senator Crane indicates that the committee concerned, the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, declined to investigate the matter. Past decisions by the Senate, however, have made it clear that any possibility of punishment of a witness because of any evidence must be investigated. Resolution 6 of the privilege resolutions also makes it clear that punishment of a witness includes depriving witnesses of any benefit on account of his or her evidence.It may be that the press report, on investigation, will be found to be erroneous, or the alleged conversation will turn out to be entirely free of the implications claimed in the article. Those are the kinds of matters which the privileges committee is best equipped to ascertain. The matter therefore clearly meets criterion (a). Past rulings of the President have indicated that in these cases there is no other readily available remedy. I therefore determine that a motion to refer the matter to the privileges committee may have precedence in accordance with standing order 81. I table a letter and attachments from Senator Crane.","N/A","PRIVILEGE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/debate.sub1[1]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

90,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","(Victoria-","ALP","Leader of the Government in the Senate)",835,"—I move:That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on Wednesday, 18 May 1994 of Sir John Oscar Cramer, Minister for the Army from 1956 to 1963 and member of the House of Representatives for the division of Bennelong from 1949 to 1974, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.John Oscar Cramer was born on 18 February 1896 at Gaspard, Quirindi in New South Wales. One of six children, he was educated at the local Gaspard Public School. After leaving school at the age of 14, John Cramer, as he was then, worked on the family farm and then managed a small family-owned fruit shop in Quirindi. In 1917 he moved to Sydney where he was offered work with Paramount Pictures film exchange. In 1920 Sir John, and his brothers Charles and Roy, set up a small real estate business on the North Shore in Sydney. He retained his interests in this business well into his retirement.Prior to entering federal politics Sir John was actively involved in local government. He held several significant positions, including Chairman of the Sydney County Council and Mayor of North Sydney. Sir John is recognised as one of the co-founders of the Liberal Party. He was heavily involved in the push for the establishment of a Commonwealth-wide party and, while his efforts earned him as many enemies as friends—as these efforts always do—they were rewarded in 1944 when Sir Robert Menzies launched the Liberal Party of Australia.At the age of 53 Sir John sought and won pre-selection for the federal seat of Bennelong and was voted into office in the 1949 federal election. He professed to being an incurable addict in relation to public matters and gained immense personal satisfaction from public life. Although there were many things about parliamentary life which frustrated him, he said often that he felt greatly privileged to work with men and women who, in his opinion, were imbued with an inner spirit of service to their fellows.Following the federal election of 1955 Sir Robert Menzies appointed Sir John to his ministry as Minister for the Army. He retained that portfolio until 1963 when he chose, at the age of 67, to return to the back bench. From 1 March 1950, Sir John served as a member of the Joint Committee on Public Works and chaired the committee from 1954 to 1955. He also served as a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1970 to 1972. He led an Australian delegation to the 14th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference in the Bahamas in 1968 and was an observer at the South Pacific Conference in Fiji in 1970. In the Queens birthday honours list in 1964 he was knighted in recognition of his long and valuable service in the interests of his country. His political career continued until he retired from parliament in 1974 at the age of 78.Sir Johns life was not without personal tragedy. He was predeceased by his son John who died in 1964, and his wife Mary who died in 1984. True to the form of so many of his generation, who lived through some of Australias toughest years, encompassing World War I, the Great Depression, World War II and the period of post-war reconstruction, Sir John Cramer was dedicated to the service of his country. He will be remembered for his unceasing efforts in public life and for the political contribution he made at both federal and local levels of government. On behalf of the government I extend to his family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
91,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HILL","BH4","(South Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)",836,"—On behalf of opposition senators I join the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) in expressing regret at the death of the Hon. Sir John Oscar Cramer on 18 May. One of the founding members of the Liberal Party of Australia, Sir John was a long-serving, dedicated politician and a larger than life character.Born late last century in rural New South Wales, as was said by the minister, he worked on the family farm until the age of 21 and then moved to Sydney. Clearly not content in his first job as a clerk at Paramount Pictures, he attended night school classes in bookkeeping and accounting. Completing his studies, he and his brother established a real estate business which became very successful.His political career began in local politics. He was elected to the North Sydney Municipal Council as an alderman in 1932 and was mayor from 1939 to 1940. Three years after joining the municipal council, he was also elected as a councillor to the Sydney County Council, a position he retained for another 21 years until 1956, being chairman for three of those years.It was in 1941, when he ceased to be mayor of North Sydney, that he began to take an interest in the federal political scene. As a member of the United Australia Party, he became very involved in the delicate, lengthy and often frustrating negotiations which eventually resulted in the Liberal Party of Australia being formed in 1944. It was thanks to the work of Sir John and his colleagues that talks persevered between the different parties, that branches were formed and that the new Liberal Party was eventually created, remained united and has, of course, gone from strength to strength. During these years he was a dedicated and tireless worker, totally committed to the goal of a united, Commonwealth-wide, anti-socialist political party.After the partys formation, he served on the federal executive until his election in 1949 to the House of Representatives as the Liberal member for Bennelong. He represented this electorate for 25 years, being re-elected nine times before finally retiring in 1974 at the age of 78. Sir John was Minister for the Army in the Menzies government for a record eight-year term from 1956 to 1963. This was a particularly significant portfolio during this time, his reign spanning the height of the Cold War and the beginning of Australias involvement in hostilities in Korea and Vietnam.As a member of parliament, Sir John was regarded as a spirited and robust performer. He was outspoken and extremely dedicated both to his constituency and to the Liberal Party. As one journalist remarked, `His enthusiasm for the Liberal Party, its virtues and its objectives, were happily unrestrained. In a newspaper interview when he was 76 and the oldest Liberal in the federal parliament, Sir John, in typical manner, assured the interviewer of his enduring virility and ability. Indeed, although he retired two years later, he went on to live for another 20 years. Sir John was knighted in 1964 in recognition of his public service. Apart from his childhood in the country, Sir John lived in North Sydney all his life and was well known in his local community.Sir John was a member of the North Sydney Rotary club for nearly 63 years. I am told that members well remember his last visit to this particular club when, at the age of 93, he took to the podium in his classic hearty, vociferous manner and instructed members on an issue he felt strongly about, that of single sex clubs. On that occasion he lost the debate. Sir Johns wife, Lady Mary Cramer, who died in 1984, was honoured by the Queen in 1971 for her 40 years of community service to the North Shore.Sir John was an uncompromising and unconcernedly irreverent man unashamedly dedicated to the future of Australia and the ideal of democratic freedom on which the Liberal Party was based. It is a great shame that Sir John will not be proudly participating this August in the fiftieth anniversary celebrations for the Liberal Party which he was instrumental in creating. On behalf in particular of Liberal senators I extend our deepest sympathy to his family.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
92,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOSWELL","YE4","(Queensland-","NP","Leader of the National Party of Australia)",837,"—I rise to associate members of the National Party of Australia with the condolence motion moved by the government concerning Sir John Cramer who passed away at the great age of 98. Sir John Cramer had a long and distinguished career in both local and federal politics. He represented the people of Bennelong in the House of Representatives for a quarter of a century. He will also be remembered as a founding member of the great Liberal Party of Australia, and it is a pity that he will not be at the celebration in August of 50 years of the Liberal Party.John Cramer grew up on a farm in Quirindi in New South Wales. He attended the local school and worked on the family farm before moving to Sydney in search of greater employment prospects. He improved his qualifications by attending evening classes in accountancy, and then went into the real estate business with his brother. The business they established in the Sydney suburb of Crows Nest flourished for many years.John Cramer played an active role in local government. After serving for nearly a decade as an alderman in the North Sydney Municipal Council, he was elected mayor of North Sydney in 1939. He also held the position of chairman of the Sydney County Council in 1946 and 1947 and again in 1949.John Cramer was a member of the Liberal Party federal executive from the time of its inception until he was elected to represent the seat of Bennelong in the House of Representatives in the new Menzies government in 1949. He was appointed Minister for the Army in 1956, and served effectively in that role for a record period of seven years. He was a robust parliamentary performer who relished a good debate.In 1964 John Cramer was awarded a knighthood in recognition of his many years of public service to local and federal governments. He devoted much of his life to tireless public service, firstly to the people of North Sydney and later to the people of Bennelong. I am sure all honourable senators will join with me in extending sympathy to John Cramers extended family and friends.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
93,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOURNE","TW4","(New South Wales)","AD","N/A",837,"—On behalf of the Australian Democrats I also wish to be associated with this condolence motion before the Senate today. Although Sir John Cramer was not known to me personally, it is clear from the remarks made by various people in recent weeks that Sir John was widely respected and much admired. In particular, his active service to the community both as a member for the federal seat of Bennelong and before that as the chairman of the Sydney County Council deserves to be recognised.Sir John was active for many years in local government, holding a number of important positions, including serving as mayor of North Sydney, before entering federal parliament in the election of 1949. He remained as the member for Bennelong until 1974. Politics formed a major part of his life, and he obviously held an enormous commitment to the Liberal Party of Australia and its ideals. His key involvement in the partys formation has already been referred to, and this is clearly underlined by Sir Johns service as a member of the Liberal Party executive in the early years after the party was formed.During his time in federal politics, Sir John served for a record term as Minister for the Army from 1956 to 1963. This in itself is something of an achievement for it was during that time that the Menzies government was involved in a number of important foreign policy and defence decisions, and Sir John Cramer clearly participated in the decision making process at that time. No doubt his long years as a federal minister contributed to John Cramer being knighted in 1964. By all accounts his influence in federal politics and Liberal Party politics in particular extended way beyond his time as a minister or as the member for Bennelong.It is true that the Australian Democrats would probably find little in common with the views that Sir John Cramer espoused, particularly on issues affecting the future shape of our society. Nevertheless, his commitment to Australia should never be doubted. For this and his obvious dedication to his own ideals, the Australian Democrats salute him. On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I offer his family our most sincere condolences.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
94,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",838,"—Sir John Cramer was my local member for many years, to be succeeded on his retirement by John Howard. He was the second last of the 19th century parliamentarians. I do not mean in attitude—although perhaps he would not have objected to that description—but in age. Although there is some discrepancy about whether he was born in 1896 or 1897, my record shows that it was on 18 February 1897. I understand that only one 19th century former member of the House of Representatives is still alive—Mr T.F. Williams, a former Labor member for Robertson, who was born on 7 April 1897.Sir John certainly had a distinguished career both in the parliament and outside it. He was the epitome of the small businessman whose best interests—that of initiative and individual effort—were clearly represented within the Liberal Party. I can remember, as a schoolboy in the mid-1940s, going on the tram from St Leonards station to North Sydney Boys High School in Falcon Street and seeing the Cramer Bros. Real Estate agency in its prominent position at Crows Nest.Sir John was a man who attracted the occasional comment. In the 1940s he was known as `Calamity Cramer because in those days, when he was chairman of the Sydney County Council, there were persistent blackouts as a result of a shortage of coal. At one stage, Mr Chifley tried to resolve the shortage by putting troops in the mines, much to the distress of many of his colleagues in the Labor Party. But that was only one of the many public service activities of John Cramer. He wore the sobriquet of `Calamity Cramer quite happily; he was simply the bearer of bad news being shot at all the time.As John Howard said in his eulogy at Sir Johns state funeral last Wednesday, his life of 98 years embraced all the great eras and traumas since federation—two great wars, a depression, post-war industrial and economic expansion, and social upheaval, particularly in the 1960s.As John Howard said, three influences dominated his long life: his deep and genuine family bonds, having at their core a 62 1/2-year marriage to his late wife, Dame Mary Cramer; his strong Catholic faith; and his simple, robust commitment to an uncomplicated Australia. His political career began at the local level and reached the pinnacle of becoming a minister of the Crown.The sort of political activity in which Sir John was involved was highlighted not by his being a minister of the Crown but by his being a founding member of the Liberal Party. He dealt with that wittily, lightly and entertainingly at a dinner I organised for coalition members as a farewell to the Old Parliament House in 1988. Fortunately, Sir Johns speech on that occasion is on tape.Sir John died 50 years after he helped form the Liberal Party—strangely, 20 years to the day after he ceased being the federal member for Bennelong in the national parliament on 18 May 1974. He entered the parliament in 1949 with the resurgence of Menzies, the man whom he had helped to set up the Liberal Party.He was in every sense the classic local member who looked after his local community but who, nonetheless, had the capacity to serve as a minister of the Crown for eight years in the Menzies government. I send my best wishes to his family.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
95,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TEAGUE","PJ4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",838,"—I share in the remarks of colleagues in my condolence to the family of Sir John Cramer and to all his many friends throughout Australia, especially New South Wales, whom he served throughout his life. I had the honour to represent the President of the Senate at the funeral and memorial service at St Marys Church in North Sydney last Wednesday morning. It was, of course, an occasion of sadness, but also of triumph and inspiration as we recalled the contributions to his state of a great Australian.I was happy to meet some members of his family. At the service I heard that there are 19 great grandchildren. Two of his daughters and a son—a fourth child, a son, predeceased him—were present with their families, consisting of many children and some great grandchildren.I was at a memorial service of a man who had lived 98 years—longer than the whole Commonwealth of Australia has existed to this point. In his childhood and teenage years he had been a farm boy at Quirindi in New South Wales. He came to the big smoke, the city, and in the early 1920s had established a real estate office with his brothers. They prospered as Sydney extended across the North Shore.Even when Sir John Cramer retired from the parliament 20 years and two weeks ago at the age of 78 he returned to his real estate business to make sure that it was all the more enhanced. One of the references made to Sir John that touched me—as I am sure it did everyone in the church that day—was that in recent years not one day passed without one member of his family coming to see him.He has been a widower for 15 years or so. He had been married for 62 years. One can imagine an achieving, aging widower who has made a huge contribution to his profession, to his state, to the parliament, and to North Sydney where he was mayor. In these last years he was all the more religious and devoted in his prayer, and all the more careful to relate to every member of his large and happy family.I was very quick to agree to the request of the President of the Senate to represent him at the funeral because here was a stalwart of the Liberal Party—one of the founders of the Liberal Party. This is the 50th anniversary of the Liberal Partys existence. Along with Sir Robert Menzies, Sir John Cramer was one of the principle activists in Sydney in the formation of the Liberal Party.But there was another reason that I so happily went to his memorial service. When I was a teenager the very first letter I received from any minister of the Commonwealth of Australia was from Sir John Cramer. To have an impressive envelope and letterhead and the signature of a minister of the Crown sent to me as a teenager in Adelaide was something which had never happened to me before and I was understandably very impressed. So his name as Minister for the Army at that time in 1962 stayed with me forever.I never had the chance to physically meet him. He left parliament in 1974; I came four years later and took my place here on 1 July 1978. That is one of my regrets. But it was certainly no regret to be a part of all of those who shared in the memorial service last Wednesday.There have only been two members for the electorate of Bennelong because it was a seat created for the 1949 election. Sir John Cramer represented Bennelong for 25 years and his successor, the current member Mr John Howard, has represented it for 20 years. It is a coincidence that it was on the 20th anniversary of the succession of one from the other that Sir John Cramer died on Thursday two weeks ago.In conclusion, I note a reading from the service that was delivered by Darya McCann, one of his grandchildren, from St Pauls letter to the Romans:None of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.There was a poem read by another granddaughter, Kirby Grattan:Death is going home,it is a continuation of life,the completion of lifethe heart and soul live foreverthey do not die.Death is going home to God,there is no fearIt was once remarked that because of his Catholic faith it was propitious for Sir Robert Menzies to include Sir John Cramer as a minister in the Liberal-National Party government for some seven years in the 1950s and early 1960s. Sir Johns reply to those who made such cynical comments—to those who thought that the only reason for his being a minister was that he was a bridge to that Catholic predominance in the DLP whose votes were needed for the success of the Liberal-National Partys measures in the parliament—was, `No, to the contrary. My being a Catholic has been one of the crosses I have had to bear through my life. I have been discriminated against and I have found society prejudiced against me because I am a Catholic. But I have had other crosses to bear. One is that I am an Australian farm boy of German descent.He would have been 18 at the beginning of the First World War. During the Second World War I am sure that there were those in Australia who would have misconstrued his loyalties. It is clear that he had to clarify to his would-be detractors that he was a genuine Australian and should not be misrepresented as being anything other.But he said that he had another cross to bear and that was that he was a real estate agent. I imagine that a second-hand car salesman would make the same kind of remark. Whether or not he was tongue-in-cheek when he said that he had these burdens to bear I leave to those who knew him better than I.I find from reading his first speech in the parliament in 1950, from what I have read from his own writing, from the account of his life that is available from the library, especially from the eloquent remarks of John Howard at the funeral service, and from my contacts with the family that it is only with the best memories that I think of this man who lived 98 years and who has served his country, his party and his family so very well. My condolences to all the members of his family.","N/A","CONDOLENCES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Determination then provides that a person is taken to have been convicted of an offence if, among other things, the person has been charged with and found guilty of an offence, but discharged without conviction, or the person has not been found guilty of an offence, but a court has taken the offence into account in passing sentence on the person for another offence. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on whether the expressions under paragraph 3(1) are appropriate and whether the provisions in paragraphs 3(1)(j) and 3(2) may operate harshly and breach the personal rights of those affected.Meat Inspection (Fees) OrdersMeat Inspection Orders No. 1 of 1994This instrument makes provision for Quality Assurance Agreements and for meat inspection services at premises that are not prescribed premises.The Explanatory Statement advises that the Orders will result in total fees being reduced by $0.3 million in a full financial year. While the Committee welcomes this reduction it wrote to the Minister asking about the basis for the reduction.More importantly, the Secretary is given a number of discretions which are commercially valuable. These include the power to extend the time for payment of an unpaid fee or late payment penalty, to allow an unpaid fee or late payment penalty to be paid by instalments (paragraph 24.1), to direct that inspection services must not be provided if fees or penalties are unpaid (paragraph 28.2) and to remit some or all of a fee or late payment penalty in special circumstances (paragraph 29.1).Paragraphs 30 and 31 provide for reconsideration of decisions by the Secretary and for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This right of review, however, does not extend to reconsidered decisions made under paragraphs 24.1 or 29.1(a). As these may be the most commercially valuable decisions, the Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on why these decisions have been excluded from AAT review, while a possibly less important decision is subject to review.","N/A","NOTICES OF MOTION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1[8]/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

110,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COLSTON","PF4","(Queensland)","ALP","N/A",844,"—On 14 March I reported to the Senate on the committees concerns with this instrument which related to restrictions on the application of the child abduction convention. The Attorney-General has now provided the committee with information which meets its concerns. The committee is grateful for this cooperation. As usual, I seek leave to incorporate the committees correspondence in Hansard .Leave granted.The correspondence read as follows—9 February 1994The Hon Michael Lavarch, MPAttorney-GeneralParliament HouseCANBERRA ACT 2600Dear MinisterI refer to the Family Law (Child Abduction Convention) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1993 No 358.Among other things, the regulations omit the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from Schedule 2 Convention countries and, retrospectively from 1 December 1991, substitute Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The SFRY was retrospectively included as a Convention country from 1 December 1991 by Statutory Rules 1992 No. 34.The result of the changes is presumably that from 1 December 1991 to 23 December 1993, the date of the changes made by the present regulations, the whole of the area of the former SFRY was a Convention country in respect of which the Convention had entered into force for Australia. The present regulations, however, do not appear to apply to all of that area. For instance, are Slovenia, Montenegro and Serbia now covered? If there are gaps, are child abductions in these areas to be left in limbo? Finally, what is the basis for the retrospectivity to 1 December 1991 for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia?Developments in this area are of particular interest to the Committee, which presented a special report to the Senate on its scrutiny of regulations imposing United Nations sanctions. This report was favourably mentioned in the Explanatory Memorandum and second reading speech for the Charter of United Nations Amendment Act 1993.Accordingly, it would be appreciated if officers of your Department could brief the Committee on the present regulations at its next meeting at 8.30 am on Thursday, 24 February 1994 in Committee Room 1S6. The briefing would be quite informal and not recorded by Hansard . The Department could discuss any details with the Committee secretary on 277 3066.Yours sincerelyMal ColstonChairman24 February 1994The Hon Michael Lavarch, MPAttorney-GeneralParliament HouseCANBERRA ACT 2600Dear MinisterI refer to my letter of 9 February 1994 about the Family Law (Child Abduction Convention) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1993 No. 358.At its meeting of 24 February 1994 the Committee was briefed on the Regulations by Mr Richard Morgan, Mr Bill Campbell and Ms Jenny Degeling of your Department. I would be grateful if you could arrange for our thanks to be conveyed to these officers for their helpful assistance.The Committee understands that the Department will approach the Hague Conference on Private International Law, the present authorities in Belgrade and the government of Slovenia, with a view to obtaining, as far as is possible, undertakings about coverage by the Convention of all the territory of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Committee would appreciate your advice on the result of these approaches.In view of the importance of the subject matter of the Regulations and the possible effect upon a considerable number of Australians of restricted application of the Convention, on behalf of the Committee I will give a protective notice of disallowance of the Regulations on 14 March 1994, the last day on which it is possible to do so. The notice will be for 15 sitting days after that date.Yours sincerelyMal ColstonChairman22 March 1994Senator Mal ColstonChairmanSenate Standing Committee on Regulations and OrdinancesParliament HouseCANBERRA ACT 2600Dear Senator ColstonHAGUE CONVENTION ON CHILD ABDUCTION: STATUS OF YUGOSLAVIAI refer to your letter of 24 February 1994 concerning the meeting of your Committee with officers of my Department to discuss the Family Law (Child Abduction Convention) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1993 No. 358. I understand that at that meeting, the Committee expressed concern at the omission of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from the Regulations and its replacement with Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia. The Departmental officers undertook to make further enquiries to ascertain the status of the remaining Yugoslav republics of Serbia and Montenegro, and Slovenia, in respect of the Convention.The Australian Embassy in Belgrade has advised my Department (see cable at Attachment A) that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) continues to respect, on the basis of its international and legal continuity, international treaties [. . .] to which the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia acceded. Furthermore, The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia continues to exercise its rights and observe its obligations under the [Hague] Convention, without additionally notifying the depositary of the Convention thereof.The Secretary General of the Hague Conference on Private International Law has advised my Department that, in the absence of a notification of continuity, the depositary and the Permanent Bureau [of the Hague Conference] consider that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) is not a party to the Convention. (See copy of the cable at Attachment B). The Secretary General also advises that, after contact with Slovenian authorities, the accession of Slovenia is expected at some time in the future. However, a cable from the Australian Embassy in Vienna advises that Slovenia regards itself as a party to the Convention, having acceded to it in May 1993.I am advised that the views expressed by our Embassy in Belgrade are in accordance with international rules of treaty succession, and Australia can recognise the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) as a party to the Convention. Accordingly, I propose the following solution:i) that another amendment should be made immediately to the Regulations by adding the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). As there is no requirement under the Convention for the deposit of an instrument of succession, it will not be necessary to wait for that notification from the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs before the Regulations can be amended; andii) that a further amendment to the Regulations should be made by adding Slovenia, when official notification of that countrys accession is received from the depositary. It is a requirement under Article 38 of the Convention that accession to the Convention is only effective after the deposit of an instrument of accession with the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs.In addition, the Department has informed the Hague Conference of the conflicting information that has been received, and requested that the Conference gives further consideration to the advice it provided on the matter on 3 March 1994.I note that you intend to give a protective notice of disallowance of the Regulations on 14 March 1994. When the steps outlined in (i) and (ii) have been taken, I hope that you will promptly give consideration to withdrawing the notice of disallowance.Yours sincerelyMichael LavarchSenator Mal ColstonChairmanSenate Standing Committee on Regulations and OrdinancesParliament HouseCANBERRA ACT 2600Dear Senator ColstonHAGUE CONVENTION ON CHILD ABDUCTION: STATUS OF YUGOSLAVIAI am writing to ask that you give consideration to withdrawing your motion of disallowance of the Family Law (Child Abduction Convention) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1993 No. 358. I am advised that the last date for withdrawal is 31 May 1994.In my letter of 22 March 1994 I advised you of the action I proposed to take to ensure that appropriate arrangements were made in relation to the abduction of children from Slovenia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).Slovenia has lodged an instrument of accession to the Child Abduction Convention. The Convention provides that it will apply between Australia and Slovenia three months after Australia notifies its acceptance of Slovenias accession. I am advised that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is making arrangements for this notification. An amending regulation will be made to include Slovenia in the schedule to the Child Abduction Regulations as soon as the notification is made.The position in relation to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) (FRY) is more complex. Further regulations have been drafted to include the FRY in the schedule to the Regulations. However the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has expressed concern that the inclusion of FRY in the Family Law Regulations may imply Australian recognition of the FRY. As a matter of foreign policy Australia and many other countries are refusing to recognise the FRY because the FRY claims to continue the statehood of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.The question of the recognition of FRY is within the portfolio responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans. I am advised that Senator Evans will be giving further consideration to the issue whether as a matter of foreign policy, it is appropriate to include the FRY in the Family Law (Child Abduction) Regulations. In the circumstances I can do no more than give an undertaking to your Committee that regulations will be made to include the FRY as soon as the question of Australias recognition of the FRY is resolved.There are two matters which I suggest should be taken into account in deciding whether the notice of disallowance should be withdrawn.The first is that disallowance will not achieve the Committees objective of ensuring that children abducted to or from the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will be covered by the regulations and the Convention. For the purpose of the law in Australia that State no longer exists because Australia does not recognise the FRY as continuing the statehood of the former Socialist Republic. There is no Central Authority in Belgrade with which the Australian Central Authority could deal in relation to child abductions.Secondly the effect of the disallowance of Statutory Rules 1993 No. 358 would be to create confusion in the minds of family law practitioners and others who use the Family Law (Child Abduction) Regulations. If the Statutory Rules are disallowed many practitioners would assume that the Convention and regulations would no longer apply in relation to the States mentioned in the Statutory Rules (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Mauritius, Monaco, Poland, Romania). They may fail to take action under the regulations to deal with any abductions. In law the regulations and the Convention would continue to apply because regulation 10 defines a `Convention country as any country in respect of which the Convention has entered into force for Australia. We could try to explain to practitioners through legal publications why those States were no longer listed in the schedule to the regulations but there would still be considerable confusion. I do not think this sort of confusion would be in the public interest.For these reasons, and in the light of my undertaking to proceed as soon as possible with the abovementioned amending regulations, I ask that you now give consideration to withdrawing your motion of disallowance of the Family Law (Child Abduction Convention) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1993 No. 358.Yours sincerelyMICHAEL LAVARCHSenator Mal ColstonChairmanSenate Standing Committee on Regulations and OrdinancesParliament HouseCANBERRA ACT 2600Dear Senator ColstonDISALLOWANCE OF FAMILY LAW (CHILD ABDUCTION CONVENTION) REGULATIONSFurther to the Attorney-Generals letter to you of 23 May 1993 requesting that you withdraw your motion of disallowance of the Family Law (Child Abduction Convention) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1993 No. 358, I wish to advise of the latest developments in relation to Australias recognition of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).We have been advised that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has agreed that Australia should accept that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) has succeeded to the Hague Convention on Child Abduction. Furthermore, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade agrees that the Family Law (Child Abduction Convention) Regulations should include a reference to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) as the name used in UN sanctions resolutions, with an asterisk noting that The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) has declared its intention to be bound by the obligations under the Convention. This reference does not amount to recognition of that entity by Australia.I am currently preparing drafting instructions for an amendment to the Regulations which reflects the position agreed to by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Draft Regulations for this purpose will be submitted to the Minister and Executive Council at the earliest possible time.Yours sincerelyRichard MorganSenior Government CounselFamily and Administrative Law Branch24 May 1994","N/A","NOTICES OF MOTION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/debate.sub1[11]/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

131,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator IAN MACDONALD","YW4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A",849,"—For the Labor Party, regional development means plenty of rhetoric, lots of media, plenty of trips, but no genuine interest in or commitment to regional Australia. This lack of genuine interest and commitment is a matter of extreme public importance, and I am pleased to highlight it during the debate today.It is important that this matter be raised at a time when the Australian Bureau of Statistics survey shows that since this Labor government has been in power the rich people, the Labor mates, have got richer and the poor have got poorer. It is of interest to note that in the regions of Australia the income levels tend to be lower than they are in the capital cities and the provincial cities. This survey shows that during the term of this Labor government, the poor in the regions have become worse off.How can this government suggest that it has any interest in the regions when it continues to do things that are detrimental to progress and development in the regions? For example, road funding, which is essential in the regions, has been continually cut back by this government. Even in the last budget, at the same time as mouthing the rhetoric of regional Australia it yet again cut back road funding to the regions and to Australia generally. Education services in our nation, particularly in the regions, have continued to be cut back under this government, and in many places of regional Australia health services simply do not exist.The ALPs only interest in regional development is a political interest because it realises that the next elections, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland, will be won or lost in regional seats. That is why we will see from the Labor government a lot of talk, a lot of promises, a lot of fanfare, a lot of media, but no real action.The government has established the Kelty task force and the McKinsey investigation to help it write a policy for the Labor Party for the next election. Of course, the Kelty task force has been an absolute failure and farce. It was a junket for Labor supporters. The task force made 137 recommendations, very few of which have been taken up by this government. Even this government realises that this task force, headed by its good mate Mr Kelty, got a lot of good publicity but the recommendations are pretty senseless and without support. The comments of the New South Wales Farmers Federation are typical of those made about the report. The federation said:The Report provides the scope and excuses to set up gigantic slush funds to be used for partisan political purposes that could make the Ros Kelly sports rorts appear insignificant.Further, to show how stupid the report on regional Australia is, the federation said:In the Report, new roads in inner city areas of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane are called `regional programs, let alone all the other spending proposals that could take place in non-metropolitan areas.So the report was pretty senseless. Regional governments were recommended by Kelty at the expense of local government. This amounts simply to setting up a fourth tier of government, a fourth level of bureaucracy in this country.Kelty recommended that more money should go to transport through the fuel tax, but he also recommended that the fuel tax should be increased. Although we are at present paying into the governments coffers $9.7 billion in fuel tax, road funding is being reduced by another $200 million. One would wonder why Mr Kelty would recommend that even more taxes be imposed upon fuel used principally in the regional areas of Australia when this government presently rips off almost $10 billion and keeps reducing the funding on roads.There was recently a white paper supposedly on regional development. What did it say? It said very little about regional development at all. The government provided $70 million over four years to finance regional infrastructure. If we work that out, we find that that is less per annum than Mrs Kelly rorted away on the sports grants.The areas of Sunraysia and the Goulburn Valley were given a measly $6 million to address a problem which affects $1,000 million worth of exports. Kelty and the government have ignored major regional works such as the Tully-Millstream proposal simply because they are too difficult for the Labor Party politically to handle in Queensland.I conclude my remarks about the Kelty report by again quoting what was said by the New South Wales Farmers Federation. The federation stated:Regional Australia should reject the Report as it is obviously a wolf in sheeps clothing.It went on to say:It is a collection of ideas with little overall theme or coherent strategy.The McKinsey report on regional Australia is a better collection of data, and that is all it intends to be at this stage. But the report pointed out that the essential thing for the regions was regional leadership—leadership in business, councils and the community in those areas. Yet at the same time as this report is talking about that, this government does its best to interfere with the regions and cut back on services, cut back on encouragements that would make the regions prosper.In the local government area the government has increased the fringe benefits tax, which particularly affects leading councils in the regions. It has also increased the superannuation charge on local councillors, which discourages good people from standing for election to the councils in the regions, preventing the regions from having the type of leadership they deserve.The second message in the McKinsey report is that we need problem solving, not policy making. The report indicated that the government should be removing taxes, not increasing them; that it should be lessening the bureaucracy, not increasing it; that it should be addressing the Mabo problems, and there are real problems raised by the native title legislation in regional Australia.It should stop removing facilities from the regions and stop promoting contracts to Adelaide, Wollongong and Newcastle—sensitive Labor electorates—taking them away from deserving industries facilities in the region. I cite what has happened in Cairns in the term of this government where contracts have been taken away from heavy engineering works there and given to industries in areas where the Labor Party is sensitive and needs support.The McKinsey report also indicated that the way to get the regions going was to have more flexible labour markets. What does this government do? It ties them up and centralises them. The report also recommended getting rid of the on-costs to business in the region. What does this government do? It supports payroll tax, increases fringe benefits taxes, adds on the training guarantee levy, increases capital gains tax and the fuel tax, and does nothing sensible about the zone allowance. Those things should be addressed, as McKinsey well points out.Labor has no real interest in or commitment to the regions. The only significant boost that Labor has given to any region is to the region of Canberra—and good luck to it—where there is enormous growth taking place because this government continues to expand its bureaucracy. Canberra is one of the real growth regions of Australia. Local government, by contrast, has been attacked by this government. The government should be condemned for its lack of genuine interest and commitment and for giving all the wrong sorts of messages to the regions. The Labor Party will promise the world; it will set up all sorts of committees and consultancies, and get reports; it will spend millions of taxpayers dollars on advertising and promotions, but it will do absolutely nothing for regional Australia. For this it should be condemned. (Quorum formed)","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is hypocrisy for a couple of reasons. Who leads the debate? It is the shadow minister for local government and the ACT. But what about the shadow minister for the area? He is nowhere to be seen. He is not even on the speakers list.This is the sort of sincere input we are getting from the other side on this issue. I will later get to the other reasons that this is hypocrisy. The government has an informed, considered and coherent approach to regional development. It is designed to assist the regions in shaping their own destiny. It is the coalition that has no coherent policy on regional development. On the one hand, it advocates spending cuts; on the other it advocates spending sprees for regional Australia. It cannot have it both ways. It cannot, in a responsible way, have cuts but spending sprees on the other side.The current leader of the Liberal Party, Mr Downer, calls for a reduction in the budget deficit of some $10 billion. There cannot be that sort of deficit reduction without massively cutting into the program the government has geared to assisting people in our regions.

134,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOLKUS","XE4","(South Australia-","ALP","Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Multicultural Affairs)",851,"—The former shadow minister. When this proposal was put up I think he was still the shadow minister. One has only to look at that to get an idea of how the coalition is approaching the problems of the regions, the job of being an opposition and its policy development. When we are accused of not being sincere, who is doing the accusing? What sort of credibility do they have? This document of 7 April 1994 professes to be `Portfolio initiatives for regional and rural development. It is from those opposite.One would have thought that in preparing initiatives in any part of government they would have to look at policy principles, costings, assessment procedures, performance indicators and so on—all the empirical steps that everyone has to go through. What do we find in the oppositions statement—the document prepared by the then shadow minister? In that document he canvasses the objectives that need to be realised when one develops a regional and rural development policy. What does he say? Does he look at the better interests of the region or at the economic interests of the regions? Does he have any underlying social justice policies for the regions? At least he canvasses the two imperatives one has to address when developing a policy. He says:It is important when considering initiatives in the portfolio of Regional and Rural Development, to distinguish between those which are essentially beneficial to the development of Australian regions—I suppose that is fair enough; that should be the motivating factor for anyone when addressing the needs of the regions. He goes on to say that they should also look at those which will win the coalition seats in regional Australia.Nowhere should that be a policy objective or principle. If they are looking at the real needs of the regions and not at this as a cynical manoeuvre or political point scoring, they should be looking at the basic needs and programs which will be beneficial for the development of Australian regions. But the shadow minister says, `As important as that is, it is the consideration of those sorts of initiatives which will win coalition seats in regional Australia.He goes on to deal with the first category—those industrial initiatives, the economic initiatives—and dismisses them almost instantly in the first paragraph of the oppositions policy document, the document to go ahead. The spokesperson says:Those issues are critical to the development of regional Australia, but they will not propel us into Government. This discussion—and this is its priority—will be concerned with those initiatives which will win votes for the coalition.That is a most cynical attempt at policy development. When one looks at the principles, what do they say? Forget about the economic imperatives, forget about all those industrial imperatives, forget about best practice and all those other initiatives, forget about social justice programs, just look at those initiatives that will win votes for the coalition. This is the degree of cynical manipulation those opposite are now into: nothing constructive. They tried Fightback; they got done on that. They were left with nothing and this is the way ahead.Let us see what they do thereafter. Having set themselves on one course of action—winning votes for the coalition, forgetting about the rural needs of the regions—how do they then go ahead and develop a program? Mr Bruce Scott has his lists of initiatives, his lists of areas to be covered and targeted. Infrastructure is an important one. We all know that infrastructure is important, but what does the opposition say? How do those opposite approach infrastructure development in the region? Not through best practice models, not through initiatives working as we did with the Kelty and McKinsey assessments, not through working with the regions themselves and not through trying to get those regions to work together. What do they say? Mr Scott says:We need to set a figure ($1 billion, $3 billion—the actual number is insignificant)Do honourable senators believe that? `The actual number is insignificant. That is the initiative of those opposite in terms of infrastructure.We need to set a figure . . . as an indication of our commitment—he expects that he might get criticised for saying this—We should also then allude to some sort of assessment procedure by which regions . . .There is nothing empirical about that, no policy grounds, no priorities set.

Even more cynically, he says that when looking at things to assist the regions, a `road or a bridge is a proven electoral winner. It is more concrete than a tax decrease.So what does he advocate? Electoral winners. Once again, the policy guide—the cynical approach—from the opposition is not in terms of the rural interests of the regions but in how the opposition can maximise its votes. So it sets up a fund—it does not matter how much it costs; make sure its objective is winning votes for the coalition—allows direct access from the regions for funding and forgets about the things that might be worthwhile; just build them a bridge, build them a new road.

146,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SPINDLER","0X4","(Victoria)","AD","N/A",854,"—The Senate today is discussing the following matter of public importance:The lack of genuine interest in and commitment to regional Australia by the Federal Government.In June 1993 the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said:Structural adjustment has had geographical dimensions which we cannot ignore . . . unemployment, hardship and disaffection.On the day of the governments white paper, headlines in the Australian Financial Review read:Canberras strong message for the regions: you are on your own.So it looks as if the government did manage to ignore those geographical dimensions after all. Fifty per cent youth unemployment, shrinking towns, high suicide rates, poor services, high costs of petrol and utilities—as the Prime Minister said, these are all things that should have been hard to ignore. But what did we get? We got a pitifully small package—$17.8 million for regional development organisations and $10 million for infrastructure this year. It is welcome, but even 10 times these amounts would still not have been enough. Worse, the government announced this package as some wonderful gift to the regions. In fact, because of the phase-out of other government programs this pitiful package actually represents a cut in the relevant DITARD program.In 1992-93 regions got $332 million. In 1993-94 they got $95 million. After the largesse of the white paper, what will regions get in 1994-95? They will get $71 million, and that figure is projected in the budget to fall in each of the next three years. We did not get anything to address cost differentials faced by people in the country; we did not get any new investment in rail, road, hospitals or educational facilities; we did not get improved rural access to finance; we did not get an extension of the investment allowance for rural producers; and we did not get improved access to communication facilities for people outside metropolitan areas. As the paper said, regional Australia has been told, `You are on your own.I have just come back from a tour of regional Victoria visiting some 12 regions. People there are sick of the `dont bother us, do it yourselves attitude of government. They would not mind doing it themselves but they want a fair go. They want a government that supports them. Instead, many of the people I saw said that government actually creates hurdles. Governments, both state and federal, actually make it harder for them.I spoke to a meat casings manufacturer in Wangaratta who is likely to loose his export markets because the government has withdrawn AQIS inspectors from local meatworks. In Swan Hill the local TAFE cannot train the workers needed for the local horticultural industry because of mindless government insistence on student number thresholds. When I visited Bairnsdale, the loss of its local rail service to East Gippsland was cutting into tourism, and local roads were being damaged due to the additional traffic, adding to freight costs.In Shepparton another manufacturer spoke of how he now sends all of his goods by truck, whereas only a few years ago he sent them more cheaply and efficiently by rail. But government `efficiencies have made the rail option non-viable. Also in Shepparton, trucks regularly go to Melbourne with 60 per cent loads—a single container—because two containers would put them a single tonne over the 25-tonne road limit. This adds thousands of dollars to freight costs. In Albury-Wodonga a firm outside the town area operates via the Lavington telephone exchange, which has no ISDN facility. Because the rules are that people cannot have access to more than one exchange, this firms business suffers. In Echuca a 10-bed extension to the hospital is not operating because Commonwealth funds have been cut off. The list goes on and on.People in all areas were concerned about the proposed sale of airports. Small aircraft from regions are likely to be diverted to secondary city airports, costing businesses time and money. Small rural airports are likely to close, costing local business and tourism yet again. In Albury-Wodonga a major employer said that relocation of its training facilities to the area would be hindered by the extra air travel costs. People in all parts of regional Victoria had difficulty understanding how petrol prices could be 15c per litre higher than in the city.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

I ask Senator Kemp to tell me whether he is prepared to intervene in market forces to ensure that petrol prices for people in the country will come down. Since Senator Kemp is not prepared to do that, I ask the government when it will do something about petrol prices. In every community I visited the fact was raised that the money collected from petrol taxes was not going back into roads.People across all regions said that Austudy rules, combined with the cost of sending their kids to the city to study, discriminated against the bush, yet it is obvious that education is critical to regional development. In several areas major new investment in waste water treatment is needed. Lack of access to such facilities, or the limits on availability of quality water imposed by their absence, was seen by all of these regions as a constraint preventing industries from relocating to the area. Basic infrastructure is needed to encourage firms to locate in the regions—infrastructure in the broader sense: cultural and community facilities, water, airports, rail, parks and sporting facilities. It is a fantasy to believe that the private sector will provide all of these, tax concessions on infrastructure bonds notwithstanding.Over the past year the government has had four inquiries into regional development. The Industry Commission said that the government needed to make regions more attractive to capital by improving regional infrastructure. The McKinsey report said that business had real concerns about government commitment to infrastructure. The Kelty report proposed dozens of needed infrastructure projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars. So what did we get? We got two small demonstration projects.The Australian Democrats have pushed very hard for and supported the two projects in the Goulburn Valley and Sunraysia. However, this picture of regional Australia launching into a boom based on thousands of people coming from all over the country to be inspired by what is happening in Mildura and Echuca does not fill me with a lot of confidence.People in all parts of regional Victoria felt that there was little support for exports from their areas. All thought the government should give preference to Australian goods in purchasing. There was widespread contempt for the governments level playing field fantasies and, unlike the government and its Treasury bureaucrats, the people in the regions are out there competing. They are the ones who see their markets taken away from them at home and abroad by subsidised competition. IBM in Wangaratta faces the prospect of losing markets to factories in South-East Asia with cheap labour and tax holidays. Agricultural exporters in Shepparton face competition from United States farmers enjoying an average of 44 per cent subsidies. Fruit growers from Swan Hill cannot get their products into markets tied up by bilateral trade agreements. Fruit producers all along the Goulburn Valley expressed concern about imports which would not meet Australian quality standards but are being allowed in to compete against domestic products.Business finance was another theme. The government is displaying a lack of interest in providing the wherewithal—be it finance or be it infrastructure—for our regional communities. The coalition has done little more than egg on the government in the economic rationalist frenzies which have hurt regional Australia. National Party senators present should hang their heads in shame for letting this go on. It might be time for them to stand up to their Liberal Party coalition partners, reject their economic rationalist policies and stand up for people in regional Australia.The Australian Democrats believe that vibrant regions are an important and appropriate social goal. They offer us diminished pressures on urban infrastructure and better use of existing rural infrastructure; a more varied choice of lifestyle for all Australians— (Time expired)","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

Mr Kelty said he was surprised that, by driving through these regions as opposed to flying over them as he normally does, he saw—I quote him roughly so do not hold me to his exact words—intelligent people in those regions willing to get on with the job of getting Australia out of trouble.

153,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PANIZZA","JI4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",856,"—Well, Senator Murphy, those of us who come from the regions—such as Senator Ian Macdonald, a few others and me—know that people out there are willing to get on with getting Australia out of trouble. But, if Mr Kelty had gone to Western Australia and toured the regions, he would have found that people are getting Australia out of trouble without his presuming that they may be able to. Mr Kelty, in his remarks about seeing intelligent people willing to get on with the job, wakened me to what this government really thinks of regional Australia.There can be no argument that when rural and regional Australia catches a cold, the nations economy soon develops pneumonia. Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics record the 1982 drought—that is quite a while ago now—in the eastern states only too well. The rural and regional money flow into the economy was choked by this failure. In the following year—the calendar year 1983, when the money would have really dried up and when we certainly got the big drought in Western Australia as well—the annual growth was minus 0.4 per cent. One decent-sized drought in the regions has shown what can happen to the rest of Australia. Since then, only once have we gone down to that sort of figure. That was in 1991, with minus 0.7 per cent, when we were still looking for the bottom of that J-curve from Paul Keatings recession that we had to have.The last year in which annual growth was over the 4.5 per cent that the government needs in the coming year to make its budget forecasts come true was in 1989, when it was 4.7 per cent. Since then, rural and regional Australia has had to contend with the bottoming out of prices of wool, wheat and every other product that those rural regions provide. With recent improvements in prices for wheat and wool, growth in 1993 returned to a more respectable 3.5 per cent—still short of what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) needs to balance his budget.Given these linkages regarding the importance of rural and regional areas to Australia, one would think the Keating government would have treated rural and regional areas far better than it did. There was an extra $60 million in the budget for the rural adjustment scheme. In last years budget the amount provided was $24.7 million. For 1994-95, the amount provided is $83.9 million, so the government claims there is an extra $60 million available. However, when one does the figures correctly, one sees that last year $87.6 million was taken out of state funds for RAS, giving a total of $112.3 million. This year, the federal governments commitment to RAS is $83.9 million, but there is still an amount of $45 million in state reserves which can be drawn down against the government commitment. This makes a lie out of the statement that there was an increase of $60 million for the rural adjustment scheme.Added to that supposed figure of $60 million, there is $29 million over four years for a rural communities access program, 80 rural counsellors are to be employed and project grants are to be given to about 400 rural community groups to help resolve local problems. When we look at what has been provided, we may think it seems generous on paper, although it does not seem generous to people like Senator Ian Macdonald and me who know the regions so well. It may seem slightly generous, but let us compare it with other allocations in this budget. The package that I have just mentioned should be compared with the $135 million allocated to train athletes for the Sydney Olympics, the $1.5 billion for Aboriginals to buy property and the $500 million for Aboriginal health. Of course, I do not disagree with that figure of $500 million, provided it is spent properly. For once, I agree with the former Premier of Western Australia, Carmen Lawrence, who did say it is not so much the amount of money that is given to Aboriginal health—former Senator Richardson had promised an extra $800 million and she was given only $500 million—but how it is used, to make sure it is effective on the ground.An amount of $48 million has been allocated to boost language and cultural links with Asia. There has been an increase of $82 million to almost $1.5 billion in the foreign aid budget. People in rural and regional Australia have to wonder where they fit on Mr Keatings priority list. They do not fit on that list whatsoever. In rural and remote regions, the fuel excise hike put in place in last years budget, which Senator Ian Macdonald has already mentioned, is having more and more effect. The Swan report points out that if the federal government were to move taxation away from diesel fuel and on to other areas, it would create an extra 2,300 jobs, boost the economy by $600 million and increase exports by $240 million.Road funding, especially in the regions, was slashed by nearly $200 million to a record low of $820 million in real terms, despite the increases in fuel excise in the August budget. I did criticise the black spot program as being politically expedient. I apologise to the former minister, Mr Robert Brown, as it has proved successful. The government should have kept it going to fix up problem roads in the regions.With regard to wool growers, exceptional circumstance interest rate assistance will stop after this year. Of course, local government has had its funding slashed, with an increase of only one per cent compared with the current inflation rate of 2.25 per cent. No exemption has been provided to local government for the FBT. Something which will affect the regions, especially rural industries, is a matter which I spoke about in taking note of an answer to a question by Senator Coulter earlier—that is, funding for CSIRO, which has been badly cut and which will affect Australian rural production for the next 100 years. It is all very well to sell research stations in the same way as we would sell an airport, but when we sell an airport, a port or anything like that, the people of Australia will still use it. If we sell a research station, it will generally revert to ordinary farming, so the research measures will be abandoned.In conclusion, this government has no real commitment to the regions, for the reasons I have outlined. It simply promoted that exercise by Mr Kelty, who drove through the regions rather than flying over them for once. When the budget was brought down, we saw that the government certainly did not have any commitment to the regions. It should stand condemned for that very reason.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
154,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CHILDS","IF4","(New South Wales)","ALP","N/A",858,"—We are dealing with a matter of public importance introduced by the opposition which alleges there is a lack of commitment to regional Australia by the government. Senator Ian Macdonald and Senator Panizza, in introducing the discussion for the opposition, have used the usual short-termism that is particularly characteristic of them. They are referring, of course, to election issues—in other words, they are trying to solicit votes. For example, we have just heard Senator Panizza refer critically to foreign aid. He pit that against assistance to rural people. The Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) must wince when he hears this sort of short-term approach because it is recognition that the opposition does not know how often our aid program leads finally to work and to markets for Australian products.I want to refute the oppositions allegations. The coalition parties have deliberately misconstrued the scope of the governments national regional development policy. While there is $151 million over four years under the regional development portfolio for specific initiatives, a range of measures in the white paper assist Australias regions to grow. Key measures are designed to increase financing options for business. The McKinsey report showed quite clearly that a healthy business climate is a key factor in a vibrant regional economy. Private investment plays an important role in that business climate.Access to finance has been recognised by the government as being a special problem for regional businesses and communities. The white paper has responded in three very significant ways: firstly, the scope and concessionary provisions for infrastructure bonds have been broadened. Secondly, pooled development funds have been made more flexible and attractive through further tax concessions. Thirdly, small and medium sized enterprises will now be able to go directly to the Commonwealth Development Bank. The bank will now be able to assist with equity lending. Lending processes will be freed up, and the amount of funds available for lending will be increased.The need for finance for regional infrastructure is especially important and is a focus of the Kelty task force on regional development. The revisions to infrastructure bonds provide a great opportunity for regional Australia. It is the complete opposite to what the opposition is saying. Regions will be able to access private sector funds for strategic infrastructure projects. This will enable them to build on their economic strengths and determine their own needs and priorities.The changes to infrastructure bonds will result in a greater availability of funds for public sector projects in regional areas. Infrastructure bonds will be attractive to private sector companies, particularly superannuation funds, where it is anticipated that $600 billion is available for investment by the year 2010.The substantial taxation rebate allowance for infrastructure bonds will undoubtedly attract superannuation funds. Currently superannuation funds pay taxation at the rate of 15c in the dollar. The taxation treatment of infrastructure bonds provides for a tax rebate of 33c in the dollar. In other words, for every dollar invested the superannuation fund would be eligible for a tax refund of 18c.The concessionary treatment of infrastructure bonds has been extended from 10 to 15 years. The government will also allow infrastructure assets to be sold within 25 years of inception, provided they are sold to a commercial entity. In addition, the removal of local government borrowing restrictions effectively allows regions to invest in infrastructure bonds from their own resources, from regional consortia or other arrangements—the direct opposite from what the opposition would have us believe.This initiative will also complement the $70 million over four years that the government will contribute to local infrastructure programs in its own right. The government has substantially expanded the types of hard infrastructure that can be included within this scheme. These include land transport, seaports, electricity generation and transmission, aviation facilities, water and sewerage projects and other types of water infrastructure.The irrigation systems at Goulburn and Sunraysia highlighted in the white paper are examples of the kinds of projects the government will be supporting. Despite criticism from the opposition, the Sunraysia project is typical of the sorts of projects that have potential under these three particular policies to which I am referring. This expansion will be of particular benefit to regional Australia where there is a need for small-scale strategic infrastructure investment.In any discussion on financing for regional development we must recognise that local government is a key player, and this government has always supported local government. Local government has extensive borrowing capacities which are largely underutilised. Local government borrowings leveraged with infrastructure bonds will become a potent financial vehicle for regional Australia.The changes to the way pooled development funds will operate will act as a further catalyst to regional growth. Small to medium-sized enterprises, especially those located in non-metropolitan regions, have traditionally been starved of equity capital. By decreasing the tax payable on profits by pooled development funds, and by allowing these funds to invest more than five per cent of their capital in start-up exercises, the government has increased the attractiveness of equity investment in small and medium-sized enterprises, the very small and medium-sized enterprises that the opposition gives lip service to, but of course we get carping criticism when this government does something very tangible for small and medium-sized enterprises.For example, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, Brian Howe, two weeks ago met with the Hamilton regional board which has established a special venture finance committee to look at ways of overcoming the problems it faces. As a result of the white paper initiative, this board told Mr Howe that it is looking to establish its own regional pooled development fund to assist businesses in the region to grow and export. This is unambiguously good news for Hamilton.The federal government is keen to demonstrate that regions, whether metropolitan—and I do not have time to point out the advantages to metropolitan regions of the governments initiatives—or rural, can make an important contribution—","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

162,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator McGAURAN","WH4","(Victoria)","NP","N/A",860,"—I join my colleagues Senator Ian Macdonald and Senator Panizza in this matter of public importance which refers to:The lack of genuine interest and commitment in regional Australia by the Federal Government.Referring to the refusal to allow Senator Bolkus to incorporate the document, I think that is fair enough because Senator Bolkus held the document up as coalition policy. It does not have that status, so he was misleading the chamber from the time he held it up. For that reason alone it does not deserve to be incorporated.Following Senator Childss address to the Senate, I think Australians, particularly regional Australians, would have great cause for concern. This government does not know where regional Australia begins or ends, yet it goes about producing report after report, document after document, and creating bureaucracies for regional Australia. Of course, it channels millions of dollars into regional Australia, yet incredibly in this case this government has no idea of the definition of regional Australia. Senator Childs just highlighted that.The commonsense definition of regional Australia refers to those parts outside major capital cities—that is, outside Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, et cetera. That is the commonsense understanding. Even Gough Whitlam understood that. He picked out Albury-Wodonga as a major regional centre. Also, regional Australia extends into far outer regions—for example, Ouyen in the wheat belt, in the Mallee area.This government takes the view that inner city areas in Melbourne, for example, are classified as regional Australia. It takes that view from the discredited Kelty report. I refer to page 55 of the Kelty report which refers to inner Melbourne as part of regional Australia when quoting the director of the Inner Metropolitan Regional Association. One only needs the word `regional to gain funds from this government. The director said:Our vision is to retain our leadership as a livable, sustainable and equitable city. It will also be a dynamic commercial, industrial, intellectual and cultural capital of the world.What a great dreamer! Of course, he would have been able to achieve those things if he could convince the government that he belonged to regional Australia—and he did. If we turn to the governments white paper, Working Australia , where it has its regional strategy, we can see that that particular gentleman and others in the inner city of Melbourne convinced this government to channel millions of dollars of scarce resources—which should have been channelled into real regional Australia—into the Domain tunnel project of inner Melbourne.All that serves to do is relieve the pressure of peak hour traffic in the inner city of Melbourne, for heavens sake. It would be a great help to the people of Mount Waverley but it is not going to help the people in the wheat belts of Albury-Wodonga. Quite frankly, it would not even rank as one of the top 500 priorities for regional Australia.We have a government that cannot even grasp the definition of regional Australia. Worse, we have a Deputy Prime Minister, a minister for regional development, who does not believe there is even a problem—who has no concern about regional Australia at all. On 17 May 1994, when the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, addressed the Building Owners and Managers Association of Queensland on the governments regional strategies he said—correctly—that there are wide variations in economic performance between states and even wider variations between regions. He said that the Kelty task force and, more recently, the McKinsey study highlighted these different performances. Then he said that they also served to debunk the myth that regional Australia is in decline.I would suggest that the Deputy Prime Minister, the minister for regional Australia, has not been out to the drought-stricken areas of New South Wales and Queensland, has not been part of western Victorias wool collapse, and has not seen the banks, post offices, railway lines, hospitals and schools closing all around regional Australia. Australians, particularly those in regional Australia, have reason to be greatly concerned when they have a government, which cannot even define regional Australia, channelling millions of dollars into the inner city of Melbourne and does not even believe that there is a problem in regional Australia.Time does not permit me to go on and totally debunk the governments working nation and regional strategy policy. Senator Ian MacDonald and Senator Panizza have already raised the issues of petrol pricing and industrial relations in regional Australia which show that a gap has opened up in the last 10 years that this government has reigned—a gap between the living standards of those in regional Australia and those in the capital cities. It is a gap fast looking like that which has opened up between the North and the South in America.The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Herron) —Order!

164,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator PATTERSON","LI4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",861,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the report.I wish to speak only briefly on this important report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on gender bias and the judiciary. At the outset, I would like to say that I was particularly pleased when this inquiry was established. As the committee acknowledges in its report, for too long the public has seen important questions about whether the judiciary fails to understand gender issues bandied about in the media, often without a detailed appreciation of the complex issues involved and, as my studies show, sometimes out of context.Rather than having the media leading the debate on these issues, it is important for informed bodies to investigate these matters. Just as I was pleased to see the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs take up this inquiry, I also welcome the work that the Australian Law Reform Commission has been doing on womens equality before the law.In part, this work has been recognised by the committee, which has recommended that the Australian Law Reform Commission identify areas of substantive law which require amendment to remove residual gender bias. Page 123 of the report says:Evidence before the Committee drew attention to the need, in a formal way, to identify legislation and precedent decisions which might require amendment because of their discriminatory potential.The Australian Law Reform Commission is obviously the most suitably qualified body to conduct this review and I look forward to the government acting on the committees recommendations.I would also like to draw the attention of honourable senators to a number of other recommendations in the report and the discussion surrounding them. Just as the committees report acknowledges a number of ways in which a lack of awareness of gender issues might manifest itself—for example, in sentencing, in the treatment of counsel and witnesses, and in summings-up—it also recognises that there are a number of ways in which they can be addressed. I am particularly encouraged by the recommendations dealing with the role of the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration in conducting voluntary judicial education courses.While education is one way of combating judicial bias, it is important that it is voluntary and does not threaten the independence of the judiciary. By nominating a body such as the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration to conduct voluntary programs addressing the issue of gender awareness and aspects of judging, the committee has recognised the importance of ensuring that a body with the respect of the courts undertakes this important role. The recommendation dealing with the establishment of a chief justices council to consider complaints against judicial offices is also a sound proposal and would do much to maintain public confidence in the judiciary and the court system as a whole.The committees report also makes a number of key recommendations about the role of the media. While there is a legitimate educative role to be played by the media, the committee has recognised that media reporting has varied from `accurate and responsible in some instances to `sensational in others. The committee identified a very real need for journalists and subeditors to receive legal education and recommends that only reporters with a thorough understanding of the operation of the courts be engaged to report on them.I welcome the recommendations that deal with these issues and I call on those in the media who are responsible for and capable of bringing about change in this area to pay attention to those recommendations which cannot be implemented by government but which are a message to the community—including the judiciary and the media—that attention needs to be paid to this very significant area.Finally, I would like to commend the committee for the work it has done on this report. The committee has produced a valuable and considered report with a number of key recommendations affecting not only the federal government but also the judiciary, the media and other sections of the community. I hope that the federal government gives the report the attention it deserves; that the media give the report the attention it deserves, not only in reporting it but also in acting on its recommendations; and that the community gives it the attention it deserves.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
165,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SPINDLER","0X4","(Victoria)","AD","N/A",862,"—The Senate is discussing the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on gender bias and the judiciary. The report is a noteworthy milestone in the administration of justice in Australia.I am pleased that, together with Senator Vanstone, whose motion started the inquiry, I was able to be part of bringing the inquiry into being. The government appeared to prefer her motion to mine, which included the selection of judges and a complaints authority for judges in the terms of reference.I am pleased, therefore, that these two matters were ultimately addressed in some detail by the committee. The main questions that were asked of the committee were these: firstly, did the publicity surrounding the statements by four judges in sexual assault cases accurately reflect the decisions of those judges; secondly, do the decisions reflect a failure to understand gender issues by judges? The comments that were made by judges in the course of sexual assault cases included something like, `No sometimes means yes and, `A husband is occasionally entitled to use rougher than usual handling to obtain his ends if his wife refuses sex. There was also the suggestion that because the victim of a rape was not conscious when the offence actually took place, this diminished the trauma that the victim experienced and therefore the offence was not, perhaps, as extreme as one might otherwise think.In relation to the main question as to whether the publicity accurately reflects the decisions, the committee found that in some cases the report was a little sensational and perhaps did not reflect accurately what the judges had said. However, I must put on record that I am grateful that the media drew attention to this issue in such a high profile and uncompromising manner because without that sort of publicity we would not have got this inquiry going and we would not have had the opportunity to examine in some detail the issues that were raised.On the question of whether the decisions reflect a failure by judges to understand gender issues, the answer would be largely yes, but again with a qualification. After taking evidence from a considerable cross-section of the legal profession, academics and some judges, the committee realised that not every judge could be said to share the views or to have the attitudes that were indicated by those statements. Nevertheless, we found that, in a sense, the problem was far more widespread; that there was a systemic failure of the legal system and of the judiciary as a whole to take full account of gender differences and that a degree of gender bias did exist throughout our legal system. It was largely due to the fact that the persons who occupy positions in the judiciary and senior positions in the legal system were predominantly male, predominantly white, predominantly over 50 and predominantly educated in traditional establishment institutions. This very obviously produced a mind-set and a system that was self-perpetuating and reinforcing.It was obvious that whilst many of the judges and lawyers occupying senior positions would certainly not agree with the statements that were made, and would certainly not share the views to the full extent that these statements indicated, nevertheless unintentionally there was a systemic gender bias throughout the legal system. The question then arose as to what the committee should recommend to overcome that problem.The first recommendation—and I think a very valid one—is clearly education for judges, education for lawyers and education for the media because we want to achieve the situation where legal cases are reported in such a way that the community can get the facts and the implications correctly. The main emphasis must be on continuing education, the provision of information and, indeed, cultural change in the thinking of the legal profession, including judges.I am happy to say that in some instances in some states this process has already started. I believe that the institute of judicial administration, which the committee thought would be the best institution to carry out this task, will be equal to it. I believe that the material and the courses offered by the institute will be readily accepted by the profession and by the judiciary.Ultimately, the cultural change that we must achieve will only come as a result of a change in the composition of the judiciary. We must have a judiciary that reflects, by and large, the composition of our community. Certainly, it must reflect the fact that 52 per cent of Australians are female, but it should also bear witness to the fact in its composition that a high proportion of our citizens originate from countries other than Australia. We must remember that we have Aboriginal people and people from other races and other religious denominations.The committee was careful to say that competence must still be the main criteria. As our law schools enrol more women and people from diverse backgrounds we will achieve a high level of competence and quality in our judicial system as well as a composition of the judiciary and the legal profession which reflects more closely the composition of our community.It is quite clear that we are not going to have an effective legal system unless judges and senior lawyers understand what men and women in the community experience in their daily lives, what their privations are, what their tasks are, the conditions in which they live and the pressures that they have to experience. I do not think it is acceptable or, indeed, possible to get good judgments if we live in an ivory tower far removed from what concerns ordinary citizens in our community.This is reflected by the committees other recommendations. We suggest that there should be greater gender and cultural diversity in the judiciary. But we also turn our attention to the selection process, and we suggest that the criteria for appointment to judicial office should be publicly available; that appointments should not be on the nudge and wink system and should not be confined to the links that senior legal people have or to the milieu in which they move.We therefore suggest that the criteria for appointment to legal office should be publicly available and that there should be a much more open process for the appointment of judges. To that end the committee recommends that there be an advisory committee to compile lists of suitable applicants or candidates for appointment to judicial office which might assist the Attorney-General in each state and the Commonwealth to propose names to the respective governments which more closely correspond to the composition of the community.I come lastly to a recommendation which I am particularly pleased about and that is that a council of chief justices be established to deal with complaints against judges. I originally asked for an independent complaints tribunal and I was met by the suggestion that we must preserve the independence of the judiciary. I agree that that is something that we must safeguard. I made that suggestion first in the report of the family law inquiry and did not receive any support for that because bias in that area had been alleged. It had been suggested that judges should not be above accountability and that they should have to respond if someone claims that they have exercised their office in an unsatisfactory manner. At that time that suggestion was not supported. But on this occasion, while we pulled back from the establishment of a complaints tribunal, the committee decided that the recommendation that a council of chief justices should be established to deal with complaints against judges should be part of its recommendations. I welcome it. I believe it is a significant advance in our legal system.I look forward to the government taking speedy action to put this recommendation into effect, as well as to implement all the other recommendations that the committee has made, which were arrived at unanimously by all the members across party lines. I pay tribute to our chairman, Senator Barney Cooney, who as usual ensured that the committee worked in a cooperative and effective manner and, in this case in particular, produced a good report with sound recommendations. I add also my thankyou to the staff of the secretariat who worked hard and diligently and with a great understanding of the issues to produce the report that is now before the Senate.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
166,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ELLISON","9X5","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A",864,"—I remind the Senate of the case that saw this reference come about. On 26 August 1992, after a four-day trial involving a charge of rape in marriage, His Honour Mr Justice Bollen of the South Australian Supreme Court charged the jury in the following manner:`Consent means free voluntary agreement to engage in an act of sexual intercourse at the time relevant. Submission is not consent. Of course, you may run into considering in this case the question of, shall I say, persuasion. There is, of course, nothing wrong with a husband, faced with his wifes initial refusal to engage in intercourse, in attempting, in an acceptable way, to persuade her to change her mind, and that may involve a measure of rougher than usual handling. It may be, in the end, that handling and persuasion will persuade the wife to agree. Sometimes it is a fine line between not agreeing, then changing of the mind, and consenting. You will bear that in mind when considering the totality of the evidence about each act of intercourse.The accused was subsequently acquitted and in January 1993, on appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal of South Australia held that the direction that I have just recited was wrong in law. The court held that suggesting that any agreement produced by rougher than usual handling might nevertheless constitute valid consent was, in fact, wrong in law. It was saying that that particular phrase, `rougher than usual handling, was inappropriately alluded to by his honour.A great deal of publicity followed that. The publicity did not pertain just to South Australia but was indeed nationwide. Around that time two other cases in Victoria dealing with sexual offences also attracted much publicity. Calls were made for members of the judiciary to apologise, to resign or be dismissed. That was the extent of the publicity in which these cases were involved—something that the law from time to time experiences as a result of controversy in the facts of a case. But this particular case engendered nationwide interest and emotional reaction. As a result of all that, in May 1993 the Senate made the following reference to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs:(a) whether recent publicity surrounding judicial comment in sexual offence cases is a proper reflection of a failure to understand gender issues by the judiciary; and(b) the appropriate response to any such failure.In embarking on this task the committee firstly had to ask itself whether the publicity surrounding these decisions accurately reflected what had gone on. In its report tabled on 13 May this year the committee recommended that education in legal matters should comprise a more prominent part in the training of journalists and subeditors. I wholeheartedly support this recommendation as the journalist who reports the case is the link between the public and the trial itself. The public has a right to know what goes on in the courts of the land but, more importantly, the public must be reliably informed as to what has gone on.I would submit with the greatest of respect that one needs competent and experienced journalists to cover those cases. My experience in Western Australia where I have been involved in 100 jury trials—perhaps more—is that there are very competent journalists involved in court reporting. But I can all too readily see where a misunderstanding might arise where a journalist is not used to court reporting or is somewhat junior, and that misunderstanding is then relayed on to the public at large which read the press report. It was a further recommendation of the committee that only reporters with a thorough understanding of the operation of the courts should be engaged to report on court proceedings.At the end of the day, the Court of Criminal Appeal in South Australia rectified the situation—it picked Mr Justice Bollen up on appeal. The system does have in-built safeguards in these matters. But that does not mean to say that I downgrade the importance of any question of gender bias in the judiciary because, indeed, there is a good deal of reason to look into this matter both in the judiciary and in the question of the up and coming legal profession.In arriving at its recommendations, the committee had taken evidence from Mr Bongiorno QC, the Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions. He stated that publicity had varied from accurate reporting in some instances, in some responsible media, to sensational beat-ups by other sections of the media.I found it most invigorating and encouraging to see the manner in which the committee approached this somewhat emotional topic. The matter was dealt with in a calm and rational way. The committee then went on to look at whether the decisions did reflect a failure by the judiciary to understand gender issues. Apart from the publicity, the committee looked at such things as the composition of the judiciary; the appointment of the judiciary; and the accountability of the judiciary in that regard. It also looked at whether there was any need for law reform in substantive law.Firstly, in relation to the composition of the judiciary, the committee found that there existed a vast disparity between the proportion of women in the population and the proportion of women in the legal profession. When one looks at the statistics in relation to my home state of Western Australia, as at 30 June 1992 there were 1,537 resident practising lawyers. Of those, 526—approximately a quarter—were women. This is not a static situation and the enrolment of females in the faculty of law has increased dramatically; so much so that, at the moment, there would be a majority of women in the law faculty of Western Australia. I would suggest this is an indication of a trend in the eastern states.The situation is a changing one and has to be looked at in that light. In the past, women have been vastly outnumbered in the law. When one draws from the legal profession for judges, one has a limited pool of experienced women from which to draw for judges. That has been a most important factor in this matter. As I have stated, I believe that with the effluxion of time the proportional imbalance will rectify itself and the question of that imbalance will gradually dissipate. Mr Justice Malcolm, the Chief Justice of Western Australia, summed up the problem quite adequately when, in referring to females in the law, he said:Their sex does not give them any claim to judicial appointment. What has to be ensured, however, is that it does not disqualify them.I believe that is the nub of the question. We do not appoint a woman to the bench merely because she is a woman, but we must ensure that she is not stopped from reaching that position because she is a woman. I echo the sentiments of Senator Spindler: at the end of the day, competence must be the main criterion for the appointment of anyone to the bench.Whilst looking at the composition of the bench, the process of appointment was looked at. Justice Brown of Victoria said:There seems to be some mystique in the appointment process—the judicial whisper goes around and someone ends up miraculously on the bench. . .At a federal level, judges are appointed by the Governor-General acting on the advice of the executive-in-council. At the state level, judicial appointments are made by the Governor, usually on the recommendation of the Attorney-General. As such, the process might seem to be somewhat transparent.However, the Commonwealth Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has suggested that judicial appointments have been characterised by the appointment of senior members of the bar, selected after informal close consultation by Attorneys-General, which may have included various bar associations, law societies, bodies such as the Law Council of Australia, some politicians and various judges. As such, there is really no defined process for the appointment of judges.That is perhaps a matter which needs to be looked at. In fact, it formed part of a recommendation of the committee. After extensive evidence on the subject, the committee recommended that the Commonwealth Attorney-General should establish a committee which would advise on prospective appointees to the Commonwealth judiciary. I reiterate that the independence of the judiciary must be preserved at all costs and that the appointment of judges should not be a political process; the recommendation of the committee in this regard would ensure that the perception of that independence and the integrity of the process of appointment is maintained.The process of judicial appointment in England is somewhat similar to our own. In 1988, Canada implemented a system similar to the recommendation I have just mentioned; namely, a committee to assess and advise on the qualification of candidates for judicial appointment at the federal level. In the United States of America, judges are elected to many courts, whilst the US Senate appoints judges on the nomination of the President to the Federal Court of America. I am not suggesting for one moment that judges should be elected. I realise that the question of the Senate appointing or selecting judges has been raised from time to time, but that perhaps is a touch too adventurous to go into here today.The question of where we draw our judges from was also looked at. The committee was of the view that representatives from the judiciary should come from the legal profession and perhaps the wider community. It seemed that there was some view that in the eastern states the judiciary came from barristers—members of the bar—and that it was somewhat restricted in that regard. In Western Australia, where the profession is fused—one can practice as both a barrister and solicitor—there are numerous instances where judges have come from solicitors. I would certainly endorse that approach.The committee also looked at the question of drawing on the wider community, such as academics, solicitors or lawyers, who practised for the government. I have no problem with the latter. In fact, in Western Australia there are a number of crown prosecutors who have been appointed to the bench. They have been very good appointments and are fine judges. As for the appointment of academics, again the question of competency must remain foremost. One most realise that, to become a judge, an appointee must have a good deal of commonsense, experience with day-to-day living and, most of all, an innate sense of fairness. With those qualities, any appointment to the bench would be a successful one.The committee did not find that there was prejudice on the part of the judiciary as a whole but concluded that a problem exists which is perhaps wider than a handful of isolated instances. That was concluded after a good deal of evidence had been taken on the matter. Again, the appropriate response was thought to lie in education. The committee therefore recommended that the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration develop specific programs addressing gender awareness and all aspects of judging.As a check on the situation generally, the committee recommended that a council of chief justices, both federal and from the states, be established to consider complaints against members of the judiciary and to suggest appropriate courses of action where a complaint might be justified or where a complaint has raised a wider issue. At this point I would dwell for a moment on the fact that inappropriate behaviour might touch not only on a lack of gender awareness or gender bias but there may be other behaviour by a judge which is considered to be inappropriate, such as rudeness and standing over witnesses. A number of aspects could come under that umbrella—","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

But during that time I have had nothing but a high regard for the judiciary which this country enjoys.That leads me to the final aspect—namely, whether any amendment of substantive law was required in order to address this situation. Questions such as whether the law favoured a male offender over a female victim was considered; possible changes to the notion of consent and sexual assault offences were mooted and, similarly, regard was had to precedent decisions which might require amendment because of any potential for discrimination. Recently in Victoria questions have been raised in relation to sexual assaults and prostitutes. The question there has been: should the occupation of the victim have any relevance to sentencing?These are relevant questions, but I would urge caution in approaching amendments to substantive law merely to address what might be seen initially as some sort of gender bias. Recently in Western Australia amendments have been made to the Evidence Act which have downplayed the question of recent complaint by a complainant, and past associations with the victim have now been made more difficult to introduce in the course of a defence of a charge of sexual assault.We must always remember that we are dealing with a system which presumes the innocence of the person charged and, furthermore, the charge must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. When we look at any amendment of substantive law we must jealously guard those principles and not merely throw them to the wind to address some social issue. I am not saying that there are not areas of the law which might not need attention, and I support wholeheartedly the committees recommendation that the Australian Law Reform Commission look at the question of the substantive law and identify any areas which might require any amendment. But that process would have to be a very careful process indeed and not one which is attended to by haste or indiscretion.At the end of the day, legislation and action by the government can go only so far in affecting attitudes of the judiciary and more widely in the legal system. As I mentioned earlier, education has been the main response of the committee and I believe that is the only direction within which an appropriate response can lie.This has been an emotional topic and one which has attracted a great deal of publicity. I believe the Senates legal and constitutional affairs committee has approached this matter in a rational and balanced way. I commend my fellow members on that committee from all sections of the chamber in the way that they have deliberated over the evidence and considered this much vexed question. I believe that the unanimous report now before the Senate is one from which a community-wide response could be worked and can provide a stepping stone to greater things. I thoroughly commend the report to the Senate.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
169,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COONEY","SF4","(Victoria)","ALP","N/A",868,"—This is a unanimous report and, as chair of the committee, I thank Senator Ellison for his outstanding efforts in preparing this report. I thank Senator Spindler, Senator Chris Evans, and Senator Amanda Vanstone. I take this opportunity to congratulate Senator Vanstone on her appointment as shadow Attorney-General. I think she will make an outstanding shadow Attorney-General. She knows her law, she has a passion to put the law forward, she has a passion for politics, and I think the opposition has chosen well.I also thank Senator Jim McKiernan, who contributes to more committees than most of us in this chamber and he does it with considerable style and skill. I thank Senator Bill OChee and Senator Margaret Reynolds. I thank the secretariat, well led by its committee secretary, Mr Paul Griffiths, and the other officers, James Warmenhoven, Virginia Buring, Belinda Jackson, Catherine Cornish and the executive assistant, Margaret Lindeman.Many of the matters that I am about to deal with have been dealt with already, but I think they are worth repeating. The problem the committee found to exist between the media and the courts was a clash of cultures. No doubt the media is looking for a story. They want to handle it responsibly, of course, but they are looking for the human element, and that sometimes gives an imbalance to the reality. The judges, on the other hand, want to conduct a trial fairly. That often means that it moves slowly. A lot of things are said over a considerable period and often that is difficult to report. But I think that if both the media and the courts try to understand each others cultures more, a lot of the problems will be solved.Political journalists in this place are quite outstanding. They understand how politics works, much more so than a lot of politicians do. They know what the issues are, and they present the issues accurately and in a way that the public can take up. Hopefully the same sort of thing can be done with people who report judicial matters. It is probably a bit more difficult than having a press gallery, but much would be gained by having a courts gallery where journalists who are learned in the law and know what the issues are could report them.I think an illustration of that is the treatment of Judge Blands comments on 15 April 1993, when he was reported as saying that no sometimes means yes. If we look at the context in which he said that, and the exchange between him and the prosecutor when they were dealing with the issue of sentence, we see that his remarks are better put in context and much more understandable than how they were reported. As has been pointed out by his fellow judges, no appeal was brought from the sentence imposed by him and no exception was taken to his remarks when he passed sentence. That is just an illustration of how necessary it is for the two cultures to understand each other.Much has been said about sexual offences. There is no doubt that they are very bad crimes, and it is a dreadful thing that people who commit them are not punished. On the other hand, it is a dreadful thing if a person who is not a sexual offender is punished as one. As Senator Ellison said, it is for that reason that the law says that offences must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.In that context, it should be remembered that the criminal law is punishing offences against the community—those acts that society thinks are so bad that they ought to be visited with criminal sanctions. But it is sometimes thought by some that the criminal law is more a law that deals with disputes between people—the victim and the perpetrator. That is true to some extent but I think it is the wrong analysis of what the criminal law is all about and sometimes leads to demands, such as demands for victim impact statements, which are not as accurate as they should be.There has been much talk of more women being put on the bench, and I certainly agree that that ought to happen. I point out here—it has been pointed out already, but I think it is a point worth making—that in the 1950s when my wife was studying law there were very few women in her class.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

There is only one judge, Mr Justice Nahum Mushin, who has come from that university. As time goes by, there will be a lot more of them. It is an illustration that when we are looking at whether or not a proper approach has been taken to appointing judges, regard must be had to the fact that judges take some time to grow. It will be interesting to see how many women are on the bench at the turn of the century.There is one other point I want to make about the appointment of judges in that context. I think it would be wrong to appoint judges on the basis that they reflect society. If we do that, as somebody said, five per cent of judges ought to be convicted criminals.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2/speech[4]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

176,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COONEY","SF4","(Victoria)","ALP","N/A",868,"—It is unlikely. But it illustrates that if there is a reflected principle, that is the sort of difficulty one comes across. What we want is a judiciary that understands the various sections of the community. We want a judiciary that is quite outstanding but, nevertheless, has an ability to understand the pressures and difficulties that people from all walks of life may have. It is the understanding that ought to be emphasised, rather than the reflected principles.Different qualities are required of judges in different courts. A court with a jury would be best handled by people who know their rules of evidence, what should be allowed into evidence and what should not. Appeal tribunals need judges with different qualities. Senator Gareth Evans denies that he would ever go on the High Court but that is perhaps the one court that he would suit. I hope he does not come after me for saying that. I think Senator Evans would have the ability to be a great High Court judge whereas he might not have the ability to be a great judge at first instance—not that he could not learn up his evidence; but he has chosen to come to the Senate instead, where rules of evidence do not count.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2/speech[4]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

178,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COONEY","SF4","(Victoria)","ALP","N/A",868,"—No, they do not. Looking at the substantive law and trying to squeeze out of that any sexual or other bias is important. The judges who made the remarks that have been criticised and referred to were not making remarks out of the air. They were making their remarks on the basis of what they had grown up with at law school. The sorts of things they said were the sorts of things that were taught in law schools in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. So it is the substantive law that needs to be looked at. What the judges have to do is attach themselves to the changing law so the changing culture of the law is kept up with.In conclusion, in my view we have in Australia a very good judiciary. It is clear of corruption; it has considerable ability and has great respect. That does not mean that when it makes a statement that ought to be criticised, that the statement should not be. Criticism in the press has been good so far, as has already been said, and has led to this inquiry which I hope is of some use. But it would be a pity if we got to the point that the judiciary became fair game, simply because it is there. I hope this report has helped get to the position where criticism that has been passed, and will be passed in the future, is legitimate.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2/speech[4]/talk.start[5]/para","N/A","N/A"
179,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CHRIS EVANS","AX5","(Western Australia)","ALP","N/A",869,"—I wish to address a few remarks to the report on gender bias and the judiciary. The report is noteworthy for making three clear findings. The first is that there is a systemic gender bias in the law that includes sections of the judiciary. Secondly, the report rejects the notion that the problem will be resolved by evolution of time and changes in the composition of the bench. It argues that a more interventionist approach is required to eradicate gender bias in our legal system.Thirdly, the report makes recommendations for steps that can be taken to improve the legal system, provide better systems for judicial selection, education and accountability; and that those things can be done without interfering with the essential independence of judges. It is possible for the community to demand more accountability and involvement in these issues without interfering in the important concept of judicial independence.Nothing in this report, in my view, would bring into question judicial independence; but it makes some very valid, commonsense suggestions for change. It reflects a mood for change that exists in the community. There is some concern not only about the cases examined by the committee in dealing with this report, but also about others, that the legal system reflects a bias against women—in the law, its interpretation, and in the composition of the judiciary.I think there is a mood in the community to support positive change to improve our legal system. That mood of change is growing. From what I have read in the press, the reaction to the report from both commentators and a range of judicial officers has been very positive. It is important that we recognise that arguments for judicial independence cannot be allowed to prevent us attacking the question of bias in the legal system. We should not resile from the challenges and opportunities to improve and correct the system.Much has been said about the role of the media in reporting these cases. There is a quite sensitive discussion of these issues in the report. I must say I fall on the side of those who are not quite as critical as others of the role the media played in reporting these cases, mainly because I think that by reporting them in that way the media have at least opened up the system to examination and forced the system to confront some of the criticisms that have been made. That is a good thing.Obviously, there were some excesses and it would be better if court reporting were more sensitive and accurate. However, the legal system has to do more to explain the way it operates, its procedures and rules, and make information available to reporters so they can do their job better. That is one of the things the report tries to pick up. It is important that the law has to make the effort to be media friendly and accessible if it expects to be reported accurately.I want to touch on one other issue that was debated by most of the speakers in this debate, especially Senator Ellison and Senator Cooney. I suppose the fact that I come to this issue as a non-lawyer might explain the fact that I hold a slightly different view from them, but maybe it is for other reasons. The issue is the trickle-down theory of the promotion of women in the law.The argument was put to the committee by a number of witnesses—and I think it has been supported by a number of senators on the committee—that because an increasing number of women are entering law school, graduating as solicitors and practising in the system, concerns about the number of women who hold judicial appointments or the number of women who hold senior positions at the bar and their obvious lack of representation in those spheres ought not to be taken too seriously. It is argued that over the years, as these large numbers of women move through the system, the numbers of women at the bar and appointed to the judiciary will, through a natural process, represent more accurately the number of women in the wider community.I am not an advocate of that trickle-down theory. I do not think that it is of itself right. I think there are a number of structural barriers to women progressing through the law and we need to take steps to address those issues. This debate is very similar to the debate regarding the problems that confront women who want to be actively involved in politics. Obviously, some barriers exist within the legal system. A number of the recommendations in this committee report will assist in opening up the system and therefore perhaps will help facilitate more women achieving appointment to the bar and to judicial positions.Recommendations, such as those that go to encouraging a wider pool from which we draw our judges, will help. The opening up of the whole appointment system and selection criteria to public scrutiny will also assist in that process. If some of those things are done then we will start to attack what are structural barriers to having more women appointed to the bench. That is very important both in terms of providing women role models and having a more broadly based judiciary.I take on board Senator Cooneys comments that we would not want to have a judiciary that exactly reflects the composition of society, but equally we would not want one that clearly does not represent society or that is clearly representative of a narrow group within society to the exclusion of others. I wanted to put on record the remarks about what I refer to as the trickle-down theory. I think I diverge from the views of some of my colleagues on the committee in relation to some of these issues. I commend this very comprehensive report to the Senate. I congratulate the staff for their good work again and my fellow senators for their contribution to the report. This report will be a useful addition to the debate on these issues which is occurring in Australian society.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
180,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator VANSTONE","7E4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",871,"—I want to speak briefly on the legal and constitutional affairs committees report on gender issues and the judiciary. Having had the opportunity to make some remarks on the day that this report was actually tabled during the break, I do not intend to take the Senates time to repeat them, except for one aspect I did raise on that day that I think bears repeating in this place. This report in particular, among many others that come from committees, is an absolute triumph for the Senate committee system. It is an example of the Senate committee system working as it ought to work. I do not want to take away from contents of the report, but I refer particularly to the preparedness of the Senate to give the legal and constitutional affairs committee this reference.As speakers have indicated, the report basically came about because of a rash of very bad publicity as a consequence of a number of remarks that have been made by judges either in sentencing or in summing up to juries, remarks which by and large were overturned on appeal. Nonetheless, the coverage given to those remarks, some of which was right over the top and out of perspective, had cumulatively created the impression in the community that by far the greater majority of our judges were ill-informed, sexist, out of date and in fact were creating the impression that people, and women in particular who were victims of sexual offences, did not stand much of a chance going before the courts.That seemed to me to be a community concern that needed to be addressed fairly promptly and responsibly. A number of people took the view that the Senate had no business taking on this inquiry, that the independence of the judiciary should not be interfered with, that the court system would handle this, that where judges had made a mistake it would be overturned, and that we should take the attitude, vis-a-vis the publicity the judges had been getting, that they have to take—that is, let it ride, let the system work the problems out and if the criticism is ill informed, it will be shown to be so in good time. I did not share that view; and I do not do so for a number of reasons.Firstly, I think the judges are in a difficult position. As one journalist put to me, they cannot sue someone who misreports what they have said. We cannot have the appropriateness, propriety or otherwise of remarks of judges when they are summing up or making remarks in sentencing settled in some other court proceedings. We cannot have civil proceedings on civil proceedings deciding what should have been said in criminal proceedings. This is just laughable.The system is that judges say what they want to say and they are judged by their peers and by superior courts if they have made a mistake. But they have to keep out of public debate and the process decides whether they have done the right thing or not. We were left with the public debate and the judiciary were unable to participate in it for that reason.We could have chosen to say, `Well, that is up to the judiciary, they are independent, we cannot interfere, and let that community concern grow. I believe if we had done that by our inaction we would have been contributing to undermining the confidence Australians by and large have in the judiciary. So simply taking on this task was an achievement. I know from the heated debates I have had that a number of people did not want us to take up this reference. They see the separation of powers as preventing the parliament from saying something about the judiciary; that merely expressing views publicly is interfering. I do not share that view.I think this report has been welcomed around Australia by judges and others, certainly by some law societies. I have seen the odd High Court judges remarks being reported favourably. That in itself is not a test of a report. Basically, who cares if someone comes to a conclusion and thinks it is right—one goes with it. There may be Senate reports that some people criticise. There may be people who violently disagree with some aspects of this report. That is all well and good. If it contributes to the debate being more informed than it was at the time we took on this reference then that in itself will be an achievement.Lastly, I want to make some remarks about this so-called trickle-down effect. A number of people have said with respect to the apparent paucity of women judges, `Well, it is all the system of appointment. It may in part be that but there has been an increase in the number of women taking out a law degree, then practising and getting to the point where they can on merit compete for these positions. That was not the case 50 years ago. The number of women in law school has increased. In 20 or 30 years we will see more women taking positions on the bench simply because there are more women around who are capable of doing so.I look forward to the day when that happens because, separate from the merit issue—which everyone has been at pains to say must be the key criterion—I do not think we can deny that many citizens, both male and female, find the first experience of a court, if they have one, absolutely daunting. I am sure there are people who do not look after their own interests as well as they could before a court because they are so terrified of the entire system and what will happen to them. In fact, I recall reading at one stage some research that it was not the penalties that frightened people into doing the right thing—it is the fear of ever having to go to court and be publicly dealt with. People find the system complex and therefore daunting and frightening. I believe that it is even more so for women, who up until fairly recently would go into a court where the judge, or judges, and most of the advocates were always male.Just as the argument is made that when we have more women in politics—I know both of the major parties are trying to address that—we will be in a sense feminising politics, I think that could happen with the legal system. It does need a softer face if it is to be a system that is welcoming to all Australians, because that obviously includes women and particularly those without the benefit of the sort of education that most people in this place have had. Those who one might in other circumstances describe as disadvantaged do start off from behind when they go through such a daunting experience.If, as I say, we have this greater influx of women on to the judiciary, they can contribute to humanising the court process. I am not talking about softening it up and giving people bags of lollies. I am talking about humanising it and making people feel more comfortable so that when they go through the system they have a more even chance than they feel they have now. If they are more relaxed and comfortable with the system, that in itself will be a good thing.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

184,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WATSON","VJ4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",873,"—by leave—I move:That the Senate take note of the report.The report that was presented to the President on 13 May 1994 by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation is a comprehensive and thorough coverage of an initiative which both major political parties took to the last election. It is, I believe, the most detailed document yet published on the subject. It is my view that the government should have waited for this report before jettisoning the super for housing scheme proposed in its 1993 election policy.On the weight of the evidence presented to the committee, it is convinced that an effectively targeted and administered super for housing scheme could provide significant benefits to certain sections of the community. For this reason the committee recommends that the government give further consideration to the adoption of a super for housing policy.There is no doubt that there is a genuine need to assist lower income earners obtain housing finance. There is no need for me to go into great detail about housing statistics, as these are presented in the report. However, the committee was concerned that, while housing costs consumed on average only 12.6 per cent of incomes of Australian households in 1988, many Australian households now have housing costs exceeding 25 to 30 per cent of their income. At the lower income levels, sole parents and couples with or without dependent children in the 35 to 64 age group spend average proportions exceeding 40 per cent in nearly all cases. Such expenditure is, for many, a major financial burden and a source of tremendous stress.Of particular interest to the committee was the impact of home ownership on housing affordability in retirement and the correlation between lack of home ownership and the high levels of housing stress experienced by retired people who meet their accommodation need through the private rental market. Statistics from a number of sources indicate that those in retirement who do not own their own home and who are also wholly or partially dependent on the age pension normally live on or below the poverty line despite government rental assistance. Hence, there was much discussion during the hearings on the relative merits of savings in the form of superannuation versus saving in the form of home purchase.The committee supports the view expressed by a number of witnesses that home ownership is integral to dignity in retirement, from both a security and an equity point of view. It became evident that adequate retirement planning must take account of major retirement expenses, such as the cost of housing, as well as anticipated income levels. The committee is aware that the ownership of the family home, when combined with superannuation and other investments, will significantly improve the balance of an individuals overall retirement security.In making its recommendation, the committee recognised that a different significant fall in interest rates has occurred since the major political parties announced the initiative during the last election which had markedly improved housing affordability. The recently announced National Mutual-ACTU super home loans investment trust may also improve affordability—providing interest rates stay down—for some members of the community. However, while these changes are welcome they are unlikely to resolve the difficulty being experienced by some members of the community whose major obstacle is the accumulation of sufficient finance for the initial deposit.I place on record my disappointment that neither National Mutual nor the ACTU appeared before the inquiry to explain their investment trust initiative, a major development which the government used to abandon its super for housing policy. The Life Insurance Federation of Australia appeared before the committee, but the ACTU unfortunately had difficulty in making itself available to appear. It certainly did not apprise the committee of its super for housing initiative. I am sure some union members might be very disappointed to hear that their peak body did not take the opportunity to put before a parliamentary committee their case on the use of super accumulations for housing purposes.The committee was also mindful of the potential negative impact of the super for housing proposal on broader government objectives in relation to the superannuation guarantee charge and also national savings. Many who made submissions to the committee expressed concerns that a super for housing scheme could threaten the integrity of superannuation generally and the superannuation guarantee charge in particular. The committee supports that this would certainly be the case should such a scheme be available to all superannuants. So it is the niche market—this particular area—that we are referring to.It is for this reason that much of the deliberations were devoted to identifying those sections of the community that would gain significant benefits without impacting adversely on the system as a whole. When considering the restrictions on access spelt out in the report and the one-off and tangible nature of housing purchase, the committee believes that the integrity of a superannuation system as such would not be in jeopardy.It must be remembered that those who the committee has suggested should have access to such a scheme would not be accumulating significant superannuation funds and that such a drawdown would have minimal impact on the value of the age pension they would receive from the government.This conclusion was drawn upon as a result of figures provided by the retirement income modelling task force, which indicated that a reduction in individuals superannuation accumulations from such a drawdown would result in increasing the amount of age pension received by these superannuants by an average of only $15 per fortnight. When considered against the potential calls for rental assistance of up to $68.40 per fortnight for single recipients without children and $85.85 per fortnight for single recipients with three or more children, it can be seen that the impact on overall government expenditure is likely to be very minimal.The retirement income modelling task force is a most professional and competent team. Therefore, I trust that the government will see the wisdom of keeping its membership intact in order to undertake important national projects. In summary, the logic on which the committee bases its recommendation that a tightly targeted super for housing scheme has merit for certain sections of the community and should therefore continue to be considered by the government is as follows: the forced savings for retirement under the superannuation guarantee charge has meant that some employees may be receiving lower take-home pay; this is, in turn, increasingly disadvantaging some sections of the community when they seek to save for a deposit to purchase their own home; the lack of a deposit is often a barrier for low income families in gaining access to owner occupancy; the high cost of rental is a major cause of poverty in old age; and those on low incomes are unlikely to accumulate sufficient superannuation to make a significant difference in the level of age pension support required.Should the government agree to further consideration of a super for housing policy, the committee is unanimous in its belief that it must be developed in close cooperation and consultation with the relevant industry bodies to ensure that it is universally available to the targeted groups. It is important to stress that the committee does not see this proposal as the panacea which would alleviate all cases of housing stress experienced in the general community. A super for housing scheme would only ever be one part of a diverse range of policy initiatives.Moreover, there are a number of other super and savings issues that need further attention. We commend the government to move in those areas. In preparing its report, the committee has made note of some of these issues and suggested that the solutions proposed by witnesses be considered in more appropriate forums. I take this opportunity to thank all of my colleagues on the committee for a most professional report, and also the members of the secretariat who played a very significant role in preparing this report.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[2]/debate.sub2/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
185,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CHRIS EVANS","AX5","(Western Australia)","ALP","N/A",875,"—I would like to address a few remarks to the report of the Select Committee on Superannuation entitled Super for housing . In doing so I commend the report to honourable senators. I think it is well worth reading in order to gain a proper understanding of the complexity of the issues involved. All members of the committee acknowledge that it is a complex issue. The attempt by some commentators to try to make it a simplistic one fails to come to terms with the underlying issues.The thrust of my remarks is designed to explain my motivation in supporting the report and its major recommendation that the government give further consideration to the adoption of a tightly targeted super for housing policy. The report, as the chairman, Senator Watson, commented, represents the unanimous view of the committee. I commend Senator Watson for his work on the report, in chairing the committee and ensuring that the committee maintains the high standards and reputation that it has built.We tried very hard to stay out of the politics of the issue. It is interesting to note that the report essentially rejects the approaches adopted by both the coalition and the Labor Party prior to the last federal election, which probably means that none of us will be popular. What the report does is highlight the problems and issues that those policies fail to address and it argues for a highly targeted and thereby far more limited proposal to be further developed as a policy option for government.In my assessment, the weight of evidence received by the committee was against supporting a super for housing policy. The industry adopted an essentially neutral position. It opposed any compulsion regarding a super for housing policy, but did not really give the committee any detailed position on the whole issue. That was one of our concerns, because without greater industry enthusiasm and involvement in the development of the proposal, I do not think it is going to work. There has to be some commitment by the industry to whatever proposal is run with, if one is adopted. I think Senator Watson highlighted that in his remarks.The industry is clearly not attracted by compulsion, and nor was the Senate committee. We were also concerned that if there is to be equity for persons involved in superannuation, all funds have to take up any super for housing policy. So while we were not attracted by compulsion, nor were we comfortable with a proposition that resulted in a limited take-up and which meant that some people had a super for housing policy available to them while others did not. I think that is one of the key issues that must be resolved.There are real problems with the proposal for superannuation funding for the private purchase of housing. The work of the retirement income modelling group showed the effect of a withdrawal from superannuation savings: it can have quite a large effect on retirement income. That is obviously a very serious concern. There is potential for the integrity of the superannuation system to be undermined. Nobody on the committee would support anything that went towards that end. I think there is justifiable concern that a super for housing policy could, if we were not careful, encourage over-investment in housing.Another point to make is that any super for housing policy will not benefit the poor. It will not benefit those who do not have enough income to meet the ongoing repayments needed to service a home mortgage. I think some of the representation of what a super for housing policy would achieve has been a little unreal. The committee makes the point very clearly that the policy would not address the problems of those who are unable to meet ongoing repayments. As the report makes clear, it is not a panacea for social justice.The committee also took very seriously Dr Vince FitzGeralds comments in his report on national savings. He highlighted that those we were seeking to help might not currently have enough in their superannuation accounts to make the schemes proposed by either political party viable and that it might be some time before the sort of people we are looking to target would have enough savings in superannuation to make a healthy contribution towards a deposit on a home. He also expressed the concern which we shared that one could see the policy being misused, with people using it to invest in larger or more expensive houses, or just facilitating increasing current consumption, but not actually increasing the rate of home ownership. The whole motivation for the policy is to increase the rate of home ownership in our society. FitzGeralds recommendation to the government was—and I quote:The Government could review whether or how direct diversion of super funds into housing can be provided without impairing the long term effectiveness of superannuation.The committee took that recommendation very seriously. We have tried to address it in presenting our report. But the very clear view of the committee was that the evidence regarding home ownership and the propensity for poverty in retirement was overwhelming; that whether one owned ones own home was a critical issue in determining whether one had a sustainable, comfortable lifestyle in retirement. One could not talk about a proper retirement policy without looking at the consequences of home ownership and making that a very real and large consideration in any retirement income policy.As a result of that concern, the committee supported further consideration of a tightly targeted option that did not threaten the integrity of the system, but which helped those with a deposit gap to gain home ownership. We identified, as Senator Watson said, a niche market—those people who perhaps had the ability to make repayments but did not have the ability to get a deposit together in order to own their own home. Having said that, it is entirely justifiable to conclude, as the government has done, that the difficulties alluded to can lead one to the conclusion that the proposal is just not worth the effort. Certainly, that is a view that I came close to adopting in dealing with the evidence before the committee.In the end, the committee took the view that we should reject that approach but instead we sought to keep the door open. Despite all the difficulties, we still thought there was a viable policy option that ought to be kept open for the future. That is essentially what we did in our final recommendation. We were not convinced that a carefully crafted solution, combining retirement income policy and housing policy, could not be pulled together.In the current climate—where housing accessibility reached new highs in 1993, where housing affordability is good with relatively low interest rates, and where large investment in housing is occurring—a super for housing policy initiative is not an imperative. The pressure that was there when both political parties sought to develop a super for housing policy has gone out of the system. Clearly, the imperative is not ranked as highly by anyone in this debate as it was, say, a couple of years ago.In this climate we can see why people have chosen to concentrate on other policy initiatives or to give them a higher ranking. The committee was clearly aware of that circumstance. It is the case that a super for housing policy is essentially designed to overcome a deposit gap problem. The deposit gap problem is not currently a major issue impacting on housing availability in Australia. It is an important issue for those who cannot get their deposit together, but it is not the major issue currently. The view of most financial institutions at the moment is that the ability to repay a mortgage is the key issue for people seeking to get into their own homes. That, together with the fact that most people we seek to target would not have large amounts currently in their super accounts, means that the time for super for housing as a policy option has not as yet arrived.In the report we say that the time may come when the pressure will exist in the system again, when the deposit gap problem will be the major issue, and that we would look again at the super for housing policy as a partial solution to that problem. It is clear that, in the future, employees will be contributing more to their own superannuation thereby effectively reducing their disposable income. The problem is that peoples disposable income will start to reduce or tighten as they make a bigger contribution to their own superannuation. This will have the effect of increasing their super savings but the money available for housing might reduce.It is true to say that accessibility to home purchase has been extremely variable in the last decade or so and, while it is high now, it will invariably drop again. I am saying that while the imperative for super for housing is not there currently, it may well be there in the future when those different factors come together. The pressure will be on to find solutions to housing accessibility, for young Australians in particular, and we will be faced with a political reality. The political reality will be that young people with $20,000 or so—some with more, some with less—in their superannuation account will not have enough personal savings to fund a deposit while, on the basis of their income, they will be able to finance repayments. We will be faced with this group of people who have a relatively large amount in their super accounts struggling to make deposits but having the ability to make repayments on a mortgage.The political reality will be that politicians—senators—will again have to face the issue of the demand for the use of superannuation to finance the purchase of a home. I do not think that the pressure is currently in the system, and that is one of the reasons the government is not pursuing the policy at this time. But the committee is saying that those factors will come together at some stage and that the pressure will be on to respond to a deposit gap problem that people seeking to own their homes will confront. Home ownership is a key factor in providing for a comfortable and reasonable retirement. When those factors I have described come together, it will be necessary to again look at the question of superannuation for housing to allow people to bridge that deposit gap.In the report we suggest that the industry and the government continue to explore the idea, address the problems that we have identified and try to find a way forward to achieve those two goals—a proper retirement income policy and a housing policy that facilitates as many Australians as possible to own their own homes. Together they provide for the best possible outcome for retirement. The committee is urging further consideration of the issues and we are urging industry to become involved because, without the practical involvement of the industry, any policy devised by a political party will not succeed. Essentially we are leaving the door open for further debate on these quite complex issues.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[2]/debate.sub2/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
186,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WOODLEY","HX5","(Queensland)","AD","N/A",877,"—I rise to support the comments of my colleagues on the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and also to support the 12th report, Super for housing . As I understand it, the report resulted from a reference by the Australian Democrats that was supported by others some time ago. I have to say that we started with a very open mind but we have been convinced that access to super for housing in a very tight policy regime is supportable. Not only do I want to deal with the details of the report, but I also want to address some of the assumptions which lie behind the issue and perhaps signal to the government that it needs to have a look at this issue together with the whole issue of home ownership for retired people.Because of the tax system, investment in ones own home is the very best form of retirement saving with higher post-tax returns than super itself. Yet we are faced with the fact that an increasing number of Australians cannot afford housing, and that certainly includes retired people. Of course, part of the problem is the reduction in public housing in some states. I want to say that lack of housing—not necessarily the very narrow issue that we deal with in this report—for people in their retirement and housing for people in general is an issue of social justice.Given my background, I am tempted to go into great detail, but tonight I will resist. I simply say that one of the major concerns of the prophetic stream in the Hebrew scriptures is the whole issue of housing. I am reminded of a text which says, `Woe to those who join house to house. Really, that is a reference to people who, 3,000 years ago, were seeking to control the housing market so as to be able to charge high rents and oppress the poor. It is an issue which has been with us for a long time.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[2]/debate.sub2/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

188,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WOODLEY","HX5","(Queensland)","AD","N/A",877,"—Perhaps I should have. With rental housing costs often taking up more than half of the income of retired people, higher home ownership means less post-retirement poverty. This issue was clearly documented in the report. However, I agree that limited access to superannuation deposits would help only some low income earners to reduce the amount they would have to borrow for a first home—in other words, it would help them to do something about the deposit gap.Perhaps it is useful to place on record that before I came into this place I would have been regarded as a reasonably low income earner. Yet, because of the two-tier system of the Uniting Churchs beneficiary superannuation fund—called a home acquisition fund—I was able to borrow sufficient money to get a deposit on a house which has enabled me to provide for my retirement.If we were able to get the government to look again at this issue, I believe that it would result in a higher proportion of retired people owning their own homes. That would certainly address an issue of justice for them. Increasing home ownership should be a vital part of the retirement incomes policy—that is the point I want to make. For that reason, we have opposed, for example, any access to superannuation for home improvement as this does not affect retirement income.I am very disappointed that the federal government saw fit to pre-empt the report of this committee by dumping its pre-election promise just two or three weeks before the report was to be handed down. I hope that it was not showing some contempt for the Senate or, at least, signalling to the Senate that its reports were of no consequence. Surely I am attributing to the government a motive that was not in its mind, but I do have those kinds of concerns.The alternative—the ACTU-National Mutual housing loan scheme—delivers a housing interest rate tied to the overnight cash deposit rate. That rate is highly volatile. I admit that at its current seven per cent it is below the housing loan rate of 7.5 per cent, but in the late 1980s it rose to over 20 per cent, well above the then mortgage rate of 17 per cent.The ACTU-National Mutual scheme could turn into another HomeFund style disaster. Our problem is that we have not been able to access the details of it in order to take them into account. I am very disappointed about that. I would hate to think that many low income earners could be locked into high interest rates and repayments through the ACTU-National Mutual scheme.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[2]/debate.sub2/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

190,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WOODLEY","HX5","(Queensland)","AD","N/A",877,"—That is right. I am also worried that Minister Brian Howe may not have done us a service by arguing that housing affordability has never been higher. For some people that may be true but only last Friday the Reserve Bank chief, Bernie Fraser, gave a strong warning on this, pointing out that interest rates are likely to rise and that wages are likely to be constrained. That would rapidly reduce housing affordability.In any case, the housing affordability record of banks is woeful. Interest rates were kept as high as 17 per cent for too long, and even though housing interest rates have come down, the banks have been allowed to profiteer. Since December 1989, official interest rates have fallen by 13.25 per cent but mortgage rates have fallen just 8.25 per cent. The difference has been pocketed by the banks. The `big three banks all recorded higher profits and fatter interest margins last week, thanks largely to housing finance.This report only seeks to offer one strategy for dealing with the critical issue of retirement housing while there are other strategies—for example, in the public housing area—which the government must employ. However, I want to finish by emphasising the point that higher debt-free home ownership means less post-retirement poverty, and I am sure we all want that.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[2]/debate.sub2/speech[3]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
191,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator FERGUSON","EP5","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",878,"—I rise to speak briefly on this 12th report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. In doing so it is wise to recognise that it is the 12th report. This committee has spent a long time looking at the many vexed questions that relate to superannuation and the way in which the structure of superannuation can be used to the best benefit of all Australians.I do not always agree with my colleague Senator Chris Evans but I tend to agree with the conclusions reached by this committee. There was a genuine feeling amongst those of us on the committee that we should come to a conclusion that would most benefit Australians while taking advantage of the current structure of superannuation policies. I am not sure that hastily arranged pre-election promises from any party are a good basis for policy when it comes to deciding the best for future retirees.There was compelling evidence from some witnesses that superannuation should not be allowed to be used for housing. I am thinking particularly of evidence given to us by Professor John Piggott of the Superannuation Economics Research Group, University of New South Wales. He has appeared before the committee on a number of occasions and the committee has taken great notice of what he has had to say because he has spent a lot of time looking into the question of what is the best form of superannuation for Australians. It is fair to say that he did not recommend using superannuation for housing. However, a number of other people appeared before the committee and we took all their evidence into consideration.We should never forget that the prime purpose of superannuation is the provision of retirement income. One of the downfalls of the system is that people do not think of superannuation as retirement income but as a form of pension, and different connotations apply. If people were to think of superannuation as retirement income, the future interests of Australians would be better catered for. After all, retirement income is there to provide for us when we no longer have the capacity to earn an income.The recommendation is that the government give further consideration to the adoption of a highly targeted superannuation for housing policy. It does not say that the government should adopt this policy; it just says that the government should give further consideration to it. I hope that the government will do that because from all the evidence that we received, both written and oral, there was compelling evidence that a certain highly targeted group of people should have access to these funds to help provide the capital required for a deposit on a house.As Senator Chris Evans said, the difficulty is that those people who might benefit the most—those on very low incomes—are the ones least likely to be able ever to afford a house because they will never have the accumulated funds from which to borrow to provide the deposit. While that is a different problem, it is important for the government to look into the situation to see if it is possible for a group of people to benefit by accessing a part of their superannuation in order to maintain a house.Owning your own house is the great Australian dream. In many other countries people know that they will never own their own house but in Australia it has always been the tradition that the vast majority will at some stage own their own home. It is almost considered their right. It is a right if people are able to do it, but having the money to do it is another thing.We were given evidence that perhaps the superannuation industry itself is not particularly geared to lending for housing. Of course, it depends on the way that the policy may be formulated. That is another issue that needs to be addressed.Before the last election it was part of the coalitions policy to have a tax-free saving scheme. Professor Piggott suggested a more modest form of the same proposal where people are permitted to save out of net of tax income, but not pay any tax on the interest that accrues to those savings until they have purchased their first home. Once the money has been used as a deposit on the first home that right goes away. That would help to remove some of the inequities that Professor Piggott mentioned.We normally compare ourselves with countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States and continental Europe. Most of those countries do not have a provision to withdraw pension funds or superannuation funds for housing purchases. Switzerland was the only country that we were made aware of that explicitly mentions housing. Switzerland has a scheme quite like our superannuation guarantee scheme, except that it is supported by a modest social security system. On retirement Switzerland permits the withdrawal of a portion of superannuation benefit as a lump sum for owner-occupied housing purchases.This committee is trying to address the problem of the finding of the deposit for the initial purchase. This is something that many people, particularly those on low and middle incomes, find so difficult to do.The committee did not come to its conclusions without a lot of consideration and hearing a lot of evidence. We probably had as broad a range of evidence as it was possible to get, ranging from those who were totally opposed to the use of superannuation money for housing to those who felt that it was the only way that some people would be able to access housing and that it was a right and proper use of superannuation moneys.Taking all that evidence into account, the committee unanimously came up with this report. I think that indicates that the feeling of the committee was that, whatever we did, we wanted to make sure that we did what we thought was best for Australians; to enable as many Australians as possible to own their own home—something that is becoming a dream rather than a reality. I commend the report and I hope that the government will, at some stage in the future, give consideration to adopting a highly targeted superannuation for housing policy.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[2]/debate.sub2/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

An injured consumer has to commence action within three years of becoming aware of the loss suffered, the defect in the goods, and the identity of the manufacturer. This provision identifies the time at which an action accrues and sets the time within which an action must be brought after it has accrued. In addition an action must be commenced within 10 years of the supply by the manufacturer of the particular goods which caused the injury. This is the statute of repose. It operates to remove any right of action under the legislation after 10 years from supply. The chief concern about such a provision is that in cases where injury does not become evident until well after 10 years from supply, that is where the injury has a long latency period, the consumers right of action is abolished before it even accrues.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/proctext/para[29]","N/A","N/A"

The solution recommended by the Committee, that a court be able to extend the period of repose if it is shown that, on or before the date of supply, the manufacturer knew or ought to have known that the product was defective, was based on oral evidence given by Justice Vincent of the Supreme Court of Victoria on the last day of hearings. Justice Vincent stated that he favoured almost a half way house between negligence and strict liability. He said You may reach a point at which you say `If there is knowledge of the existence of the defect—and that might be short of negligence—`then you do not have your cut-off period at all. (Evidence 27 October 1992 p.343.) There was no discussion before the Committee of how such an exception would operate, nor has there any discussion there, or in the report, of alternative means of addressing the problem.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/proctext/para[31]","N/A","N/A"

The nature of limitation periods has been the subject of recent decisions in the High Court, usually in the context of conflict of laws questions about whether such provisions are purely procedural so that the law of the state in which the action is being heard applies, or whether they are substantive so that the law of the state where the cause of action arose applies. In McKain v Miller (1991) 104 ALR 257, the Court split on this question of the nature of limitation periods, but even those judges who saw some as being procedural agreed that where a limitation period is annexed by statute to a right which the statute creates, the limitation period will generally be of the essence of the right, that is substantive. The right to sue is both conferred and extinguished by the statute. The statute of repose is a limitation period of this type. It is doubtful therefore that it could be extended at the discretion of the court as if it were a procedural limitation period of the usual sort. If an exception is to be made to the 10 years the basis of the exception should be in the legislation.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/proctext/para[32]","N/A","N/A"

As noted above, the discussion by the Committee focused on the problems presented by toxic harms caused by chemical and pharmaceutical products. However, its exception to the 10 year rule is expressed in general terms and would theoretically apply to all products where harm might be caused after the 10 years had elapsed. Though such cases might be limited to more complex manufactured goods, for example cars or aeroplanes, the Committees formulation has the potential to extend the repose period for harms other than toxic harms and goods other than chemicals or pharmaceuticals. There is no evidence of any intention on the part of the Committee to extend the repose period in this way.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/proctext/para[33]","N/A","N/A"

For example, subsection 75AK(I)(c) allows defendant manufacturers to argue in their defence that the state of scientific or technical knowledge at the time when the goods were supplied was not such as to enable the effect to be discovered (the state of the art defence). The onus of proving this is on the defendant. The Committees formulation appears to move the onus to the plaintiff to prove that this defence did not apply, and to do so before being able to bring his or her substantive case. Similarly, there may be interactions with the consideration of warnings given with the goods as an element of proving defect under section 15AC. In practice it might eventuate that much of the substance of the case has to be argued, at cost to all parties, before a decision can be made on whether the repose period may be extended.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/proctext/para[34]","N/A","N/A"

A further problem is that the recommended formulation appears to move away from strict liability towards negligence by requiring the plaintiff to show, when seeking an extension, that the defendant knew or ought to have known that the product was defective. The Governments intention in introducing a strict liability regime was to impose liability irrespective of any wrongdoing or knowledge on the part of the defendant. When referring the three particular questions on aspects of the regime to the Committee, there was no intention on the part of the Government that the basic nature of the regime be changed in any way.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/proctext/para[35]","N/A","N/A"

The Government accepts the Committees recommendation that the 10 year repose period should remain for most personal injury and all property damage claims. It appears from American statistics and evidence presented to the Committee that most claims will fall within the 10 year period and industry will benefit from knowing with some certainty the extent of its liability. The Government also accepts the Committees intention to assist those Australian consumers who would be significantly disadvantaged by the statute of repose provisions as enacted in Part VA. However, it cannot accept the exception as formulated by the Committee, for the reasons set out above.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/proctext/para[36]","N/A","N/A"

The Governments view is that a cleaner solution to the problem is to have any exception set out in the legislation and to make that exception depend upon the type of harm suffered rather than upon any action, knowledge or intent on the part of the plaintiff or the defendant. The question of whether a case fell within the exception or not would then arise as a threshold issue, distinct from the substantive issues to be argued to determine liability. These issues would then be determined in the same way for these plaintiffs as for plaintiffs whose claims arose within the repose period. The Government now accepts that a blanket 20 year repose period would not be satisfactory in that it would increase costs for all manufacturers while not addressing the specific problem of toxic harm cases.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/proctext/para[37]","N/A","N/A"

Alternatively, the exception to the 10 year period could be based on the Australian Law Reform Commissions formulation to cover cases where the loss or damage caused by the way the goods acted was not, and could not reasonably have been discovered within that period (ALRC Report No. 51 Product Liability 1989 at p. 120). Another option to be considered is the formulation in the US Model Uniform Product Liability Act which excludes cases where the harm caused within the 10 year period did not manifest itself until after that time. The Government will take further advice from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel on the appropriate approach.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/proctext/para[40]","N/A","N/A"

Where there is more than one defendant, liability is joint and several (section 75AM). If only the smaller business, which used chemicals as components in its own product, is sued and held liable, it would be open to it to take third party proceedings against the manufacturer of the defective chemical.

The plaintiff bringing an action under Part VA must prove that there was a defect in the goods at the time of supply, that the defect caused harm and that as a result he or she suffered loss or damage. Removing the need to prove negligence does not lessen the burden of having to prove the presence of the defect and causation. This burden becomes harder to discharge the more time has elapsed.

The questions of extraterritoriality and burden of proof will be left to the courts to work out in the particular fact situations which are brought before them. The statute of repose will remain at 10 years with one exception—to allow claims for compensation to be brought when harm manifests itself only after a long latency period, the so-called toxic harm cases.

However, it is not acceptable that consumers suffering a particular type of harm should be excluded from the improved access to justice provided by the scheme, especially where those consumers are the ones who face the greatest difficulties in securing compensation under the existing law.

304,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COATES","LF4","(Tasmania)","ALP","N/A",887,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the response.As chair of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, I should first thank the government for responding promptly to the committees report of last December. I also note the extent to which it has attempted to address the operational problems in the performance pay system which were exposed in the committees inquiry and a parallel performance audit by the Australian National Audit Office.Having said that, I have to add that the response is disappointing. It fails to address the committees main criticisms of performance pay. The committee concluded that the APS performance pay system was the conceptually flawed result of a faulty process of policy development. The system rests on assumptions about motivation and the nature of work in organisations which are not valid or appropriate for much of the APS. It requires a degree of precision in the appraisal of individual performance and a level of acceptance of those appraisals which is not realistically achievable in many public sector agencies.Schemes like that in the APS enjoyed a brief fad in the OECD countries in the late 1980s but the bandwagon appears to have come to a halt just about the time that the APS leapt aboard. There is no evidence that any performance pay scheme like that in the APS has been successful in any other jurisdiction. Indeed, there is growing evidence that these schemes are failures. Only two weeks ago, the Economist —not a magazine which I usually find interesting—reported similar findings in the private sector. Managers who fell in love with the idea of performance-related pay in the 1980s are now said to have found the practice to be expensive, clumsy and demotivating.I find it highly significant that the response tabled today is the first official publication on APS performance pay in the five years I have followed these issues which does not cite overseas experience as a reason for adopting performance pay. The reason is obvious. The overseas experience is now long enough for conclusions to be drawn and those that are relevant are all adverse.The response does not address two other major failures revealed by the committees inquiry. The first is the widespread lack of acceptance of the scheme within the APS. The committee found an unprecedented level of dissatisfaction with performance pay in the APS, not only at the level of individual officers but very much at top management level. The closest the response comes to acknowledging this is in a passing suggestion that the problems exposed by the committees inquiry, and by the audit, are to be expected in the process of creating a major cultural change. The solution proposed in the response is that the coordinating agencies issue a circular.If performance pay is really about major cultural change, it is absurd to suggest that it can be managed by issuing circulars. If, on the other hand, it is the sort of program that can be managed by a few central agency circulars, it is hardly likely to produce major cultural change.The second major failure in this program which the response ignores is the failure of the coordinating agencies themselves to manage the change to performance pay. I believe that the scheme was doomed from its conception but, if it was to have any chance of success, it needed to have been better managed.The committee found that the coordinating agencies—the Department of Industrial Relations, the Department of Finance, and the Public Service Commission—failed to design a workable system. They failed to ensure that departments and agencies understood the defective system that they designed; they failed to specify a reporting system that would reveal what turned out to be widespread departures from the spirit and letter of the guidelines they issued; and they underestimated the need for investment in implementation. These failures and the unusually harsh criticisms the committee made of them are grandly passed over in the response which, I presume, was drafted by the coordinating agencies themselves.The new circular issued by the coordinating agencies does attempt to address the many implementation problems that were exposed by the committee and the ANAO. I do not wish to dwell on the proposed changes because they do not go to the fundamental problems of the system. I will point out, however, that one of the major changes proposed is the imposition of `suggested quotas on the numbers of officers that may be rated at each of the appraisal levels. If these quotas are implemented, about 20 per cent of senior public servants who have been told by their supervisors that they have achieved a certain level of performance will have to be told that they are actually performing at a lower level. About three-quarters of these will stop receiving bonuses to which they have become accustomed.It is impossible to see any benefit that could flow from this proposal which could outweigh the costs of brutally downgrading and dashing the expectations of such a large proportion of our senior public servants. It would be a very difficult process to implement and, perhaps for that reason, the coordinating agencies memorandum leaves some unusually large loopholes.Firstly, agencies do not have to implement the changes in the current appraisal cycle if the cycle is too far advanced. This will allow many agencies to defer initiating action until next year. Secondly, agencies will not have to report the results of any action they take until after the tabling of their next annual report after the first year of the changed system. Information on compliance with the suggested changes will not be available in many cases until the tabling of 1995-96 annual reports in October 1996. This is a remarkably leisurely timetable for the correction of problems in a program which initially was regarded as so important that it had to be rushed through in a few months.It seems unlikely to me that many line agencies will take up the suggestion of the coordinating agencies that they assault the self-esteem of many of the senior staff. A far more sensible response in line agencies would be that already adopted by the Australian Defence Force in respect of its officers. It is open to agencies to fold the funding for performance pay for senior officers into the pool of funds available for agency bargaining. Clearly all agencies should do this and I hope that the management of most agencies will have the good sense and the courage to do this.I regret that the government has not taken the opportunity presented by the committees report to bring performance pay to an end in December by announcing that now. Even though the rhetoric suggests that performance pay is to continue to be defended, I just hope that the fact that the government, in stating that it is not responding substantively to our recommendation No. 1 `at this stage, provides an indication that the system might yet be abandoned as it should be.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[4]/debate.sub2/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
305,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WATSON","VJ4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A",889,"—Following the report of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, tabled in early December of last year, the governments response has been received with commendable promptness. However, that is where the praise ends. The committees report made five specific recommendations on performance pay, one of which was that the performance pay system should be abandoned no later than the expiry of the Australian Public Service workplace bargaining agreement in December 1994.The governments response attempts to argue that performance pay can serve to provide a link between rewards and achievements of corporate goals. It does so in an environment where the concept has failed elsewhere around the world. The government then further argues, rather ineptly, that this can be achieved through a system of formal appraisal and the overall exercise can move towards the better realisation of those goals and the activity required to reach them.The committee is quite adamant about the need for appraisal but not performance pay linked to those appraisal concepts. The governments approach assumes two things that are a little unrealistic: firstly, that appraisal can properly measure performance with acceptable accuracy—and we found there were problems not only within agencies but across different agencies—and, secondly, that those being appraised will accept that this can be done. I thought it was just another excuse for a backdoor method of getting wage increases into certain top echelons of the public sector. Unfortunately, the governments response fails to relate any experience known to refer to this type of appraisal in other areas. As the practice has been made use of in many other places for many years, it would seem sensible to make use of those experiences to reduce our need to reinvent the wheel.I compliment Senator Coates on his courage in chairing the committee that brought down recommendations that are running contrary to the thrust of what the government is doing within the bureaucracy. I trust that the governments failure in this document to reflect on the experience of others cannot be seen as a lack of confidence in the most up-to-date information available. Could it be that this sort of reference might well show that the fad for this type of scheme appears to have expired at about the time the Australian Public Service decided to adopt it?I also note that an edition of the Economist of a few weeks ago, to which my colleague also referred, reported the emerging consensus in well-managed organisations that have tried performance pay schemes and that there exists an aversion to schemes like the one adopted by the Australian Public Service. While those schemes might look initially attractive, over time that attraction disappears very quickly as people become somewhat disenchanted.None of the coordinating agencies were able to supply the committee with references to any empirical evidence which points to any benefits being achieved from such systems in any public sector. The simplistic approach to initial problems with introducing the system also leaves much to be desired. The government states that initial problems `are symptomatic of the cultural shift inherent in introducing the arrangements, the fast pace of change and the lack of familiarity and experience with such schemes on the part of managers and staff.The remedy is seen as the issue of yet another circular clarifying the earlier circulars. We must all doubt whether a major cultural change in the workplace can be successfully achieved by the official issue of circulars! The governments response also expresses strong scepticism about the possibility of any extension of performance pay to officers below the senior officer grades. This is based on the belief that performance appraisal can only operate when linked with rewards. This argument moves in ever decreasing circles as appraisal needs rewards to work but the rewards depend on appraisal.Appraisal is said to be of great importance for the top 10 per cent of the Public Service, 80 per cent of whom are in Canberra and few of whom deliver measurable services, but of little importance for the rest of the service. I hope that the future of this system is not linked to the professional reputation of its initiators. It would be unfortunate if senior people in the Public Service could not objectively and fairly appraise the problems facing the system.Any personal or professional investment which may lead to a need to justify a continuation of the system in spite of difficulties should not be tolerated. The extension of formal performance appraisal more widely across the Public Service certainly appears to have the potential for positive results. The continuation of the performance pay system, unfortunately, does not portend any such rewards. I commend the report to the Senate.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[4]/debate.sub2/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

309,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CHAPMAN","FF4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",890,"—As the Senate would be aware, over the last three sitting days—today, and the last two days that the Senate sat a couple of weeks ago before we had a fortnights break—I directed questions to the government and the minister in this place, Senator Bolkus, representing the Minister for Justice, regarding allegations about investigations by Queensland police and justice authorities into criminal activity on the Gold Coast involving the provision of prostitution services and its relationship with money laundering and other criminal activity involving overseas links.As the Senate would also be aware, the minister has utterly failed to answer those questions but has sought to divert attention from the questions in a number of ways. Firstly, it has been by dissembling and backing and filling in relation to the answers he has given. More particularly, on the last two occasions, it has been by making scurrilous attacks on one of my staff members. I believe that that approach by the minister to these very important issues is entirely unacceptable. What is emerging from the information which I have available, and as a result of the questions I am asking in this chamber, is an attempt by the government to divert attention from this very serious issue, an issue that may well go further than anyone expects with regard to the possibilities of criminal activity and attendant corruption.The response of this minister on two occasions has been to make scurrilous allegations against my staff member. In particular, Senator Bolkus has made the assertion that this staff member, Mr Chris Nicholls, was `run out of South Australia, run out of journalism, and run out of the ABC. These are nothing more than lies. Again, they reflect the ministers lack of credibility in the responses which he has been giving to me on this particular issue. I might well ask what the minister hopes to achieve by attacking my staff member in this way. Therefore, I want to place on the record the circumstances regarding Mr Chris Nicholls.One may well ask why the minister, a South Australian Labor senator in this place, has such a fixation with regard to Mr Nicholls, so we ought to reflect for a few moments on what happened to Mr Nicholls as an ABC journalist in South Australia. There he was intimidated and victimised by the former Labor government—the Labor government that was hounded out of office by the people of South Australia last year in the December state election. So it is not Mr Nicholls who has been hounded out of South Australia; it is the former Labor government led by Mr Bannon and then by Mr Arnold that was thrown out of office lock, stock and barrel by the people of South Australia so convincingly in that election. The Liberal Partys victory achieved the second highest result of any political party in South Australia, giving it 37 seats and the Labor Party 10 seats.This victimisation of Mr Nicholls took place after he exposed yet another scandal on the part of the Labor Party in South Australia. Perhaps it is a bit close to the bone for Senator Bolkus to be subject to questioning here on the possibility of scandals at the federal level. That state level scandal involved a former minister, Barbara Wiese, a member of the Legislative Council in South Australia. Mr Nicholls uncovered that scandal, a business relationship in which her so-described partner in life was involved. Five days after he uncovered that particular scandal Mr Nicholls was subjected to one of the most insidious and corrupt abuses of political power by that particular government.Mr Nicholls was acquitted by a court of the charges. But, not satisfied with that, the then Labor government continued to pursue him. It was so relentless that it then mounted contempt charges against him for protecting his source of information relating to the scandal that he had uncovered of political corruption in South Australia. For his trouble, the former Labor government pursued him by mounting contempt charges against him. As a result of that, Mr Nicholls spent some four months in South Australias maximum security prison, sharing his prison cell with hardened criminals—a credible journalist spent four months in jail for protecting his source. That happened to Mr Nicholls as a result of the investigations that he undertook at the time and the evidence that he was able to present. That evidence was one of the many factors that caused the South Australian people to throw the former Labor government out of office lock, stock and barrel.Again we find that Senator Bolkus is trying to intimidate Mr Nicholls by raising his name in this place and by scandalously abusing him in the way that he has. The fact that Mr Nicholls is a member of my staff has nothing to do with my interest in this particular issue. For some time I have been investigating the threat that organised crime poses to the community in Australia, and Australians in general. The need for further action to be taken against organised crime in Australia was again highlighted by the bombing of the NCA headquarters in Adelaide. Those headquarters just happen to be located next to my electorate office.

Its activities are obviously detrimental to the Australian community. It is important that at government level action is taken to stem the growth in organised crime. If at government level there is a lack of will to do that, a lack of will that in part is due to possible links of former senior ALP heavies with some of the people who may be involved in those criminal activities, then that must be exposed. I welcome the fact that, because of my interest in the issue, I now have a member of staff who has the skills, ability and knowledge to undertake legitimate investigations and inquiries on these matters and to produce the evidence which can be presented in this parliament to bring these people to book.I strongly defend the integrity and ability of Mr Nicholls. He has been subjected to scurrilous misrepresentation and lies by Senator Bolkus in this chamber. That simply should not be allowed to persist. Senator Bolkus ought to have the decency to come into the chamber and apologise for that.

312,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SCHACHT","4J4","(South Australia-","ALP","Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction)",892,"—I want to make a couple of comments on what has been said by Senator Chapman. I was not going to speak in the adjournment debate until I heard his remarks about Mr Nicholls and the case he mentioned in South Australia of some 18 months ago.I say to Senator Chapman, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that coincidentally a family relative of mine was involved in that case. He was the bank clerk whom Mr Nicholls fronted at the bank when Mr Nicholls claimed to be a Mr Jim Stitt in order to get access to material. It is just absolute coincidence that, out of all the Westpacs there are in South Australia, he picked the one at which a cousin of mine, who has had a long-term career with Westpac, happens to be a bank clerk. Maybe it is a sign that Adelaide really is a small town.I have known my cousin all his life. I have no doubt of the veracity or integrity of my cousin when he gave evidence in court identifying Mr Nicholls as the person who came to the bank saying he was Mr Jim Stitt. That is the only comment I wish to make. Senator Chapman has said here that Mr Nicholls and his integrity have been attacked in this parliament, but a relative of mine had to go through a period of considerable anguish and doubts about his own career future—whether he would stay within the bank, or what would happen to him—because a person impersonated somebody else to get hold of bank records. I find that the more appalling, that a person, an absolutely innocent employee of the bank, had the possibility of his career being affected, and had to withstand months and months of personal anguish over what happened on that particular occasion. I think before we get too `holier than thou in defending Mr Nicholls, we should consider that there are other absolutely innocent bystanders who, through no fault of their own, were dragged into this case because of the actions of Mr Nicholls. I put that on the record and ask people to make their own judgment about whether I am biased or not in identifying that the clerk was a close relative of mine.Senate adjourned at 7.30 p.m.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

345,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator McMullan","5I4","QLD","ALP","N/A",893,"—The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senators question:(1) Yes.(2) The letter was written by the CAAs Manager, Legal, Mr David Williams on the understanding that it had been requested by staff of the DPPs Office. In those circumstances, there was no intended breach of the Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth or the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983.(3) No, the letter was written at the request of the Defendants Counsel, and on the understanding that the Defendants solicitor had been requested by the Office of the DPP to obtain such a letter. The Office of the DPP states that no such request was made.The matters raised in the letter did result from discussions between Mr Gary Ticehurst, in his role as Chief Pilot of G & A Helicopters Pty Ltd which firm employs Mr La Pira—and the CAAs Mr Barry Diamond, District Flight Operations Manager, Moorabbin.Those discussions followed from a letter from Mr Ticehurst to the Authority, addressed to Mick Mayoh, General Manager Finance, passed to George Macionis, Director, Directorate of Safety Regulation and thence to Mr Williams, for advice as to appropriate action. As the letter was from the Chief Pilot of the employer and not from a person purporting to represent Mr La Pira, Mr Williams referred the matter to Mr Diamond for discussion with Mr Ticehurst.Mr Ticehurst is a member of the Australian Aviation Advisory Committee.(4) Mr Ticehurst is the Chief Pilot of the Company which employs Mr La Pira.(5) Mr Roser was not involved in the process.The Authority acknowledges that it was inappropriate to express a view to the Defendants solicitors on the appropriateness of the prosecution when the prosecution was part heard and without involving the informant and the prosecution in the process.The Authority further acknowledges that there was an error of judgement in that the Office of the DPP should have been contacted by the Authority to confirm that it had requested such a letter as was sent.(6) Yes.(7) Mr Rozenes QC wrote to the Chairman of the CAA about the matter on 13 January 1994. After investigation and review of the matter, the CAAs Chief Executive Officer, Mr Roser, responded to Mr Rozenes on 11 March. Mr Roser advised that he was satisfied that there was no deliberate undermining of the prosecutions case or intended exclusion of the prosecutor from developments during the case. The review did identify a need for closer co-ordination and improved liaison between the CAA and the DPPs Office, and this is being pursued. Mr Roser also reported the matter to the Chairman of the CAA.(8) No.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

349,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator McMullan","5I4","VIC","ALP","N/A",895,"—The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senators question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC):(1) (a)&(b) The total production and internal costs incurred in producing the show televised on the Sunday night following the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras were approximately $120,000.The video was produced by Village Roadshow utilising footage taken to produce the Sunday night program and the costs to the ABC were as follows:Hire of Outside Broadcast Camera—$447.61Overtime to compile video—$455.39Tape stock—$140.611X80 minute one inch tape—$180.0010X180 minute VHS tapes—$42.00Artwork for sleeve design—$300.00Courier and miscellaneous—$50.00Total—$1615.61All other costs associated with the production of the video were borne by Village Roadshow. The ABC receives a percentage of the video sales.(2) In advising the public of the nature and content of the program the ABC decided the `M classification would be used, although the content was considered to be more consistent with a PG classification.When the tape for sale in retail stores was classified by the Commonwealth Censors Office, it was rated `PG.(3) (a)-(c) It is not intended to broadcast any part of the Mardi Gras coverage on the Australia Television service.(d) All available information regarding telephone calls and correspondence concerning the 1994 Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is shown at question (4) below. Requests to show the program at a later hour were not separately collated. This information is not readily available without diverting resources and facilities from program making activities.(4) (a)-(c) Pattern of early complaintsThe majority of early letters and phone calls were complaints. Many of these appeared to be part of an organised campaign. Identically worded form letters of complaint, all addressed to the Executive Director (rather than Managing Director) at GPO Box 3334 (rather than 9994) or faxed to the Managing Directors own fax machine, began arriving in early February.This campaign was apparently organised by a group called Tradition Family Property Australian Centre, based in Sydney.(i) Those writing letters or sending faxesOpposed to Telecast (mostly received before the broadcast):Total: 5163, including 3372 form letters of complaint, of which 2566 came from NSW.State/Territory breakdown (not counting form letters)NSW—1148Victoria—180Queensland—177South Australia—98Western Australia—80Tasmania—29ACT—9NT—6Letters/forms from a location that was not clear: 78Supporting the Telecast (mostly received after the telecast):Total: 349Identically worded form letters of support: None.State/Territory breakdownNSW—266Victoria—27Queensland—25South Australia—9Western Australia—14Tasmania—1ACT—4NT—3Letters from an unclear location: None(ii) Those making phone calls to the ABCCalls to ABC switchboards(a) Opposed to telecast: 2,378 calls.(b) Supporting telecast: 58 calls.In addition, 515 callers rang to enquire the time of the telecast or seeking information about purchasing the videotape of the parade. These callers were assumed to be favourable.Special Mardi Gras Call-line2,689 calls were recorded. Most of these calls did not leave their name or location. It is impossible to tell whether they were repeats of calls logged at the main switchboards. Those logging the calls noted the same voices ringing in regularly. Calls were 3 to 1 against the telecast proceeding and, as with the letters, the great majority of calls were made before the broadcast went to air.(5) The ABC believes there was an organised ring-in of complaints in an effort to stop the telecast. It is likely that the honourable senators office received some of these calls. Considering the volume of phone calls recorded (over 6,000), the ABC believes it was able to gauge as accurately as possible the extent of community feelings reported by the calls.The ABC considers the most representative measure of public opinion is reflected in the audience size gained by this telecast. Two million people watched the telecast providing the ABC with its highest Sunday viewing audience for many years.(6) Within the limits of coverage of a live event the ABC considers the reporting to have been of a satisfactory standard.(7) No instructions were given to the reporters other than to report professionally.(8) (a)&(b) ABC Management advised the production team that the ABCs role was to cover the event in a way that made it appropriate for a wide audience at 8.30pm. Because the parade has been held many times the general nature of the event was known. The reporters were not given instructions other than to report in a professional manner and within `M classification guidelines.(9) (a)&(b) The program on 6 March was one of a series of programs in an 8.30pm timeslot entitled the Big Picture . Programs scheduled in the Big Picture slot tend to be single programs rather than series. The coverage of events and current affairs encompasses the expression of one side or another of controversial issues. ABC TV has a strong commitment to information programming and broadcasts a wide range of programs covering a wide range of issues.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

351,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Senator Faulkner","5K4","TAS","ALP","N/A",897,"—The answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) and (2) The provision of sport and recreation facilities is primarily a local and state government responsibility. The fact that Tasmania has not, to this time, had an international level aquatic centre is, therefore, a reflection of the priorities of the Tasmanian State Government and local government authorities.Comparisons of sports facility provision reflect the priority given to them by state and local governments. In any comparison of aquatic facilities in Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, it should be borne in mind that none of the aquatic facilities in the ACT can compare to what is proposed in Hobart. The two most prominent facilities in the ACT are inadequate as international competition venues. The Australian Institute of Sport complex (which was fully funded by the Commonwealth) is basically a training facility with limited spectator accommodation, no diving pool and has limited public access.

No example was held in the national collection.This medium bomber was operated by the RAAF during the second world war. 700 examples were built in Australia, and this was the largest single military industrial effort undertaken by this country during the period. Over 50 RAAF units operated the type, and tens of thousands of personnel were involved in their construction and operation. The example obtained comprises the fuselage, wing centre section of a former 100 Squadron RAAF machine, A9-557. It completed 103 missions in 1944/45 before crash landing at Tadji in PNG after sustaining combat damage. In an unrestored condition, it was accompanied by 631 listed and a further 400 minor components. These included engines, all other major structural components except the fin, and the majority of the internal and systems parts.

Its national atomic energy agency BATAN, began operation in 1958. It has been considering a nuclear power program since the 1970s. The Indonesian Government intends to establish a new regulatory agency to assume the regulation and control functions presently carried out by BATAN. The Indonesian Government has commissioned studies which are being undertaken by international experts into the feasibility of constructing a number of power reactors. These studies are expected to continue through until 1996. The Indonesian Government does not intend to take a final decision on whether or not to proceed with constructing a nuclear power reactor until it has considered the result of the feasibility studies. If the Indonesian Government decides to proceed with a nuclear power program, it is likely to choose from an advanced reactor design available from among those Western sources which have been assisting it with feasibility studies. The first power reactor is not likely to begin commercial operation before 2003.(2) This information,including the schedule of feasibility studies, is already on the public record.(3) No. The study was commissioned by the Indonesian Government.

In relation to rifle ranges, however, because of the historical relationship between shooting clubs and the Commonwealth, the individual cases are considered prior to a decision being taken on the appropriate method of disposal. This arrangement is considered to provide fair consideration to rifle clubs which have used rifle ranges for long periods of time. It is not considered necessary or desirable to change the policy on disposal of surplus Commonwealth property in order to provide rifle associations with special advantages not available to other occupants of Commonwealth property.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[17]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
