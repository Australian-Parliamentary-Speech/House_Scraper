2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MENZIES, Robert","N76","Kooyong","LP","Prime Minister",3,". - Since the House last met we have had the sad news of the death of Senator William Patrick Ashley, who was very well known, of course, not only in the Senate, but also to all members of this House.Senator Ashley was born in New South Wales in 1886, and he died on 27th June of this year at the age of 72. I think it proper to put on record his parliamentary career. He was elected to the Senate, for New South Wales, in 1937, and continued thereafter as a senator until the time of his death. He was a member of the Parlia mentary Joint Committee on War Expenditure from July to November, 1941. His party coming into office, he was Minister for Information from October, 1941, until September, 1943. He was Postmaster-General from October, 1941, to February, 1945. He was Minister for Supply and Shipping from February, 1945, to April, 1948. He was Minister for Shipping and Fuel from April, 1948, until December, 1949. He was Vice-President of the Executive Council from 1943 to 1945. He was the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate from 1943 to 1946, and was Leader of the Government in the Senate from 1946 to 1949. He was the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1949 to 1951, and he was a member of the Select Committee appointed by the Senate on the Constitution Alteration (Avoidance of Double Dissolution Deadlocks) Bill in 1950.That, Mr. Speaker, is a very remarkable career of political service and political duty.Early in his life he served in the New South Wales Bushmens Contingent in the South African war in 1901 and 1902.Senator Ashley Bill Ashley, as he was familiarly known to all of us - was, 1 think I may say, a doughty fighter for his cause. He could deliver a shrewd blow and, I must say, take one in good spirit. He had, as I personally always found in my experience of him, a most friendly approach - almost a disarming approach. He was, above all things, a human being who understood humanity, and he responded to all the problems that humanity presented to him. I think, whatever our party affiliations may be, we all had a fondness for him which we shall long remember with great pleasure and of which I wish his widow and his married daughter to know from our lips.He made many friends, and they were not all of his own party by any means. He enjoyed a wide field of friendship in this Parliament. We will all greatly miss him. I will miss him and those in the other place, the Senate, particularly will miss him because it was in that chamber that so much of his active and responsible political work, whether in Government or Opposition, was carried out.Honorable members will notice that I have referred to the fact that he was, for some time, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, lt is perhaps not always understood that a mans fighting for those things he believes in politically is not merely confined to the period when he is one side of the House rather than the other. Senator Ashley had a rich experience both ways, and for each period and in both circumstances he fought a good fight for the things he believed in. It is, I think, proper that, although he did not sit in this House, this House should place on record its appreciation of his work and convey an expression of its profound sympathy to his family. I move therefore -That this House expresses its deep regret at the death of Senator the Honorable William Patrick Ashley, a senator for New South Wales since 1937 and a former Minister of the Crown, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR THE HONORABLE WILLIAM PATRICK ASHLEY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"EVATT, Herbert Vere","DTN","Barton","N/A","Leader of the Opposition",4,". - I second the motion that has been proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies). We feel the deepest loss in the death of Bill Ashley. He had an extraordinary career, as the details alone are sufficient to show. I might add that he was very well known in sporting circles and extremely popular among all sections of the people including those in his own city of Lithgow as well as in Sydney and the other capital cities. It is an extraordinary fact that Senator Ashley served in the Boer War in the New South Wales Bushmens Contingent and that two other members who are still active in the Australian Labour party in this Parliament served with him. One is Senator Donald Cameron and the other the honorable member for Brisbane (Mr. George Lawson).Bill Ashley had some of the great qualities of the serving soldier. He showed that in his civilian work, in Parliament and as a member of a previous government. He was a loyal mate and a great figure in the Labour movement. He never seemed to be missing from its meetings whether they were held in the city or the country. His activities placed a heavy burden on him as he grew older, but he always carried out his job. I think that not only his assistance to the Australian Labour party but also the services he performed, especially during the very difficult war-time period, should be remembered. He rendered great service to both Mr. Curtin and Mr. Chifley when they held office as Prime Minister.Bill Ashley had something in him of the simplicity of the best type of Australian such as one might read about in the pages of Henry Lawson. He was in the New South Wales Bushmens Contingent in the Boer War and had some of the qualities of the old type of Australian bushman.Mr. Speaker, we mourn his loss. We shall not look upon his like again. I hope that Mrs. Ashley and her family will take some comfort from the words of the Prime Minister and from the proposed resolution of this House which, I think, expresses the view of all members of the Parliament and of the people, whatever their politics may be.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR THE HONORABLE WILLIAM PATRICK ASHLEY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

With my colleagues of the Australian Country party, I join in mourning the loss of so distinguished a member of the Parliament as Senator Ashley. He was a man who gave great service to his own party and in the high offices that he held, he had opportunities, of which he availed himself, to give service to the Parliament and to the country.Senator Ashley was a personality in his own right. He certainly made a mark upon the minds of those of us who have served in the Parliament with him. 1 am sure that he will be long remembered in circles wider than those of his own party which he served so well and which rewarded him with such distinguished office. He was clearly a man who was respected and trusted by his colleagues, for he was elected leader of his Government in the Senate and, subsequently, Leader of the Opposition in that chamber.In my personal contacts with him, 1 found him warmly sympathetic to the interests of private individuals as he clearly and publicly was to the interests of causes. The Australian Country party joins in extending its sympathy to his widow and family.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR THE HONORABLE WILLIAM PATRICK ASHLEY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
5,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"LUCHETTI, Anthony","KID","Macquarie","N/A","N/A",5,"- I associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) and the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr. McEwen). William Patrick Ashley came to the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia from the electorate of Macquarie. He came from my home town, Lithgow, and in Lithgow I had the rich experience, for many years, of being associated with him. I had the distinct privilege of being his Labour party nominator when he entered the Commonwealth Parliament. Much has happened since then.In Lithgow and throughout the Macquarie electorate Bill Ashley, as he was known, was widely appreciated and greatly admired. He was a person of high resolve, and throughout his life he never equivocated. He made up his mind on principles and, having made up his mind, he forged ahead with the utmost determination. I look back over the political years - some 30 or more - and I recall that Senator Ashley - or Bill Ashley, or Alderman W. P. Ashley in Lithgow - was a great supporter and admirer of a former Premier of New South Wales, the Honorable James Dooley, who represented the constituency of Macquarie. In the course of time, he supported, with the same vigour and determination, Mr. Hamilton Knight, a former Minister of the Crown in New South Wales; and also the then Premier of New South Wales, Mr. Lang.Subsequently, having been elected to the Senate, Bill Ashley became a great personal friend of my predecessor in the electorate of Macquarie, the late Mr. J. B. Chifley, and in the difficult problems facing the Australian Labour party throughout the war period he was his right-hand man. Wherever there was a difficult situation, William Patrick Ashley - Senator Bill Ashley - was called upon to assist to deal with it. I. think of him as a representative of the outback of this country and of the people of this country. I think of him as an alderman in Lithgow, working for the people there, dealing with their intimate problems. I recall that during the difficult days of the depression period, when Alderman Ashley was the Mayor of Lithgow, he allocated the entire mayoral allowance for a Christmas party in order that the children of the unemployed might have a Christmas treat - that their lives might be brightened by what he was able to do for them. He always thought of the little people. He thought of the masses. He thought of them again in Lithgow when he had a sports ground constructed there, and a grandstand, which was subsequently named the Ashley Stand in his honour. Throughout his life he concerned himself with the people and their intimate problems, lt is not surprising that in the political arena he was concerned about hospital benefits, medical benefits, prices, wages, housing and all matters that had a direct link with the people.On my own behalf, and on behalf of the people whom I represent, who knew him so well, and appreciated his work, 1 thank the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Leader of the Australian Country party for their kind remarks. T am sure that the community, which appreciated Senator Ashleys services so much, would like to join me in those remarks, and T am sure that the sentiments I have expressed here to-day will be echoed sympathetically throughout the whole of my electorate and, indeed, throughout the country.Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR THE HONORABLE WILLIAM PATRICK ASHLEY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
6,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MENZIES, Robert","N76","Kooyong","LP","Prime Minister",6,". - Mr. Speaker, during the recess the Senate, and the Parliament, sustained a second loss. Senator the Honorable Harrie Stephen Seward, of Western Australia, died on 23rd July at the age of 74. He, also, was a veteran in parliamentary service. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia for Pingelly in 1933. and he held his seat until March, 1950. He was Minister for Railways and Transport in Western Australia from 1947 to 1950. He was elected to the Senate for Western Australia in 1951, and in that House he was a member of various committees - the Printing Committee, the Joint Committee on Public Accounts, and the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances.Before he entered parliament he served in the first world war, having enlisted in the Australian Imperial Forces in 1915. He served in France, was commissioned in 1916, and was invalided home to Australia in 1917. Apart from his parliamentary life, he was a farmer of quality and standing at Pingelly, in Western Australia.Sir, it is, perhaps, not always understood by people outside of Parliament that no man can devote, as Senator Seward did. a quarter of a century to parliamentary service of the people without undertaking great tasks and undergoing great strains. Senator Seward had, as I always felt whenever I met him and heard him or spoke with him, a very grave sense of public affairs. He took public affairs most seriously. He had a remarkably strong sense of duty. In war and in peace he had an unsurpassed sense of responsibility. It is a great thing that a man should earn a reputation for such qualities. Western Australia knew him very well because he had a long experience in the Parliament of that State, but he was in this Parliament long enough for everybody to appreciate the quality of his mind, the quality of his character, and the grave and responsible spirit that he brought to bear on his public duties. We all were very distressed when news came of the illness which ultimately took Senator Seward away. In the Government parties, when they met, very warm remarks were made about him, and fervent wishes were extended unto him through his wife. I would like her to know, as I am sure honorable members all round the House would like her to know, how much we admired Senator Seward, how much gratitude we have for the work that he did, and how deeply we feel for her. Sir,I move -That this House expresses its deep regret al the death of Senator the Honorable Harrie Stephen Seward, a senator for Western Australia and former Western Australian Minister of State, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders ils profound sympathy to his widow in her bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR THE HONORABLE HARRIE STEPHEN SEWARD","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Honorable members on this side of the House did not have the same opportunities as did members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party of close association with Senator Seward, and were not so well acquainted with him. His sense of dignity and his strong sense of duty were always displayed, as was shown in his speeches. He rendered great service to the nation in World War I., and, politically, he served his State, as well as the Commonwealth, becoming a Minister of the Crown in Western Australia. On behalf of the Opposition, I join in this tribute to the late senator, and express the hope that his widow will take comfort from this evidence of the regard for his great public services held by the people who knew him in the Parliament and know how well he served his State and the nation.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR THE HONORABLE HARRIE STEPHEN SEWARD","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
8,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MCEWEN, John","009MB","Murray","CP","Minister for Trade",6,". - Mr. Speaker, I desire to record for myself and my colleagues of the Australian Country party our deep sense of loss at the passing of Senator Seward, and to join in supporting the motion proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). Senator Harrie Seward was a very distinguished member of the political party to which T belong. He was also a very distinguished Western Australian and a very great citizen of Australia. It is true, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, that he was not so long in the Commonwealth Parliament that all had full opportunity to measure and assess his work, but he was a man who had served his State of Western Australia, the primary industries and, in politics, the Australian Country party for very many years with great devotion, and with great achievement for the party and the interests with which he concerned himself.Senator Seward left a mark of distinction on everything that he touched. He served for a period in the field of banking, and then went farming with his brother. He was a good farmer, and, inevitably, he graduated into the activities designed to strengthen primary-producing interests. It is notable that the organizations that grew from those interests perhaps first appeared in Western Australia, and certainly have never been stronger anywhere in Australia than there. The late senator was one of a group of very distinguished originators of the organized movements to promote the well-being of the primary industries, and it was only a natural consequence that he should have graduated from those movements to the political field, in which he served with the same devotion as he served his country in war-time.It is on record that Senator Seward not only was wounded in France in World War I., returned to Australia and was discharged, but also re-enlisted and went overseas on active service for a second time. That is symptomatic of the unflagging devotion that Senator Seward exhibited in anything to which he put his mind. He was a good Western Australian Minister, a very good senator, and a very good member of the Australian Country party. We mourn his loss very greatly. We will remember him as an example, and we extend our very warmest sympathy to Mrs. Seward in her very great loss.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR THE HONORABLE HARRIE STEPHEN SEWARD","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
9,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"THOMPSON, Albert","KVT","Port Adelaide","N/A","N/A",7,"- I desire to speak on this motion as a colleague of the late Senator Seward, since 1952, on the Public Accounts Committee. The Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies), in speaking of Senator Sewards high sense of public responsibility, spoke very truly indeed. Throughout all the inquiries that the committee made, on all occasions we found him to be a man who would concentrate on a problem, and deal with it not as a party representative, but as a responsible member of the committee. I remember, Sir, that when our chairman, the honorable member for Warringah (Mr. Bland), was ill, and I had to take over as vice-chairman of the committee, 1 appreciated very keenly the support given by Senator Seward in our endeavours to carry on with the presentation of a report that had been prepared by the chairman and had to be gone through by the committee.Senator Seward was indeed a man who would apply himself to the proposition before him. He had a keen sense of responsibility in regard to the spending of public moneys. He was not just a politician who, to get big things done, was prepared to spend any amount of money. He wanted to see the moneys of the people looked after in a proper way. All our members had a very kindly feeling for him. We did, of course, communicate with Mrs. Seward on his death, but we felt it right and proper that some one should on this occasion refer to his special work on that committee. Unlike the Minister for Trade (Mr. McEwen), I do not know of Senator Sewards earlier activities in Western Australia. To me, he was one of the old school of politicians. When we say that a man is one of the old school of politicians, we mean that we look upon that man very highly indeed. I support the remarks that have been made, and I hope that Mrs. Seward will derive some little comfort from what is being said and done in Parliament to-day.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR THE HONORABLE HARRIE STEPHEN SEWARD","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
10,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"LESLIE, Hugh","L19","Moore","N/A","N/A",7,"- As one whose association with Senator Seward extended back to the days prior to his entry into the political field - the days to which the Minister for Trade (Mr. McEwen) referred - I join in the expressions of sympathy to his widow, and voice the regret that the people of Western Australia feel at the passing of this man. I also express my humble thanks to this House for acknowledging his work. I was associated with the late senator in this Parliament and in the State Parliament, and, earlier, in the days when we were building a political organization for a specific purpose. He never for a moment sought gain for himself in the work which, he did. The records of our organization in Western Australia show that for years he gave his services in an entirely honorary capacity, as an organizer and as an unpaid secretary of a State-wide organization, in days when the services of such men were urgently needed.Harrie Seward, few people realize, was one of the most devout Christians that it has been my privilege in life to meet. He was a member of the Roman Catholic faith, and he practised his religion unostentatiously, never at any time forcing his ideas into the minds of other people. When travelling together I occasionally shared a room with him. and, before climbing into bed, he would, without self-consciousness, kneel, beside it to say his prayers. That was typical of him, and it shows that he built his life completely upon a Christian belief, firm in his faith and firm in his desire to serve his God and his fellow men, and to pay appropriate rent for the place that he occupied in this world.Different people treasure different experiences in their lives. I count among my greatest treasures the privilege of meeting, being acquainted and working with, and being inspired by, people like the late senator. These are treasures that no one can take from me.Harrie Seward, Sir, in his political life was just as faithful, sincere and unostentatious as he was with his Christian beliefs. He was impatient with injustice. In fact,  impatient  is hardly an appropriate word to describe his feelings on matters involving injustice. He had a cause. He fought for that cause and he fought for justice. He hated hypocrisy, and to his mind there was no greater example of hypocrisy than the oft-repeated, shallow promise to give sympathetic consideration to matters requiring immediate action. In such cases Senator Seward threw some penetrating darts, which could, and often did, hurt those at whom they were directed.Western Australia, in particular, has lost a very good man. The late senator was bom in Victoria, Sir, and was proud of that State. He was also proud of the State which he came to call his own, but he never lost his love for Victoria, just as he never lost his eagerness to serve this country and to serve the State which eventually gave him adoption.This Parliament, the people of the Commonwealth and particularly the people of Western Australia suffer a loss, but no one, Sir, suffers so great a loss as those of us who were privileged to be with Senator Seward c?uring his lifetime of service. I join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Country party in extending sympathy to his widow and to the people of Western Australia in their loss.Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR THE HONORABLE HARRIE STEPHEN SEWARD","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
11,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MENZIES, Robert","N76","Kooyong","LP","Prime Minister",8,". - Mr Speaker, before suggesting to you that the House should adjourn until 8 oclock as a tribute of respect to the memory of those two parliamentary colleagues who died while members of this Parliament, 1 want to make a brief reference to the fact that a former member of this House - who was a member, as one realizes almost with surprise, many years ago - the Honorable Horace Key worth Nock, is dead and, indeed, is to-day being buried.Mr. Nock sat in this House from 1931 to 1940. It seems to those of us who were here during that time, or for some part of that time, not very long ago. Therefore, as I say, it is rather surprising for one to realize that it is eighteen years since he sat here. He was the member for Riverina; he was Minister without portfolio for a period during my first term of office as Prime Minister and he was a temporary chairman of committees from November, 1935, to September, 1937.Apart altogether from his parliamentary work, which was remarkably active and vigorous, he was a former federal secretary of the Australian Country party and he was prominent, I need hardly say, for many years in organizations associated with primary production. He died at the age of 79, an age which I had not thought he had reached. Those of us who remember him well and with great affection will be prepared to admit that he took more than a passing interest in the problems of the wheat industry and other primary industries. He was celebrated for it. He had a fertility of mind, a vigour of advocacy and a persistency in dealing with these matters which, I am sure, made him a creditor of many industries, particularly the rural industries and notably so in his own State of New South Wales.He was a very fine man and a very vigorous man, and those of us who sat here at that time - we are now, perhaps, a slightly diminishing band - will always remember him with great regard and great fondness. I learned of his death with profound regret - 1 am sure that we all did - and I thought it would be in conformity with the wishes of the House if I were to indicate on its behalf that on this occasion we have taken note of his death, that we have expressed our regret to learn of it and that we would like to convey an expression of our very sincere sympathy to his two sons and his daughter, all of whom reside in New South Wales. I am sure they will take some comfort from the fact that they inherit a good name and a good reputation.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE HORACE KEYWORTH NOCK","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He was also a very distinguished leader of the wheat industry. Graduating, as he did, from being a good practical farmer to concerning himself, almost naturally, with the marketing problems of the wheat industry, he was truly one of the leaders of this movement during a decade, at least, of controversy and a formative period of policies which were of great importance not only to that industry but also to this country as a whole.Horace Nock will always be remembered for his work for the wheat industry; it was constructive, most persistent and fruitful. He was one of the originators of the idea of a home consumption price of wheat, even before stabilization plans became a practical reality. In that work he has left a memory and, certainly, a monument behind him.He was a persistent and devoted worker for the Australian Country party, one who left evidence of achievement and example. We will remember him as a colleague in this Parliament who set an example of devotion to a cause and of intense loyalty to his party. This day brings sad memories to all of us who worked with Horace Nock, this great Country party man, for so long a period of years.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE HORACE KEYWORTH NOCK","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I hope that always some note will be taken of the work of members and former members when, unfortunately, they fall by the wayside.It is not often, at one sitting of this Parliament - it has never before happened in my memory - that three members of the Parliament, each of whom had distinguished and long careers in politics and held ministerial office either in Federal or State Parliaments, should be commemorated on the one day. Surely it is worth while that we should desist, for a short space of time, from the ordinary hurry-scurry of our political life and commemorate them in reverence so that everyone will know how highly their work has been appreciated.Each of these three distinguished gentlemen gave very great service for a very long period to the Parliament of this country, both inside and outside it, and I am sure that not one of them left any ill will behind him. Each of them has been very highly esteemed here, and his work has been so agreeable to the whole of the Parliament and1, I think, the people of Australia generally, that it is well worth recognition.I felt that I should say a word, myself, about Horace Nock. I was a friend of these three men. I was intimately connected with them by reason of the fact that they , all Came to me with their medical troubles when they were in a bit of a jam. Consequently, I really knew them pretty well and they were all on very good terms with me. Nobody can afford to quarrel with his doctor. I was especially indebted to Mr. Nock at one period of my life when my son was killed and it looked as if the whole management of my affairs would be so disturbed that I would not be able to remain in the Parliament. In fact, I was away for a year. Mr. Nock, with his wealth of experience, came and stayed with me for several months in order to try to make certain that we Would be able to put everything in order. Ever since, I have found that the generosity and the readiness to help that he displayed to me were displayed to every organization in which he was interested and to every cause he adopted.As. the Minister for Trade (Mr. McEwen)has said, Mr. Nock was one of the foundation members of the Australian Country party. He was at different times president and secretary of the Farmers and Settlers Association in its very early days. He was a very good farmer, and 30 years ago he was using farming methods that are still considered advanced. He was pushing the interests of farmers all the time in order to make sure that the organization of which he was part, and the people who were working with him. would be recognized in the manner they deserved, and also to ensure that farmers would enjoy the prosperity that would enable them to give employment to others.I myself feel that we would be very wise to extend the practice we follow on such sad occasions as this, when we express our sympathy with the relatives of our late colleagues and pay tribute to the work and lives of these colleagues, then adjourn for a few hours. I think it would be a very good thing if the practice of commemorating these people were maintained in its fulness, because I am sure that the measure of comfort provided by this public expression of sympathy is worth a great deal; is worth more, in fact, than those who have not been the recipients of it can realize.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE HORACE KEYWORTH NOCK","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This year the Government is budgeting for an overall cash deficiency of £110,000,000. That is to say, we expect that the total receipts of the Commonwealth from revenue, public borrowings and other usual sources will fall short of our total expenditure commitments by £110,000,000, and we plan to finance that gaD by borrowing from the central bank. We are doing this advisedly because we judge that, in the circumstances of our economy, expansive action of that kind is more appropriate than the conventional course of trying to match total receipts and total outgoings. We believe that what we are doing will materi ally support business investment and consumer spending and so help to offset the effects of continued low export earnings.","In Committee of Supply:","BUDGET 1958-59","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Total employment rose and, although unemployment increased to some extent, it did not at any stage reach large proportions. In manufacturing, a great many industries increased output - very considerably in some cases - and, of the other industries, the great majority succeeded in keeping output high. Private investment expenditure is estimated to have increased during the year by more than 7 per cent. The rate of dwelling construction rose and other forms of building activity remained high. There was a large increase in purchases of motor vehicles. Public works nearly everywhere made good headway - this was due largely to more adequate supplies of labour, equipment and materials. Total consumption expenditure for the year is estimated to have been some 7 per cent, greater than in 1956-57.","N/A","THE ECONOMIC PROSPECT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

Meanwhile, the prices of wool, meat and dairy products fell sharply as also did prices of metals. Our total exports for the year were £814,000,000 whereas in 1956-57 they were £978,000,000. Internally, of course, this struck hard at the position of primary producers, who were affected also by cost increases and other factors.

To my mind this demonstrates certain facts of great importance. One is that the expansionary forces which have operated in this country during recent years have great strength and have imparted a high degree of resilience to our economy. Because of this, and because our economy is now much more diversified than formerly, it is better able to withstand external shocks than it once was. Over and above this, last year showed how much can be done by timely and well-judged action in the fields of monetary and budget policy to offset adverse trends and support the initiatives that make for local expansion. For the Government is entitled to recall how, in its Budget for 1957-58, it provided for substantial tax concessions, for increased social service payments, for larger payments to the States and larger works expenditures - all of which unquestionably helped to sustain and increase levels of community spending and provide opportunities and incentives for private enterprise. I may also recall that, even before 1957-58 had begun, restraints on bank lending were being eased and that process was carried on, stage by stage, throughout the financial year. In fact, during the twelve months to June last, advances of the major trading banks increased by some £77,000,000.","N/A","THE ECONOMIC PROSPECT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/para[3]","N/A","N/A"

In Western Europe, where activity has remained high, perhaps the most to be expected for the time being is that the present position will be held.

On the other hand, it is not thought that the wool clip this year will be as large as last year. Moreover, in the first half of 1957-58, export income was maintained by carry-over shipments of wool sold at high prices in the previous year and by drawing upon stocks of wheat. Resources of that kind are not available to the same extent this year. Meanwhile the Government has said that it intends, if possible, to maintain imports at about £800,000,000 f.o.b., which is approximately the same as in 1957-58, and we certainly hope that we will be able to do this. Neither the Government nor, I imagine, anyone else, has any wish to turn again to the expedient of tightening import restrictions. So far, our external position has been supported by a fairly strong inflow of private capital from overseas and, most fortunately, our international reserves are still reasonably high. At 30th June last they stood at £525,000,000 so that even if, as seems likely, they have to be drawn upon fairly heavily this year, we still have a considerable way to go before any action to reduce imports will become necessary. At the same time it is clear that we have to get along with a level of imports no higher than the present, and we must therefore be careful to avoid doing anything that would materially accentuate demand for imports.","N/A","THE ECONOMIC PROSPECT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/para[6]","N/A","N/A"

Heavily though the rural industries were hit by the fall in incomes during 1957-58. the blow was mitigated by the fact that, for some producers at any rate, incomes in the previous year, 1956-57, were exceptionally high. As time has gone on, however, this cushioning effect has necessarily diminished.

There are three chief reasons for this. One is that revenue last year was. without doubt, exceptionally high. I drew attention to this in my Budget Speech for 1957-58 when I pointed out that our buoyant prospects for that year owed a great deal to the good fortune of a high wool market in 1956-57. The second reason is that, in the current year, income tax, which is our largest source of revenue, will reflect the heavy fall in primary producers incomes during 1957-58. The third reason is that, this year, our revenues must show a fullyear effect of the substantial tax concessions which the Government made in its 1957-58 Budget. I may recall that, although these tax concessions were estimated to cost revenue some £28,000,000 in 1957-58, they were also estimated to have a full-year cost of some £57,000,000. Included in that total were reductions in company tax and pay-roll tax and the introduction of a revised basis for depreciation allowances which were estimated to confer upon trade and industry this year direct benefits amounting to £44,000,000. In other words, whilst these various tax concessions were brought down in the last Budget and had a certain expansive effect last year, they assume a much greater magnitude and will have a much greater expansive effect in the current financial year.","N/A","THE BUDGETARY SITUATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/para[2]","N/A","N/A"

This is an increase of £10,000,000 on the programme of last year. We regard it as generally desirable to keep the level of constructional activity at least as high as that of last year, and, with additional labour becoming available, some increase in the borrowing programme appeared to be warranted. On the other hand, as I have said earlier, we do not think at this stage that we can count on raising any greater amount of loan money than in 1957-58 when our ordinary loan raisings yielded £115,000,000. This means that, once again, the Commonwealth will probably have to provide from its own resources a very substantial amount of assistance for the Loan Council programmes. In addition, we will need an amount, estimated at £7,000,000, for War Service Land Settlement. How much these commitments will, in total, require it is, of course, impossible to estimate precisely, but it seems advisable to make substantial provision towards meeting them. We are accordingly seeking for the purpose an appropriation of £102,000,000 from Consolidated Revenue to the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve.","N/A","THE BUDGETARY SITUATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/para[15]","N/A","N/A"

On earlier occasions I have referred to the very large amount of debt, a great part of it arising fom 1939-45 war borrowings, which falls due in the next few years; and it was with this problem in view that the Government some years ago established the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve. In successive years appropriations to the Reserve have been made from Consolidated Revenue, the money being temporarily invested - for the most part in Special Loans raised to assist Loan Council programmes. Through the operations of the Reserve it has been possible to effect a very large reduction in the amount of early-maturing debt. Up to 30th June last the Reserve had, in fact, acquired and cancelled securities totalling more than £200,000,000, nearly all of which would have matured ;n the period between 1956-57 and 1961-62. But the amount of debt outstanding remains very large and in the current financial year £337,000,000 falls due in Australia and £26,000,000 in London. Of the Australian debt.some £291,000,000 is held outside the Commonwealth Trust Fund and, since p great part of it is war debt, the number of individual holders is large. The Government will, of course, do its utmost to convert the maturing loans into new loans and we hope that we will have the strong support of institutions and the public in our efforts to do so. In the nature of things, however, we have to expect that a considerable number of holders will want to obtain cash for their securities as they fall due, so that the total amount redeemed1 may be formidable. Last year redemptions of securities offered for conversion totalled £59,000,000. This year, because the maturing debt is much more widely held, it seems probable that the amount redeemed will be considerably larger. In addition, provision has again to be made for maturing savings certificates. It is not possible, of course, to make any exact estimate at this stage but we have thought that, for purposes of our financial reckoning, we should not put the total amount lower than £80,000,000. Towards meeting this we estimate that the National Debt Sinking Fund may have available, from current receipts, up to £45,000,000. It is proposed that the remainder will be met by drawing upon the accumulated balances of the sinking fund and of the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve. For that purpose, investments of these two funds will have to be realized and that means, in effect, obtaining cash from the Central Bank, since to sell securities elsewhere could very well militate against our efforts to raise new loans or to convert existing loans.","N/A","THE BUDGETARY SITUATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/para[16]","N/A","N/A"

This makes a total of £1,465,000 for resources available in cash during the year. On the other hand, expenditure ordinarily charged to Consolidated Revenue is estimated at £1,278,000,000. The Loan Council borrowing programmes involve an amount of £210,000,000 and War Service Land Settlement an amount of £7,000,000. Besides this, we are estimating debt redemptions in the year at £80,000,000 which makes, in all, an estimated amount of £1,575,000,000 for which cash will be required. If cash resources are £1,465,000,000 and cash requirements £1,575,000,000, the estimated overall deficiency becomes £110,000,000. These estimates of our overall financial position are set out in detail in Statement No. 2 attached to the Budget Speech. I should perhaps emphasize that since, in making estimates of this kind, we have to take account of many imponderable factors, they are necessarily subject to a margain of uncertainty. That applies particularly to such items as the amount of loan raisings and the amount of debt redemptions.

The arguments in favour of doing this are, I think, quite overwhelming. On the one hand, immigration is, without doubt, a powerful influence in sustaining demand - demand both for capital facilities and for consumption goods. It would therefore be a great mistake at this time when, in one sector of the economy, there is a shrinkage of demand, to cut the intake of migrants. On the other hand, the steady growth of population, in which immigration plays such an important part, has undoubtedly become the basis of forward planning by many people in industry and trade. They are looking to increased population to provide wider markets in the future and it is important that they should feel secure in that expectation.","N/A","FINANCIAL POLICY 1958-59","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/para[3]","N/A","N/A"

Industry, in all its main sectors, is doing a tremendous job. If the primary industries are currently suffering a set-back, it is no fault of the primary industries themselves. For. taking them as a whole, their achievement in recent years has been remarkable in point of increased output, greater capacity for production, efficiency and conservation of resources. Equally can that be said of manufacturing where, as we all know, astonishing progress has been, and is being, made in establishing new industries, applying new processes and techniques and building foundations for still greater development. There has also been great progress in mining, a development which we should particularly welcome because of the promise it holds for increased exports.

It brought down additional taxation to ensure that, overall, the inflow of public funds would match the outgoings and, if need be, show a surplus. That policy was unquestionably the right one for the time. To-day, conditions are somewhat different. Labour is no longer scarce as it was then; additional labour is coming forward and will have to be absorbed. Demand for goods is no longer excessive; in the important rural sector, indeed, demand has contracted and may possibly contract still further.","N/A","FINANCIAL POLICY 1958-59","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/para[6]","N/A","N/A"

As I have shown, the deficiency is, in part, due to a short-fall in revenue which, in itself, follows upon a drop in rural incomes. That is ground we can reasonably hope to recover before too great a time has passed. Partly also it is the result of tax concessions made by the Government last year which will, in this year, yield their full benefit to industry and commerce. The rise in expenditures of various kinds will also serve to support activity over a very wide field. That is obviously true of works expenditure, payments to the States and Social Service payments. But it is also true of debt redemptions because people who obtain cash for their maturing bonds or stock will, for the most part, either re-invest it somewhere or spend it on consumption goods. In general, the effect of the Budget will be that, whilst rather less is being taken from the public in taxation revenue, more will be added to incomes through the increase in public expenditure.","N/A","FINANCIAL POLICY 1958-59","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/para[7]","N/A","N/A"

That, of course, is something we would have wished to do had it been practicable. But various considerations weighed against it. One was that it would have increased the overall deficiency this year; and we were not prepared to do that. In effect, tax concessions would have been made by borrowing still more from the central bank. After all, total expenditure in the economy has for some time been rising and, for anything we can see, will continue to rise. The second consideration was that, by the nature of most tax concessions, the cost to revenue would have fallen more upon the Budget for next year than upon the Budget for this year. We did not think that we ought to mortgage the future in that way. We are not therefore making any tax concessions of a general character. Those of which I shall give details presently either provide for the continuance of existing concessions or, at the most, widen their scope to some extent. At the same time I think I should emphasize again that this year the economy will have, in full measure, the benefits of the very considerable tax concessions made last year.","N/A","FINANCIAL POLICY 1958-59","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/para[9]","N/A","N/A"

But there are some weaknesses in our position which could develop further if they were not countered. In this Budget, the Government aims to do that by giving a broad stimulus to the economy. Some no doubt will say that we ought to do more than we propose to do and, in particular, that we ought to reduce taxation further. That is something we would have been glad to do had the revenue position been stronger. But with revenue down it has appeared neither feasible nor wise. I am coming to the end of a long term as Treasurer - a record term in point of years. But there is another record of which I am far prouder.

198,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CAIRNS, Jim","1V4","Yarra","N/A","N/A",55,".- This piece of legislation, which was introduced at the end of last session, is extremely important. Substantially, it substitutes a new act of Parliament for all measures dealing with migration passed since 1901 to the present day. The bill provides for control of migration to Australia by regulation or restriction.Migration to Australia has always had two quite distinct aspects. The first has been the aspect of assistance or encouragement, and the second the aspect of restriction. Both of these aspects have always been closely related and it is quite impossible to discuss or examine one without discussing or examining the other. As the Minister for Immigration (Mr. Downer) stated in his second reading speech, restriction of migration to Australia goes back to 1855 in Victoria and a little later in New South Wales. We are often led to believe that restriction of migration is a relatively new factor. We are frequently told that throughout the laisser-faire nineteenth century, the movement of people in and out of countries was much freer. However, in practically every established country, restrictions have been imposed upon the entry or departure of people.In the Australian situation there are some reasons which we should identify for the restriction of migration. First of all some persons who come may not be of a desirable type to be accepted for permanent residence in the country. I have also thought that, in the Australian case, a restriction should also be placed on those who do not enter the country in accordance with what is regarded as the proper procedure. I refer to persons who leave ships and enter the country without meeting legal requirements. There are those also who come temporarily, for particular reasons, and then desire or try to stay. Those are types against whom, broadly speaking, restriction has been practised in the Australian situation.Before I look more closely at the restrictions proposed in this bill I should like to direct attention to the second aspect - the encouragement or expansion of migration. I want to make the point clearly that there is a very close relationship between the two aspects. If it were possible in this country to maintain conditions under which migration could be very expansive, then the question of restriction would not be nearly so important. I feel like saying clearly to persons who are affected by the restriction of migration, and who want to get members of their families from overseas and cannot do so, If we were able in this country to stand a much greater immigration programme, many or most of these restrictions would disappear . The connexion between restrictions and the expansionary or assisted side of migration, therefore, is very close indeed. I think it would be most unfortunate if people became concerned with the aspect of restrictions without relating it to what, perhaps, is the most effective way of removing those restrictions. I shall refer to that in a few moments.Historically, the factor that most intimately concerns expansion in the Australian situation, has always been associated with the question of unemployment, right back to, I think, 1858, when 5,000 persons gathered in the Flagstaff Gardens in Melbourne to protest against immigration because of unemployment. Throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century the relation between unemployment in Australian and the demand for restriction of migration had always been very close. In the 19th century, when governments were, in many respects, remarkably unrepresentative of the people and would not, perhaps, have had much to fear from the unemployed, there was invariably restriction of migration for either natural or artificial reasons. Historically, therefore, unemployment has been a very significant matter in relation to the level of migration that this country has been able to maintain. But a relatively new factor has appeared in recent years. This is the factor to which I want to give emphasis tonight. It is the factor of housing and services. As far as I am able to find, this became a significant factor in the determination of Australias migration programme.In 1945, the then Minister for Immigration, who is now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Calwell) outlined in a speech to this House the foundational structure of the Australian migration programme All those people who are interested in maintaining the programme should read that speech again. I believe that the Australian post-war migration programme was founded upon the facts and circumstances detailed in that speech. Not only was emphasis laid, correctly, upon the level of employment and the increased opportunities for employment in this country; emphasis was laid also upon the need to have an adequate housing and servicing programme if the migration programme was to be maintained.I think that in considering this bill, which is a most embracing and, I may say so, a vastly improved and a vastly liberalized measure, we should think at the same time primarily of the fundamental economic circumstances which underlie the migration programme. This is a vital matter in relation to restriction. Indeed, the post-war migration programme was accepted, I believe, by the Australian people in association with a policy of full employment, rather generally and loosely understood.The point to be made clear here is that it is not just a matter of there not being much unemployment - not full employment in that sense. Most significantly it is a matter of the increase of the work force each year, such increase to he made up of the number of Australian-born who join the work force, and the number of people who come from overseas to join it. In the post-war years this has always been 60,000 to 80,000. In other words, I am suggesting that we cannot have what I call an optimum migration programme unless we have an increase in the work force of 60,000 or 80,000 people a year, or perhaps a little more. Full employment is not enough. The fact that we do not have much unemployment is not enough. We must have an expanding work force. The expansion of our work force has not been at anything like that rate. One only has to refer to the information provided by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics for wage and salary earners which, of course, do not include all; where estimates of the aggregate are made, the position is slightly worse. Between June, 1955, and June, 1956, the work force increased by only 53,000 people. In the next twelve months, the work force increased by only 10,000 people, and in the last year, not necessarily the financial year, the increase will be even less. It is pretty clear, therefore, that with the level of employment in Australia behaving like this, the problem of the restriction of migration will become greater and greater. Personally, 1 do not want to see it become any greater. Other members of this House may know of dozens of migrants to this country who are most distressed, who are in great difficulty, and who have tragedies in their homes because all members of their families cannot, or have not so far been able to come to Australia. This question of restriction, therefore, which this bill very closely affects, cannot be separated from those factors.In addition to the growth in the labour force, we have also to be concerned with the second principle that was expounded by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in 1945, relating to housing and services. It is all very well to speak, as the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) has spoken earlier this evening, of prosperity when you think only about the aggregate, and the vast volume of inflated Fadden flimsiest by which the national income has increased. We must also think of the composition of the national income or national output. What has happened to housing? We all know the answer. Very soon after this Government came into office the rate of construction was over 80,000 houses a year. Since then, our population has increased by over one and a half million, yet the number of houses under construction in Australia is just over 64,000 a year. So if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was correct in 1945 - and I believe that he was - the question of the number of houses being built is of vital importance to the migration programme. Again, seeing the conditions in my own electorate, I do not want the same pressure, or anything like the same pressure to be maintained on housing that exists at the present time. Because of my knowledge of the housing conditions in my electorate, I am not prepared to accept from the Treasurer, although he has occupied his distinguished office for nine years, the assurance that this country is in a condition of prosperity. I am not prepared to accept as satisfactory the congested conditions under which migrant families live; it would not be fair to the migrants, many of whom are no better off in Australia than they were in some of the depressed parts of Europe. The number of actions for eviction that some migrant home-owners have been compelled by the circumstances to launch in the courts has created, unfortunately - it is not yet of any great significance - an antipathy to migrants. Therefore, if we are concerned - as we are in this measure - with a liberalizing of the procedure of migration restriction, we must also be concerned with these fundamental matters to determine how much that procedure must or must not be applied. Now, the position, which I would like to put summarily, is that immigration to this country cannot survive to any significant extent without serious restriction unless not only full employment but also an expansion of the work force by something like 60,000 to 80,000 people a year is maintained. It cannot be maintained unless something like 80,000 houses a year - or more - are being built. It cannot be maintained at a proper level unless hospitals, schools and other services are also provided to meet the needs of an increasing population.What has been going on in Australia in recent years is that we have been losing out in the provision of the essentials and gaining rapidly in the provision of the trivial or additional things. You can buy a television set without having to pay a deposit; but try buying a house without paying a deposit! It is much easier to buy the things that are not essential for national development than it is to buy the things that are fundamental to national development. But as long as we are encouraged - as we are by the present Government and by some of its advisers who ought to know better - to think only in terms of the aggregate, and as long as even the semblance of full employment exists, everything in the world is lovely, or so we are told. That is the doctrine of ultralaissezfaire, and it is not a doctrine that will solve Australias .problems of national development.I want now, having discussed this fundamental matter underlying the immigration programme, to turn to the actual restrictions on immigration. In Australia we have applied immigration restrictions because some of. the people who have come here, or tried to come here, have not been desirable types. We have, as I suppose most people have, a rather high assumption of our own quality, and we tend to be choosy. I suppose that is quite justifiable. We think in terms of fitness. We think in terms of contribution to development - and the Australian immigration programme has been coupled with development. We have wanted as immigrants people with skills, people with muscles who can work on tramway construction and so forth, or in the building industry and, on the whole, we have got them. These people have made a substantial contribution to Australias developments in all these respects. We have also been concerned - and let us be quite frank about it - with social and political suitability. There has been political screening used here and abroad which, I think, has allowed people with, shall we say, very narrow concepts of political conformity, to have their say. It seems to me that conformity is a greater danger in this country than radicalism is. It seems to me that in some of those respects we have rather overdone it, so to speak.","Second Reading","MIGRATION BILL 1958","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[25]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

207,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CAIRNS, Jim","1V4","N/A","N/A","N/A",58,"- The point to which I was referring is that we have considered the social and political suitability of immigrants. We also have decided that people who are to come to Australia should come according to the accepted methods. They may not come temporarily and then try to stay permanently.Now let us look at the aspect of fitness and contribution to development first. That is, broadly speaking, a necessary requirement at a time when we have the ability to be selective, when more people want tocome to Australia than we can accept in the circumstances of a particular time. In those conditions that is a wise kind of policy to follow. But I think that it is not a position that we can maintain completely. Because of humanitarian reasons we cannot maintain it completely.Many people pass the fitness and contribution to development test and come to Australia. Then we find that they have relatives overseas who cannot pass that test. I feel that when we are getting sufficient numbers of immigrants who show themselves to be capable of contributing to our development and of increasing our productive capacity, then, on humanitarian grounds, we are bound to accept also as immigrants some members of their families who, for reasons of age or health, lack fitness and cannot contribute to our development. I would be prepared to take this much further than the present Government is. Time and time again we hear of prospective migrants being refused admittance to Australia for no other reason than a health condition which is consistent with their age. There are other kinds of cases, too. I can call to mind one case of a small boy who had a deformed left hand and whose left leg was slightly shorter than his right leg. His mother and father were here. I think that a refusal to admit in such a case is an example of a principle being applied far too narrowly. We have had an important contribution to our productive capacity and we can stand, 1 think, and must stand for humanitarian reasons, a relaxation of the principle. The position is that such people are not going to be particularly dependent upon Australia.At naturalization ceremonies we are told that naturalized Australian citizens are entitled to all the social services that an Australian-born citizen is entitled to. Of course, that is not true. They are not entitled to all these social services. Members of immigrant families who come here later and who are for such reasons as health not normally acceptable immigrants, come under conditions where their sponsors undertake to maintain them. I know that that undertaking is not always capable of being carried out. But I believe that a country in Australias present circumstances can afford to go quite a long way in common decency in this respect.Let me refer to one other point - the restriction on those who come here temporarily and not as permanent residents. Broadly, they come as visitors, either to engage in some particular business or employment, or they come for education. Probably there is a third category consisting of those who do not fit into the first two. When such persons have been here for a time, perhaps having had their vises extended on two or three occasions, and have proved themselves to be quite suitable people for this country, why not allow them to stay? What is the reason that they are not allowed to stay? Probably it is that allowing them to stay would be against the rules and would encourage more people to come ostensibly for temporary reasons in the belief that, having come temporarily, they would be allowed to stay permanently. If that happened, would it be likely to create any very serious situation? A case at present under consideration concerns a young Dutchman, I think, who came here and had his vise extended a couple of times, and is not to be allowed to stay. Why not? He is a very suitable type of person. I do not think it would be such a bad thing to even have a system under which people would be allowed to come on trial, look us over and decide whether they want to stay. I do not think the operation of such a system would be likely to create such a serious situation. 1 have in mind the case of a family who came here twelve years ago and eventually were refused permission to stay. They where told that they would have to leave Australia. That was twelve years ago, and these  wicked  people went into smoke. For twelve years they lived the normal lives of Australian citizens. Wherever they were employed they were found to be completely satisfactory. They were favorably known to justices of the peace and members of the Police Force. They produced, I understand, references of excellent character from all these people. What is wrong with them? Why should we be so particular and fussy? Why should we apply restrictions when people come here for a certain period? We have seen them, they have lived under Australian conditions, and they have shown themselves to be- acceptable. Why can they not be allowed to stay? I am not, of course, concerned with those who have not proved acceptable.One point in this matter does, I think, call for re-examination. Quite a number of people are allowed to come here for employment in fields demanding special qualifications. They are placed very much in the hands of their employers - the Chinese restaurant industry, the North Australian pearling industry and so on. Their employers are answerable to the State Department of Labour, and to other authorities in the north, in respect of working conditions, but they are given a very great power over their employees, whose conditions, we know, have in many cases been far from satisfactory, and certainly below those of Australians generally. This sort of thing continues to exist because the employee fears that if he objects he will lose his employment - the reason for his being allowed to remain in Australia. T want to say here that my experience has been that both the State departments of labour and the Department of Immigration have dealt with this matter in a very reasonable and sensible way, but I think that it should be looked at a little more closely because there is in it an element of exploitation and unfairness. Such persons come within the category that I have been discussing and I believe that after they have been here for some years - in the pearling industry some have remained for thirty - and their employment has finished, they should be given the opportunity to become naturalized.They may be too old to work and, failing naturalization, must return to their own country. Such people surely have very strong claims for naturalization.In conclusion, I believe that a couple of guiding principles underlie this legislation. One is that restriction must be closely related to the conditions of expansion or assistance. The Government has an optimum immigration plan to bring in 112,000 people this year, because it is budgeting for a deficit of £1 12,000,000. That is not the proper approach. The optimum number should surely be the number that we can employ, house and service without significantly harming Australian living conditions. Any other approach is bad for both the migrant and the Australian. We must be more liberal in relation to families. We must allow more of those who are not so fit, or so young, to come into Australia. We must do so for humanitarian reasons and because of the important contribution that is made to Australian productive capacity by those to whom these migrants are related.We must be a little more tolerant on both the social and political side. I know that some migrants, being apprehensive, have expressed opinions, political or social, concerning this country, but it is necessary for us - confident as we are in our own institutions - not ourselves to be so apprehensive as to refuse naturalization to persons who are not strongly suspected of endangering security. For my own part, I cannot see how a man can be a greater threat to security if he is naturalized than if he is not. Certainly, naturalization is not something that should be easily handed out, but in respect of a number of the restrictions that I know are applied in some cases, I would call for a more liberal interpretation of the principles involved.Finally, I think that the time has come to allow some temporary visitors to remain in this country if they so desire. This business of deporting them, or threatening them with deportation - more than anything else - gives Australia a bad name in this field. There has been, over the years, a liberalization of these things, and this measure is an expression of that liberalization, which should be extended as rapidly as possible. That seems to be the trend underlying the administration of immigration in this country.","Second Reading","MIGRATION BILL 1958","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[25]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Minister deserves generous congratulations on the bill, and upon his very favorable presentation of its contents. He is known for his humanitarian outlook.

We are seeking, by getting increased population, not merely to defend this country, but also to develop it, realizing that unless we develop it, somebody else will do so for us. Accordingly, great steps have been taken to bring many thousands of immigrants into Australia.The immigration policy has been a tremendous success. One has only to look at the achievements that have resulted from it to appreciate the truth of that statement. We have only to consider the increase in the population and the tremendous number of new works that have been commenced, whether they relate to transport, public works or manufactures. We must not overlook, either, the tremendous number, of new houses that have been built in Australia. The honorable member for Yarra suggested that the housing position, so far as immigrants were concerned, was bad. The truth of the matter is that when the Australian Labour party, which the honorable member supports, occupied the treasury bench, Australia had a shortage of 250,000 houses.

Immigrants have taken part in all this tremendous development. We must realize that only through an immigration policy such as that sponsored by thi9 Government can we develop and prosper as we have been prospering during the term of office of the MenziesFadden Government.As to the criticism of the honorable member for Yarra of the general principles of the Governments policy, as he put it, the truth of the matter is that the immigration policy of this Government is most carefully balanced. All matters that are relevant to it have been considered. They include the question of nationalities. We do not want too many of one nationality or too few of another. We are endeavouring to assimilate the immigrants into the community. That is one of the vital features of this Governments immigration policy, and so it is most desirable that we consider a balance of nationalities. We must consider also a balance of skills. We must have imimgrants who are skilled in one particular form of employment and others who are skilled in other jobs. There must be a certain proportion of unskilled labour. We must consider how many males and females should be introduced into the community each year. We must consider physical fitness and age. All these and many other factors have been taken into account in the balanced immigration policy of the Government. Its objective is to achieve a proper balance in immigration.Above everything else* trends of employment are considered so that there shall not be too many persons able to do one type of job and too few able to do another. We must be sure that we have the correct proportions to do particular types of jobs or trained in particular skills. The employment potential is one of the matters which is always before those who are in charge of the immigration programme or who are advising the Government on it. It has been said - and I believe rightly - that, from the point of view of community interest, in relation to the employment potential and in planning and effect, our immigration policy is second to none, either past or present. I believe that that is the reason why our policy has been such a great success.In considering the subject of nationalities, I believe I should mention briefly the question of British immigrants because there are more people of British stock in Australia than there are in any other country in the world outside the United Kingdom. The Government wants Australia to remain a British country, lt wants British characteristics to continue to predominate. Consequently, the first objective of the Governments immigration programme is to accept every eligible British immigrant who is available. Any person in Australia who can offer accommodation or a job to a British immigrant can secure a free passage to Australia for the British immigrant and his family. The Government has done absolutely nothing that is detrimental in any way to British immigration to Australia. On the contrary, the advantages afforded to British immigrants by the Government far exceed those that have been given to immigrants of other nationalities.Reference has been made to southern European immigrants. In that connexion, the Government has said that we must have regard for the balance of nationalities. We must be sure that there are not too many of one nationality and too few of another. We have to think of the assimilation problem. We must consider the total number of immigrants that we shall admit to Australia each year. We must pay attention also to the backlog of southern Europeans who wish to come to Australia. For the time being, the Government decided - and I believe rightly - that we should close down on immigration from southern Europe, but then the Minister, realizing that immigrants were suffering hardship because some members of the family were in Australia and some were in their homeland, made provision for certain types of family immigration to continue. Although that was a most humanitarian decision, criticism was levelled at the Minister. I believe that his answers to that criticism have silenced it completely; and the Minister should be commended not only for his decision but also for the manner in which he has stood up to criticism. He has shown clearly that he will do what he believes to be right in carrying out the policy of the Government in relation to the department under his administration.Another matter that has been raised during the term of office of the present minister is Asiatic migration. It should be realized that we have moved forward in this matter. We are now prepared to receive Asians who wish to study or to carry on business here. We are prepared to receive Asian travellers. In certain instances, we are prepared even to naturalize Asians and allow them to remain in our country permanently. The position now is different from that which existed in the early years of this century, when our immigration policy came to be known as the white Australia policy. We have departed from the ideas that we held during the early years of the century, and that should be fully realized. We are admitting into this country now far more Asians than would be admitted under the small quota system for which some emotionalists are crying out.The bill proposes a very important alteration in the method of obtaining entry to the country. In the future, the mode of entry will be by entry permits. Some of these permits will be of a temporary character. This system is to take the place of the old dictation test, which gave rise to a considerable degree of derision and which was by no means highly regarded in the community. It was thought that the dictation test often created hardship and was often improperly applied. I do no say that that was so; I am merely stating that that was the reputation it came to have. The courts, on the other hand, interpreted the dictation test provision very strictly, and cases arose in which persons were able to escape the effect of the dictation test through some technicality, such as failure to read exactly 50 words, the number stated in the act. It is good that we are to be rid of that test.","Second Reading","MIGRATION BILL 1958","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[25]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The test was provided for in the original Immigration Act. It is interesting to note that Senator the Honorable Sir John Downer said that he thought it was a good provision, for the reason that it ensured that only well-educated persons would be able to come into Australia. Although the present minister may not agree with the means by which Sir John sought to obtain that result, I am certain he does agree with what Sir John attempted to achieve. I am certain that he thoroughly approves of well-educated persons coming into this country. In view of certain criticism by a section of the press, perhaps I should say of Sir John Downer that the honorable and learned senator, although he voted for the original bill, made it quite clear that there were a number of things in it of which he personally did not approve, but which he considered were desired by the electors.The bill also deals with deportation, and it is in this connexion that the imagination, vision and humanity of the Minister are most clearly seen. I wish to stress this point, because the bill - which is somewhat lengthy - being a consolidating measure dealing with a very important subject, has had to be drafted in places in precise and technical legal language. Unfortunately, in this House one hears so often the parrot cry that we have legalism without humanity in our legislation.","Second Reading","MIGRATION BILL 1958","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[25]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

221,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"JOSKE, Percy","KDY","N/A","N/A","N/A",63,"- The vacant mind naturally cannot appreciate the meaning of the legislation, and it is the vacant mind which makes use of the parrot cry. The position, Sir, is that you cannot have humanity without law. Legal rights and obligations need to be phrased in clear language. Indeed, it has been said that law is the sister of freedom. The noble task of the law is to endeavour to do justice, and justice can hardly be done unless humanity accompanies it. Let us hear no more of this cry that because a bill is couched in legal language we have legalism without humanity. The bill provides that before there can be a deportation there must be an inquiry before an independent commissioner - a person of high standing, a judge or a lawyer of standing. A similar provision relates to arrests. A person arrested for a breach of the provisions of the bill also must be brought before such a commissioner. Provision is made for facilities for obtaining legal advice. The Minister has decided that a person about to be deported, who in fact has not committed a criminal act but has merely done something prohibited by the Immigration Act, shall not be incarcerated pending his deportation. The Minister is to provide for detention centres. In all these ways he has shown his humanity.Another interesting feature of the bill is the provision for doing away with the registration of immigration agents. It has been found that the registration system has been abused. It is now provided that if a person acting as an agent is found guilty of misconduct, he shall be prohibited from so acting in the future. It is hoped that this abuse of the system will be prevented.Finally, let me say that there is in the bill an exceedingly important, wise and humanitarian provision dealing with infant children. We have witnessed in this country the unfortunate spectacle of one parent seizing a child from the other parent and rushing it overseas, thereby taking the child out of the jurisdiction of the Australian courts and making it improbable that the parent in Australia will ever obtain custody of the child again. When cases have come before the courts in which a parent has said that he or she fears that a child in his or her custody will be taken out of the country, the judges have looked quizzically at the parent, shrugged their shoulders and said,  Fear is no ground for granting you an injunction or other order to prevent the child from being taken overseas. You must have positive evidence that that is, in fact, about to be done. Of course, the positive evidence is available only when the child has gone. The Minister, therefore, very wisely - I believe that this provision has been approved by the Immigration Advisory Council - has provided that a child shall not be removed from the country without the consent of the person in charge of it where an order for custody has been granted to that person or where custody proceedings are pending. Penalities are provided for a breach of that provision. This is a magnificent step forward. Speaking as one who has practised in this jurisdiction of the courts, I say that the Minister is to be commended for a novel and exceedingly wise provision. In fact, the whole of the bill should receive the commendation of the House.","Second Reading","MIGRATION BILL 1958","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[25]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
222,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MAKIN, Norman","KLL","Bonython","N/A","N/A",63,".- I am afraid that the honorable member for Balaclava (Mr. Joske) did not follow the excellent example of the Minister for Immigration (Mr. Downer), who, when introducing this legislation, tried to keep it free from partisan feeling. I appreciate the Ministers attitude very much because I feel that, by observing that principle, we shall get the very best results from this class of legislation. It is fortunate that we have a Minister for Immigration who appreciates that fact.The Minister introduced this bill on 1st May. In the speech that he delivered at that time he indicated that this legislation was to consolidate the various statutes on immigration and was more technical than policy-making. I can see the wisdom of the honorable gentleman in providing in the 67 clauses of this bill that which is contained in many pieces of legislation passed since the beginning of federation. This consolidating bill will make more readily available to us the information that -we require in dealing  with immigration matters.I should also like to express my appreciation of the Ministers reference to the contribution made by a former Minister for Immigration, the honorable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell) to the immigration policy that has been accepted and generally appreciated by the Australian community.I feel that, in the main, our immigration policy has worked out very successfully although it has not been without certain of the difficulties which I suppose are inseparable from the implementation of a policy to bring to this country great numbers of people. These people have to be assimilated into our population. They have to be found opportunities to become properly established in their way of life here.I have had reason to bring to the Ministers notice one or two cases in which hardship would have been endured by people who have come to this country believing that other members of their family would be allowed to follow at some later period. The Minister has been most considerate in these cases, and for his consideration I tender him my appreciation.I agree with the honorable member for Bendigo (Mr. Clarey) and the honorable member for Yarra (Mr. Cairns) who emphasized the great need for relating the intake of immigrants to the number that the country can reasonably absorb without diminishing employment prospects amongst the people generally. Surely the Minister will realize that newcomers to this country, be they British or of foreign extraction, require to be able to earn their livelihood within a reasonable period after they come to this country. By a reasonable period  I do not mean a period of months; I mean almost immediately upon arrival.If the newcomer finds himself for a lengthy period without employment his mind is subject to a devastating impact. Not only does this destroy his confidence in the country, but knowledge of this circumstance is made available to people in other parts of the world. This prejudices the standing of Australia in the eyes of those who otherwise would have had a favorable view of Australian conditions. That being so, we must ensure that employment is made available to all who come to Australia. It is wise, also, to ensure that the bringing of people to this country will not be of definite disadvantage to any Australian who is seeking to make a satisfactory livelihood.I feel that the Australian people generally have been most helpful and considerate in the way in which they have accepted immigrants into our way of life, and have shown them that they are indeed welcome and that we desire that they shall share the fortunes of this country. The attitude of the Australian people to those who have come from the other side of the world has shown a generous spirit. There is a wide appreciation that much can be contributed to the common good by the energy, effort and initiative of the newcomers. Undoubtedly the immigration programme has given an impetus to the development of Australia. But I feel that it is essential for us to do certain things in order that full satisfaction may be given to the people who come here. They must be provided with houses because it is most important that they should be given an opportuntiy for family life. The home has always been the principal basis of the life of a nation. People should not be left in hostels for inordinately long periods, as has happened in South Australia. Whilst such accommodation may meet the emergency of the moment, it should not be regarded as being more than temporary. Unfortunately, men and women have been housed in this unsatisfactory class of accommodation for periods in excess of two years. People who have enjoyed the comfort of their own homes are not satisfied with hostel accommodation. indeed, some migrants have become resentful, have said that they were misled, and have returned to the countries from which they came. Such conditions of life are not satisfactory in a young and growing country like Australia. Instead of spending our resources in ways that will not contribute to a solution of the problems that I have brought to the notice of the Minister, we should ensure that provision is made to overcome the housing lag.I refer to the remarks of the honorable member for Balaclava with a feeling of grave concern, because honorable gentlemen who occupy responsible positions in a parliament should not be prepared to justify present shortcomings in the light of something that happened 10 or 15 years ago. The circumstances that obtained in 1948 or 1949 were entirely different from those of the present time. Ten years ago we were just overcoming the difficulties that a war had imposed upon us. We had been reestablishing in civilian life those who had served in the forces, and we had transformed the economy by changing its basis from a wartime one to a peacetime one. How was it possible for us at that time, with such major problems on our hands, to apply ourselves to the provision of suitable housing? The honorable member for Balaclava did not do justice to the subject under discussion when he was prepared to address himself to it in that way.Although the number of unemployed in the community may be regarded as being relatively small, it is greater than it ought to be. We must try to ensure that every man and woman who is capable of rendering a useful service to the community is employed upon activities that are essential to our life and advancement. To do anything less than that is to fail to play our part in establishing those conditions of life that are essential to the successful assimilation of migrants.We must find a solution to not only the problem of providing adequate housing but also the problem of providing suitable school buildings. As the Minister knows, even in South Australia there is a great number of temporary school buildings, and I have no doubt that similar conditions obtain in other parts of Australia. Children are accommodated in school corridors. That is not satisfactory. We are capable of providing something better, but we must apply ourselves to it. If our economy is to be based on the kind of outlook that was outlined to us to-night, I am afraid there is no immediate prospect of our being able to provide the facilities that I have mentioned. If the policy that has been announced by the Government to-night is to be followed, we will soon be facing conditions of hardship. Therefore, the intention of the Government to bring to this country the same number of migrants that were brought out during the last financial year should be reviewed.I am very appreciative of the part that has been played by the overwhelming majority of migrants in the development of our community life. That remark applies particularly to the new satellite town of Elizabeth, which is situated in my electorate. Many British migrants have been settled in that area, and they are making a magnificent contribution to the establishment of that community. Among those who have come to our country I know of no better citizens than those I have just mentioned. They bring with them the abilities of the technician. They have the skill of the tradesman. They are willing to give of their professional and technical knowledge in a way that will develop this country and improve our way of life. Many industries are now being established at Elizabeth and I hope that many more will be able to get under way.However, I feel that in other parts of the Commonwealth the immigration programme has not proved so helpful. Our intake of new settlers must be related to our economy. If the Minister recognizes that fact, we shall be able to provide better opportunities for those who come here. We shall be able to keep the promises that we make, and, by so doing, we shall encourage other immigrants to seek a share of the advantages that this country has to offer. I am sure that the Minister, who approaches these problems with sympathy and understanding, will recognize that immigrants are entitled to every consideration and an opportunity to direct their efforts towards improving conditions in this country.I am pleased that the Minister deals with these problems with humanity and tolerance. We are dealing with human beings. We are dealing with people who require the help, the care, and the protection of a government. Without that assistance, circumstances could imperil their prospects in this country. These people are likely to be very bitter if they are faced with unsatisfactory conditions on their arrival here.I endorse the views expressed by my colleague, the honorable member for Bendigo, on migration. I have read the report of his speech with great interest and profit. I have also been helped by the speech of the honorable member for Yarra. The views expressed by those honorable gentlemen, and those expressed by the Minister, should be put into effect so that the newcomers to this country will quickly seek the honour of becoming true citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia.Debate (on motion by Mr. Anderson) adjourned.","Second Reading","MIGRATION BILL 1958","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[25]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It also provided for consultations on this subject to be held from July, 1955, onwards between the authorities of the two zones created by the Armistice Agreement. These elections have not yet been held. The Government of the Republic of Viet Nam (South Viet Nam) refused to enter into preparatory consultations with the Vietminh administration in the North on the grounds that conditions for free elections do not at present exist in North Viet Nam. The Government of South Viet Nam argues, with justification, that the regime in the North is Communist controlled and non-democratic, that no free elections have yet been allowed in the territory under its control (in contrast to the situation in the South), and that under its authoritarian rule all democratic freedoms are denied the people. Until this situation is remedied it is impossible for free elections to be held. It should be added that the Republic of Viet Nam was not a party to the Geneva Agreement and does not recognize any obligation springing from the agreement.","Viet Nam","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Government is very well aware of the strategic and economic importance of oil being found in Australia in commercial quantities. There has been no indication that there will be a reduction in oil search activities in Australia this year. It is true however that two of the companies who are the major shareholders in the larger companies engaged in the search for oil in Papua have indicated their intention to withdraw from the search there if encouraging results are not obtained during the next twelve months. The Commonwealth Government is watching closely to see how that situation develops. On the Australian mainland there is no sign of any decrease in the intensity of the current oil search programme. Twelve applications have been received by my department for subsidy under the Petroleum Search Subsidy Act 1957 in respect of drilling to take place in the last half of 1958. Under that act the Government may subsidize up to half the cost of holes drilled for stratigraphic information at approved sites. Drilling operations on locations which have been approved by the Minister for National Development under the act in respect of the current six months ending 30th June are in progress at Puri (Australian Petroleum Company Proprietary Limited) and Pimba (Clarence River Basin Oil Exploration Non-liability). Two others have been completed, at Karumba (Associated Australian Oilfields Non-liability) and at Samphire Marsh (West Australian Petroleum Proprietary Limited). One other has been abandoned at Kaufana (Papuan Apinaipi Petroleum Company Limited).

Only part of the moneys so credited is available for re-lending to building societies and other institutions because repayments of principal and interest payable by the State to the Commonwealth must be debited against the account.

Therefore, repayments each year from the building societies and other institutions to the State should exceed repayments by the State to the Commonwealth.The arrangements made in relation to the Home Builders Account are not adaptable to war service homes. Repayments received by the War Service Homes Division are by law credited to the National Debt Sinking Fund. If, instead, the moneys were used for re-lending to provide second assistance to persons previously assisted under the War Service Homes Act there would be no reimbursement of Commonwealth finances in respect of advances made under the act. The Government would have to take this factor into account in determining the future level of funds it could supply for war service homes. The Government has provided funds for war service homes each year to the maximum extent possible from the total available for distribution. The sympathetic approach to war service homes is evidenced by the allocation of the record sum of £35,000,000 during 1957-58. If it were possible to increase the war service homes funds in any way Government policy would, in present circumstances, be directed towards assisting those applicants who have not previously been assisted and who have to wait lengthy periods for war service homes funds.","War Service Homes","N/A","/hansard/answers.to.questions/subdebate.1[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
