I ask for some support from you because this is a most important document. I have not been given access to it. I ask why this very important report was not dealt with by way of a ministerial statement in the normal way, with the shadow Minister being given the courtesy of several hours notice and the ability to reply to it. If it is too late to do that now, perhaps I might receive an assurance from the Government and from the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that we will receive within the next several weeks before Parliament rises, no doubt for an early election, an adequate chance to debate this very important report.
