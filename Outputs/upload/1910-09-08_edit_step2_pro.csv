I believe there was some communication with the Opposition as to the desirability of passing the Works Estimates as soon as possible, but no one could have imagined, unless behind the scenes, that it was intended to pass the Estimates at the same sitting during which the Budget Speech had been delivered. Personally, I never heard of such haste, and I see no necessity for it. It is not fair to members, either on the Ministerial side or the Opposition side, that they should be asked to deal with such important matters without opportunity for consideration. These Estimates, which were only introduced at midday yesterday, express the intentions of the Government in regard to the whole financial policy, so far as works and buildings and naval construction are concerned-; and I think the Treasurer will admit that we have not been treated quite fairly.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I could well understand the desire to have a commencement made, but to force the Estimates through by means of an all-night sitting is not reasonable. Necessity, of course, knows no law, but, as I say, I see no necessity in the present case. These Estimates deal with between£2,000,000 and £3.000,000, and there are several items about which full explanation ought to be given. Personally, I take no exception to most of these items on their merits, but, at the same time, I should like to know all about them. For instance, provision is made for£10,000 for a Military College, £50,000 for the Federal Capital, £850,000 for naval construction, £50,000 for uniforms, and £15,000 for wireless telegraphy ; and in regard to all of those items full information ought to be forthcoming. The procedure adopted by the Government on the present occasion is unprecedented in any Parliament of which I have knowledge. We are not near the end of the session, and a days delay would not have mattered. Although the Treasurer may have a submissive and docile majority-","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
96,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"WISE, George","L1P","N/A","N/A","N/A",2836,"- They were not very docile last night !SirJOHN FORREST.- That is not a reason why honorable members should be kept up all night. I cannot understand the cracking of the whip which has occurred. The action of the Government was without precedent. Many honorable members will recollect that the procedure of passing the Works and Buildings Estimates before the Estimates for the ordinary services of the year was first proposed in 1905. Until then it had been customary to deal with the ordinary Estimates before considering the Works and Buildings Estimates, which, of course, meant several months delay in carrying out public works. I, as Treasurer, proposed the course that is now followed, but it was met with a storm of disapprobation, Sir George Turner, who had been Treasurer for many years, objecting strongly to it. Eventually, it was agreed to postpone the consideration of the Works and Buildings Estimates until the first item of the ordinary Estimates had been passed. That procedure was followed thereafter, until last year, when the debate on the first item of the ordinary Estimates was very protracted, owing to the prolonged opposition of the party now in power. Finally, some weeks after the introduction of the Budget, the postponement of the discussion was agreed to, and the Works and Buildings Estimates were dealt with. I do not object to the Government getting these Estimates passed as soon as they can, but honorable members should have been given an opportunity to study them, and should not have been asked to sit up all night and forced to pass them at one sitting.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/interjection[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The complaint seemed justified, and I agreed to give a vote for the postponement of the work until honorable members, and especially new members, had had time to consider the whole question. I had no desire to prevent the carrying out of the Federal compact, but I told my constituents that, although I had supported the Yass-Canberra site as the best available after Tumut, I would not be a party to extravagant or hasty and ill-advised expenditure upon it. I felt that any expenditure should be in pursuance of a well-considered scheme. The proposal before us last night did not indicate adequate and sufficient consideration to justify us in passing it so hurriedly. Honorable members were entitled to fuller information, and to a guarantee that the money would not be frittered away. It was for that reason that I voted as I did. reserving to myself the right, should fuller information be given later, to support the Governments proposals. My vote last night was a protest against unnecessary haste, and the rushing through of the matter before honorable members had had time to consider the question generally.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Minister of Home Affairs knows what assistance the United States bureau has rendered to the farmers, orchardists, and rural workers of that country. In Tasmania, farmers have been saved hundreds of pounds in the past by heeding the timely forecasts issued by Mr. Wragge, when meteorologist for Queensland, and abstaining from harvesting when storms were predicted. The Meteorological Bureau, however, cannot do its work efficiently without the co-operation of the Postmaster-Generals Department. I asked the other day whether steps had been taken to have rainfall records published at important stations throughout Australia, and the honorable member for Calare asked a similar question. It was hoped that the Meteorological Bureau would assist persons travelling, or desiring to travel stock in large States like New South Wales and Queensland, by giving them the latest rainfall records for the various districts which they might wish to go through, thus preventing much loss of stock, and the suffering of dumb animals. I was informed, however, that the Post and Telegraph Department cannot make arrangements for the transmission of the necessary messages. In districts like Capricornia and Maranoa there are many large centres where weather information would be very useful, and it should be possible to transmit it from Rockhampton. The other telegraph work in that part of the Commonwealth cannot be very heavy. What 1 suggest is some system of decentralization.. Probably it would be sufficient to telegraph to different centres the reports for the districts lying round about them. In the United States, even the railways are used to signal the coming of storms and weather changes. I suggest that the Minister should get a report from the Meteorologist as to how the difficulties which have been complained of can be met. I take this action on my own initiative, without ascertaining the opinions of the Meteorologist. As I was responsible for the introduction of the Meteorological Act, and for the establishment of the bureau, I naturally take an interest in the subject, and wish the Department to be a real, practical, business concern. Queensland representatives know how well organized the weather services of that State were before Federation, and how accurate were its records. I do not think that the Minister will find the difficulties in the way of the publication of weather information insuperable. If it be necessary to remove them, to increase facilities for telegraphing, let that be done. I have some doubt as to whether the number of stations is sufficient and the publicity given to the information obtained altogether adequate. Having regard to the area of the Commonwealth, insufficient information is supplied. If we had a larger number of stations at which records were taken and made public, great good would be done. I wish also to ask the Minister to what extent Voluntary efforts are being made to assist the Department? Tn England a host of persons co-operate with the Department in making records and furnishing returns.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is most important that correct information regarding the rainfall all ^ over Australia should be recorded. Up to the time of the establishment of the Bureau the work had been of a fragmentary character, and what we now need is a complete and thorough system. Honorable members will recognise how important it is that men who are asked to go on the land should have in advance specific information as to the exact rainfall in the districts where they propose to settle. Another point on which I desire to seek information is the extent to which the Meteorological Department is attempting- to educate the young people of our schools in regard to the importance of meteorology. In the 1907 report of the Department of Agriculture of the United States of America there is art interesting article showing what is being done there in that direction. I understand that pictures indicating the cloud formations have been distributed over a fairly wide area in Australia, and the teachers in some schools have been assisting in meteorological matters, but I should like the Department to make an effort to reach the secondary schools, and more particularly the agricultural colleges, with a view to seeing that instruction is given as to the correct recording of temperatures and rainfalls, so that our young men who are ultimately to settle on the land will have some idea of the value and importance of meteorology.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

104,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BROWN, Thomas","JSM","Calare","N/A","N/A",2838,". - I wish to emphasize the importance of the matter to which the honorable member for Darling Downs has referred in regard to the distribution of meteorological information. In New South Wales, prior to Federation, some attention was given to the subject, and the more important towns in pastoral and agricultural centres were supplied every day with a report as to the rainfall, also with a general weather forecast. That system was gradually being extended, towns, as they grew in importance, being placed on the list of those to be supplied with such information. In addition, similar information with regard to country districts was transmitted to Sydney, and was shown on a chart on daily exhibition at the General Post Office. That information was of value to both country and city men. Dealings in stock and grain are materially affected by weather conditions, and this prompt supply of accurate information is of much concern to commercial interests as well as to the men upon the land. Since the Commonwealth has taken over the work of the Meteorological Department, however, progress in this direction appears to have been arrested Difficulties are experienced in getting new centres added to the list of towns in respect of which information is to be given on the weather chart at the General Post Office. At the outset it was difficult to ascertain where the trouble arose. For the last four years I have had prominently before me the case of the citizens of Peak Hill, who desire that information as to that important centre in New South Wales shall be supplied and shown on the chart. Their application has invariably been refused. In the first place the objection was that there was no room for such information, but when the Progress Association of Peak Hill, through me, offered to pay the expense of enlarging the chart, the Department shifted its ground. It then said that a number of centres had been selected as being of a representative character, and the information shown on the chart in respect of places 40 or 50 miles away from Peak Hill was considered to be sufficient to meet the requirements of that town. Such information does not appeal to country or city interests. The average city man examines the chart to obtain information as to a particular district, and if he cannot find it he does not think of examining the returns relating to centres 40 or 50 miles away. Such a lack of information, therefore, is detrimental to the centres concerned. The average man either assumes, where there is an absence of such information, that the district concerned is of insufficient importance to warrant its being given, or that it is considered that if it were supplied it would be detrimental to its interests. After a further investigation, I ascertained that the Department of Home Affairs, which controls the sub-department of Meteorology, cannot obtain this information except with the cooperation of the Post and Telegraph Department, and that the plea of the last-named Department is that its lines are so congested, and the number of its officers in New South Wales so limited, that it would be impossible to afford increased knowledge of meteorological conditions without withholding more important information. If that is a correct statement of the position - if it is purely a question of the ability of the Post and Telegraph Department to deal with the work - then I hope that the Government will take the matter into their early consideration, for this is one of the big reforms necessary in the near future. It is a matter of great importance to country districts. We wish to fill the waste spaces of Australia, and hope that legislation now before us will help materially to that end. Anything that will assist us in that direction ought to be encouraged ; and I maintain that, by supplying this information, we shall materially help the man on the land to obtain the best results from his labour, and assist the commercial man to a better appreciation of his conditions. In New South Wales the public school teachers, without cost to the Commonwealth, except in respect of the necessary weather gauges, are prepared to make observations, to tabulate the information obtained and to place it at the disposal of the Department. The same statement will apply to country police stations and post-offices, but all these channels of information are not being utilized as they ought to be. I have put before the Department several applications which have been refused on the score, either that the Department does not require the information, or that it cannot bear the small cost involved in supplying the necessary instruments. This is a departmental matter, apart altogether from the transmission of telegrams. In that direction, as well as in the more important one of bringing the information before the public, the Minister might do something substantial to render his Department valuable to the men upon the land, and to the commercial interests of the community. It is with great pleasure that I join with the honorable member for Darling Downs in urging the Government to take action in this matter.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I speak with considerable diffidence, because I do not know what has previously been the practice when the Estimates have been submitted. I consider that on this occasion, whether a precedent already created is being followed, or a new one is being adopted, we are drifting into an exceedingly bad practice. We have been dealing with an expenditure of no less than £2.324,496, and we have been compressing the consideration of the many big questions involved in it into several hours, through a long and weary night. Yesterday the Prime Minister delivered his Budget Speech, a subject which, in most Parliaments, is considered big enough for the consideration of honorable members for the one day. Bur, immediately following on that, these Estimates were presented for the consideration of the House, with the most meagre explanation.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We have now under consideration a Bill for the appropriation of more than two and a quarter millions of money, and the consideration of that expenditure has been absolutely insufficient, because the information laid before honorable members has been entirely inadequate. If we had had sufficient information as to the items for which the Bill makes provision, they might have had proper consideration from honorable members. But the Government attempted an impossibility if they honestly intended to get their Works Estimates through the House in a satisfactory manner in one nights sitting, because many debatable questions were raised in the consideration of the expenditure, and particularly the question of the Federal Capital. Surely the Government know that that question afforded material for debate for a night and a day, if not for two or three days, and possibly it would have taken that time had not physical exhaustion terminated the debate earlier. There is another matter requiring a protest to be made. I do not know whether any previous Government has been responsible for the same offence, because I submit that it is a real offence to submit limited sums on the Estimates, involving enormous subsequent expenditure, anr] also big questions of policy. In that connexion I refer first of all to the provision made in this Bill for certain works to be done at the Federal Capital. No policy has been submitted by the Government, and no details have been given as to the next steps they propose to take in the creation and equipment of a Federal city. We ought to have a full and comprehensive statement of policy before we are asked to commit ourselves to a public expenditure such as that. In many details I absolutely refuse to be bound by last nights proceedings. I do not believe in involving this country at once in a big expenditure for the creation and equipment of a Federal city, much as I desire to sec such a city as was depicted by my enthusiastic friend, the Minister of Home Affairs. We can wait awhile before we undertake that work. We ought to provide for other utilitarian requirements of -the Commonwealth before we commit ourselves to any big expenditure in that direction.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

One honorable member wanted to know why I did not make a protest then. I waited for hours to make a protest, but between a certain section of this House on one side of the Federal Capital question, and a certain section on the other, I could do nothing but sit down and listen and admire the enthusiasm displayed, and entertainment afforded, through the night. Another point of which I very strongly disapprove is the getting in of some of these big questions by a side wind. One item for which provision is made in this BiH is £5,000 for the construction of the Western Australian railway. I have no objection to raise to that, because I am a supporter of a through railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie; but I protest, in the interests of safe and sound finance, against the Government committing the House to that railway by the appropriation of £5,000. Those honorable members who assisted last night in passing that sum gave their adherence to the railway proposal, because it was indicated in a note at the foot of the page that the total estimated cost of the work was £3,988,000. Therefore, the House last night, by approving a preliminary vote, which indicated in plain terms what the total cost of the railway would be, gave its approval to the whole undertaking.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I refer to the coast from Strahan to Port Davey, Tasmania, which would appear to be ill-starred, having regard to the number of serious wrecks there during recent years. This is a most barren part of our coast-line, and sailors who ply their calling there certainly deserve some provision for their safety. Some months ago a deputation from Tasmania waited on the Postmaster-General, who, I understand, gave an assurance that he would take certain steps if the State Government would comply with certain stipulations. The State Government, I am informed, have intimated by letter to the Government that they are willing to perform their part, but, so far, no move has been made by the Postmaster-General. For some weeks past I have asked questions on the point, but I have only been asked to give notice, and then the matter seemed to be shelved. If the Postmaster -General, since receiving that deputation, has altered his mind, or has some better scheme in view, we should know the facts. At any rate, I cannot let this opportunity pass without emphasizing the need there is for some action on the part of the Government.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We have had no time to consider the items in this Bill, otherwise we might have helped the Government greatly. As a matter of fact, great assistance has been given to the Government by the honorable member for Darling Downs and others in the matter of weather telegrams. I shall be very glad if the Government could see their way to adopt the system of telegrams of this description which was in vogue in Queensland prior to Federation. I remember well trying to persuade the Federal Government to secure the services of Mr. Clement Wragge, in order that he might continue his meteorological observations for the benefit of Australia as a whole. Mr. Wragges forecasts were always regarded with a great deal of attention by ship captains and others; and I wrote to the Australasian United Steam Navigation Company, the Union Steam-ship Company of New Zealand Limited, the Adelaide Steam-ship Company, and Howard Smith and Company, asking for testimonials on his behalf. To that appeal, however, the answer I received was that, so far from the shipping companies considering his services of any benefit, they found that the forecasts were the means of preventing a good many people travelling by their steam ships. We all know, however, that the vessels of these companies are well insured, and that it does not matter to their owners even if storms arise and disaster follows. The travelling public take a very different view, and to reliable forecasts like those of Mr. Wragge they always pay close attention. Although) meteorology is not yet regarded as an exact science, Mr. Wragges opinion is that it very soon will be; and I shall welcome the time when the Commonwealth will frank weather telegrams. In the Capricornia district great danger to life and damage to property occur owing to the absence of such warnings. At present, telegrams relating to floods must be paid for at urgent rates if they are to take precedence, although we know that in the absence of any warning, the waters cause great damage in the settled districts.. Surely this is a matter deserving of some consideration. If the Prime Minister desires to go to South Africa by a certain date, let him go ; but I do not see any necessity for rushing the business through.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Honorable members opposite complain, rather late in the day, of the provision of £5,000 for the purposes of a transcontinental railway. I have never yet been able to satisfy myself that the time has arrived for such a railway as that from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, although, when a member of the Senate, I informed myself pretty extensively on the subject. This line will cost anything from £3,000,000 to £5,000,000, and, so far as I can see, the only people who will travel on it, for some time, at any rate, will be politicians and commercial travellers. We realize that, as soon as this line is constructed, the shipping companies will reduce their rates; and, if the fares on the railway are to be sufficiently high to make the line pay, the public will certainly travel by sea. What prompts my opposition to any immediate pledge for the construction of such a line is that the working classes of Australia, for the most part, will have to make up the deficit; and that I regard as most unjust.It is said that a transcontinental line should be constructed for the purposes of defence; but anybody who has paid attention to the question knows that there is nothing in that argument. No doubt the line will have to be constructed in time; but I am of opinion that we should not build it yet. The Prime Minister said this afternoon that the item in the schedule does not commit us to the policy of constructing the line, the £5,000 asked for being merely to pay for the preparation of information. The legislation dealing with this railway has been got through Parliament by a series of moves resembling those on a chess-board. A letter was obtained from the late Sir Frederick Holder, stating that, in his opinion, the line should be built, and that was held to be a pledge on the part of Australia as a whole to construct the line if Western Australia would federate with the other States. By little and little the supporters of the proposal advanced, until a survey of the route was sanctioned. That survey having been made, steps have been taken to pledge the Parliament to the construction of the line. The item in the schedule reads -Trans-continental Railway from Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, to Port Augusta, South Australia - Towards cost of construction,£5,000.We should be told definitely whether the money is required to pay part of the cost of constructing the line, or merely to pay for the preparation of information. If any of the works authorized by this measure are unnecessary, or unduly costly, I, for one, shall disclaim responsibility, because of the way in which the schedule has been rushed through. Ministers should not regard criticism as offered in any personal spirit. Past Administrations have generally been ruled by one man. assisted by a few personal friends, who has dictated the policy of the country, and Parliament has had to accept what he offered. But now that we have an elected Government, Ministers should give the House the best of their thought and ability, and not take offence when suggestions are offered, or objections made, in regard to their proposals.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I hope that we shall adopt a more businesslike method of dealing with the Estimates. Let us first of all conclude the Budget debate, and then proceed steadily with the consideration of the Estimates, instead of attempting, as was done yesterday, to rush them through at one sitting. We sat until 8 oclock this morning owing to the effort of the Government to bludgeon the Works and Buildings Estimates through Committee, and in the very schedule to this Bill there are items which have committed the Parliament to entirely new departures. More especially is that the position with respect to the Department of Defence, and there is practically no explanation of these Estimates. I would remind the honorable member for Capricornia that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition remained here until 8 oclock this morning, not only seeking information, but very often supplying it when it might well have been forthcoming from a different source. Those who left for their homes at an early hour last night cannot afford to attack others who remained behind and endeavoured to elicit from Ministers information with reference to the Works and Buildings Estimates.

There the son of a millionaire receives the same salary, and wears the same uniform, as the son of a poor man, and is distinguished from his compeers only according to his ability to pass the examinations. Major-Genera} Hoad has presented a splendid report with regard to the work done at West Point, and I hope that in connexion with the Military College of Australia we shall have none of those distinctions, as between man and man, which unfortunately obtain at the present time amongst officers of our forces. I trust that in the Naval Training School a similar system will be observed ; and in this connexion I wish to enter my protest against any man who enters the Naval Department being liable to be sent on service beyond Australia. I as an Australian, loving my country, object to any naval man being sent from this continent without his consent; and I think that in that respect I have the support of the majority of the Ministry. With respect to the question of the Federal Capital, I certainly regret that there has been, seemingly, undue haste in arriving at a decision. I shall always be loyal to the provision inserted in the Constitution, as the result of a fair compromise, that the Capital should be in New South Wales ; but I object to the establishment of the Capital on a site where an adequate water supply can be obtained only by pumping. I should care not if the site chosen were a barren waste, provided the climate were healthy and the water supply abundant. We are only on the fringe of scientific discoveries, and a genius of chemical analyses may yet discover a formula whereby a granite hill may be made as productive as a rich alluvial flat. The Minister of Home Affairs will not deny that at Yass-Canberra the water supply will have to be pumped 800 feet, and I have yet to learn of any great city that labours under such a disadvantage. Shall I remind honorable members of the elder Rome with its seven aqueducts? Only three of those aqueducts remain ; nevertheless Rome stands to-day pre-eminently first amongst all the European capitals in the matter of its water supply. A gravitation system is in operation there, as well as in New York, and when the splendid waters of one of the lochs of Scotland were tapped for the benefit of Glasgow, the supply was also obtained by a gravitation scheme. Who can say what are the potentialities of electricity ? We are looking, as it were, through the mystic glass of the what-may-be, and no one can prophesy what are the possibilities of the Dalgety district, having regard to its magnificent water supply. In Australia the death rate is lower than that of any other country. Dr. Bell, the inventor of the telephone, expressed surprise that Brisbane, with its lack of sanitary arrangements, should have so low a death rate. Perhaps he failed to make fair allowance for the fact that this continent has been inhabited by white races for a comparatively short period, and for the great stretch of plain country over which the wind blows.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

No one will say that Yass-Canberra is the best site in New South Wales that could be selected for the Federal Capital. Although I have the privilege of representing the constituency in which the Parliament House is situated, no one will be happier than I shall be when we have made a final selection of a site, and have established ourselves in pur new home. I hope then that our political life will be what it ought to be - that we shall work in the day-time, and, if necessary, limit the speeches of honorable members to half-hour periods. We should never descend to the absurdity of all-night sittings. During such sittings honorable members grow weary and angry, and scenes occur which, upon reflection, are always deeply regretted. I do not wish to see the establishment of the Capital delayed, because I am on the shady side of fifty, and am very anxious to witness the experiment of a new land tenure. We have had a splendid illustration of what may be done in that respect in Norfolk Island, but what has been done there will fail altogether in comparison with that which we hope to do in the way of a new land system in the Federal territory. I hope that, in laying out the Capital, we shall benefit by the experience of the United States. The great French genius who laid out Washington had his heart broken by the unfair criticism of his compeers ; but those who visit that city to-day can see what that genius foresaw when he planned it. I trust that we shall avoid the faults of Washington, and that we shall not sell a foot of land in the Federal Capital. In that respect we ought to follow the example of Hong Kong - which, in the extent of its tonnage, rivals London as a shipping port - where there is no private ownership of land save in regard to a few allotments. I look forward to the creation of a city that will dominate the continent, but I certainly object to the selection of a site where the water will have to be pumped to a height of 800 feet. The Federal Capital, I sincerely hope, will be an example to the rest of the world, and will be free from the brand of pauperism. On the question of the transcontinental railway, let me quote the following passage that appeared in the Melbourne Age of 10th July, 1902 -Society has no system by which the thousands of men whom it has to feed in enforced idleness can be utilized in such ways as will give back a return for the revenue expended, so the eternal question revives itself every year, and we have to listen to the wail of women and children and the curses of unemployed men.If, therefore, a railway appeals to the House as necessary and justified, I am willing to give my vote for it, but I do object to go to the money-lender. The remark made by the Age was repeated by the Premier of New South Wales in September, 1904, in answer to a deputation representing a large number of practically starving men. That gentleman said -There was plenty of work that might well be given to them, but there was nothing to pay them with. They were in their present position because they had run out of their capital, and the country was in the same position as they were. It had reached a condition when it was not able to buy all the labour that was available. Circumstances compelled him to go steadily. At the first blush they might say, 11 Oh, you have got ^12,000,000 a year revenue, but that was already hypothecated. It had to be expended in paying interest on loans and in carrying on the business of the Stale.I propose to show the House how that railway can be built without the curse of interest being saddled on us. I stated in the Legislative Assembly some time ago that Victoria had borrowed over £50,000,000, had paid to the moneylenders in Europe over £53,000,000, and still owed £50,000,000. That arose through the curse of interest. If there is a way of building this line without paying interest, surely the House should consider it. One concrete example is worth an ocean of talk, so I shall give the example of what was done by the island of Guernsey. As early as 1726, it was desired to put up municipal market buildings in St. Peters, the capital of the island, but in those days it was a little more difficult to borrow in London, and the matter dropped. It was not until 1822, or nearly 100 years afterwards, that the genius of Governor De Lisle Brock hit on an expedient. He asked the citizens of Guernsey why they did not build the place for themselves, seeing that they had bricklayers, carpenters, and other tradesmen among their numbers. A meeting of citizens was called, and it was agreed to issue a sum of £4,000 in what were known as market-house scrip notes. The contractor and workmen agreed to take them, and the townspeople to accept them as currency, backed up by the whole of the island. The buildings were erected for that sum, the land belonged to the community, the eighty stalls were immediately let, and a rental of over £500 a year was obtained. A holiday was made once in the year when the whole of the notes that had been returned in payment of the rates and taxes pertaining to the market buildings were publicly burnt. Before ten years were over every one of those notes had been cancelled. The debt had been liquidated, and the island had a property perpetually producing rent to the extent of £500 a year. Why cannot we apply that principle to this railway? I note that the total estimated cost of the line is £3,988,000, or in round figures £4,000.000. I would suggest, to liquidate that sum, a note issue on quite a different basis from the one we were recently discussing. I suggest that it should not be redeemable in gold, but every penny of it ought to be spent on the permanent way, the rails, the rolling-stock, and the station buildings. Those £4,000,000 notes would be sent out, not bearing a penny of interest. It may be a long time in the life of a human being, but it will be short in the life of a State, before the returns from the railway come in. I take it that the Government would ask the States to guarantee the working expenses. Supposing that the net profit over working expenses was only £5,000 per annum, those 5,000 notes, being received in payment for the rates, fares and freights of the railway, would be cancelled, because each of the currency notes for the £4,000,000 would be ear-marked for that line alone. They would be guaranteed by the rolling-stock and permanent way and railway stations of the line, and backed by the whole weight of the Commonwealth. Whether by fair or foul means the history of that Guernsey experiment has been removed from nearly every public library, and but for the action of the Americans in seeking the information, I am afraid it would have been entirely lost to the world. The Government of the day would direct that the notes should be utilized only in the building of the railway. The sooner the railway began to pay, the more quickly would the notes be withdrawn and destroyed. Ultimately we. should have a paying railway without it having cost id. in interest, and without the Commonwealth having had to borrow a single pound. Had the railway between Melbourne and Sydney been constructed in. that way, what huge sums in interest would, have been saved ! I believe that this idea, which comes from the blended French and! English race inhabiting the Channel Islands, has come to stay. I hope it will be adopted in Australia, and that the seed I am endeavouring to plant will grow into a big tree, of which this great Commonwealth will enjoy the fruits.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We are entitled to a formal and complete statement of policy in this matter, but we have not been told, except in the barest outlines, how the money is to be spent. I understand that the Minister for Home Affairs proposes to offer prizes amounting to £5,000 for designs for the Capital. We should be told what is to be done in the calling for designs. I wish to know whether it is proposed to call for designs of buildings, or for designs of the manner in which the streets, promenades, or reserves are to be laid out. Then, again, are the designs to be restricted to the site of the Capital itself, or is anything to be done with reference to the Federal territory adjacent to or forming part of the whole of the Capital city scheme? The Minister ought to have given us more information under this heading. As a matter of business and of practical arrangement, the Government ought to call for competitive plans dealing, first of all, with the laying out of the streets and promenades and the proposed situation of public buildings in the city itself. That, however, is only a preliminary portion of the work, and the designing of the buildings ought to be a completely separate matter. Equally important is the matter of the exploring or setting out of the various parts of the territory that should be associated with the central portion. The Minister proposes to expend £13,000 on surveys, and the Committee is entitled to some explanation of the surveys to be undertaken. I understand that a considerable amount of survey work has been done, and we ought to know what yet remains to be carried out. Then we find that £4,000 is to be expended on afforestation. That is certainly an important item, but we have no information as to the principle or the plan to be adopted. Before any money is spent under that heading, the Department ought to secure the best professional advice available in Australia for its guidance. There is also a proposed expenditure of £22,000 on roads, bridges, and railways, and the Committee should be supplied with information as to who is advising the Department in respect to those works. Another item relates to an expenditure of £6,000 for freehold property. What freehold property is to be acquired, and for what purpose? The Minister ought to have submitted a complete statement showing the order in which all this work is to be carried out. The Committee is entitled to an assurance that the Department of Home Affairs, in laying the foundations of the Federal territory, is acting on reliable professional advice. It should have the advice of a Board of engineers and architects charged with the duty of making preliminary surveys and submitting preliminary recommendations. The Department, first of all, should receive advice as to what land ought to be reserved as forest areas, and as to roads, railways, and bridges that need to be constructed. We ought to be assured that none of this money will be spent on an ill-digested or ill-advised scheme.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I understand that the leasing principle, with periodical re-valuations, will be adopted ; and if the land is to be leased in such a way as to encourage expenditure on the part of the public, the rents must be very small for some years to come, because the lower the rents the greater will be the inducement for expenditure on improvements. I also wish the Minister to let us know exactly what it costs to administer the affairs of the Commonwealth in Melbourne. I refer, more particularly, to the cost of leasing, for Federal purposes, buildings which will be no longer necessary when the Parliament is transferred to the Federal Capital.

With the conflicting evidence of the New South Welshmen on the one side, and that of the Victorians on the other, I find it difficult to know what is the correct and patriotic thing to do. 1 am almost entirely in the dark, and I find that, in seeking to get light, as I did last night, confusion becomes more confounded.

It is unwise to leave such matters entirely in the hands of officers. We have a Works Committee in connexion with the Parliament of New South Wales. That Committee takes evidence with respect to the construction of public buildings and other undertakings, where the estimated cost exceeds a certain sum, and it has saved the State hundreds of thousands of pounds. If we are now to enter upon the work of building the Federal Capital, I think that we should have such a Committee of this House, and that it would prove a safeguard against any rash or unnecessary expenditure.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We cannot have a better supply than the horses which are used in the very districts in which they have been accustomed to work. Those accustomed to horses know how difficult it is at times to get them to -work to advantage in districts other than those to which they are used. Thus a horse which is valuable in sticky country would not be of very much use in sandy country. Gippsland horses are fitted for quite different purposes from the horses grown in the northern and north-western parts of Victoria. It is a matter of use, which descends from generation to generation. The Government would do well to pause before they decide to give up a system which has only recently been brought into vogue, and has been found to work admirably. Military officers, like the members of every other Department, wish to be as far as possible self-contained in all that they require, and I go a long distance with them in that desire; but we can pay a little too much at times to carry out the principle. I ask the Minister. to make further inquiry as to the success that attended the efforts of previous Governments to obtain from the agriculturists the necessary haulage power for the camps. 1 am in hearty accord with the breeding proposal. I believe, that from a business point of view alone, the project can be made a really good thing for the Government. It has been said that £30 a head would be necessary to procure suitable horses for military work, but if the price is limited to that, a very inferior class of animal, not to be depended upon, will be obtained. We must remember that we are using these animals as an adjunct to a work upon which men s lives are depending. It would be like sending men to sea in a coffin ship to send men out upon active service with inferior horses. The Government will make a very good departure from past methods if they lay down on safe lines a system of breeding the horses required, not only for the military service, but for various portions of our other Departments, With regard to the money which has been voted for the Capital site question, when the item is passed by this Committee it will absolutely pledge the House to the site which has been selected.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[19]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

After all, I feel sure that the benefit of having the Capital within a State has been very much over-estimated, because there will not be that tremendous addition to material wealth that a great many have anticipated. We all know the circumstances under which the arrangement was made; and, as I have already indicated, I opposed it at the time as strongly as any one could personally. This was one of the few blots on the Bill submitted to the people. It was not, however, placed in the Constitution by the Convention, but was agreed upon at a subsequent meeting of Premiers, who adopted it in order to make the Bill more acceptable to the people of New South Wales. The Government have made up their minds as to the attitude they are going to adopt, as the Minister of Home Affairs has said they are going  straight on. I do not quarrel with the Government for adopting that attitude; but I sincerely regret that the exigencies of our governmental system should make it absolutely necessary for the Cabinet to be united on a question of the sort. If Ministers were free to exercise their individual feeling, we should have a very different statement to the Committee as to the amount proposed to be expended. Of course, we cannot alter the position; and I can only appeal to the Minister. We know that on more than one occasion he has shown that he is capable of looking into the future and exercising caution in matters of expenditure. We realize that he regards many questions from a wide Australian, if not an Imperial, view ; but I urge on him not to open too wide the coffers of the States and spend money which, in a few years, may be found to have been misspent in the sense that it will have been sunk in buildings and improvements which can be of very little value if it be decided, as I believe it will, by the people to make an alteration. I hope the Government will not think that I have occupied an undue amount of time ; but, like themselves, I have a mandate from my. electors. I was questioned on this matter at almost every meeting I addressed, and the feeling throughout the electorate is very strongly in favour of an alteration of the determination arrived at by the last Parliament. I have discharged what I have conceived to be a duty to them and to the rest of Australia, in urging on the Government, even at this the eleventh hour, the necessity for further investigation, as to the possibility of securing a much better site for the future Seat of Government. If the Government find, as they declare they have found, it to be absolutely necessary to go on with the work, I hope they will exercise the utmost economy, and not enter into expenditure which, in the future, may have the effect which I have ventured to say they would be the last to desire, namely, that of thwarting the will of the people. If there is one thing which the Government and the party they represent claim, it is an earnest and constant desire to do what the majority of the people require.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[19]/continue[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It would be interesting to know how this saving of £5,000 comes about ; but evidently Ministers think that the least said the better concerning troublesome items. We had to complain foi twelve hours yesterday before the Prime Minister would tell us anything, and we got practically nothing from the Minister of Home Affairs except a statement about some trees that are to be planted. I felt inclined to move the reduction of the item by £1. As the honorable member for Laanecoorie has pointed out, although the supporters of the site say that it is the best available, they will not risk a referendum of the people of Australia, or even of the people of New South Wales, regarding it, because they know it would not be accepted. Sir George Reid told us that he did not care for the site, but that it was the best that New South Wales could get accepted by this Parliament. We know how extraordinary was the manner in which the choice was made. Yass-Canberra, we were given to understand, was an area containing three sites - the Yass, Lake George, and Canberra sites. The Lake George site was lost on the first ballot, I think, and the Canberra site secured only one vote, being finally dropped. I then asked the late Mr. Speaker Holder if it was not the case that only Yass was left, but he said that he did not know what Yass-Canberra stood for. Now, although seventy-four members refused to vote for Canberra, that is the site which has been chosen by officers about whom we know nothing. The Government have not gained much by the all-night sitting. Although the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and his lieutenants did not protest against the way in which this business has been put through, very strong protests were made this afternoon by the honorable members for Swan, Bendigo, and Wakefield, who condemned in the strongest terms the procedure which was supported by their leader.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[20]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When honest people were in their beds asleep, my honorable friends were making night hideous with their cries about the wasteful extravagance of building a Federal Capital. But we have in this modest estimate a guarantee that there is to be no extravagance. Forty-five thousand pounds with which to build the national Capital ! The magnificence and magnitude of the proposal takes away ones breath. I fancy myself viewing that stately capitol with its domes and minarets and towers rising up and piercing the blue infinite above. I fancy myself viewing the lakes of the Federal city filled with flowing waters, swans gracefully gliding over their surface, and of people crowding their pleasure boats. In the distance I see the mono-rail bringing millions of people from every quarter of the globe to behold the beauty of the Capital, and hovering over the whole scene are aeroplanes in which the people will take their pleasure. And all this for the sum of £45,000 ! I thought the Victorians did not believe in cheap things, yet here we find them afraid that this magnificent Capital is going to be too expensive. Shame upon their miserable views of what the national Capital ought to be ! It is time this nonsense ceased. My honorable friends know that there is to be no extravagance, and there will be none so long as this paltry pittance is voted for the work. This item of £45,000 is but a beginning. It is to provide for surveys and for the preparation of plans. It does not relate to the building of the Capital, and the representatives of New South Wales consider that the amount is a miserable one to place upon the Estimates now that the site has been finally determined.

With regard to the larger question of breeding our own horses for the army, the Minister promises to bring down later on a well-matured proposal. Meantime, this item of £32,000 may well be passed. It averages about £22 per horse, so that, taking all the facts into consideration, it is not an extravagant vote. I commend the Government for entering upon this scheme, and I hope that later on they will bring down a well-matured proposal for breeding our own horses for army purposes. We have at present the greatest possible difficulty in producing horses suitable for the army. There is a tremendous field in India which we might exploit to the full if we had the proper horses to send. This is an enterprise into which the Government might fitly enter, and by a well-considered scheme we might secure the  horsing of our own army for next to nothing, the idea being that we should acquire a large area, say, at Yass-Canberra, and utilize it for horse-breeding purposes.

We, therefore, have no lack of horses in Australia. Station-owners who go in for horse-breeding can always supply them, and under the present system the Government are not exposed to the risk of loss by keeping a horse-breeding station.

It looks as if we have reached a stage when they are going to dash money all round, judging by the way the Government are  bumping  everything up.

I have been unable to get a single telephone line erected since the present Government have been in office.

That sort of tiling was never allowed in New South Wales before Federation. It is productive of a feeling of insecurity and want of confidence, because people do not like their correspondence, telephone messages, and telegrams to be sent or handled by a private individual, very often a person who lives in a business establishment. My constituents are complaining that this should not be so. If we are a Federation of any importance we can surely afford to build our own post-offices, and have our own men looking after them, instead of employing people in contract offices at from about £3 to £5 a year.

There are numerous areas near Sydney eminently suitable for the purposes of the Seat of Government, and there is certainly no necessity to go into the wilderness of Yass-Canberra, than which, in my opinion, a more unsuitable spot could not have been selected. I have been over the country, and made a thorough inspection ; and I must say that I failed to see any stone or timber for building purposes, while the Cotter River is a stream of the dimensions of a main drain. New South Wales members will be wise if they endeavour to have the Capital fixed somewhere, say, on the Hawkesbury River, one of the prettiest spots in Australia, and close to Sydney Harbor, the front door of the Commonwealth. It is true that, according to the Constitution, the Capital must be beyond 100 miles from Sydney; but it is possible to alter the Constitution in this respect as in others. If there were a large inland river suitable for an extensive irrigation scheme at Yass-Canberra, something might be said for that site ; but, as. a matter of fact, the place possesses no advantage in the way of. position, land, or anything else. I feel confident that this £45,000 will be the last ever spent on Yass-Canberra as a Federal Capital site. There is no doubt that this will be made a test question at the next general election ; and I know what the opinion of the people will be. The hope of the Commonwealth ever receiving a shilling of revenue from the proposed Federal Territory is a vain one; and it is of no use to talk of experiments on this 800,000 acres, where there is really nothing to experiment upon. The place is subject to miserable droughts, and it would be hopeless to expect people to go there to reside. The Minister of Home Affairs is quite right to talk of planting trees, for, goodness knows, they are required ; only he will have to take great care to protect them from the rabbits. It would be much better, as the honorable member for Hume suggests, to spend the money in developing Australia, for there is no country in the world so much in need of it, in order to assist settlers in isolated places, where telegraphic and telephonic, and other means of communication would be much appreciated. In any case, we are very comfortable, as members of Parliament, in Melbourne; and I do not see any reason for desiring a change. I feel quite sure that the Minister of Home Affairs, hardheaded, sensible man that he is, would not spend a penny on this site if he had his own way.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[24]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In the first place, New South Wales is the empire State of the Commonwealth, and we desire to have a city that will be the Gotham of Australia. We hope that the Federal Capital, in a few years, will rival London in size, Athens in art, and Paris in beauty. Washington was built on a swamp, where, in 1799, the first President of the Republic caught a cold, and died before he got home ; but Yass-Canberra occupies one of the highest situations in New South Wales. I slept there in a tent last June, and felt in the morning that I had awakened to a new world. We propose to spend £4.000 on a nursery for Australian trees, under which the inhabitants of the place will be able to shelter. I am not sure that we shall make a railway to Queanbeyan, but we shall need a few bridges and roads, even before designs for the city are called for. The designers could not go straight out into the raw prairie. The sum of £13,000 will be spent on surveys, so that we may know where we stand.

The rich river flats of the Tooma site to which reference has been made are on the Victorian side of the Murray, and although I admired the beauty of the spot I recognised that we were up against an impossibility, since Victoria would not be likely to give away part of her territory to enable the Federal Capital to be established there.

Very often the Department will specify materials altogether unnecessary to serve the purpose for which a line is required. In some instances the producers will put up with that, but they have to contend with the still more ungenerous treatment of theDepartment in demanding a 10 per cent, guarantee. The State Governments almost without exception assist the producers by advancing money to provide facilities, for them, and in hardly any instance do they charge more than 4 per cent., or, at the very outside, 5 per cent. Yet the Postmaster-Generals Department insists in every instance that a line shall be made to pay an absolutely full return or the concession wilt not be granted. If we are to proceed on those lines we shall never vigorously develop the outlying districts of the Commonwealth. I earnestly appeal to the Government not to be generous, but to be just, in this matter, and if they are, they wilt reduce these guarantees from 10 per cent, to 5 per cent.

A fortnight ago a telegram was sent from Drake to Tenterfield, a distance of 32 miles, and it took twenty-six hours to reach its destination. It related to a case of severe illness, and upon inquiry I found that the reason for the delay was that the telegram, to reach its destination, 32 miles distant, was despatched over 370 miles to Sydney. The lines along the New England route were broken down, and the message had to be sent by train to Tenterfield. Doubtless that is only one of many instances of the kind. There we have two dead ends only 32 miles apart, and all the traffic from the rivers to the New England district has to be despatched first of all to Sydney and then back along the New England route to Tenterfield. I ask the Postmaster-General to see if it is not possible to devise some general system of linking up these dead ends throughout Australia and thus to prevent our already overloaded lines being called upon to carry a vast amount of unnecessary traffic. I should like to emphasize what the honorable member for Hume and the honorable member for Wakefield have said with regard to the treatment of back-block settlers in the matter of telephone facilities. When taking up my duties as a member nothing surprised me more than the treatment meted out to the back block settlers with regard- to telephonic communication. The Department asks from them terms which it is absolutely impossible for them to agree to. They are expected, in many instances to find a large monetary deposit, to guarantee working expenses for seven and up to ten years, and often to provide and erect the poles. It seems to me that the Department, in asking those terms, is endeavouring to choke the settlers off, because it is already overloaded with work.

With regard to the Postmaster-Generals Department, especially in the construction of telephone and telegraph lines, the present Government are, of course, not responsible for the existing system; and I hope we shall have a radical alteration. I can hardly define exactly what is meant by a contract office or a semi-official office; but it seems to me that a. contract office is very nearly a semi-official office. Some one is asked to contract to supply a postal and telegraphic office, erect the building, and manage the business.

I am not finding fault, but trying to show where improvements can be made. We want a more enterprising spirit manifested by the Department in opening up new places by telegraphs and telephones. Because a work will not pay immediately, there is no reason why it should not be carried out. It used to be thought that a railway or a road could not be built to a place unless there was a lot of people there to use it, and the same idea seems to be entertained with regard to telegraphs and telephones. They should be regarded as the great civilizers and openers-up of the country. I hope the Postmaster-General will see what he can do in that direction, and not say No to every request that it is thought will not pay from the start. I am getting tired of sending on requests for works in this Department. If there is a possibility of saying  No, we can depend upon it that the officers of the Department, acting under some instruction and coercion, will say that they regret very much that the work does not seem to be a paying concern, and that they cannot recommend it. I have told the Deputy Postmaster-General and his officers in Western Australia that they often appear to me to be very pessimistic and not enterprising ; but they have to act under an authority and are not given a free hand. The Postmaster-General should use his power by giving facilities to the people who are going out to settle in the back country, so that the Commonwealth may be made to prosper. There is a great opening for some one to so administer that big Department as to give these facilities to all the agricultural districts. It will not be done by building a little line here or there. It must be carried out on some more broad, general and comprehensive plan. There is no reason why people should have to travel miles over bad roads, when they could use a telephone wire to do their business. The system could be also made to pay. In my own electorate there are millions of acres being brought under cultivation, and very little telephonic communication in all mat country. I had it in my mind before the election, but the fates decreed otherwise, to urge upon my colleague - and I am sure he would have agreed with me - to institute, not a pettifogging plan of giving a little here and there, but some general scheme for giving telephonic and telegraphic communication to all the agricultural districts of the Commonwealth. It is done in Canada and the United States, and can be done here. We have not looked at the matter yet from the stand-point of a basis sufficiently broad. If necessary, we ought to obtain the loan of an expert from Canada or the United States to institute a proper system, which would be not only a great advantage to the people, but would also pay.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[29]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am indebted to the representative of the Minister of Defence in this Chamber for the particulars, which go to show that it is proposed to establish three State factories for the manufacture of cloth, uniforms, and harness, saddlery, and leather accoutrements. Ultimately, I understand, it is intended that these should be situated in the Federal Capital district. In the case of the woollen and harness and saddlery factories, the total number of employes engaged is to be only 150. These appear to be very small undertakings with which to make so considerable a departure as is implied. The uniform factory will, it is true, employ 800 persons, with salaries and wages approximating £40,000 per annum. The two others, however, appear very small. Whether it is wise to make a change of this kind when there are to be found any number of factories in all the States which are certainly capable of supplying all these articles is a question which Parliament would do well to consider. Without going into the general issue of the nationalization or non-nationalization of any particular industry - a question which is far too serious to be dealt with in Committee at this stage of the Estimates - I may say that if nationalization is to be undertaken, surely it ought to be in regard to something worth while in which employment in the Con> monwealth is to be extended to more than 200 or 300 persons, and for which there is some special need. We have here set down for the equipment of these three industries a sum which, taking buildings, machinery, power, and stock together, runs into nearly £80,000. That might be a considerable investment for a private person, but it is very small for a national undertaking. Nor does it appear that there are any new fields for extension in military supplies.Under the circumstances, what is there to call for, or justify, a step so serious, in which one can confidently say there will be no- saving of money, and in which there is no such extensive employment, opening up of new resources, or novelty of departure, as might under other conditions be held to demand such an advance ? I may be told that the very fact that they are on such a small scale is the one reason for undertaking them. If so, the Commonwealth will find itself saddled with a great many other business undertakings, for which precisely the same plea can be offered. In my mind, it is not anything like sufficient to justify the nationalization of an industry, or to make it worth while for the Commonwealth to put forth all its powers undertaking the many disabilities which must attend its entrance into ordinary commercial speculation, and into ordinary manufacturing undertakings. With all those difficulties, and with no prospect of any extension of those businesses worth mentioning. I am at a loss to understand the principle on which Ministers have proceeded in making a selection of these particular industries, or what expectation they have of gain to the Commonwealth as a whole. This is not the time to elaborate the matter further ; but I did not wish this particular item to pass without having invited Ministers to inform the Committee, as they have not yet informed us, of the cause which led to this relatively small expenditure, involving, however, very large responsibilities, when there is no evidence that any gain to the Commonwealth as a purchaser is likely to result.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[31]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It seems to me that these difficulties could be met by the application of ordinary business principles, requiring the delivery of orders at fixed dates, and stipulating that the quality of the articles supplied should be equal to given samples. The difficulties of which the Department complains are really not difficulties, and have to be overcome by business men every day in their commercial lives. People who have buildings to erect, ships to build, or articles to be manufactured, always fix a time within which the work must be completed, and there are heavy penalties for any breach of the conditions. It is quite open to the Government to secure the manufacture of woollens and the making of clothing by contract, with time conditions and penalties similar to those which ordinary business people provide for. I cannot understand why the Minister should allow his officers to assure him that those two conditions, which are complied with in ordinary business life, cannot be complied with in respect to Government contracts. Why should the Minister, in consequence of statements made to him by his officers, allow himself to be induced to make this departure - which the Leader of the Opposition has so properly commented upon - on such flimsy grounds ? If the Government are not desirous of entering upon these industries as Socialistic experiments, they should take the ordinary precautions practised by business people. If a person makes a contract for the manufacture of 100,000 yards of woollen cloth, it is the easiest thing in the world to call for tenders and include in them the condition that the work shall be done by a certain date. If the contractor fails to supply the goods on the date prescribed, heavy penalties could easily, and should be, insisted upon to prevent a repetition. If the question at issue be one of quality, what is more easy than to provide that the work shall be done subject to the approval of an outside authority, holding a position analogous to that of an architect, who should approve of the goods before delivery is accepted and payment made ?","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[33]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The business principles which are applicable to the building of a railway or a store should be applied equally to the manufacturer of clothing.

Such a proposition ought to have been presented in a definite form, in accordance with a proper scheme. Two proposals are involved - one for the creation of a woollen mill, and the second for the establishment of a clothing factory for the conversion of cloth into garments. When I was at the head of the Post and Telegraph Department, it was my duty to consider the report to which the Acting Minister has referred. I am not aware whether it contained anything about the creation of a Federal woollen mill ; but it certainly contained a recommendation for the establishment of a clothing factory. I made inquiries particularly with reference to the economical production of uniforms. I consulted some of the principal manufacturing firms in Australia, who had been supplying uniforms to the Department. They challenged the suggestion that a Federal clothing factory could turn out uniforms cheaper than they had hitherto been produced. They supplied me with figures which showed that it would be impossible for a Commonwealth factory to do the work more satisfactorily than it had been done by private firms. They also challenged the suggestion that contractors had been neglectful of their undertakings in connexion with Federal contracts. They said they always regarded work done for the Commonwealth as a very important branch of their business. They denied the allegation or suggestion that they had ever neglected the wants of the Departments. It stands to reason that great manufacturing firms competing for public and private patronage would be only too ready to make every effort to supply- the wants of our great Departments in respect of quality, promptitude, and cheapness. I know nothing about supplies for the Defence Department, but I certainly looked into the subject carefully as it affected the Post and Telegraph Department. 1 satisfied myself that there was no necessity whatever for launching upon an experiment of this kind, and that there was no occasion to depart from existing arrangements. No doubt the Government will carry their proposal, but I am satisfied the Departments will be no better off than they have hitherto been, whilst, on the other hand, a large number of firms will be seriously interfered with. If they lose a large quantity of the business which they have hitherto been obtaining from the public Departments they may have to dispense with a number of hands, a serious blow may be struck at their industry, and an injustice may be done to private enterprise. Many contractors have laid themselves out for a number of years to supply the wants of public Departments. They have equipped their factories with machinery, trained expert hands, and competed for public contracts. They will now be left in the lurch. At the same time, there will be no gain whatever to any public institution.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[34]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Last night I expressed my regret that provision was not made on the Estimates for the payment of compensation to owners of certain small cottages near Fort Forrest, North Fremantle. The matter has been the subject of correspondence for two or three years. These cottages, which are owned by poor people, are damaged by the firing of the big guns in the fort. The ceilings are brought down, the walls are shaken, and the very door frames are thrown out of plumb by the firing.

I sent a copy of this letter to the persons concerned, and I think that I am entitled to an explanation as to the reason why an item does not appear on the Estimates in respect of this matter.

As a boy I passed the gates of the establishment day after day, and I think that if we are to have an effective defence system, it is necessary that we should have some means of manufacturing the clothing and accoutrements required for the use of the troops and their officers. Once the industry is established honorable members will be satisfied that the Government have done the right thing in providing factories where the troops may be equipped and clothed in a way suitable to the Australian climate. The honorable member for Parkes has said that the British Government do not manufacture their own woollens, but my contention is that it will be to the credit of Australia if, as the Government propose, the clothing worn by our troops is made by Australians from Australian wool.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[36]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When the Tariff was under discussion it was pointed out that there was very great difficulty in connexion with the establishment of a woollen factory. Certain conditions of climate and water supply are conducive to the success of such establishments, and much skill and experience are also necessary. In some of the States successes have been achieved under very disadvantageous conditions. I know that in South Australia a factory has been established at Lobethal, and that it has-been brought to a very high degree of perfection after experiments extending over thirty years. It is now acknowledged that its output is very fine. It seems to me very unfair that Government competition should now be started without the smallest regard to the fair reward which the proprietors of that factory ought to get for the skill and enterprise which they have shown, and ignoring the fact that it may take many years, perhaps thirty years, for the same perfection to be obtained under Government experimentation.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[37]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

433,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GLYNN, Patrick","KCO","N/A","N/A","N/A",2870,"- I am quite aware of that, and it shows the absurdity of the Ministerial policy. In the Defence Act of last year there is a provision enabling the Commonwealth, if driven to do so, to establish a factory for the equipment of troops. That was a proper reserve power to take, because in a time of stress the Commonwealth ought not to be left at the mercy of any private firms. But it is most absurd to say that, because such power was taken in the Defence Act, the Government should ask for a vote to put the provision in operation at once. They are not only ignoring the reasonable claims of factories which started under disadvantageous conditions, but going back on a policy which was established two or three years ago of, as far as possible, allowing the supplies for the Departments to be provided by the enterprise of each State. I think that as regards the supply of harness and various equipments it was decided some years ago that, other things being equal, the articles ought to be furnished by local firms. The present proposal will lead to a very high degree of centralization, and I believe that, as a result of its operation, the Government operations will in time not be confined to the mere equipment of the army. That has been the experience of some States in connexion with engineering. They started an industry to meet railway requirements, but after a while they went in for the manufacture of pipes, until eventually some local firms which had been getting a share of the Government contracts were practically brought to ruin, and one or two had to close up owing to the unfair competition of Government enterprise. I hope that the Government will, even though the vote was passed in the early hours of this morning, reconsider the matter, because the adoption of this policy must lead to a degree of centralization which I am sure they would be the first to declare unfair, and it may result in the destruction of minor industries which are generally beneficial. i may mention that at Lobethal good wages are paid, and the conditions of living are quite ideal. If the Government would only give a fair opportunity to firms of that character I am sure that all their contracts would be fairly met. They could give their orders in the future with a degree of certainty which would enable private firms to extend their machinery. We have an army of about 23,000 men, and the Minister of Defence expects that in six or seven years we shall have to meet the necessities of 127,000. Will that not be a very great inducement to firms to extend their operations? Does it not indicate that the Government can in the future give contracts with such regularity in the various States that capitalists will be tempted to extend the operations of the present factories? I think that in the circumstances it will be a very great mistake for the Government to push this vote unnecessarily into operation.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[37]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I had the misery of bringing under the notice of the Minister of Defence a scandalous abuse of power by a large clothing manufacturer in Melbourne. I refer to the case of three sisters, of fine education, who eked out a livelihood by making badges for the military. Their tender was accepted by the Defence Department, which inserted in its contracts with clothing manufacturers a condition that they must obtain all badges from that source. Did the large contractors do so? No. They broke their contracts, and have not yet been punished. But I hope that a Select Committee will be appointed later to inquire into the conduct of persons who are acknowledged to have defrauded and helped to ruin the women I refer to by unjustly importing badges, which, I believe, were admitted duty free because they were attached to uniforms. I have to thank the Minister of Trade and Customs for making some inquiries, which tended to expose the firm of Lincoln, Stuart, and Company. I am sorry that my friend, Mr. Frank Stuart, is not in Melbourne, so that I could reveal to him the infamy which this wealthy company has perpetrated in ruining three young women who are. living in East Melbourne. I know that they will be quite willing to earn £1 a week. Any honorable member can see some samples of the splendid work which they do, if he doubts my statement. There is not one Commandant but considers that their badges are splendid, yet, forsooth, the power of money is exercised against them. A manufacturer, who is pretty well known in connexion with the six-hatters myth - Anderson, I believe, by name - approached these three ladies, and said to them, It is of no use for you to fight against us; we have the money, and can crush you ; you had better not compete against us in New South Wales, if you do, we shall agree upon a sum, and submit it to the Department. Previously to that, the Department had been paying a much larger sum for the badges. The women replied,  No, we have been treated fairly by the Department, and we shall not enter into an arrangement with you. The files in the Department show that they complained to the Minister of the day. But because, forsooth, the evidence was not considered sufficiently strong by an Attorney-General who for a little time graced the Treasury bench, but who, I am glad to say, will be in the limbo of oblivion for a very long time, a prosecution against that large contractor has not taken place. If we establish a Government factory, these or other women can obtain employment there, and will not be crushed out of existence by large firms. Unless the De- partment take steps to prevent the recurrence of such infamies as that which I have related, strong measures may have to be taken. Had these ladies, instead of being loyal to the Department, adopted the usual business tactics, and joined with two firms, they would have had. a large sum coming in every year. I do not know what the Department intends to do, but I hope that when the stress of business has passed by, the Attorney-General will do what his predecessor was not manly enough to do - punish firms who have broken their contracts.Every contract entered into with the Defence Department contains a penalty clause, which should be enforced if necessary, even if those concerned are large manufacturers like Lincoln, Stuart, and Company, of Melbourne, or the Andersons, of Sydney. I hope we shall ultimately make in the State factory the uniform for every Government servant who requires it, whether -he is employed in the Defence, Postal, or Railway Departments, which I hope will soon come under the control of the Federation. I hope this will be only a commencement, so that every uniform worn by Australian public servants will be made by men working under Government employment, and free from sweating influences.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[38]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is evidently only the first instalment of a large sum which will be required to carry out a project that will seriously affect all those who have been induced by our Tariff and other protective measures to invest large sums of money in the making of woollens in Australia. This is no time for the Government to invade that trade. They will have enough to do to look after the other parts of their defence scheme, and they can well afford to drop this move towards the establishment of a cloth factory. Not long ago a woollen factory was established at Marrickville, and I believe that English capital is now coming out for the establishment of woollen mills at Launceston and Hobart. It is not treating fairly those people who are embarking in enterprises of that sort, which will use a large quantity of Australian wool, and employ many Australian workmen, to establish a Government factory to compete with them. Although the item was passed last night, I think inadvertently, I hope the Ministry will recognise that the matter may well be held over for some time, if not for good.Clause agreed to.Clause 3 (Appropriation of Supply).","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[39]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
436,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SAMPSON, Sydney","L0P","Wimmera","N/A","N/A",2872,".- I suppose the proposal to nationalize the making of uniforms is part of the Government policy, but it seems to be a very adroit way of introducing the business into the House, and is somewhat on a par with what was done last night, by authorizing the building of the Federal Capital by means of a vote of £50,000. While the Government appear to be anxious to recognise the necessities of rifle clubs and new telephonic ser vices, I regret that the amount of money provided for those two objects is not keeping pace with the enormous developments in those directions throughout Australia. The amount voted in -1909-10 for new rifle clubs was £18,000, but this year it is only £12,000. We must build up the rifle clubs if we are to have an efficient Defence Force, because, by their means, we bring in a large number who will not be drafted into the regular troops or trained under the compulsory system. The previous Minister of Defence gave the subject the greatest attention, and if he had remained in power, there would have been a considerable development in that direction, but I regret to see, from the amount of money provided, that it is not the intention of the present Government to push on as they should with this important branch of our defence equipment. The vote ought to be considerably increased. Almost every country member knows that rifle clubs in distant parts have the greatest difficulty in finding ranges for shooting practice. There was an enormous increase last year in the revenue of the Postmaster-Generals Department, yet the additional amount for new services and the extension of telephones is only £688,000 this year, as against an additional amount °f £s64.-°°o last year. I admit that that is a substantial increase, but it is altogether insufficient.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[40]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I wish to support the statement of the honorable member for Richmond that the conditions which obtain in respect of the extension of telephonic services in country districts should be liberalized. Whilst I recognise that the Department has been doing its utmost to meet the requirements of rural residents in this connexion, I think that the conditions which it has imposed have been altogether too exacting. Where services promise to be remunerative within a period of five or six years, the Department should be prepared to accept the guarantee of residents to indemnify it against loss, and consequently it ought to be willing to abolish the .10 per cent, charge which il now makes. I understand that the Postmaster-General has power, by means of regulation, to liberalize the conditions under which telephonic services can be provided in various districts.
