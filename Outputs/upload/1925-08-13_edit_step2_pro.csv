I have said that Manly is the most popular and important health resort in Australia; but this is a matter which concerns not only those who reside in the vicinity of Manly and Sydney, but the whole of the people of Australia. In the summer time people come to Manly from every part of Australia, and they can be seen in their tens of thousands on the beautiful beaches there. If a person, suffering from an infectious disease, is allowed to get away from the quarantine station and mingle with the people at Manly, that disease may be carried far and wide throughout Australia. That is a matter for -very serious consideration. I urge upon the Minister for Health that no harm can be done by the appointment of a small select committee to make inquiries into the possibility of the removal of the existing quarantine station to some other place, or of arriving at some compromise in the matter. I have made personal and official application to have some division of the existing area. Do honorable members know that there are 600 acres of very valuable land comprised in the existing station which would make beautiful park lands and recreation areas. They are locked up in the quarantine station, and goodness only knows for what purpose. The great extent of the existing station makes it most difficult to police it. This difficulty will be admitted when I tell honorable members that I have personal knowledge that persons suffering from an infectious disease, and supposed to be confined at the quarantine station, have found their way out, and have attended dances in Manly. It has been found impossible to effectively police- the area and prevent inmates of the quarantine station from getting out and mingling with the general population. Some will contend that it would not improve matters to reduce the area of the existing station, but its reduction would make it possible to more effectively police it. I understand that there is some objection by the Defence Department to the removal of the station, or to the curtailment of. its area. Why the department should desire to reserve an area at North Head of 600 acres for defence purposes I cannot imagine. It may want North Head as a gun position; but there is no reason why it should not do all that is required by an improvement of the fortifications of South Head,, from which the harbour might be just as effectively protected. What sort of defence could be established at North Head that could not be established at South Head? The Defence Department has been putting up this objection for the last twenty years, but in all that time no defensive .works have been carried out at North Head, which has not been made use of in connexion with defence. In spite of this the Defence Department continues its opposition to the request of the people of Manly to have at least some inquiry made as to what might be done to remove what is at present a serious menace to the health of the people. I shall not take up time unnecessarily in discussing the motion. I want to get a vote upon it, and I believe the House will agree to my request in view of the importance of the matter. I ask the Minister to, at all events, let me have the satisfaction of making some inquiry to see whether it is not possible to remove the quarantine station from North Head, whether there is not a more suitable site for a quarantine station, and what would be the cost of removal to such a site. I should like to be able to inquire, also, whether, if the existing station cannot be removed, it would not be advisable to cut off, say, 300 acres of the area, and make it available for park and recreation grounds. I shall not labour the matter further. The Government will be well advised not to oppose my simple request, when it is backed up by the. advice and recommendation of many thousands of people who have lived in the vicinity of the quarantine station for years.","N/A","QUARANTINE STATION, MANLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[1]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

546,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HOWSE, Neville","KI7","Calare","NAT","Minister for Defence and Minister for Health",1404,". - The honorable member for Warringah (Sir Granville Ryrie) has opened up an extremely important question in proposing the removal of the quarantine station near Manly, and I think it advisable for the House to have some definite data in reference to that establishment before it decides whether it will grant the select committee for which the honorable member asks. The quarantine station comprises an area of 671 acres. In 1908 it was agreed between the New South Wales Government and the Commonwealth Government that this area should be divided into two definite sections, one of 388 acres for a land quarantine station, and another 283 acres for a marine quarantine station , and that  in the event of the land being no longer required for quarantine purposes it should be re-transferred to the New South Wales Government, with the exception of that portion required for defence. It has been alleged by the honorable member for Warringah that the use of this area as a quarantine station is a menace not only to the people living iri its vicinity but also to all the visitors who go to Manly each year. In 1888 the people of Manly made a complaint about the matter, a.nd the then head of the Quarantine Department pointed out that in the 54 years preceding there had been 50 separate outbreaks of small-pox in New South Wales, and that in not one case had there been any extension of the disease to any individual in either Manly or Sydney. There is perfectly clear evidence that the North Head quarantine station has not been a menace to the health of the people of Manly at any period during its establishment. Honorable members will recognize that we must have a quarantine station near Sydney, and that such establishments are particularly necessary in. this country. The honorable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) strongly opposes the retention of the quarantine station at North Head, but I remind him that in view of our proximity to the East, quarantine in Australia is a very different matter from quarantine in England. There is no evidence whatever that the existing quarantine station at North Head has been a menace to anybody in the vicinity, in Sydney, or in New South Wales. If it is to be removed we must consider where it should be re-established, and even the advocates of its removal agree that the only place to which it could be removed is Jervis Bay.","N/A","QUARANTINE STATION, MANLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is quite clear that the quarantine station at Manly is no menace to the health of the people of Sydney. Now I come to the second aspect of . the question - that of defence requirements. Since the war, it has come to be recognized that coastal defences will probably play a great and important part - possibly a more important part than was anticipated before 1914- in the defence of big towns adjacent to the sea. The defence authorities point out that a gun of the 9.2 type requires to be surrounded by a cleared area of at least 1,000 yards radius, that is to say, by an area of 800 acres, and were it not for the fact that at North Head there is the ocean to the east, the area now available - 671 acres - would not be enough for the working of a 9.2 gun, and still more insufficient for the management of a 15-inch gun. The Imperial Defence Committee now sitting in London is discussing this subject, and at an early date the Government hopes to learn from it what type of fortification it considers necessary to erect at North Head. Therefore it is clear that it is not possible for a select committee to obtain evidence of any value on the question.","N/A","QUARANTINE STATION, MANLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

552,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HOWSE, Neville","KI7","N/A","N/A","N/A",1405,"- Because there is none available. The Government has no evidence yet as to the type of coastal defence that should be constructed at North Head. It is waiting for that information before laying before Parliament its programme for the construction of coastal defences. I appeal to the honorable member for Warringah to try to realize the inadvisability of asking for a select committee, because evidence is not available on the subject of defence. It is true that a committee could take evidence in regard to the supposed menace to the health of the community due to the proximity of the quarantine station to Manly but any body of scientific men would, without a moments hesitation, come to a conclusion upon that point. The experience of 100 years has shown that the quarantine station at North Head has not been a menace to the health of the people of Sydney. Assuming that the station could be removed to some place where a suitable anchorage could be found, the estimated minimum cost of the removal would be £250,000 without providing for sewerage. After what I have said, I ask honorable members to consider very seriously whether it is advisable to spend on an inquiry by a select committee even the small sum of money to which the honorable member for Warringah refers. When I received a deputation from the people of Manly the one point they made was that the presence of the quarantine station was inimical to the growth of the town. We dealt with the   menace to health  objection quite easily, and I thought I had convinced them on that point, but evidently I did not do so. It is true that the growth of Manly has been phenomenal. During the decade from 1911 to 1921 its population has increased from 10,000 to 18,000, and every year there has been an increase . in. the number, of visitors. However, there is no warrant for incurring any expense whatever in appointing a select committee todiscuss a matter on which it could not get evidence which the Government itself is not able to get to guide it in coming to a decision as to whether the area should be given up or not.","N/A","QUARANTINE STATION, MANLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[2]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
553,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MALONEY, William","KLM","Melbourne","ALP; FLP from 1931; ALP from 1936","N/A",1406,".- I am sorry to have to disagree with the Minister for Health (Sir Neville Howse). It may be another instance of scientific men, like legal men, giving an opinion pretty well to order to suit the Government. I ask the honorable member for Warringah to press his motion. Only the thickness of a sheet of galvanized iron separates the quarantine station at North Head from the town of Manly. If the germs of small-pox, or any other contagious disease, can be carried during warm summer weather, honorable members can see the menace of continuing this station on its present site. We have been told by the. honorable member for Warringah that quarantined persons have attended a dance at Manly. I know from my own experience that the children of officials at the quarantine station attended a school in Manly every day while I was with other honorable members in quarantine. I also know that the department was so well managed at the time that through its absolute ignorance it made the Minister of the day tell lies. When we asked that the second and third class passengers on our boat should have the advantage of warm baths, the reply came that hot shower baths were available to them. As a matter of fact, there was not a single hot shower bath in the whole of the establishment, and I replied in a telegram worded in this way,  Not only is your answer inaccurate, but your informant in the department is idiotic, because there are no hot shower baths in the establishment. The womenfolk who unfortunately could not travel first class on ourboat had to perform all their ablutions in a trough 2 ft. 6 in. long, 2 ft. 6 in. wide, and 10 inches deep. My statements in this regard can be borne out by the honorable member for Herbert (Mr. Bamford) and the honorable member for Lang (Sir Elliot Johnson), who were quarantined with me. We called a meeting of the passengers, and asked the first-class lady passengers to give up half their hot baths for the accommodation of the ladies travelling in the second and third classes. To their honour, they agreed to do so. These facts show how the department was managed at that time. I have given up the practice of medicine for the last eighteen years, and  I am prepared to defer to the knowledge of the Minister for Health ; but I ask him if it is not true that germs of contagious and infectious diseases can be carried on waves of hot air for a distance of at least 6 feet. I have known of infection to pass from one room to another. However, is it right that one of the beauty spots ofone of Australias most beautiful harbours should be used as a quarantine ground ? Perhaps the Minister will agree with me that the most perfect site for a quarantine station is an island, and if there are no islands available on the coast of New South Wales, which I regret, surely there are sites at Kuringai Chase which could be absolutely isolated, and where the waters are comparatively calm no matter how great a storm may be raging outside.","N/A","QUARANTINE STATION, MANLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

556,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BOWDEN, Eric","JRH","Parramatta","N/A","N/A",1406,".- The removal of the quarantine station from near Manly is a subject that is of perennial interest. As long as I can remember, I have heard of the menace to the health of the town of Manly. When I was Minister for Defence the Manly Council made representations on the matter, and examined the proposal from the point of view of the Defence Department. Its principal contention then was  that as the town was. growing so rapidly the area occupied by the quarantine station should be made available for additional residences. My opinion is that the town has ample room to grow to the north, and does not need to go any further south. I notice that, the honorable member for Warringah.. (Sir Gran- ville Ryrie) is not asking that the area should be made available for building sites, but that it should be used as a park for the benefit of the inhabitants of Sydney. I do not think that his proposal will meet with the wishes of the Manly Council, whose main object is to bring revenue to its coffers. If the area were subdivided and sold, the council would increase the number of its ratepayers. The quarantine station has been at North Head since the thirties of last century, and as there has been no instance of the transmission of disease from it to any person in Manly or elsewhere, the alleged menace is only a bogy. The honorable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) spoke of the careless administration of the station, but his statements have no bearing on the question of site. I do not desire to discuss the conduct of the station, except to say that all infectious cases are kept far away from the galvanized iron boundary fence to which the honorable member referred.","N/A","QUARANTINE STATION, MANLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Personally, I was quite convinced by the information that was placed at my disposal. In every state the quarantine station is within the principal port. Although the Victorian quarantine station is a good distance down Port Phillip Bay, and is further from closely settled areas than is the North Head station, it is within the harbour. Quarantine is a serious matter to both passengers and shipping companies, and if the station were removed from Port Jackson to some place more remote, a great deal of additional expense would be involved, which would probably have to be borne by the Commonwealth. A site on the Hawkesbury River was suggested, but the bar at the mouth of the river prevents the entrance of. vessels of deep draught.","N/A","QUARANTINE STATION, MANLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[4]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Its draught was probably not more than 20 feet, whereas some of the larger mail steamers that now visit the Commonwealth draw as much as 30 feet. Unless the Hawkesbury River entrance were dredged vessels of that type could not enter. Botany Bay has been suggested as a suitable site; but it must be remembered that all around the bay new watering places have come into existence, and the country surrounding Botany Bay is becoming almost as- populous as Manly. The Minister for Defence has reminded us that suitable anchorage cannot be found in Botany Bay. Even if a suitable anchorage could be obtained there, nothing would be gained by transferring the quarantine station from one closely settled area to another. Jervis Bay is too far south, and the conveniences there are very few. Shipping companies could not reasonably be asked to bear the cost of quarantine at Jervis Bay. Already the charges upon shipping are a very great tax upon the community, and a further increase of them would have serious results.","N/A","QUARANTINE STATION, MANLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[4]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Every alternative site put forward by advocates of the removal of the station has been inquired into and rejected. Nobody has said how the cost of removal should be met. Certainly one advocate for the removal of the station suggested that the Commonwealth might sell the present site at Manly, and I believe that £1,000,000 or £1,250,000 was offered for it. But the agreement with the New South Wales Government requires that when the ground is no longer required by the Commonwealth for quarantine or defence purposes, it shall be handed back to the state. Therefore, this Government could not recover one penny in respect of the present site, and if another suitable site could be found the cost of removal - probably over £250,000 - would have to be borne by the Commonwealth. I do not know whether the honorable member for Newcastle can suggest another site; I am certain that he will not propose that the station should be transferred to Newcastle. Of course, if the station on its existing site were a menace to public health, the cost of transferring it would have to be faced; but as, during more than 80 years, when more or less happy-go-lucky methods of quarantine have often prevailed, no evil results have been traced to it, we may be confident that, with improved methods and the advance of medical science, there will be no danger in future.","N/A","QUARANTINE STATION, MANLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[4]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The defence aspect also must be taken into consideration.The honorable and gallant member who submitted the motion knows that one reason why North Head lias not hitherto been fortified is the inadequate means of communication with the other forts on the harbour. In effect, North Head was until recently practically an island, and the waters of Middle Harbour formed a serious obstacle to the sending of relief or reinforcements to that point. That disability has been overcome during the last twelve months by the completion of the Spit bridge, which has rendered possible quick land communication between Middle Head or Georges Heights and North Head. It is almost certain that the Imperial Committee, which is reporting on the harbour defences of Australia, will recommend, as Lord Kitchener did, the fortification, of North Head. The trouble experienced at South Head, through the approach of settlement too close to the forts, should be a warning to us. The big guns at South Head cannot be used for training because of the damage done to windows and the resultant demands upon the Defence Department for compensation. Quite recently the department determined to give the trainees some training with the 9.2-inch guns, and issued a circular to the inhabitants of Vaucluse, Watsons Bay, and other suburbs in the locality, advising them to leave their windows open at certain hours in order to avoid damage. By some people that advice was not heeded, and considerable claims have been made upon the department in respect of broken windows.","N/A","QUARANTINE STATION, MANLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[4]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When North Head is fortified 9.2-inch or possibly 15-inch guns will be mounted there, and in view of that possibility it would be madness to part with the land now held by the Commonwealth at Manly. We should retain it if only for possible defence needs in the near future. The Minister for Defence has stated that even now the area is barely sufficient to provide a radius of 1,000 yards from the big guns to the nearest residences. I am afraid that some of the quarantine buildings are within that radius, but they are Commonwealth property. The proposal to remove the quarantine station from Manly has been put forward and inquired into ad nauseam. Every Commonwealth Minister for Health and every. Minister for Defence has had to consider it, and all have come to the conclusion that, in the interests of the Commonwealth and of Australian defence, it would be inadvisable to surrender that area to the state.

This motion asking for a royal commission is rather a big proposition to place before honorable members, but, if appointed, the royal commission would thoroughly investigate the. conditions at Norfolk Island, and its report would probably resultin remedial legislation being introduced into this House. I shall not say, at this stage, that a royal commission would constitute the best form of inquiry at Norfolk Island; but I consider that some inquiry of a semi-judicial nature is urgently needed to benefit this far-distant and utterly neglected appendage of the Commonwealth. The conditions at that island - a mere speck in the Pacific - are certainly agreeable to the majority of its inhabitants, but honorable members, when they hear the information which I have to place before them, will agree with me that drastic action must be taken to place the affairs of the island upon a satisfactory footing. That Territory,carrying a community of about 700 people, is ruled by an Administrator appointed by the Home and Territories Department. If the islanders have the good fortune to secure the services of an official properly qualified for the position, they are happy indeed; but if otherwise, then their lot can be made very miserable.

615,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WEST, John Edward","KZA","East Sydney","N/A","N/A",1411,".- The production of power alcohol in Australia is likely to become a vexed question. The bill, in proposing to encourage the production of power alcohol from cassava, only trifles with the question, for two years ago Australia was using 34,000,000 gallons of power alcohol aud petrol a year, and for the year 1924-25 the figure will be about 81,000,000 gallons. Owing tQ the more general use of the internal combustion engine, the consumption of this fuel is likely to become still greater in the future. The Public Accounts Committee has for some time past been holding an inquiry into oil exploration, but has not heard any evidence to indicate the probability of discovering a payable flow of oil in this country. Other members of the committee may disagree with that statement, but I think they will all agree that oil cannot be discovered unless more energetic measures arc taken. We have been told that to look for oil in some parts of Australia is merely to waste time and money. Power alcohol is produced on the continent of Europe from various kinds of vegetation. Not only the Federal Government, but the Government cf Queensland also, has interested itself in the production of power alcohol from cassava. The tropical and sub-tropical parts of Queensland are well adapted to the growth of vegetation for this purpose. The bill provides for a bounty to a British company. I have never encouraged the payment of bounties; I prefer protective tariffs instead. But as no bounty will be paid to the company until the spirit is produced, and as the company is willing to incur a large expenditure with a view to earning the bounty, there appears to be no reason for opposing the bill. If power alcohol is made available as a fuel at a cheap price that will enable the soil of Australia to be put to better use. Honorable members opposite are always worrying about the need for settling people on the land. The Treasurer, in his budget speech this afternoon, proposed to write off an account for millions of pounds that have been given to people on the land.. That money has been thrown to the winds. It could better have been given to honorable members, who, individually, could have done some good with it. In 1915 Australia, in order to produce munitions, had to manufacture methylated spirits for the cordite factory. For that purpose a large expenditure was incurred in 1916 in building the acetate of lime factory, and highly skilled workmen were engaged. After the war over-production occurred, and the factory was closed. Subsequently it was reopened, but had not been running long before the private interests that produce methylated spirits were able to exert sufficient pressure to influence the champions of private enterprise who sit opposite, and it was again closed. Later, it produced power alcohol from molasses, which is a by-product of sugar refining, and had previously not been put to commercial use. The factory has been supplying the Defence Department, the Postal Department, and other Government departments with spirit. I hope that something will be clone to put it to greater use in the future, for otherwise, we shall suffer if international troubles occur It is the policy of the Labour party to have all the requirements of war manufactured in Australia; we do not approve of employing people on the other side of the world to build cruisers or other . weapons of defence. Statements made- to the Public Accounts Committee bear out what I say, but they are too long for me to read now. The bounty proposed by the Government is small, but it is essential. Should we obtain flow oil in Australia all other production cf oil and spirit, such as oil from shale, benzol from coal, and power alcohol from molasses, will become insignificant. It gives me pleasure to view any matter from the economical stand-point, and I remind honorable members that we .are at present sending out of Australia a very large sum of money for the purchase of crude oil. We possibly would have to pay more for its production in Australia, out I still doubt the wisdom of sending to the other side of the world for it. From the information I have obtained I have little doubt that when the American people discover that the number of oilwells is not being increased, they will conserve their supplies for themselves, and outsiders will have to do without it. It is a characteristic of the American people, which I admire, that they prefer to look after themselves first. They are, perhaps, the greatest consumers of oil for power purposes in the world, and, if they see no prospect of increasing their supplies, they will keep what they have for themselves. It is really against my nature not to oppose the Government, but I have no intention to oppose this measure, which may do something useful for the people of Australia. The measure should not be opposed by members of the Country party, because the people whom it may be the means of putting on the land will be purchasers of the produce of the wheat-growers and cattle-raisers. T hope the company concerned in this business will be successful. If it is successful, Australia will lose nothing, by the bounty.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
616,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MANN, Edward","KMQ","Perth","N/A","N/A",1412,".- This is a bill to provide a bounty not exceeding £5,000 a year for five years on the production of alcohol from cassava or similar starch-bearing vegetable products. It is not a simple bounty bill, such as many that have come before this House. There are connected with or arising out of the principles of the bill many important issues which require to be taken into consideration before the measure in its present form is accepted. There are many big questions bound up with it of which honorable members may not be entirely aware. So important do I regard this matter that, if the second reading of the bill is carried, I intend to move that it be referred to a select committee for inquiry into some of the questions to which I shall refer directly, so that the House may be fully informed as to all its possibilities before the measure is passed into law. It is very unsatisfactory and difficult te deal with a technical measure in this House. Many questions of a. technical character cannot be gone into sufficiently fully in the circumstances in which a bill of this kind has to be debated. They can only be properly inquired into by a select committee devoting itself to that purpose. It is necessary^ however, that I should indicate, in general terms, the issues which occur to my mind in con- nexion with the bill. As the Minister in charge of it suggested, it looks an innocent measure, but babies sometimes grow up to be giants. I think the future should be safeguarded by full consideration of the issues which may arise under this bill before we commit ourselves to the first steps along what may be found in the future to be a rather dangerous line of procedure. I trust the House will bear with me while I try to put before it some of the considerations I have in mind. The bill is to encourage the production of alcohol from starch-bearing plants. The principal commercial source of alcohol throughout the world to-day consists of materials which produce naturally either starch or sugar. All those different forms of vegetation which produce starch or sugar are the cheapest and most common forms for the production of alcohol. Starch may bo converted into sugar, and sugar by fermentation into alcohol, and so we get the product required. With certain exceptions,, to which I shall refer later, those are the principal sources of alcohol in the world to-day. At the same time they are the most important sources of food for all animals including man. All the most important supplies of food are being exploited throughout the world. . The necessities of the human race require this if it is to continue its existence. All proposals to use any such natural products as these on a large scale for alcohol production must be considered in their relation to the food requirements of the world. It may be said that this is a very small and innocent measure, and it is unjustifiable to assume that it might interfere with the food supplies of this country or of the world; but before I have finished I think it will be admitted that I have some justification for raising in the minds of honorable members a certain degree of alarm on this point. The increasing populations of the world are demanding larger and larger food supplies. We know perfectly well that there are large hordes of the human race to-day insufficiently fed because they cannot afford to buy enough food. To use large areas of land to produce alcohol instead of foodstuffs must have the effect of reducing the actual or potential food supplies of the world, and thus increase the price of food. That they may know that this is no  mere chimera of my brain, I inform honorable members that in July, 1913, there was a great motor transport conference held in England which was attended by over 200 delegates, I believe from all parts of the world. It constituted a motor fuel committee specially to inquire into the question of power alcohol for fuel for motor purposes. This committee issued a questionnaire, which was distributed by thousands all over the British Empire. I was at that time in charge of a government department, and received some copies of this questionnaire, and I know that very many were distributed throughout Australia. It made definite and careful inquiries as to supplies of material now or potentially available for this purpose. A most exhaustive inquiry was undertaken, and I think it was some three or four years later that this committee, after full inquiry, issued a report in which it said that it was impossible to contemplate the production of power alcohol on any scale likely to effect any serious economy in the production of power for the worlds requirements, without seriously interfering with the food supplies of the world. The only exception suggested was that by some chance some great discovery, at present unexpected, might be made of some rapidlygrowing tropical vegetation, naturally recouping itself, and bearing a large proportion of starch or sugar, whilst being useless for any other purpose. That condition has never been fulfilled. The Imperial Government appointed a departmental committee to make inquiries along the same lines, in October, 1918. This committee reported in July, 1919, and the substance of its report was that alcohol could not be made from foodstuffs without a bounty. The committee mentioned other sources of alcohol to which I shall refer later. In a special article published in the Times of November, 1918, just after the appointment of this committee the following facts were- stated : - In 1916-7, when every war effort in England was at its maximum, and every nerve was strained to try to produce alcohol for power purposes, the production of industrial alcohol had reached upwards of 4,000,000 gallons a year. That does not seem to be a very large amount, yet it was the maximum war effort of Great Britain at the time. The report went on to say -The alcohol thus obtained has been derived practically entirely from material otherwise available as food, and, indeed, in the case of molasses has been secured at the serious expense of the supplies ordinarily employed for stock feeding.Our own Institute of Science and Industry published bulletins and articles dealing with this subject in 1918, 1919, and 1921, and the conclusion come to in those reports was that alcohol could only be made from foodstuffs with the aid of a bounty mainly because of the costs incurred by fiscal restraints.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It seems extraordinary that we should be asked to pay a bounty principally because of the cost of manufacture imposed by our own fiscal restraints, that is to say, by the precautions necessary to protect the revenue in the matter of the production of alcohol in other directions. Although the reports of the Institute of Science and Industry do not contribute anything new on the subject, they collate from various sources information which is very valuable to us. Among other matters they emphasize is the fact that the calorific power of alcohol is inferior to that of petrol. I think I. am correct in saying that it is not more than 75 per cent, of that of petrol.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They take as their basis of comparison the price of 3s. 6d. per gallon for petrol, whereas now the price is 2s. 3d. per gallon. A proposal based on a price of 3s. 6d. per gallon . might have some features to recommend it, .but these may be entirely removed by the fact that the price of petrol has dropped considerably. lt would be fallacious indeed for this Parliament to accept this bill on a recommendation of the Institute of Science and Industry, which is already out of date in an important respect, and it is obvious that if on its recommendation a bounty is required for the production of power alcohol to compete with petrol at 3s. 6d. per gallon, that bounty must be very largely increased when the price of petrol has fallen to 2s. 3d. per gallon. I could say a great deal more on the general aspects of this question, but I do not wish to inflict on honorable members a long, wearisome and rather technical dis:sertation. I simply want to indicate that there are. beneath the surface some far-reaching considerations which it would be very wrong for Parliament to pass over without the fullest and most careful inquiry. First of all, it appears to me that the need for the payment of a bounty has not been shown. We are told that the measure has been brought forward mainly to encourage the operations of a company which is proposing to plant cassava. It is said that if the bounty is paid the machinery employed in the sugar industry, which now lies idle during a certain part of the year, can be employed during that period in the production of alcohol, and that some of the labour which is engaged for part of the year only in the sugar industry will, during the rest of the year, be applied to the production of cassava. It is said that this, is very desirable, and that, therefore, we should grant this bounty. To me that is an extraordinary process of reasoning. The sugar industry already has immense assistance given to it for one very important reason, namely that the men employed in it work during a restricted season only. If we can produce another crop which can be grown in the balance of the year, and if we get employed for the whole of the year, not only the labour, but also the machinery which is now idle for portion of the year, that should be regarded as a reason not for the payment of a new bounty, but for the reduction of the existing bounty on sugar.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Cassava, about which we have heard so much, but of which, probably, most of us knowvery little, is a shrub that develops foots which are large store houses of starch. It is the plant from which the tapioca of commerce is made. It is, therefore, a very valuable and well recognized food substance for the human race, and my remarks about the treatment of material which could otherwise be used for food supplies have a very direct and pertinent bearing. It is an expensive crop to work, much more expensive than wheat.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Almost any textbook on the subject will corroborate my statement that cassava is much more expensive to grow than wheat. A root crop always requires a great deal of cultivation. The Minister (Mr. Pratten) admits that this is a great experiment. He hopes that it will be so successful that the production of power alcohol will be sufficient to replace the whole of our present petrol supplies. That is a very large order, and I want the Minister and the House to consider what it really means. The evidence I have already submitted to the House from the British Committee and the Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry, which was corroborated by the interjection of the honorable member for South Sydney, indicates that the bounty will need to be permanent. Alcohol cannot be produced from these sources without a bounty, which, once granted, must be continued. Without such artificial aid the industry could not endure under existing economic conditions. Leaving out of account the political pressure which may be exercised by industries developed by public money in this way. whatwill this bounty ultimately cost the Commonwealth.? The consumption of petrol for this year is estimated to be 81,000,000 gallons. Disregarding the lower calorific value of alcohol as compared with petrol, if the ambition of the Minister for Trade and Customs to entirely replace petrol by alcohol is to be realized, Australia must produce at least 81,000,000 gallons of alcohol per annum. That, indeed, is the purpose of the bill, but is it practicable?Mr.Forde. - Would it not be a good thing to produce even 8,000,000 gallons of alcohol, and use only 73,000,000 gallons of petrol?","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If Australia does produce 81,000,000 gallons of alcohol, the proposed bounty of 4d. per gallon will eventually amount to, not a paltry £5,000 per annum, but £1,350,000 per annum. If, as has been estimated, 35 gallons of alcohol can be obtained from 1 ton of cassava, the country will require to produce ultimately 2,300,000 tons of cassava. The yield per acre of cassava has naturally been estimated very favorably, but from the authorities I have consulted. I find that it varies from 21/2 to 15 tons per acre. Assuming an average of 7 tons per acre, the production of 2,300,000 tons of cassava will mean the use of 300,000 acres of land, and the diversion to this purpose of over 2,000,000 tons of potential foodstuffs.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Within 24 hours of the introduction of this bill statements foreshadowing a demand for an increase in the bounty appeared in the press. . Past experience warns us of the developments that may be expected from this modest commencement. It is very easy to recommend the payment of a bounty which is so small as to be not worth quibbling about, but we know that once the thin edge is inserted the thick body of the wedge will* follow. Grant this small bounty now, and this Parliament will be requested to pay a higher bounty per gallon, involving a bigger annual outlay. If Parliament is to start upon this course it should do so with its eyes open : it should not act without definite and independent data. Several features of the bill prove to me that the Minister has shown a very indifferent regard for his duty to supply this House with full information. The bill requires that the bounty shall be paid only on alcohol which conforms to the spirits regulations. Those regulations specify that the spirit shall be not less than 60 per cent, overproof, which equals 87 per cent, of alcohol. According to the reports of the Bureau of Science and Industry, engines require spirit that is 70 per cent, overproof, equalling 95 per cent, of alcohol, or 8 per cent, above the standard specified in the spirit regulations. Therefore, if this provision in the bill is accepted there will be no guarantee that the spirits produced will be of the strength and quality required for power purposes. The expense of raising spirit from 87 to 95 per cent, of alcohol is a Very serious consideration. It is comparatively easy to improve spirit to make the percentage of alcohol fairly high, but the final refinement and the elimination of the last traces of water is a difficult process, and more costly than all the preceding stages. This apparently trivial, but highly important, difference of 8 per cent, in alcoholic strength may damn the whole enterprise.Whether the Customs Department is aware of that point I do not know, but certainly some additional safeguard should1 be inserted in the bill. The suggestion has been made that the bounty should not be confined to alcohol produced from the materials mentioned in the bill. The honorable member for Capricornia has spoken of the necessity for including alcohol produced from molasses. I do not propose to discuss the pros and cons of that suggestion. T. have no desire to appear prejudiced. If I speak strongly it is only because I am endeavouring to prove that there are grounds for inquiry, but if a select committee is appointed, I, as a member of it, will endeavour to ensure that the whole subject shall be impartially investigated. I may be wrong in some of the arguments I have been advancing.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The committees of investigation appointed at Home and elsewhere have referred fully to other possible sources of alcohol, and, after all, we must take these into account. Although honorable members have heard a great deal about power alcohol, they perhaps do not know of the research work that is being carried out in other parts of the world respecting other sources of alcohol. Surely we should know about them before we agree to give a bounty on power alcohol. Investigations concerning other sources of alcohol have been going on for some time. There is the production of alcohol from cellulose, which, I admit, is n rather dubious source of alcohol. The cost of the production and the nature of the wood are very important factors in. that process, and it is certainly doubtful whether it could be employed here. Since the reports from the Institute of Science and Industry have come to hand, much progress has been made in the production of alcohol, and further facts are obtainable. To-day we must keep pace with technical investigations of this kind. It has been generally recognized elsewhere that alcohol cannot be produced from food supplies without the assistance of a bounty, and for that reason technical skill has been devoted to other sources of alcohol to try to obtain an economical process. Alcohol can be obtained from the great peat bogs of the world. More important and, perhaps, more promising is the production of synthetic alcohol, which, of course, does not affect food supplies at all. It has already been successfully produced on a large scale. Until recently there has been an objection to this process, because the synthetic production of alcohol causes a hig diversion of coal and the consumption of the fuel supplies of the world. But here again I point out that the whole aspect of the question has, during the last year or two, apparently. undergone an immense change. No one could read the cabled reports of the last week or two without knowing, something of the glut in the coal industry of the world and the need of the coal producing countries to find some method of extracting power alcohol from coal. We cannot but realize that this is probably the most reasonable and hopeful line of technical investigation and research not only for the production of a power that could compete with petrol, but also to overcome the great trouble which has arisen in the coal industry. A large amount of synthetic alcohol is to-day actually being exported from Europe. Petrol has beaten coal, and this is responsible for the slump in the coal requirements of the Old World. Is it feasible that alcohol can be expected to beat petrol under the conditions that I have outlined ? We should keep in full touch with all the latest developments respecting synthetic alcohol. I suggest that I have shown to honorable members sufficient grounds for delaying the bill. This House, to tackle this subject successfully, should insist upon a more careful inquiry, and not accept this innocent looking bill at its face value. I do not want the Minister to misunderstand me. I know the importance of producing cheap power. Everybody does.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

656,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MAKIN, Norman","KLL","Hindmarsh","N/A","N/A",1416,".- The honorable member for Perth (Mr. Mann) stated that he felt that he had adduced sufficient evidence to warrant a further delay in the granting of a bounty for the production of power alcohol. My complaint is that this measure has been delayed far too long. There is ever increasing difficulty in providing propellant power for the requirements of this country. The honorable member oxpressed the view that some committee cf this House or of experts should investigate this important subject. He may not be aware that a committee of this House has recently been inquiring into petroleum supplies and the production of power alcohol and other- forms of propellant power. I have a shrewd suspicion that this legislation has been inspired to some extent .by the deliberations of that committee. I agree with the Ministers statement that the amount proposed for the bounty, is modest. It is far too modest, and certainly should have been more substantial. It is not advisable to confine the granting of a bounty for the production of power alcohol to cassava and other starchbearing plants. Recent research and local circumstances in Australia demand that the bounty should be more far-reaching than is proposed in the bill. An important line of investigation has been successfully followed by an eminent Australian physician and surgeon, who for some years past has devoted himself to scientific research ; I refer to Dr. Sinclair, of Coogee, New South. Wales, who has recently produced power alcohol from prickly pear. That being so, and in view of the fact that the prickly pear at present constitutes a pest, it is desirable that every effort should be made to utilize it to advantage in the production of power alcohol. Before a committee of this House, Dr. Sinclair stated that the prickly pear may yet prove to be a great blessing to Australia. If he is able to convert this curse into a blessing, he will take his place among those who are regarded as the great men of this continent. The production of power alcohol is closely associated with one of our most valuable industries - the sugar industry. The honorable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde) has already, in an able  speech, placed this aspect of the question before the House. During recent years, those engaged in the sugar industry in Australia have experienced anxious times, as they have had difficulty in obtaining markets for their product, while that which has been disposed of has been sold in unfavorable markets. Sugar cane is rich in those properties which are necessary for the production of power alcohol, and by obtaining fuel from this source we should not only provide ourselves with a valuable commodity, but also help an industry which is greatly in need of assistance. The provisions of this bill should be extended to apply to other than cassava and starchy foods; they should apply to the prickly pear particularly, and also to any other form of vegetation from which power alcohol can be produced. Those who are in a position to know have stated that, at the present rate of consumption, the worlds known supplies of petroleum will last for fifteen to 25 years only. But as the rate of consumption is increasing rapidly - during the last two and a half years, our imports have increased by from 100 per cent, to 150 per cent. - it will be seen that that period is likely to be considerably reduced. It is therefore incumbent on us to do something to provide ourselves with a satisfactory substitute ; and in view of the fact that the discovery of petroleum in Australia has not to the moment been made in payable quantities, we must, for our own future security and advancement, encourage the production of power supplies from alcohol. If the necessary assistance is given to the industry at this stage, I believe that the time will come when there will be no need for a bounty. Nevertheless, we must remember . that formidable opposition must be expected from the big oil interests, which will from the very inception, do all in their power to prevent power alcohol from being placed on the Australian market. For that reason the industry should have our assistance. The excise authorities are much too conservative in their attitude towards the denaturing of spirit. An effective denaturant could, at less than the present cost, and with advantage to the industry, be substituted for that which we have today. During the last year or two there have been slight modifications of the requirements respecting the denaturing of spirit, but they have not been sufficient. Something further along those lines should be done. When power alcohol was introduced into France, the great oil interests there recognized it as a formidable rival to their product, and exerted all their influence to prevent its use. It was eventually found necessary to provide that a certain percentage of alcohol should be mixed with all the petroleum spirit which was imported into France. By that means, encouragement was given to the new industry, while at the same time the opposition of the great oil interests was checked. The experience of France and of other countries will be repeated in Australia unless effective measures are taken to prevent it. T hope that the Minister will be prepared ;o further encourage this industry by making the bounty applicable also to power alcohol produced from sugar cane and other forms of vegetation. In the district of Barker, in. South Australia, some of the residents have . interested themselves in growing other vegetation from which power alcohol can be obtained, and I should be pleased to support the honorable member for Barker (Mr. M. Cameron) in any effort that he might make to extend the provisions of this bill to assist them. It may be argued that, while we have not yet discovered in Australia . petroleum oil in payable quantities, we have valuable shale oil deposits from which fuel may be obtained; and these are worthy of our support and further interest; but I contend that certain of them are too valuable as a source for the supply of lubricants to allow of their general and unlimited use for power supplies.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This bill should be thoroughly investigated before we pass it. It surprises me that so many honorable members are ready, without the proper investigation of a proposal, to dip their hands, so to speak, into other peoples pockets to provide money for ventures of this sort. It may be said that the provision of £5,000 is  only a little thing, but I am satisfied that if we pass the bill there will be a demand in the future for a larger subsidy, and, ultimately, for a duty on motor fuel. Cheap motor fuel is essential for the development of this country, and I hope that nothing will be done to make it dearer. The honorable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin) urged that we should not use our shale deposits for the production of fuel oil, because they were too valuable for the production of lubricants. He has evidently been misinformed, for although Australian shales yield a fair percentage of kerosene, they do not yield the lubricating oils required for heavy motors.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

While those shales produce lubricating oils suitable for low-power engines, they do not produce lubricants fit even for a tractor, let alone a locomotive. I feel quite certain that every member of this House is satisfied that a bounty of £5,000 will be of little use to this company. The honorable member for Wide Bay (Mr. Corser) said that the company was investing £1,000,000. If that is so, will it be influenced by a bounty of £5,000? It will not, of course, be satisfied with £5,000, but will come forward later and say that the bounty is not sufficient, to enable it to compete with the importers of petrol. It has to be further borne in mind that the whole of the £5,000 will not be paid to the distillers, for the growers will receive some of it. This country cannot afford to pay a heavier duty on petrol, for the motor car and tractor have become essential to national development. Surely honorable members do not want to make the life of the man on the land harder by increasing the cost of production. Almost everything done by Parliament in the last four or five years has tended to increase the cost of production. An example of the. effect of increasing the cost of production is seen in the Mount Morgan mine, which supports tens of thousands of people, and may have to close down in the near future. It lost £170,000 last year, not because of a decrease in the quality of the output, but because of the increase in the costs of production. The future prosperity of Australia depends upon keeping the costs of production low.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have been induced to agree with him by a careful study of the second-reading speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Pratten). Reading between the lines of that speech, I gather that even the Minister regards the provision of this bounty as more or less experimental. The mixed reception that the bill has received justifies honorable members in referring it to a committee. The committee should report within a maximum period of six weeks. If the honorable member for Perth would agree to a time limit being fixed, every member of the House should accept his amendment. If the acceptance of the amendment would seriously delay the ultimate determination of this vital question, I should oppose it, but it would not do so, and it is a quite reasonable proposition. The subject is one of very great importance. The honorable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde), who contributed an excellent speech to this discussion, and displayed the results of a large amount of research, has expressed dissatisfaction with the bill because the bounty is inadequate and no assistance is provided for the production of power alcohol from molasses. On the other hand, the honorable member for Macquarie (Mr. Manning), has given notice of an amendment to extend the bounty to power alcohol produced from prickly pear. The Minister stated in his speech that the possibility of the commercial production of power alcohol from prickly pear had  not yet been proved. All these questions should be properly considered. The more I see of the way in which legislation is pushed through this House without adequate time for deliberation, the more I am convinced of the value of the practice of the House of Commons of referring to committees important questions involving the expenditure of public money. The proposed expenditure is limited in this instance, but in the future, if the industry is established, it will probably be very greatly increased. I am reluctantat all times to oppose bills de signed to assist in the economic development of Australia. I recognize the importance of encouraging the production of power alcohol, but at the same time I urge that such a big subject should be properly investigated by a committee appointed for the purpose. Parliament could then be informed of all the facts. The committee could ascertain whether the proposed bounty is adequate, and consider also the incidental fact that the price of petrol has been decreasing. Whether this country can produce power alcohol on a satisfactory basis, in view of the possibility of further reductions in the price of petrol, is a question that should be investigated. I sincerely trust that the Minister will accept the suggestion of the honorable member for Perth. Ican see no logical reason for opposing it. The bill is not urgent, and as it involves the expenditure of public money, it could well be delayed for a month or six weeks.","Second Reading","POWER ALCOHOL BOUNTY BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The salary was raised to £2,000 in 1917, and has not since been increased. The salaries paid to railway commissioners in Australia and throughout the world have materially increased of late years. The responsibilities of the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, who also acts as Engineer-in-Chief of the Commonwealth Railways, have greatly increased. Mr. Bell has under his supervision at the present time, amongst other things, the construction of the railway bridge over the Katherine River in the Northern Territory; the extension of the railway to Daly Waters, a distance of 160 miles; the survey of wharf site and route for a railway, Pellew Island to Borroloola, Northern Territory, and the design of wharf and railway in connexion therewith; the design and lay-out of new shipping arrangements, wharf, &c, at Darwin ; and with the Chief Commissioner of New South Wales, and the Commissioner of Queensland Railways, is in control of uniform-gauge works, embracing (a) the construction of the standard-gauge railway, Kyogle, New South Wales, to South Brisbane, Queensland; (b) the relaying and relocating of the Grafton to Kyogle railway ; the extension of the QueanbeyanCanberra railway, including the construction of bridges over the Molonglo River and Jerrabomberra Creek, the design of special station accommodation at Canberra; the taking over of the management and maintenance of the Port Augusta-Oodnadatta railway from the 1st January, 1925; the survey and construction of the first section of the north-south railway; and the construction of a direct broad-gauge railway from Port Augusta towards Adelaide. In the circumstances. I suggest that the present CommonwealthRailways Commissioner is not being adequately paid. I may state, for the information of the House, that the Chief Railways Commissioner of New South Wales receives £5.000 per annum, and two Assistant Commissioners receive £2,500 each, a total of £10,000 per annum. In Victoria the Chief Commissioner receives £5,000 a year, two assistants £1,750 each, a total of £8,500. In South Australia the Chief Commissioner receives £5,000 a year, and an Assistant Commissioner £1,350, a total of £6,350. The Queensland Railways Commissioner receives £2,000 a year, the Deputy Commissioner £1,000, and a third Commissioner, £900, a total of £3,900. In Western Australia the Railways Commissioner receives £2,000, in Tasmania the Commissioner receives £2,000, and in New Zealand the Commissioner of Railways receives £2,500 a year. It is understood that the general manager of the Midland Railway, Western Australia, receives a salary of £2,000 a year, and the right to take fees for outside work. I am informed that this is so, but I make the statement subject to correction. I have had some little to do with Mr. Bell during the last ten or twelve months, and when we realize the enormous amount of work he has to perform, the responsibilities devolving upon him, and the fact that federal property totalling in value something like £12,000,000 is under his control, it will be admitted that it would be false economy to appoint to his position a man who did not possess the highest talent and experience.","Second Reading","RAILWAYS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I say at once that that is no reason why a man in the position of Railways Commissioner should not be given adequate remuneration for the services he renders the country. If we compare the salary paid to Mr. Bell with the salaries paid to railways commissioners in some of the larger states, we shall find that the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner receives very much less than do some of the state commissioners. Mr. Bell may feel that for his services he is entitled to similar remuneration to that paid to. the Chief Railways Commissioners in the states. I believe that he is a very competent man for the position he occupies. I know of no complaint against his administration since he has held that position. I know, too, that he is very attentive to the duties of his office. It does not follow that because there is a loss on the operations of the Commonwealth railways Mr. Bell is in any way to blame for it. I agree with the Minister that it would be absolutely impossible for any man to make the Commonwealth railways pay at this juncture. Whatever the future may bring forth, no man who voted for the construction of the transcontinental railway, or the taking over of the Northern Territory railway anticipated that they would be profitably operated for some years. We must have population in the Northern Territory, and a considerably larger population along the transcontinental line before a return can be looked for. It was admitted by honorable members when the construction of the transcontinental railway was approved, that it was needed chiefly for defence purposes. I think every one realized that it was absolutely impossible to make it a paying concern from the start. I do not think that any honorable member expects it to be a paying concern in the immediate future. The question is whether the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, in view of his great responsibilities, and the amount of capital involved in Commonwealth undertakings, is entitled to remuneration something similar to that paid to railways commissioners elsewhere. Looking at the matter from that point of view I do not intend to oppose this measure.","Second Reading","RAILWAYS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not care which of these lines is built. I should like to reply to the Minister for Railways by saying that South Australia did not foist upon the Commonwealth something that would not pay. It gave a great asset to the Commonwealth, but those who have held office in the Commonwealth subsequent to the transfer of the Northern Territory have fallen down upon their jobs, and have not known how to administer it.

The Leader of the Opposition has suggested that the transcontinental railway was built as a strategic defence line. Nothing of the sort.

I shall vote, against the bill, and if any one will call  No  with me shall take the matter to a division. I am aware that an honorable member who opposes increases of salary is like one crying in the wilderness. The present tendency in this Parliament is to increase our own salaries and then increase the salaries of heads of departments as a. sort of excuse for increasing our own. I realize, of course, that the Commonwealth railways could not be worked at a profit, but I know that on the advice of the gentleman who is managing them the Government has recently taken over the running of the line between Quorn and Oodnadatta, with every prospect of increasing the present loss upon it. In the past the staff and rolling stock employed on that railway could be transferred to the haulage of wheat and ore, when cattle were not moving, but now they will remain idle for from five to seven months of the year unless the line is continued to Alice Springs. When the honorable member for. Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) was Minister for Works and Railways, I wrote to him pointing out what: the department was doing. It is the same old game - heads of departments trying to increase their departments so that they may draw larger salaries; and recognizing that this is not in the interests of the Commonwealth, I shall vote against the bill. The Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce) looks at me for saying that, but as a result of my personal inquiries I guarantee that at the end of twelve months the Commonwealth will find that it is losing money on the Oodnadatta line, and that it would have been a far better proposition to leave its control in the hands of the state. The Minister (Mr. Hill) has told the House that the Commissioner for Railways in South Australia is paid a . salary of ?5,000 a year. Previously the salary paid was about ?2,000 a year, and at that time the Commissioner was running a bigger proposition than all the Commonwealth railways to-day.

In fact, it is the most innocuous measure I have ever been called upon to consider. It is more a committee bill than a second-reading bill. It contains one clause only, and although I may be out of order at this stage in referring to clauses the sole proposal of. this solitary clause is to omit the word  two  and insert in lieu thereof tha word three.- Its charming simplicity appeals to me-. If the figures ran into thousands I could understand the honorable member for Angas (Mr. Gabb) discussing the matter with the animation which always characterises him when it is a question of reducing peoples emoluments. But I remind the honorable member that the Bole proposal is to substitute  three  for  two. There is only one figure less than  two  and that is  one. If we followed the good example now being set by the Minister, and in the consideration of the emoluments of honorable members omitted  one  and substituted two it is very likely the proposal would have the whole-hearted support of this Parliament with one exception. I do not want it to be thought that I am indulging in any unfriendly criticism of the honorable member for Angas. I have the greatest respect for the courage with which he always supports his opinions, and the fact that on occasions I do not agree with him on such delicate questions as this is probably not his fault, because while he views the matter in the cold light of reason, I confess myself, like other members of this House, gently moved in such matters by self interest. The honorable member suggests that because the Commonwealth railways are not paying, and, infact, are being run at a loss it is unbecoming that before redressing this unfortunate condition of affairs wo should proceed to increase the beggarlysalary drawn by the Commissioner.","Second Reading","RAILWAYS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

690,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BRENNAN, Frank","JSC","N/A","N/A","N/A",1425,"- I argue for the sake of argument in quite a different way. I say thatif we are los ing money upon this undertaking as a result of paying our Commissioner £2,000 a year it is perfectly obvious that we must increase his salary, and keep on increasing it until the railways pay. Seeing nothing wrong in that argument, I propose to carry it further, and suggest that the increase should be made general, and applied also to the men employed on the railways. There are many of them whose salaries appear very insignificant when they are compared with those paid to others doing similar work in other departments, and I suggest that the time is ripe, when we are considering the salary of the Commissioner, for reviewins the salaries of the workers employed in the Commonwealth railways and making them nearly appropriate to the services rendered by them. I am afraid I am digressing slightly from the central point of the bill, which is to substitute  three  for  two, but to-day we have been dealing with millions. I could not bring myself to remain in the chamber while the Treasurer read that dreadful message which is known as the budget, but I have heard that it dealt with our £500,000,000 debt, which we seem to take very cheerfully, and that there has also been a proposal to ladle out a bounty for the production of power alcohol. It seems to be a day of beneficence and benevolence with us, and as we are substituting  three  for  two  in regard to the salary of the Commissioner for Railways I suggest that the benevolent spirit manifested to-day and which is so appropriate to the Christmas season be extended to all classes of workers upon- the Commonwealth railways.Debate (on motion by Mr.Foster) adjourned.","Second Reading","RAILWAYS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At the present time the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of the states in which cotton is grown are co-operating to encourage the industry by guaranteeing a price for the cotton produced. This is based upon the quality of the cotton, and has varied from 31/2d. to 51/4. per lb. for the cotton seed. This guarantee has encouraged the growing of cotton by assuring to the growers an immediate return upon their product as soon as it reached the ginneries. It has also given considerable stability to the industry. Rut difficulties have arisen in regard to it, and there is a difference of opinion as to whether it provides the best means for assisting the industry. It was recently represented to the Government that a more effective method of stimulating cotton-growing would be to substitute a Commonwealth bounty for the guarantee. This proposal has been very fully considered, and the Government is sympathetically disposed towards it. Ministers believe that, by it, difficulties which have arisen in the industry may be removed. But it is impossible to substitute a bounty system for the present guarantee in relation to the 1925 crop. Beforea bounty can be given it is necessary that a full inquiry shall be conducted by the Tariff Board, and enabling legislation will have to be passed. Careful consideration must also be given to the organization of the finances of the industry. At present, as I have said,the growers get immediate payment at the guaranteed price when their cotton is delivered at the ginneries, and if a bounty is substituted, we must be satisfied of the arrangements made in this respect. The bounty cannot be arranged for in connexion with the coming crop. But, as honorable members are aware, the planting is now taking place, and any delay in informing the growers as to what is proposed for the present season would interfere with their operations. Consequently I say now that the Government considers it necessary to continue for the financial year 1925-6 the guarantee system which has obtained for the past two years. 1 am in communication with the State Governments concerned, with a view to determining the exact basis upon which the guarantee for the 1925-6 crop shall be given, and I hope to announce at an early date the basis decided upon. The manner in which a bounty can be substituted for the present guarantee system has been referred to the Minister, for Markets and Migration (Senator Wilson), so that he may go into the whole subject; and in the event of the substitution of a bounty for the present system of guarantees, make the necessary reference to the Tariff . Board.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/para[3]","N/A","N/A"

We cannot produce -cotton, even with the assistance of a guar antee or a bounty, and send it overseas to compete with the cotton produced in other countries. We should also give some assistance to the cotton manufacturers in the Commonwealth. At present, £15,000,000 worth of manufactured cotton goods is coming into the Commonwealth every year. Some honorable members have had an opportunity of seeing what is being done in New South Wales. 1 trust that at an early date an announcement will be made concerning the policy of the Government in the direction of assisting manufacturers of cotton goods. I believe such a proposal would have the support of a majority of honorable members.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
