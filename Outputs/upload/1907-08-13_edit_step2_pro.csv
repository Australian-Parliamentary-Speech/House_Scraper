I understand that in such cases it is intended not to give to the importers at the first port of call an advantage over their fellows at the other ports. I have received a letter from Mr. W. R. Anderson, of Geelong, who says that he has goods on board the steam-ship Kent, which reached Adelaide last Monday week, and on board the steam-ship Narrung, which reached that port last Tuesday. He points out that the Adelaide importers by those vessels will obtain an advantage over him unless he is allowed to land his goods at the rates provided for in the old Tariff. I have also had a similar request from Messrs. Bright and Hitchcock, importers, Geelong.","TARIFF","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/question[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Those importers are in a position very different from that of merchants who, onThursday last, had goods in bond, because bonded goods can be cleared at anytime, and those who kept their goods in bond until after the new Tariff came into operation did so on their own responsibility. If a vessel had touched at Fremantle, or any other Australian port, before the new Tariff came into operation, but had not visited all her Australian ports of call, the consignees of goods at the ports which she had not visited would not have had an opportunity to take possession of them on paying the old rates of duty.","TARIFF","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The matter is one for the Minister of Trade and Customs to deal with ; but, as I have been asked a question with regard to it, my reply is that I do not think it fair to differentiate between shippers by any vessel which had touched at one Australian port before the coming into operation of the new Tariff, but had not visited all her Australian ports of call. If means can be devised for treating all such shippers alike, I hope they will be adopted. Of course, I leave the matter entirely in the hands of the Minister of Trade and Customs; but I should advise him to try to meet consignees at ports other than the first port of call, who could not land their goods before the introduction of the new Tariff.","TARIFF","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/answer[1]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Once a vessel has called at any port of Australia, she must be regarded as having entered the Commonwealth, and ought to be able to land her goods at all her. Australian ports if payment is made on them in accordance with the Tariff rates prevailing at the time of her first reaching Australia. Therefore I think that the position of importers by any vessel that had touched at one Australian port at the date of the introduction of the new Tariff, should be taken into consideration.","TARIFF","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/question[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We expected a great deal more, he said. The proposed duty on hats, caps and bonnets has been fixed at 35 per cent., and at 30 per cent., against Great Britain.Mr. Geo. Bruce, chairman of the Denton Hat Mills, observed that a duty of 30 per cent. barely covered the difference between wages here and in competing countries - if it did cover it. In some cases the proposed duty was not sufficient.In considering those statements will he bear in mind the following extract from the report of the Chairman at the last annual meeting of the Denton Hat Mills Company -The year had been more successful than he had anticipated. The last alteration in the Tariff, as regarded hats, was a reduction, but the effect of this was more in shifting trade from one source to another than towards any diminution.

Knowing that they are sensible men, I am inclined to believe that they have not taken the responsibility of doing what has been attributed to them.

I am of opinion that the charges do not constitute an offence under the Regulations. The only one it, I think, could be considered to come under if any would be 23 of 236.  Being an officer, behaves in a scandalous manner unbecoming the character of an officer and a gentleman.Iam of opinion that the Regulation was not intended to include any act unbecoming a gentleman, such as evading a debt of honour by pleading the Gaming Act ; but something that is, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, behaving in a scandalous manner unbecoming the character of an officer and a gentleman.The Crown Solicitor was then asked whether the Department had any power under the Defence Act to take further action, and his reply was that any further action could not be taken under the Act or Regulations, because Lieutenant Russell had not committed any breach of same ; and, further, that, in his opinion, evading the payment of a debt by pleading the Gaming Act is not an offence against the Regulation quoted, although no gentleman would be likely to do it. The question of amending the Regulations with a view of providing for cases similar to that under notice is now under consideration.","LIEUT.

This relates entirely to imported animals, and the question involved is one of great moment. It is absolutely impossible for any quarantine officer who is not a qualified veterinary surgeon to make a careful inspection of imported animals, and give any valuable opinion as to whether they are or are not diseased. The amendment would apply merely to imported animals, and would require the appointment of a qualified veterinary surgeon only at certain fixed ports. I can quite believe that no Minister would attempt to administer this Act without the services of such an officer. The Attorney-General must admit that it is essential that the quarantine officer, whose duty it will be to examine imported animals, should be a veterinary surgeon, as otherwise his inspection would be valueless. In view of the amendment foreshadowed by the Minister, it is still more necessary to secure the services of a qualified veterinary surgeon for this work. My amendment would not apply to the inspection of animals transferred from one State to another.

In the first place, that sub-clause provides that if the imported animals are accompanied by a certificate of  an approved veterinary surgeon at the port of shipment, a certain procedure shall be adopted. Why should we apply to the port of shipment certain essentials which the Minister says we are incapable of applying to the port of landing?

I admit the justice of the Ministers contention that there are States officers who are as competent as are veterinary surgeons to examine stock; but the honorable gentlemans wish to safeguard the rights of those officers can be very easily observed, whilst at the same time we agree to the spirit of this amendment. All that is required is a slight verbal alteration, or the granting of a reserve power to the Minister, if he wished it, to keep in employment States officers possessing  approved  qualifications. In reply to the honorable member for Corangamite, the Minister laboured the injustice which he said would be done to States officers if the amendment were inserted. I should be very sorry to think that we should be so sensitive to the rights of States officers as to expose to the risk of infection the now healthy flocks of Australia. This amendment is really a safeguard against the introduction of disease which might prove absolutely destructive to the numerous stock upon which the prosperity of the country depends. If we are to consider existing rights, let us, at any rate, give first attention to the right of the people of Australia to keep their stock as free as possible from disease. If the amendment, having that object in view, is sound in principle, a consideration for the rights of this or that officer should not weigh for a moment with the Committee as against a desire to insure the safety of the stock of the continent. In the light of sub-clause 2 of clause 53, I shall have to review the decision at which I arrived at an earlier stage, when I took the view that the appointment of officers was properly a question of Executive responsibility. In. view of the provisions of that sub-clause, and for other reasons that have been submitted, I think it might be wise to insert the amendment. 1 therefore earnestly suggest to the Minister the desirableness of his adopting, at all events, the principle of the amendment, even if he cannot accept it i?i toto.","N/A","QUARANTINE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[3]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Let me quote my own experience. After I had had eight years of close study in London hospitals, devoting myself during that time to pathology, I came out to Australia and went in for farming. I considered that my knowledge of pathology might be of some advantage to me in working amongst animals. But I felt that it was necessary to get further instruction in veterinary work. I therefore came to Melbourne, and went through a course of instruction at the Veterinary College, under Mr. Kendall. I devoted myself to a special class of study designed for farmers, and passed through that course. Since then I have had hundreds of horses and cattle, thousands of sheep, and a great number of pigs through my hands. But notwithstanding all the experience I have had in one way and another, publicly and privately, I always call in a qualified veterinary surgeon when any difficulty arises in connexion with my own stock. As that is what I do in private life, surely I am only faithful to my trust to the people when, in dealing with a matter of great public importance, I insist that the Government shall avail itself of the assistance of properly qualified veterinary surgeons for work of the kind contemplated under this Bill. Australia has been, is, and will be, so long as the temper of honorable members and of members of the States Parliaments throughout Australia remains as it is with regard to veterinary science, behind the times.

But if Tasmania has been behind the times in the matter of veterinary science, she will continue to be so unless she recognises that to become an efficient veterinary surgeon a man must be qualified not only by practical experience, but also by a course of study.

We are grateful to Tasmania for many things, though we are not always grateful to the honorable member for his lectures. The point at issue is that my amendment simply asks the Government to say that at all times, when imported animals have to be inspected, the work should be done by men who know something about the diseases of stock, and about the business of examination, and who do not proceed merely by rule of thumb. Take the case of a man who is qualified as a veterinary surgeon, and who is a member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons of London. Such a man is a scientist. A man who has gone through the course of instruction that is prescribed at the present day, and who is finally turned out as a M.R.C.V.S., commands respect on account of his science in any part of the world. I am well aware that we cannot get a sufficient number of members of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons to carry out the work under this Bill. But, nevertheless, there are sufficient men in Australia, some of them excellent veterinary surgeons, who have had practical experience, and who have gone through a course at the Melbourne Veterinary College or elsewhere. They command respect as professional men of high standing. What is required in Australia is that when such men have qualified themselves they shall have a chance of employment in this class of work.- No man, no matter what his experience with stock may have been, is qualified to discharge functions under this Bill unless he has studied the diseases of stock pretty deeply. It has to be recollected that the quarantine officers who will have to examine stock will require a knowledge, not only of the ordinary diseases of animals which occur from day to day on a farm, but also of the diseases of imported stock, some of them of an obscure character. Unless a man has studied veterinary science he is not qualified, and any certificate that he may give is not worth the paper upon which it .is written.

It would be a standing disgrace if we permitted the present position in regard to veterinary science in Australia to continue. This is the national Parliament, and we ought to do something to encourage the States Parliaments to take some steps in the direction I have indicated. It would never do to permit, on sentimental considerations, unqualified men to continue to examine stock; we ought to be brave enough to say that qualified men must be employed upon such work. In the case of human beings, we regard all unqualified men as  quacks  ; and, in my opinion, unqualified inspectors, in the case of stock, are quacks, and, therefore, a danger. For example, the other day, in a case quoted in the newspapers, an inspector declared an animal to be suffering from the bot fly, whereas, on examination, the animals liver was found to be disintegrated, and it was shown to be suffering from pleurisy.

155,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"LIDDELL, Frank","L1H","Hunter","N/A","N/A",1758,". - In order that honorable members might satisfactorily discuss this Bill, the Attorney-General was good enough to place in our hands certain papers, which I understand he has collected for our inspection. One of these papers is a communication from Mr. S. W. Moore, Minister of Mines and Agriculture, New South Wales, and in it there is the following -Further, there is no provision in the Bill as to the status of the quarantine officer to carry out the inspection of imported animals. Obviously this officer must necessarily be a qualified veterinary surgeon, but, evidently, so far as the provisions of the Bill go, a Customs House officer could legally carry out the inspection if authorized. The absence of any reference to the veterinary staff which will necessarily be employed for the satisfactory administration of the provisions of the Bill, detracts from its value as the manner in which the provisions of the Bill are given effect to becomes optional, and is, therefore, an unsatisfactory substitute for the excellent system which has been so successfully adopted in this State for some considerable period.I point out to the Attorney-General, who has had a legal education, much in the same way as the honorable member for Corangamite had had a medical education, that all legislation of this kind should be guided by scientific principles. One of the first questions which a medical man is asked when he enters the witness-box is,  Are you a qualified medical practitioner ?  If the answer is in the affirmative, the evidence of such a witness carries considerable weight. And we would apply the same principle to the administration of this law. Enormous responsibilities will be placed in our hands if this Bill is passed. We propose to take from the States certain of their responsibilities, and necessarily it behoves us to discharge them satisfactorily. If an imported beast were condemned and killed, and action brought against the Commonwealth for damages, and if the Minister had to tell the Court,  This man, who is an excellent officer, has been looking after cattle, sheep, and pigs, he would be asked, Is he a legally qualified man? He would have to reply, No; he is not. The Court would say,  Oh ! then on his evidence you destroyed the beast? In such circumstances, any jury would, without hesitation, give a verdict for the plaintiff. On that ground, I suggest to the Minister that he should adopt the amendment of the honorable member for Corangamite.","N/A","QUARANTINE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
156,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"KELLY, William","KEA","Wentworth","N/A","N/A",1758,".- I should like to supplement what I have already said on this subject on one point. The Minister appears to consider that we are now rediscussing a matter which was settled in Committee some days ago. He evidently thinks the same principle is at stake, but he will find it is not so if he looks at this and the adjoining clauses. The last time the question was touched upon, the honorable member for Corangamite sought to provide that every quarantine officer who might be called upon to perform any of the duties under this Bill must be a duly qualified veterinary surgeon, but he was beaten. A majority of honorable members thought it would be tying the hands of the Executive too much to take such a step. The Minister will find that the present proposal applies only to this clause. It declares that before animals are handed over to the importer, and left free to mingle with the herds of Australia, they shall be declared clean from disease. Surely that is a very fair safeguard. Had it related to the previous clause, which makes it necessary that a quarantine officer should order stock into quarantine, I should have regarded it as unnecessary. The question before us is not that of ordering stock into quarantine as in clause 52, or of examining and ordering into quarantine as in clause 55, but is a question of allowing stock out of quarantine, and the least we can do, having due regard to our responsibilities, is to impose some such safeguard as has been recommended by the honorable member for Corangamite. The medical fraternity seem to be agreed on this point, and the report read by the honorable member for Hunter appeared thoroughly to substantiate our position. I therefore urge the Minister to insert this provision in this one clause. It will not tie his hands with, regard to any other clause of the Bill. If he wishes to safeguard the rights of existing and qualified State officers by exempting them from the amendment of the honorable member for Corangamite, I am sure that honorable member will be only too ready to meet him half way, if, by so doing, he is not sacrificing the public interests. I know the Minister is skilled at drafting amendments, for I have often seen him suggesting them from almost the same place as that now occupied by the honorable member for Corangamite.","N/A","QUARANTINE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I prefer the man of much experience to the man who has only just passed his examinations. When we imagine that we are ill, we go, not to the young doctor, however brilliant his university career may have been, but to the practitioner of experience. We could not obtain the services of veterinary surgeons of long-standing at out-of-the-way places, and therefore if we insisted on the appointment of veterinary surgeons to such ports, we should Gave to take men who had only just qualified. There is this safeguard against the introduction of disease, that, if Parliament were sitting when diseased animals were admitted, the Government would very soon be asked for an explanation.

There is not much in the contention that, if veterinary surgeons were* employed, the present State officers would lose their positions ; because the only occasions upon which veterinary surgeons will be absolutely necessary will be when certain beasts have to be examined. I recognise that we could not have a veterinary surgeon always on- the spot at every port of landing ; such men would not be always available at places like Normanton and other ports of large stock districts.

L should be very loath to indict the latters engineering capacity, but I cannot see that his bridge provides a safe passage for quarantined animals into Australia. To provide, as the Minister desires, that the animals have to be passed by a quarantine officer as  prescribed  merely . inserts the intention of  the Committee in the Bill, and that  is that the Government shall have power to prescribe who is to do all these things. It does not give any .indication to the Executive in the future that we intend that only the most highly-qualified officers shall do the work. For the Minister to provide that the officers are to be  as prescribed  is to give the Executive an even greater discretion in choosing their officers, whether qualified or not, than it would have without his amendment. I think that his bridge is a very unsafe one. It is one over which I should not like to send a dog, let alone all the stock we hope to see passing across it. The suggestion of the honorable member for Capricornia meets every objection which has been urged.

While I think that there should be some elasticity in the Bill with regard to Inter- State quarantine and the passing of stock across the borders, still I should relax no precautions so far as the ports are concerned, because, in my view, the safeguards there ought to be of the strictest possible character. Only the other day I read that in New Caledonia there are diseases, particularly a disease which is rapidly decimating dogs, which has not yet obtained a foothold in Australia. With these unknown and uninvestigated diseases in contiguity to Australia, it becomes a matter of the highest moment that the duly qualified officers under this Bill shall be officers who are certified as possessing the requisite knowledge and skill to perform the duties which it assigns to them. I hope that the Minister will consent to waive his amendment in favour of the course which has been suggested by the honorable member for Capricornia, and which provides the requisite variation in practice by the insertion of the words where available. Of course, if there is none of this skill available, then the next best skill must be obtained. Everything is provided for. But, so far as the main ports of Australia are concerned, I think that, in spite of the Bill, it ought to be a very solemn obligation on the Government to see that no one but a duly qualified veterinary surgeon shall take the oversight of the importation of stock. We cannot be too careful in our efforts to keep out diseases. There are some diseases which have not been introduced yet. When diseases are introduced, it seems to me that they thrive here in a way in which, perhaps, they do not thrive in any other country. One reason why we ought to have prohibition of diseases as far as possible is to be found in the ravages which they make, and in the facility with which they seem to spread and multiply once they get through the quarantine which we impose. With regard to the necessity of having the requisite skill for investigating these matters at the port of entry, we ought to remember that very often diseases are latent for a great length of time. I quoted here the other day the case of a dog which developed hydrophobia seven months after the time when it was proved that he took the disease into his system. That is a disease that we want to keep out of Australia if possible. That case, I think, occurred in the Island of Corfu, off the coast of Greece. One cannot imagine what would be the result to our stock if a disease like that broke out amongst our dogs.","N/A","QUARANTINE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

However, in order to meet the honorable members objection, and carry out more effectively the intention of the Government, it is proposed that the principle adopted should be that animals coming from all countries should come under these provisions.

The provision as it stands will, if passed, mean a very radical departure from the practice hitherto adopted in New South Wales. Camels, horses, dogs - in short, stock of every kind - on entering New South Wales, must undergo six months quarantine irrespective of whether or not they are free from disease. There is a long standing grievance among the people there regarding the way in which quarantine is evaded by resorting to practices obtaining in some of the other States. When we were last discussing this matter, I pointed out the difference between the treatment of dogs entering New South Wales, and that of dogs entering this State. Here, there used to be private quarantine, and I am assured that dogs intended to be imported into New South Wales were often put ashore at Melbourne, where they went into private quarantine, and were subsequently taken quietly across the border. If the clause be passed, it will mean, to say the least, a very radical departure from the quarantine system in force in New South Wales. There we do hot accept, any ones certificate as to the health of an imported animal. It is put into quarantine the moment it arrives, and has to remain there for six months, so that any latent disease may have time to develop. I do not discuss for the moment the question of whether such a system is, in its entirety, a wise one. Perhaps it is a little severe, but, at any rate, it is safe, and our first obligation, with regard to the quarantining of animals is to insure security from disease. Shall we have sufficient security under the Bill as proposed by the Minister? We are told that it will be within the discretion of the Minister to permit imported stock to forego quarantine.","N/A","QUARANTINE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[22]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

After sufficient time has elapsed to prove beyond possibility of cavil that there is no danger of any latent disease breaking out, then, and only then, should they be admitted into the interior of Australia. Had such precautions been taken years ago, Australia would have avoided losses amounting to millions of money in respect of stock that have fallen victim to various fell diseases.

I do not think that it is really necessary, because without it the period of quarantine in regard to any particular animal could be prescribed. Where there is very little danger, of course the regulations could prescribe the shortest period possible. But if there were such a likelihood the quarantine could by regulation be extended. The Bill will work automatically in the ratio of the increasing fear. But unless the Minister is very cautious, and provides for regulations to neutralize the clause in respect of some animals, it may very well be that diseases will be imported which will be disastrous to our flocks and. herds. In Western Australia camels have been allowed to land which are spreading one of the direst diseases to stock. I dare say that the Minister over there would have said beforehand that there was not the slightest danger. But it has occurred, and it behoves us to be very careful that fresh diseases are not introduced.","N/A","QUARANTINE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[25]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A little while ago, in Tasmania, some animals freshly imported from England developed warbles, which is a well-known disease of cattle, after they had been in quarantine for some time. That stock was apparently clean and healthy when it landed. Had the animals been liberated the disease would have been spread throughout the State. Animals from outside Australia should certainly go into quarantine until after a very rigid examination. If this precaution be not taken, all sorts of pests will be introduced, which will simply decimate our flocks and herds. I agree that the clause is not required at all. Every provision has been made for the free interchange of stock between States, and we do want if we can to stop the importation of diseases such as that which the honorable and learned member for Angas has indicated as having been introduced by camels into Western Australia.

Where the Governor-General is satisfied that any laws or regulations of a State, or of an authority constituted under a State, with respect to the introduction of animals or plants into the State-are in part or in whole unnecessary for the purpose of preventing the introduction of disease into the State, andhave the effect of interfering with freedom of trade or commerce among the States, the Governor-General may, by proclamation, direct that those laws or regulations shall cease to apply, or shall apply subject to such restrictions, limitations, or modifications as he directs.This clause affects the introduction of animals or plants from one State to another. Where plants or animals are being introduced into a State, and the regulations of that State, which are in whole or in part unnecessary for the purpose of preventing the introduction of disease, have the effect of interfering with the freedom of trade and commerce amongst the States, the Governor-General is given power by proclamation to direct that those regulations shall cease to apply; or, if they do apply, he may direct that they shall apply with such restrictions, limitations, or modifications as he may direct. The object is to prevent the unreasonable use of such powers by a State. They may be used not merely to prevent the spread of diseases, but practically to stop trade. The honorable member for Brisbane submitted an amendment, which honorable members opposite preferred at the time, in which he endeavoured to provide that certain powers should not be exercised unless the Governor-General certified that the execution of such powers by a State operated in a manner prejudicial to the interests of any other State of the Commonwealth.

No doubt the Minister will have power, from time to time, to suspend the operation of a State law if he so pleases ; and he may do that in the case of one State, and not of the five other States. If trouble arose, after a time, on pressure being brought to bear, the Minister might settle the question by stating that the particular law of the State had obstructed the passage of animals from one State to another. This is not saying that the Federal law should be substituted for a State law. That question has already been dealt with ; and we have settled how our regulation shall be substituted for those of the States. While not forgetting States laws, we are taking power from time to time, as occasion requires, to suspend the operation of the laws of a particular State in relation, not only to animals - the dealing with which has been left to the Federation - but in relation to plants, the dealing with which has not been left to the Federation. In clause 13, we have recognised a desire that, for the present, we should not altogether supersede the laws of the States in respect to plants; and we declare that our regulations shall not be called into operation except in the case of a State not exercising the power which it possesses. But we are now interfering with a State by declaring that, not only in regard to animals, but also in regard to plants, the law of that State shall not operate any longer. In the first place, is this expedient ? I do not think so, because it means the suspension of the law of a particular State for a particular purpose. That may place the Commonwealth in rather an invidious position. For those who do not wish to go the full length of throwing out the whole clause, it might be as well to start with an amendment to strike out the words  or plants, so as to make the clause consistent with the Bill. The object of that would be to prevent this interference taking place with the fruit regulations of the States. I received a letter last Friday on this point from South Australia, expressing the opinions of the Fruit-growers Association, which is a very representative body there. They particularly asked that for the present, at all events, the State laws should be left absolutely unfettered as regards plants.

We said it was not to come into force until the Governor-General did a certain thing. What the honorable member suggests in this case is to impose a condition on the exercise of the power given by the clause to the Governor-General. In the other case, power was given to the Governor-General to condition the operation of the Federal law. It really was to the effect that the Federal law was not to supersede the State law, except in a certain event, to be declared by proclamation. This clause says that when a proclamation is issued, the State law is to go. The honorable member for Parramatta asks whether we cannot insert the qualification that the power of the Governor-General to issue the proclamation should itself be conditional. That could be done, but it would be somewhat anomalous. I would prefer to test the feeling of the Committee towards the clause by an amendment to strike out the words  or plants, so as to limit it to that extent at any rate.

This clause is not directed against that at all. Its object is to enable the Governor-General to say that the State laws are not required for the purpose of preventing disease, that they are causing friction between State and State, or that they are unnecessary. In clause 13 we put the words in for greater caution, so that if the State laws were inefficacious, for quarantine purposes, to prevent disease, we could then bring in the necessary provision to render the law effective. This, however, is for quite a different purpose; that if a State law, although considered by the State to be required for local purposes, is working so as to promote dissent on the part of another State, the Minister may step in and suspend its operation, thus settling a dispute between two States by suspending the operation of the law of one. If that is done it will lead to a good deal of friction. I do not know that we have power to do what is proposed. When the Defence Bill was before the House in 1903, it was questioned whether we could expressly repeal the laws of the States. There was a fairly long debate on the point, and, as usual, some sort of working compromise of opinion was come to, under which power was taken to declare that at a particular time, or for particular purposes, the Defence law of a State was not to operate. In that case the question of the validity of that reservation would never be tested, because our power of legislation as regards defence was practically exclusive, and the States had, therefore, no need for any of their local laws. The administration of the local law passed holus-bolus to us on the transfer of the Department to the Federation. All that was said by that Act was that the law that we, as a Federal Parliament, wanted to apply for the future, was the law as it existed upon the statute-book of the Federation, or on the statute-books of the States until the date when we had determined that the State laws should no longer apply. That was a matter purely concerning ourselves, but this is quite different, because, in this case, we shall be modifying, or attempting to some extent to repeal, the operation of the State laws, which, otherwise, would be concurrent with the law of the Federation. An attempted repeal, protanto, in the Defence Act - and the same applies to the Post Office Act - is therefore essentially different from the position we are now asked to take up in attempting to repeal the State laws, instead of allowing the repeal to be brought about through the principle of inconsistency. Whether we have that power, I do not presume to say. Some very competent authorities thought that there was an exceedingly great doubt as to its existence. Consequently, I do not think that from the very start we have ever expressly repealed an Act of a State.","N/A","QUARANTINE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[29]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In those instances the law of the future was to be purely a Federal law, and all that we did was - instead of administering the laws as passed by the States, which stood without any provision in them inconsistent with the Federal Act - to declare the particular time at which those laws would no longer apply. That, however, would be purely for Federal purposes, because the administration for the future would also be purely Federal. The clause says that if the Governor- General is satisfied -That any laws or regulations of a State ...have the effect of interfering with freedom of trade or commerce among the States- he may, by proclamation, direct that those laws or regulations shall cease to apply, or shall apply only subject to such restrictions, limitations, or modifications as he directs. If the State law or regulation does interfere with trade and commerce, it is bad under section 92 of the Constitution, and this express provision is not required to declare it so. The Minister says that it is intended to enable a litigant to rely upon the express declaration of a Federal Act - which he thinks would be conclusive, and probably it would - instead of challenging the interference on the ground that it was against section 92 of theConstitution. In the latter event, the litigants proof, instead of being a Federal Act, would be simply facts showing that there was such an interference, and that procedure, of course, might be more expensive for him. That is the only possible difference that can be made if paragraph b is passed. It may perhaps facilitate the proof of an offence against section 92 of the Constitution by having the fact that it did occur evidenced by a proclamation, although, of course, that it actually did occur would be no more sure because the Governor-General had said so. There might be no offence at all. The Courts might, if this clause were passed, have to take our fiat upon the matter as conclusive in a case where no jury would accept it or. the evidence. That possibility might perhaps outweigh the advantage of the greater facility given to a litigant to assert with conclusiveness that such an interference did exist. I prefer to leave section 92 of the Constitution - which is exceptional here, and is not in the American Constitution - unfettered in its operation, without having it safeguarded by the power we possess under paragraph 1. of section51 of the Constitution to make this further provision under the trade and commerce clause. On these grounds, I have great doubt as to the desirableness of passing the clause. At all events, I am inclined to vote against it, and, before doing so, to test to what extent it should be applied by moving the excision of the words  or plants. For the present, however, I merely indicate the possibility that I may move in that direction.","N/A","QUARANTINE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[29]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It will be remembered that in clause 13 we put in an amendment to the effect that paragraphs g, h, and i shall be put in operation only as a reserve act. In that clause we take the power, if necessary, -to step in and reinforce the quarantine which may be imposed by a State. Originally, clause 13, in paragraphs g, h, and i, provided that in certain cases the Governor-General may prohibit and declare. Then we passed an amendment which provides that the Governor-General shall prohibit and declare only in extreme and urgent cases. Iri other words, where the States are not doing their duty in the way of repressing certain diseases we shall have power, under that amendment, to step in and do the work for them. This new clause, I take it, is one which will enable the Federal Government to step in and give the States relief from each other. The normal condition of the Bill is that it is to leave in operation the State inspection laws as regards plants and animals. In that respect we do not contemplate interfering with the powers which the States exercise to-day. It is only in respect of the prohibition of diseases and the prevention of their spread from State to State that we take power, if necessary, to step in and reinforce their quarantine.The Attorney-General .submits to-day a new clause, providing that in cases where the Governor-General has satisfied himself that the State quarantine is harsh, he shall have the option of stepping hi to relieve that quarantine. My trouble is that it is not conditioned in the same way as was the repressive amendment which we passed last week.

In the Senate, the States are equally represented. The words  Governor in Council  do not necessarily imply parliamentary approval, they may mean merely the approval of this House. The other branch of the Legislature, which represents the States, may be altogether opposed to the action of the Ministry as represented by the Governor in Council. I can see sufficient reason for giving this Parliament power to annul a State law which interferes with freedom of trade, but I can see no reason why we should delegate that power to the Ministry of the day. When we come to look at the matter from the stand-point of freedom of trade as between the States, we cannot fail to remember that the framers of our Constitution decided upon the establishment of a special tribunal, namely, the Inter-State Commission, to deal with it. The Commission was to be a nonpolitical body, which would be free from bias, and which would not need to look for the support of a parliamentary majority. This tribunal was to view the matter from an all-round stand-point, in the interests of the whole of the States. The words  Governor in Council  really mean a parliamentary majority for the time being, and I do not think the power of dealing with the question of Inter-State free-trade should be delegated to such a body. I do not think that a parliamentary majority is the right tribunal to deal with these matters. I admit that by the method laid down in the Constitution their decision would rest with a parliamentary majority, but it would, at least, be a majority of both Houses of the Legislature, which is a very different thing from the decision of the Ministry of the day.","N/A","QUARANTINE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[33]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Upon the main point raised by the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, I think there is the gravest doubt as to whether this Parliament has power to annul any State Act which it was within the power of the State Legislature to pass. I ask the Attorney-General whether there is any authority for the adoption of the course which is proposed ? The same question arose in Canada, where the Supreme Court decided that such power was not vested in the Federal Parliament. In Lefroys Legislative Power in Canada, one proposition which the author says is established by authority is -There is no power given by the Confederation Act to the Dominion Parliament to amend or repeal an Act passed by a Provincial Legislature within the limits of its authority nor to the Provincial Legislatures to amend or repeal a Dominion Act.I may say that the State Parliament has just as much right to repeal a Commonwealth statute as the Commonwealth Parliament has to repeal a State statute. Under the Constitution, we have power to make laws covering a certain area, and if those laws are inconsistent with any laws passed by the States Parliaments, to the extent to which they are inconsistent, the State laws are overridden. By our substituting other provisions for those which exist under State legislation, we can secure an effective repeal of such legislation. Chief Justice Dorion, in the case of Dobie v. Temporalities Board, which is reported in /.CartrightsReports, puts the position thus -But it is important to remember that though the Dominion Parliament has no power directly and tolidemverbis to amend or repeal an Act passed by a Provincial Legislature within the limits of its authority, there are many cases where its legislation may have the effect of suspending the operation of valid provincial Acts.So it is with us. If we choose to pass any legislation upon the subject of quarantine which conflicts with any State law upon the same subject, the latter will, to the extent of the inconsistency, be rendered in- Operative. But we have no power beyond that. Here, however, we are simply attempting to annul the Acts which the States Parliaments have passed within the limits of their own authority. I urge the Attorney-General to give this matter his earnest consideration, because every step that we take which improperly overrides the legislation of the State authorities can only lead to vexatious litigation, to uncertainty, and ultimately to the humiliation of this Parliament. If the Attorney-General has any authority to cite in support of this proposition, I think that he ought to inform the Committee of it.","N/A","QUARANTINE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[34]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

314,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GLYNN, Patrick","KCO","Angas","N/A","N/A",1774,".- When the Minister last spoke, I tried to draw a distinction between the provisions of the Defence, and, I think, also of the Post and Telegraph Act, and those contained in this Bill. With all due respect to the honorable gentleman, I still consider that the distinction is very well founded. In connexion with the Defence Act, it must be remembered that the moment the States Defence Departments were taken over the whole administration of whatsoever defence laws were in force in the States at the time passed to the Federal Government, and there was no longer a concurrent power vested in the States. They had absolutely no power afterwards to pass an Act relating tq defence. The position is altogether different in connexion with the exercise by the Commonwealth of. its powers in respect to quarantine, because in connexion with this subject there is a -concurrent power in the States, as well as the Federal power, embodied in paragraph ix. of section 51 of the Constitution. We covered the whole field in our defence legislation. We took over the Defence Acts of the States, and administered them ; we added something to them, and we declared that after a certain time certain provisions of. the States. Acts should no longer be in force. In view of the fact that not only the legislative power, but also the administrative power, was vested in the one authority, it might have been competent for the Federal Parliament to pass such an Act as that. In this case, however, we allow the concurrent legislation of the States to continue. That is recognised by the general terms of this Bill, and by the proposed clause itself. This clause presupposes the existence of a concurrent power in the States, otherwise the Governor-General would be unable to say that the provisions of a State Act are working in restraint of Inter-State trade and commerce. We recognise the existence of the States Acts when we authorize the Governor-General to interfere with their operation. I do not wish to repeat what I said on that point, but I do think that inasmuch as we have from the beginning refrained from expressly repealing Acts of theStates, that fact indicates some doubt as to our power to do so. With the exception of the proposed clause, no attempt has ever been made to directly repeal a State Act either by Federal legislation or by the delegation of power to the Governor-General, and I doubt whether it is constitutional.The honorable and learned member for Bendigo, in his lucid speech, referred incidentally to our power to annul inspection laws of the States. I do not think that quarantine laws can- be considered as amongst those inspection laws. Looking through the matter from time to time, I find that distinctions are drawn between quarantine laws and inspection laws. Section 112 of the Constitution, which is the section giving the power to annul inspection laws, deals only with exports and imports. The commentary in Quick and Garran upon this section is confined to inspection for purposes connected with the operation of local trade laws, and- deals with such matters- as the size of parcels, and so on. I do not think that the power to annul inspection laws given by section 112 gives us any power to directly annul States quarantine laws. To test the question; I propose to move a limitation of the clause, but, even though it should be amended in the direction I am about to suggest, I still think it would be better to negative the clause altogether. I move -That the words or plants, line 4, be left out.I propose this amendment, because in clause 13 we have already declared that the power of the Federation in respect of Inter-State quarantine, as regards plants and goods, shall not be put in force unless upon evidence of neglect to take proper precautions under the States laws. I think it would be most unwise to take power under the proposed new clause to destroy States Acts by the delegation of a power to do so to the Governor-General.","N/A","QUARANTINE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[36]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Though I do not press the clause, I am still of opinion that it is quite within our competence to enact a clause of this description.  A desire was expressed by certain honorable members that while the States laws were to be left to the administration of the States authorities, if it were found that they were being administered in such a way as really to amount to a prohibition of trade and commerce under the guise of inspection or quarantine, there should be a reserve power in the Commonwealth to deal with the matter.","N/A","QUARANTINE BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[37]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member who interjects represents a very intelligent section of the community who mean to carry out the principle of spending all they can, and then coming for more. When the Minister talks about economy, I should like to draw his attention to one striking fact. In the year 1901-2 the Commonwealth returned to the States- no less than ^7,300,000. In 1906-7 it returned only j£6, 900,000. Much has been said about the surplus returned to the States in excess of the 75 per cent, of Customs and Excise Revenue required by the Constitution. But when we have before us a three months Supply Bill, and we find that ^242,000 is set down for contingencies, I urge that this Committee ought, for its own credits sake and in the interests of the people whom we represent, to  take a pull  of the expenditure of the Commonwealth. I am no prophet, and even if I were, a prophet, as the Scripture says, has  no honour in his cwn country, but I venture to say that, unless we do what I have said we ought to do, an expiatory period will come upon us in 1910, when the time for the expiration of the Braddon Blot section arrives.Honorable Members. - Hear, hear.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The pamphlet is so full of shocking pessimistic statements that I do not think we could have done worse than spend £100 in this way.

We learn from honorable members opposite that the Immigration League in New South Wales has received ,£150. I should say that the Victorian League should have received the whole lot, as it has told the truth. When the honorable member for Flinders was Premier  of Victoria, he pointed out in a speech at Nhill that the population was leaving the country districts of this State, and flocking to the towns. That is all that the pamphlet quoted. by the honorable member for Corio states so far as I could gather from the passages which he read. There is nothing in those passages that has not been said many times on the platform- in Victoria during the last ten years. It has been repeated over and over again that the reason why settlers do not come to this State is that we have not land for them to settle upon. We have heard many times that farmers have to leave Victoria to obtain land. In that respect, I believe that the pamphlet is on right lines, and I do not at all complain of the alleged misrepresentations as the honorable member for Corio has done. I wish to direct the attention of the Treasurer to a matter which I brought under his notice some time ago. I asked him whether he would do what I believe other Treasurers did prior to the occupancy of the office by the right honorable member for Swan, namely, pay the officers who have obtained increments their arrears out of the advance to the Treasurer. I wish to ask the honorable gentleman to state- whether he - has looked into that matter, and whether he intends to pay fifth class officers who are entitled to increments the arrears due to them at the present time? If he will not, I desire to know whether it is true that officers in other classes are being paid their arrears at the present time ; and, if so, what objection there is to treating fifth class officers in the same fashion.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Parliament voted .£5,000 for the encouragement of immigration. Out of that sum money has been paid to Immigration Leagues in Victoria and New South Wales. I do not object to money being spent for the purpose of encouraging legitimate  immigration in an honest and truthful manner. But I do object to the money of the Commonwealth, voted for a specific purpose, being applied to what I must describe as a scandalous misrepresentation of the actual state of affairs, at least in some of the States. A letter written by Dr. Arthur hasalready been quoted. That letter was not creditable to him as a man, and certainly it was very discreditable to the institution of which he is president. I intend to read it again. It was written to Mr. Marshall Lyle, of Melbourne, by way of instruction to him as to what he should and should not do in regard to the immigration movement. The letter said -We are putting boxes on the Himalaya, and Medic, both leaving to-day. Can you do the same, or get your Government to do so? This is a splendid work, which requires to be organized. All these hundreds of passengers are potential immigration agents. Dont mix up immigration and land settlement in your pamphlet. In fact, rather issue two. In the immigration book everything must be couleur de rose. No hint of difficulty about getting land. You need not be afraid you will be rushed. Even when Queensland offered cheap farms in London, there was only one applicant. As regards land settlement for home (Victorian) consumption, you can be as pessimistic and as indignant as you please. The blacker the better, though dont get too much on the line, What is the use of having the immigrants here, when we have nothing to offer them. That would choke off subscriptions.The only purpose for which the Immigration League seems to be run is to obtain subscriptions and keep going a movement that is not in the interests of the people of Australia -Anyhow, dont do anything to frighten off immigrants, because competition for them is so keen in Europe, and even if conditions change for the better in Victoria you might find that it was of no avail, as you had given the place a bad reputation.That, in my opinion is a clear indication that £150 has been paid over without any inquiry as to the method of the organization, or as to the object which the organization may have in view. But there is something stronger yet, in the way of corroboration and condemnation. I have here a letter, copied from the Barry Dock News, South Wales, as follows -MINERS AND NAVVIES FOR NEW SOUTH WALESTo the Editor of The Barry Dock News.Dear Sir, - There is a great demand at present, and will be for some time to come, for miners of all kinds, and pick and shovel men, in New South Wales. There has been such an expansion in the coal trade that hundreds of miners are needed at the various collieries on the North and South Coasts. There the wages are from 8s. a day upwards, men sometimes making 12s. or 15s. a day. But all the other kinds of mining need men also. Two thousand miners are required at Broken Hill, several hundreds at the Cobar Copper Mines, at from 11s. to 22s. a day, and small mines all over the country whether they be copper or gold or tin are advertising for men.Again, the Commonwealth Oil Corporation is asking for some hundred men for railway construction, and will soon be requiring an equal number of shale miners. The land at which this Corporation is operating is about 120 miles from Sydney, N.S.W., and good men may be certain of permanent work there.The New South Wales Government is also commencing the construction of a railway of over 300 miles in length, the cost of which is estimated at about three million pounds. This line will take five years to construct, so that continuous work can be guaranteed. Men, therefore, who are accustomed to the pick and shovel, and who understand blasting, and rock-butting, need have no hesitation to come to New South Wales, as the prospects offered them are better than anywhere else.The New South Wales Government is offering liberal assisted passages to miners and labourers. A number of Scotch and Welsh miners have already arrived, and others are expected.I have always understood that the object of the New South Wales Government was to induce people to place themselves on the land ; but it would appear, from what I have read, that the principal object is to invite immigrants to enter into competition with all except those who are engaged on the land.I shall be glad to supply further particulars if letters are addressed to me at the Immigration League of Australia, Sydney, Australia; or our London agent, at 36 King William-street, E.C., may be written to. - Yours, etc.,Richard Arthur, M.D., President,The Immigration League of AustraliaThere could be nothing stronger than that in the way of wholesale misrepresentation as to the state of affairs in New South Wales. We have the letter from Mr. Marshall Lyle advising that gentleman not to mix up the land question with that of immigration, and then we have the other, setting out that there is work galore in every other occupation, except that involved in land settlement. But even that is not all. I have here a letter from the Intelligence Bureau of New South Wales - the bureau to which the Premier of New South Wales wrote asking for help to dispose of immigrants about to arrive.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The following is the letter written by direction of the Premier of New South Wales -Intelligence Department,Phillip and Bridge Streets,Sydney, 20th April, 1907Sir,I have the honour, by direction from the Premier, to bring the following matters under your kindly notice.In view of the increasing numbers of immigrants that are now arriving week by week, we have to use every means to get into touch with employers of labour in the country districts who may be able and willing to take such immigrants and supply them with different classes of work.We have got into touch with large numbers of pastoralists, farmers and other employers who have intimated their requirements from time to time, but unfortunately we find that we are frequently not able to supply the exact class of labour needed at the time, and when it arrives in due course the vacancy may not exist. I have therefore found it necessary to take some steps to secure an immigration officer in each of the hundred leading towns of this State, who would inform this Department of any demand for labour in his district, and also receive, despatch and advise where necessary any new arrival in search of work. If we knew that there was a fair demand for labour of a certain class in any district, we might then safely send a certain number of immigrants to the immigration officer there with the confident hope that they would be duly placed, although we might not be able to indicate the exact employer to whom we were despatching each immigrant.I recognize very fully that your officers have already so many multifarious duties that it is with the utmost reluctance I felt myself compelled to ask the Premier to allow me to request you to authorize your officers to undertake another one, but in view of the fact that it is impossible to get sufficient services from private persons in many districts, and that no other class of public officers can do this work so well, I feel emboldened to trespass again upon your kindness in the event of your being able to allow the officers in the chief districts to assist in this way.The Premier has approved of an honorarium of 10s. each for every immigrant received from headquarters, and suitably provided with employment through the agency of such officers.I have been authorized also to ask all other Government Departments who have officers in country towns to urge such officers to keep in touch with the Police Department, and inform the local representative of that Department of all cases which come under their notice where immigrants can be effectively placed in rural labour. I therefore would express the hope that you will be able to assist in the way indicated by allowing your country officers to undertake the duty of reporting to me any avenues of employment for immigrants as agricultural labourers, mechanics, miners, or generalI have the honour to be,Sir,Your obedient servant, (Sgd.) H. C. L. Anderson,DirectorThen the following is given as the reply from the Inspector-General of Police -The above circular has been transmitted to every member of the Police Force, with directions from the Inspector-General of Police that the proposed duties be performed at ten bob (10s.) a head for each immigrant.Commonwealth money is, therefore, being spent in upholding a League which is inviting people to come to New South Wales by deceptions such as those published in the South Wales paper. When those immigrants arrive, every man in the State service, including all the officers and members of the Police Force, has to be employed to try to find a way whereby they can earn sufficient to live upon. The police officers are to be paid at the rate of ten  bob  a nob   for the services they render in finding employment for immigrants, for whom, according to this deceptive advertisement, there is work available in this country, while, as a matter of fact, there is no such work, except under the extreme conditions pointed out in the letter I have just quoted. What will the people of the old country think of the people of Australia, or of the Treasurer who is responsible for granting even £150 of public money to an organization to mislead them in England, and to deceive them when they come here? What will the people who have read Dr. Arthurs letter in that South Wales paper - copied as it has been into other papers throughout Great Britain, and the glowing account of trade and employment in New South Wales - think when they read the letters from those immigrants who have been bandied about from pillar to post at  ten  bob  a nob   by the New South Wales police in the effort to find them work at anything a week and their tucker? It is simply cruel, and is doing Australia more harm than anything that has happened hitherto. It is an unpardonable offence that public money should be paid to such a League without due investigation, and without that careful control which the Commonwealth Treasurer should exercise over funds entrusted to his care. It is an offence which should not be repeated by any future Treasurer.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[14]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is said in the letter I quoted that  they reluctantly applied to the police to put this extra duty upon the staff, because of the multitude of duties the Force have to perform already. We know that the  duties of the police are anything from A to Z. If a policeman has to waste his time asking employers, whether they have work available for immigrants who may arrive, but about whom he knows nothing personally, he will not have time for the duties which. he undertook to perform when he took his oath of office. The honorable member for West Sydney has some knowledge of Dr. Arthur, having been, I believe, associated with him in some matter, so that he speaks with authority and knowledge which I must respect. The state of affairs that has been revealed should not be tolerated by this Committee or by a Treasurer having control of the public funds. I trust that it will be made public, so that the people of New South Wales may learn, not only what these men are doing under the garb of an Immigration League, but what they are doing in the interests of another class of people for whom they are working. They profess to be actuated by a desire to populate Australia with the right class of people, and, while getting subscriptions to the League for that purpose, they use the money to deceive the British public, and to degrade the public sentiment of Australia. I have read those striking extracts so that, when sums are being voted for immigration in the future - an amount of £20,000 appears on the Estimates-in-Chief for the purpose - we may indicate clearly and unmistakably that no more money is to be expended in this way unless the Government have direct control, and that none shall be given to an irresponsible League to advertise a state of affairs that does not exist in Australia.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[14]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
564,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WATKINS, David","KX9","Newcastle","N/A","N/A",1793,".- I believe that Parliament voted £5,000 last year for the purpose of advertising Australia, but not necessarily to be spent directly to bring out any particular class of immigrants. We find now that some of the money has been given to people who are quite irresponsible - I say it with ali respect - so far as concerns the spending of Government funds. On the one hand, we have a complaint from the honorable member for Corio, that one branch which has received some of the money will not keep certain facts back, while on the other hand there has been a general complaint that another branch of the so-called Immigration League have been so misrepresenting the position in Australia as practically to have misapplied the money that was given them by the ex-Treasurer for the purpose of advertising the Commonwealth. Quite a number of these advertisements, which have been spread throughout the industrial centres of England, were sent to me to-day. The position of the coal mining industry in New South Wales has, at the instigation of the Premier of the State, been inquired into by the head of the Labour Department there, and, after an exhaustive investigation, he has been forced to admit that the supply of labour is equal to the demand. He adds the forecast - though in this I regard him as treading on very dangerous ground - that during the next twelve months perhaps 1,000 men may be absorbed. I have as intimate a knowledge of coal mining as is possessed by any man in this country, and I say that, if everything goes well with the coal trade for the next twelve months, and the output is doubled, openings may be afforded for the employment of a large number of additional men. But at the present time men who have arrived in our coal mining districts from the old world are absolutely disappointed with the conditions with which they have been met, and regard the promises made to them as unfulfilled, the fact being that, if no employment were given to the local labour now looking for work, the utmost endeavour could not find places for more than fifty additional hands. Do not these facts give the lie to the statements made by those in responsible positions in the State that hundreds of men can be employed in various avocations? The adoption of the methods referred to by the honorable member for Gwydir to secure work for the immigrants now here shows that the State authorities are at straits to fulfil their promises. If there were employment for 2,000 men at Broken Hill, and for another 2,000 in the Newcastle and Maitland districts, what need would there be to use all the Departments of the State to endeavour to find work for those who have come here? The efforts which are being made to secure openings for immigrants show that employment is not so easily obtained as has been made to appear. We have no right, when attempting to attract desirable immigrants to Australia, to hide the condition of things here. Last year this Parliament voted £5,000 to advertise the Commonwealth abroad, and this year it is proposed to vote £20,000. I say, let the truth be told when advertising our resources.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I trust that before more money is expended in that direction the Commonwealth Government will look into the matter, and have it put on a proper basis. It has been stated that the Premier of New South Wales has offered so much money to the police to get billets for immigrants. I was credibly informed more than two months ago that not one shilling but ten shillings per head was to be given to the police for each immigrant who was provided with employment. Knowing of the existence of that offer a young man in Sydney asked me to get him employment. I took him to the Intelligence Department and asked the authorities if they could find him a billet. They asked,  Is he an immigrant? I replied  No. He is a young Australian of good character and ability, who is out of work. Thereupon they said  We are not a labour bureau to get work for unemployed Australians. If he were an immigrant we would try to get work for him.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Unemployed men are no good to the community. Men should always be at work, and if it is impossible for a man to find work, the Government should do their best to find it for him. What I protest against -is that an office should be run at a large expense, and that a sum should be paid to the police to find employment for immigrants, while our own men are deliberately refused help.

The manufacturers, through their agents, have alleged throughout the State that the increased prices are consequent upon the Excise duties which they have had to pay upon the machinery. Since I came to Melbourne, I have ascertained that those firms appear on the schedule of firms exempted under the order of Mr. JusticeOConnor from paying Excise duties. I ask the Minister, before we begin the consideration of the Tariff, to instruct his officers to call upon each firm to produce their catalogue of prices for last year, as well as for this year. If, from a comparison of the catalogues, it should be found that my statement is correct, then it will be clear evidence that the firms have been deliberately robbing the farmers of the increase in the prices under the excuse that they had been charged Excise duties. Not only have they done that, but they have credited this Parliament with having done something which has made the cost of the machinery much dearer to the primary producer. I think it is the duty of the . Minister to have the matter investigated thoroughly before we proceed to consider the Tariff, so that we may know how to deal with these manufacturers.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[19]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I propose to pay increments upon salaries up to £160, which represents the maximum of the fifth class.

The Opposition are making only a reasonable request; but if we are not to be allowed the comfort of the early adjournment usual on Tuesdays, we must carry on the discussion. The honorable member for Corangamite has raised a number of interesting questions, and the most important point with which he has dealt is that relating to refunds of duty. The Treasurer has said that moneys collected in excess of the rates ultimately agreed to by the Parliament could hardly be refunded to the importers. The consideration which weighs very heavily with me, and, I think, will weigh with other honorable members; however, is that we are concerned, not with the question of whether or not an importer does his duty by his customers, but whether we do our duty by those who send us here, and our duty, so far as it lies within our power, under the Constitution. Honorable members will find that the Constitution provides that no money shall be appropriated to the Crown except with the consent of this House. The imposition of a duty is an appropriation of the peoples money; and if this House, after the message, refuses to indorse that appropriation, a refund should be made of all moneys collected under a misapprehension on the part of the Minister that the House would indorse the duties originally proposed by him. .","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[23]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When the original Tariff was before the House, we were trying to determine what really were the burdens upon the backs of the majority of the people of Australia. There were in operation in Australia at the time six separate Tariffs, and it was very difficult for the Chair then to interpret what was and what was not a new burden on the people. In this instance, however, we know that there was a uniform Federal Tariff in operation prior to that now before the House, and that that Tariff has been increased on a message from the Crown. If we do not indorse the increase of a duty, and yet allow the Crown to take the revenue resulting from its own action, we shall practically give up to the Ministry our control of the taxation of the Commonwealth. That is a very serious thing to contemplate. I admit that I should very much prefer some means - if means could be devised - whereby the consumers could obtain the benefit of any refund, but in any event our duty under the Constitution is to see that the Crown is not allowed to tax the people of Australia without the consent of this House.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[23]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As there seems to be no response to the appeal, I may as well address myself to the items. In the first place, I object to the granting of three months Supply, because it is a departure from all established practice, except to tide over a general election or some other emergency. What is the object of the Government I do not pretend to sa\- for certain; but, on the face of it, there appears to be a desire to secure themselves in the positions they now hold. In view of the business before us, the Government having brought down such drastic Tariff proposals, it is difficult to say what may happen within the space of the next few days, not to say the next three months.

Let him take action, instead of making threats to me, or suggestions to other honorable members. We are justified in resisting any proposal to grant Supply to the Government, in view of the fact that they have just laid on the table of the House Estimates and Tariff proposals which involve . the mass of the people in an immense amount of taxation which they ought not to be called upon to bear. The Government in bringing down their proposal for three months Supply, evidently with the assured support of men who call themselves labour representatives, and who ought to be backing up the workers, standing up for their rights, and defending them from unjust impositions, have evidently counted noses beforehand. But the fact that, they have the numbers up does not relieve the Opposition, especially the freetrade section of it, of the duty of opposing by every legitimate means in their power such iniquitous and unjust imposts. -The Tariff . proposals had no sooner been published in the press than the wholesale dealers throughout -Australia;  with* few exceptions, increased the cost to the retailers of / all the commodities they .handled. Numbers of retail shopkeepers have complained to me of the unjust treatment they have received. The prices of the goods supplied to them have been enormously increased, and they have been compelled, of course, to increase the prices to the consumer. The result was that on .Saturday, the day on which shopkeepers expect to do more trade than on any ordinary day, many of them found their trade almost at a standstill. That is particularly the case with tobacconists and others in a small way of business, especially in the suburbs. The large houses in the city do not feel the pinch so much, because they have had the capital behind them to take their goods out of bond, and have made in many cases a profit amounting to a. handsome fortune, because they had not paid a single farthing of the new duties, although they put up their prices just the same. I am speaking more particularly with regard to the unfortunate retailers in a smaller way of business, who have to depend on the suburban trade for their living. The greatest injury will be done to the poorest sections of the community, who cannot afford to pay enhanced prices for the necessaries of life. Hardship and deprivation of the most acute character will be entailed in many cases, but honorable members on the other side of the Chamber, especially those who profess to represent the wage-earning class, sit back and smile complacently, prepared at the same time to vote a wholly inexcusable three months Supply to a Government who attempt to place these crushingly heavy burdens on the backs of the unfortunate people.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[26]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The amendment should commend itself to any reasonable Minister, because it is in accordance with  established custom. The Minister has shown no good reason why three months Supply should be granted. The only reason which has been advanced for the Ministerial proposal is that the discussion on the Tariff ought not to be interrupted. On several occasions debates on matters equally important as - iri fact, a great deal more important than - the Tariff have been interrupted in order to get a months Supply. Hitherto there has not been any trouble in getting a monthly Supply Bill passed, nor can I see that the Ministry have any reason to anticipate any trouble in obtaining a months Supply from time to time. There are several matters on which I want an explanation. There is one matter, for instance, relating to the repatriation of kanakas.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[30]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

What I said was that it is a scandalous shame that the Parliament should be asked to pass the Bill when no urgency has been shown for granting Supply for three months. It would be interesting to have from the Minister some information as to how far trade has been developed as the result of voting a subsidy for a mail service to the Pacific Islands. The vote was originally proposed upon the ground that the granting of an increased subsidy to the shipping companies would have the effect of developing trade with the Islands, and that settlers would be induced to take up their residence there if we offered more rapid communication. If a further expenditure under the same heading is to be justified we should have a statement from the Acting Prime Minister regarding the extent to which the anticipations of those who originally proposed this subsidy have been realized, and how far the Australian Tariff has operated to counteract the anticipated advantage of this expenditure. So far, however, no such statement has been furnished.. Some time ago I asked for a return showing the extent to which trade between the Commonwealth and the Islands had developed, but up to the present the desired information has not been forthcoming. Consequently honor able members are in absolute ignorance of the trade which is being done with the Islands, and are not in a position to say whether or not the expenditure of the £3,000 which we are now asked to vote in this connexion should be authorized. I note that a sum of £1,500 has been provided for the repatriation of Pacific Islanders. I wish to be informed how this money is to be expended, and whether proper precautions have been taken to insure the protection of these Islanders upon being returned to their homes. Numerous complaints have been made in this connexion, and articles have been published in the newspapers alleging that certain of the Islanders upon being returned to their homes have been killed. If it be known beforehand that a Pacific Islander will have his life endangered if he is returned to his own island, and if he prefers to be landed elsewhere, I think that his wishes should be acceded to as far as possible. Under the heading of Defence we are asked to vote considerable sums of money. Indeed, there are a number of items in this Department which will require a good deal of explanation. Personally I do not feel justified in sanctioning any of the items which appear on the Defence Estimates until I have ascertained the intentions of the Government in regard to the Naval Agreement. Very conflicting statements have been made by the Prime Minister and other Ministers as to. what was done in London in this connexion. Statements have appeared in the press indicating that the Prime Minister misrepresented the opinion of Australia upon this matter. Yet we are asked to vote Supplies to retain the Government in office for at least three months without being afforded an opportunity to receive an explanation upon this question from the Prime Minister. I understand that we may reasonably expect to have the head of the Government back in a very short time, perhaps in a day or two, or possibly in a week.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[30]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

765,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"JOHNSON, Elliot","K99","N/A","N/A","N/A",1806,"- If the Minister is so anxious on the score of humanity, I would remind him that it is cruelty to saddle the taxpayers with the extra burdens which the Government desire to impose. Notwithstanding the repeated denials which have been made, I find that the Prime Minister did give the Home authorities to understand that Australia wished to terminate the Naval Agreement. Reference to the official reports of the proceedings of the Imperial Conference shows that the newspapers statements in this connexion are quite correct. I propose to quote a few extracts from the speeches of the Prime Minister and Lord Tweedmouth, which show that the statement in question was definitely made. Upon page 129 of the official reports Lord Tweedmouth is thus reported -The only reservation that the Admiralty desire to make is, that they claim to have the charge of the strategical questions which are necessarily involved in naval defence, to hold the command of the Naval Forces of the country, and to arrange the distribution -of ships in the best possible manner to resist attacks and to defend the Empire at large, whether it be our own islands or the Dominions beyond the seas. We thoroughly recognise that we are responsible for that defence. We want you to help us in that defence. We want you to give us all the assistance you can, but we do not come to you us beggars ; we gladly take all that you can give us, but at the same time, if you are not inclined to give us the help that we hope to have from you, we acknowledge our absolute obligation to defend the Kings Dominions across the seas to the best of our ability.I should like to know what these remarks have reference to, if it is not to some statement by the Prime Minister or the Acting Prime Minister prior to the delivery of that speech by Lord Tweedmouth. From the tenor of these remarks, it is quite evident, even if there were nothing more to follow, that the impression left on minds of the Lords of the Admiralty was that Australia desired to terminate the Naval Agreement, and did not propose to continue the payment of the annual subsidy of £200,000, or, at any rate, wished to be relieved of that responsibility. This view -of the matter is strengthened by further remarks made by Lord Tweedmouth, in a speech which will be found reported on page 469 of the proceedings of the Conference. He said -Since we last met, I have had the opportunity of having conversations with various of the Prim 6 Ministers and also with their colleagues, and they have had some conferences with some of my colleagues at the Admiralty also. I do not know that I have any very definite plan to propose to you. I can only repeat what I said before, that at the Admiralty we are most anxious to meet the wishes of the various Colonies. But, of course, the real difficulty is that the position varies in the different Colonies, and they have very different wants.In a later paragraph, I find that he said -As I understand Australia puts forward a proposal that the agreement of 1902 should be ended, and that Australia should start something in the way of a local Defence Force.Here Lord Tweedmouth puts the position as it was understood by the Admiralty authorities from the statements of the Prime Minister of Australia. I should like to know whether the other members of the Ministry concur in the attitude taken up by the Prime Minister, and whether that honorable gentleman before he left Australia was authorized by them to make statements which so misrepresented the opinion of the people of the Commonwealth. At page 473 of the proceedings of the Conference, it will be found that Mr. Deakin, speaking after Lord Tweedmouth, made this definite statement -In Australia, for reasons which have already been nut on record in the despatch which I had the honour of addressing to the Admiralty about two years ago, the existing contribution has not proved generally popular.A copy of that despatch ought to have been placed on the table of the House, so that we might have been made acquainted with the reasons which caused the Prime Minister to arrive at the conclusion that the agreement has not proved generally popular. The honorable gentleman went on to say -It was passed because it was felt that some distinct recognition of our responsibility for the defence of our own country and of the Empire of which it is a part was necessary, and though it did not take the form -which commended itself most to the very large minority, possibly even a majority of the electors, we accepted that mode of co-operation until something better presented itself. Further consideration has convinced the public that the present agreement is not satisfactory either to the Admiralty, the political or professional Lords of .the Admiralty, or to the Parliament of the Commonwealth.That is a very sweeping statement for the Prime Minister to have made as a representative of the people of Australia. I should like to know whether the honorable gentlemans colleagues indorsed that statement, or whether he made it with their authority ? Whether it was made with or without their authority, there is absolutely not the slightest foundation in fact for any statement of the kind. In this matter Australia was misrepresented by the honorable gentleman throughout. In the face of a misrepresentation of that character, Ministers associated with the Prime Minister have the audacity to come down to Parliament, and ask us to give them three months Supply, and thus prevent any successful attempt within that period to oust them from their position on the Treasury Benches. So far as I am concerned, I refuse to be a party to voting the Supply now asked for,  no matter what anybody else on this or on the other side may do, until we have some satisfactory explanation from the Prime Minister in connexion with this matter. Even if I had no other ground of opposition, I should certainly oppose the granting of three months Supply to a Ministry whose head has been guilty of such misrepresentation of Australia, in connexion with so vital a matter as the defences of the Commonwealth. I notice that Ministers appear to be a little restive, because honorable members in opposition choose to exercise their right of criticism. We are not here from our own choice, but as a protest against the Government proceeding with this Supply Bill at this hour of the night. I notice that the item,  Contingencies, occurs with alarming frequency throughout the schedule. It is to be found in connexion with every branch of every Department. Where the amounts set down for contingencies are small, it may be that they cover small expenditure on which it is not necessary that we should have any definite information. But in the Estimates relating to the Department of Home Affairs, we find the large item Contingencies, ,£1,000  ; and also an item of ,£360 in regard to contingencies in the Electoral Office. In connexion with the Census and Statistics branch of the Department, we find provision made for salaries amounting to £900 j whilst ,£1,670 is provided under the heading of Contingencies, which might cover anything. An item of £450 appears in respect of contingencies for the Meteorological branch of the Department. There is very grave complaint regarding the establishment of this branch in Melbourne. It seems to be the policy of the Government to concentrate all the Departments in or about Melbourne, irrespective of whether or not the conditions are favorable to the adoption of that course. The Meteorological branch of the Department was established in Melbourne in defiance. of the report of Mr. Hunt, who pointed out that the conditions here were not so favorable to its work as were those in New South Wales, where he had been engaged in the State Department of Meteorology for some years. But for the sake of concentrating all these offices in and around Melbourne so as to make it appear to be what the Government allege it is, the centre of the Federation, they have established the Meteorological Department here, in face of the objections of the officer chiefly interested in it. An explanation of this action on the part of the Government is required. Then there is £1,500 set apart for expenses in connexion with the administration of the Electoral Act during the next three months. I should like to know to what these expenses relate. There is another item, Cost of Commonwealth Elections, £300. I should like the Minister to state whether this amount is to be expended, in accordance with a suggestion made by an honorable member opposite, in refunding the expenses incurred by candidates at elections subsequently declared void owing to the fault of electoral officers. There is nothing in the schedule to show what will be the destination of the .£300. I certainly raise my protest against the Opposition continually giving way to the Government in respect of proposals which ought to be hotly contested. I would sooner go to a division a dozen times, even if I were defeated on> every occasion, in order to assert principles where. they should be asserted, but I often find myself alone in calling for a division. The mere fact that the numbers happen to be against us at times does not afford justification for allowing to go unchallenged items that ought to be contested. It ds only because I have regard for the comfort of honorable members, who have sat here all day after travelling by train all night, that, having entered my protest and stated some of the reasons for the action I have taken, I propose now to resume my seat.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[30]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have been able to make only a cursory examination of the Bill, because, though it was circulated this morning, the copy intended for me did not reach me. Apparently, for some reason which I cannot understand, the Government are anxious to force the measure through, under the pretence of bringing us nearer to the Tariff debate.

Already the States are taking into their own hands the organization of independent mail services to the East ; and I am not quite sure whether such action is constitutional. It appears to me that the Commonwealth should make an arrangement by which all the States should have equal facilities, without competition. This is a matter of great importance, which needs more discussion than it is likely to receive to-night.

It was rumoured that the reason why the bond which Captain Collins is endeavouring to receive payment upon has not been honoured, is that it contained a stipulation that it was only to be binding in the event of the Commonwealth Parliament ratifying the contract within a certain period from the signing of the bond, and that, inasmuch as the Commonwealth Parliament had not done so, the bond was no longer operative.

It would be very much better if the Commonwealth Government could arrange the mail services to the East, so as to secure equal facilities to all parties concerned. At the present time, each State is fighting the other States for space in the vessels going eastward. However, it is a large question, and I do not intend to go into it at this hour. I think, however, that we might have had from the Treasurer a full explanation at a more reasonable time.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[43]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When he was in London, the Prime Minister was very anxious - and I was assisting him - to make an arrangement in regard to the control of some of the Pacific Islands. We did not succeed in what we wanted to do. We have simply carried on the contract with Burns, Philp, and Company on the same lines as before. As regards the desire of the States to employ other services, there is a difficulty about interfering. The question has been under consideration, but at the present moment I cannot give any definite information regarding the shipping companies to which the honorable member has referred. We have taken care to adhere to what has been authorized, and have continued the services at the same rate.Schedule agreed to.Title agreed to.Bill reported without amendment.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL (No. 2)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[44]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The matter had come to the knowledge of Ministers three or four weeks ago. It was not discussed in the ordinary way in Cabinet, but in an unofficial way it was considered by Ministers. It was thought that as it had not been mentioned in the Governor-Generals Speech, it could not be made a Government matter, and so no action has been taken. When a similar case arose in New South Wales some years ago, while Sir Henry Parkes was head of the Government, one of his Ministers brought in a private Bill to provide for the payment of an allowance to members of the Legislative Assembly. It was not a Government measure. That was carried through, and that was the origin of payment of members in that State. In this particular case, I wish it to be clearly understood that it is not a Ministerial matter.","Parliamentary Allowances Bill","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
