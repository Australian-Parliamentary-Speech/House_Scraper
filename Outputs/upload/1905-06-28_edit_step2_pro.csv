The only conclusion at which I can arrive from a perusal of his address is that by withdrawing his support from the Coalition Government he desires to bring about a return to the three-party system of Government which was introduced into this House some time ago. Nobody who feels keenly in connexion with our representative institutions wishes to see a return to that system, which undoubtedly degraded those institutions. Under these conditions the Government, composed as it is of men of high standing in our public life, naturally had to seriously consider the position. It is clear from the Vice-Regal speech that they have done so. AH the measures which were forecasted by the Prime Minister at Hawthorn have been placed upon one side, and the Government now propose to deal with one matter only, which everybody will agree is a matter of pressing urgency - I refer to the Redistribution of Seats Bill.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[2]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

46,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"FULLER, George","JZF","N/A","N/A","N/A",10,"- He wanted to have a look at the honorable member. That a redistribution of seats is necessary, must be patent to everybody. As time has elapsed, the inequalities which were proved to exist when the first distribution of electorates took place have increased. To-day they are of such a glaring character that, in order to insure a proper representation under the liberal franchise which exists in Australia, it is necessary that we should have a Redistribution of Seats Bill passed at the earliest possible moment. That fact is recognised, not only by the Government, but by every right-thinking person in the community. In some quarters a great outcry has been raised, because, under the redistribution scheme  which is projected, Victoria will be represented by one member less, and New South Wales by one member more. What is the real position, and what is the reason for the great outcry which has occurred in that connexion ? When the first distribution of electoral divisions for the Commonwealth Parliament took place Victoria obtained her twenty-, third representative by having 1,135 Per sons in excess of half the quota. In the second distribution which took place in 1903, that State secured her twenty-third representative because she possessed 2,280 in excess of half the quota. The statistics for 1905 show that half the quota necessary to entitle a State to return a representative is 27,443, and that Victoria has 24,631 less than half the quota, or only 2,812 persons in excess of the number required to return twenty-two representatives. What is the position in regard to New South Wales? In 1900 and 1903. that State returned twenty-six representatives upon the full quota. There was no bare allowance in the case of that State. Her representatives were returned upon the full quota in every instance. According to the official figures for 1905, she is entitled to an additional member,, because the figures show that she has 2,767 above half the quota. When Victoria, in the first instance, obtained her twenty-third member she had only 1,135 persons over the half quota, while in the second instance she had only 2,280 over half the quota; but in neither case was objection raised by any one","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[2]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But now that New South Wales has more than half the quota entitling her to an additional member, namely, 2^767, as against the 1,135 n the first instance, and the 2,280 persons in the second, upon which Victoria obtained her twenty-third member, we hear grumblings in certain quarters1 in connexion with the proposed redistribution. In the interests of the proper representation, not merely of New South Wales, but of the whole Commonwealth, it is absolutely necessary that there shall be a redistribution. In order to give effect to our democratic franchise, and to secure proper representation in this House, so that we shall have, as nearly as possible, equality in the matter of one adult one vote throughout the Commonwealth, it is imperative that every honorable member should recognise that it is his duty to support the position assumed by the Government, and to help them to pass a Bill for the redistribution of seats. I have nothing further to add. I have dealt with the only matter referred to in the GovernorGenerals Speech, and I trust that it will receive the proper consideration of the House. I commend the Government for the manly, straightforward, honest stand they have taken up, and feel satisfied that it will receive the commendation of every right-thinking man and woman in Australia.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[2]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The only matter with which it deals is the proposal of the Government to bring in a measure for the redistribution of seats; and, apart altogether from the question of whether any State should have the number of its representatives varied, I think it is essential that the States should be divided into something like equal electorates. If we are to have one adult one vote, the corollary is that there shall be one vote one power. It is not in accordance with such a Constitution as is ours that one honorable member should represent more than double the number of the electors to be found in practically an adjoining electorate.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

51,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"MCWILLIAMS, William","JUV","N/A","N/A","N/A",11,"- I am speaking of the Constitution as it stands. It has given the States a certain measure of representation, and every one who is familiar with the difficulties surrounding the erection of the Federal Constitution knows that, without equal representation in the Senate, there would have been no Federation today. It is essential that a proper redistribution of seats, shall take place before an appeal is made to the country. I regret, however, that any State should lose a proportion of the representation which it has enjoyed, and I hope that when the population statistics are counted or recounted, it will be found that Victoria will not have to part with any of her existing measure of representation. It is deplorable that in a young community like that of Australia any State should lose a proportion of its representation on account of a decrease of its population, and I hope that such a contingency will not arise. As to the position which the Government has taken up, I must say that they have my hearty congratulations. There has never been a Government in office with a majority at their back since my election to this House, and the majority supporting the present Ministry has always been small. Indeed, if my advice had been taken - for what it was worth - the course they now intend to pursue would have been followed when a crisis occurred on a prior occasion. When I first entered this Chamber the Deakin Government, who were then in office, had not a majority, and, indeed, they did not at any time have a majority behind them. We had then three parties in the House, and each was practically as strong as that behind the Government. When the Watson Government took office, they had very little more than one-third of the honorable members of this Chamber sitting behind them. It was really impossible for either the Deakin Government, or the Watson Government, to pass practical legislation, to control the House, or to govern the country. As long as the honorable and learned member for Ballarat remained faithful to the agreement entered into between his party and that led by the present Prime Minister, the position was different. That agreement was an honorable and proper one, and I believe that it had the support of a majority of honorable members. Although I confess that I have been unable to thoroughly grasp the exact attitude taken up by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat in his recent address to his constituents, it must be patent to every one who has perused the reports of that address, that the. loyal agreement entered into between the two parties has, so far as the leaders are concerned, terminated. They have reached the parting . of the ways. There is no one who would have received more abuse than the Prime-Minister would have done had he come down to the House with a proposal to attempt to carry on when his majority had practically gone. The very honorable members who are now attempting to deride his action would have been foremost in abusing and challenging him to take up the very position that he has now assumed. What is the objection which some honorable members have been taking, both in the lobbies, and whilst the honorable and learned member for Illawarra was speaking? It is urged that the Prime Minister has indicated a course which he cannot himself carry out. It would be useless to deny that it is not in the power of any Minister, or any Government, to command a dissolution. It is not in the power of any Ministry to say that they will not exert themselves to remain in office, and that the moment they retire there will be a dissolution. The position which the Prime Minister has taken up is thoroughly in accord with the highest traditions of constitutional government. When the Ministry of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat failed to hold a majority, they retired, and when the Watson Government failed to carry a majority, they also retired. I believe that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat on leaving office did not apply for a dissolution, but we know that the present leader of the Opposition did, and I think that he was to be commended for his action. That being the position, what objection can there be to the proposal of the Prime Minister to make a proper and above-board provision to enable him to apply for a dissolution if he cannot hold a majority ?","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When I read a speech delivered recently by the leader of the Opposition, it recalled to my mind one of the most clever cartoons I have ever seen. I refer to a cartoon which appeared in Lon don Punch, and has been considered one of the few worthy of preservation. As honorable members are aware, when John Russell sought to put back the hands of the clock, so far as Catholic emancipation was concerned, he ran through the country attempting to explain his proposal. This led Punch to bring out an exceedingly clever cartoon depicting John Russell, after putting up  No Popery  on the wall, flying for his life. I think that is exactly the position of the ex-Prime Minister - the present leader of the Opposition - for, having written up  Socialism  on the walls of the Commonwealth, he has been engaged during the last three months in touring the country, and attempting to explain that what he proposed was really not Socialism, or, if it was, it was such a little bit of Socialism, that, after all, it was not worth considering. Australia has come to this position : The present Parliament has been in existence for eighteen months, and, so far as practical legislation - legislation for the benefit of Australia - is concerned, the results have been to a very great extent nil. The Prime Minister would have deserved that which honorable members opposite would have said most vehemently of him, if he had. sought to mark time to the end of this session, and then, perhaps, have attempted to sneak through the next session with a majority which he could not command.","N/A","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH : ADDRESS-IN-REPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[3]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
