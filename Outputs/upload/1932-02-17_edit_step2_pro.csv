The honorable gentleman has already given long service to his constituents, having been first elected to this House in 1917. He has, moreover, occupied the position of Temporary Chairman of Committees in several parliaments, and in that office has had an opportunity to show that he possesses those qualifications which justify his promotion to the higher honour of the Speakership. The occupant of the Speakers chair should be a man of calm temperament and impartial judgment, and the honorable member for Lilley possesses both qualifications.

91,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MALONEY, William","KLM","Melbourne","N/A","N/A",19,". - It was ten years ago, in this very month, that I first took advantage of the opportunity which presents itself only once in the life of a parliament, when any honorable member can speak untrammelled by rules of debate - some of them absurd - which unfortunately up to the present have not been properly altered and amended. I do not object to the honorable member for Lilley, who has been nominated for the Speakership, because he and I have been the best of friends ever since he entered this Parliament. I have a great respect for him, and if he is appointed I hope he will emulate the splendid work of his predecessors. Rut I object on principle to the present method of appointing the Speaker, because once an honorable member is elected to that position, his electors are disfranchised; they have no further representation in this House. Realizing that the officers of thisParliament know far more of parliamentary procedure than does the average honorable member who is appointed to the Chair, and that the conduct of Parliament really rests upon the parliamentary officers, I would prefer that some officer, and not a member of Parliament, should be elected each session to the speakership. This would enable all honorable members to represent fully their electors. Those remarks apply also to the position of Chairman of Committees. It is strange how frequently some of my dearest friends fill the positions of Speaker and Chairman of Committees, and thus become subject to my criticism.I raise one other matter. This is one occasion on which I can hold up to scorn and contumely some of the judges of the High Court and other courts. These judges, even in the hour of their countrys need, have refused to allow any reduction to be made in their salaries, but they are so terribly blinded that they have drastically reduced the wages of the workers. Five years ago I expressed the contempt and loathing in which I held Judge Lukin. To-day I hold him in still greater contempt. He receives in addition to his salary a pension of £1,000 a year from the Queensland Government. He sits in court with all the dignity of his horse-hair wig, and refuses to suffer any reduction in his salary. Men of his type took part in the French Revolution. At that time one fool said that the people should eat grass, and according to Carlyle, he was eventually strung up to a lamp post, and hanged with grass stuck in his mouth. When the people properly control Parliament no longer will Australian men and women receive a dole of 5s. a week plus ls. 6d. for each child, while in the Motherland an unemployed man receives 15s. a week, and an unemployed woman 13s. a week. Our Defence Department has issued a regulation to the effect that 7s. 6d. a week shall be provided for each child. Is there any difference between the children who have to be maintained on Defence Department money and those who have to be maintained by other government expenditure? This is a very serious matter, although I am not blaming this Government for it._ The previousGovernment deserved a lot of the blame, and they received their reward at the election. But the people have not yet obtained control of Parliament.We talk about our democracy in Australia, but there can be no democracy here so long as this Parliament can control the people who create it. The people have the right to control the Parliament, and we shall never have a democracy until they can exercise that right. Private members have at different times tried to improve matters in this respect, but the previous Government, like those which preceded it, limited the rights of private members to the greatest possible extent. Those who were members of the last Parliament know that this statement is true.I had a motion on the business-paper to provide for the bringing into effect of the principle of the referendum, initiative and recall. Honorable members who are sitting on the front Opposition bench may laugh, but they, like myself, have signed a platform which contains this plank. If they were sitting in a Labour conference they would not be complimented upon their laughter. Let me tell them, and honorable members generally, that I have held the respect of my constituents longer than any of them - in fact for nearly 43 years. For very many years I have tried to get this House to carry a motion approving of the principle of the referendum, initiative and recall. On one occasion, when the right honorable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) was Prime Minister, such a motion was agreed to unanimously; but no Labour Government has ever taken steps to give effect to this principle.I am loyal to the Labour party. The planks of the platform of that party are as sacred to me as the Prayer Book and the Bible, and I wish to see them put into effect. I do not want to see members of this party holding on to place and pay. I say definitely that there were more gold-diggers in the last caucus than in any in which I have sat during my long parliamentary life. Honorable members opposite seem amused, but by and by I shall have something to say about them, and I shall not hesitate to say it. I hope to continue to hold the respect of my colleagues as I have held it during all the years. I have never said anything in this House that I did not believe, and I have never tried to attain an object unconnected with the welfare of humanity. I know that the right honorable member for North Sydney, in his heart of hearts, believes in the referendum and initiative.I have taken care not to speak of the recall. I believe that I am the only member of this House who has trusted his constituents, and who, for 42 years, has given them the right to render the seat of their representative vacant at a days notice. By presenting a petition signed by one more than half the number of voters who voted for me in my constituency the electors could bring about my immediate recall. Honorable members are again laughing, but they laugh in ignorance. Poor children, there is a lot yet for them to learn. There was a time when 556 signatures could have brought about my removal from Parliament.I have mentioned Judge Lukin. I wish also to mention Judge Drake-Brockman, Mr. Justice Rich, and Mr. Justice Evatt. I am sorry to have to do this.If my suggestions had been accepted our poor country could be helped out of its troubles. Let us do here as they did in England during the war period. At that time food was rationed, and the highest aristocrats in the land had to submit to rationing just like the poorest people. We should remember too, that poor old England can produce only enough food for every fourth man, woman and child living there. Australia, on the other hand, is producing more than three times as much food as she requires to feed her people. Let us ration our food supply and everything else, and use all the surplus to meet our debts.In regard to the monetary position, I wish to place on record tha following letter which I received from the Treasury on the 16th January, 1932 :-","N/A","ELECTION OF SPEAKER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am confident that you will bring to that task the qualities of impartiality and justness, because I remember that, many years ago, before you entered this Parliament, you were responsible for an extraordinarily fair piece of dealing in connexion with myself which demonstrated to me the innate justness and fairness of your character. I am satisfied that those qualities will characterize your actions as Speaker.I hope that during the term of this Parliament you will carry out the practice of previous Speakers, and recognize, in their turn, the members of the several parties in the House as they rise to take part in a debate. That method has been used in previous parliaments. It was adopted when the right honorable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) was Prime Minister, and also when other governments were in office, and the practice is observed at the present time in the BritishHouse of Commons, where the various parties are recognized in their turn in the matter of calls from the Chair. I trust that this practice will be followed in this chamber. At the same time, I point out that members of the Country party are occupying their present seats in this chamber to suit their own convenience. They desire, so far as possible, to sit together. The object of the Country party in coining to this Parliament is to put into effect, at the earliest possible moment, the policy that was jointly agreed upon by the United Australia party and the Country party prior to the election. So long as the Government carries out the policy on which the people voted, it can rest assured of the support of this party.","Dear Sir,","ELECTION OF SPEAKER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Unfortunately, this occasion is no exception. Senator the Hon. James Ernest Ogden died on the 5th February at his home in Tasmania. The late senator was not a robust man, and his health had been failing for some time. The news of his death, however, came as a shock to his colleagues in this Parliament, most of whom had not been in close touch with him since the adjournment in November. The sudden removal from our midst of one who had been so recently sharing in the work of the Parliament, and whose personal friendship was valued so very highly, is felt particularly keenly by those of us who were associated with him.Senator Ogden had a long record of parliamentary service, having been a member of the Tasmanian and Commonwealth Parliaments. I was associated with him in the Tasmanian Parliament, and in the Government led by the late Honorable John Earle. I valued his friendship and respected him for his sincerity. Before his election to the Commonwealth Parliament in 1922 he had been a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly for sixteen years, during which time, in addition to a brief period as Treasurer, he was Chief Secretary and Minister for Mines and Labour for two years. For a brief period he was Leader of the Opposition in that Parliament. Senator Ogden was a member of the Commonwealth Government as honorary minister from the 29th November, 1928, for approximately twelve months. His parliamentary life covered a period of 26 years, during which time he did not spare himself to give of his best to Tasmania and the Commonwealth. Before his entry into Parliament, his efforts on behalf of hi3 fellow workers were such as to merit special remembrance. We tender our deep sympathy to his widow and family in their loss. I move - by leave -That the members of the House of Representatives record their sincere regret at the death of Senator the Honorable James Ernest Ogden, who was a representative of Tasmania in the Senate since 1922, and performed valuable service as a member of State and Commonwealth Governments, and tender their deep sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR THE HONORABLE J.

As years go, he was a comparatively young man, especially for a native of Tasmania, where longevity is the rule. He died worn out by the years of service which he devoted to the public. For a brief time I worked with him as a colleague in a Government, and no one could have been more conscientious or painstaking than he in the discharge of his duties. Despite constant ill health he spent many years in the service of his country, and I am convinced that the public have lost a valuable servant by his death.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR THE HONORABLE J.

I was not a member of this House when Mr. Foster was representing Wakefield, but I know of his work and of the high personal esteem in which he was held by his fellow members. Mr. Foster first entered Parliament when elected to the House of Assembly of South Australia, in 1893, and was a member of that House for thirteen years, during which time he held Ministerial office for periods totalling five years. His election to the House of Representatives took place in 1909, and he retained the seat until the general elections of 1928. He attained Ministerial office in the Hughes Government as Minister for Works and Railways, holding that portfolio from December, 1921, to February, 1923. His colleagues in this chamber remember him as one imbued with a high sense of public duty, who was at all times prepared strenuously but fairly to uphold his political beliefs. Our sympathy goes out to the widow and family of one who has left behind a very valuable record of public service. I move - by leave -That the sympathy of this House bc extended to the widow and family of the late Honorable Richard Witty Foster, who was a member of the House of Representatives for Wakefield, South Australia, from 1909 to 1928, and rendered conspicuous service to Australia as a member of State and Federal legislatures, and as a Minister of the Crown.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE R.

The Prime Minister gave a brief summary of Mr. Fosters career. The deceased gentleman had a long record of public life, a record which was in every way honorable. The Prime Minister (Mr. Lyons) did not know him in this House, but many of us here knew him well. He was one of those figures in public life that one never forgets. He was a strenuous fighter, and a vigorous debater - none more vigorous. He fought for what he believed in, and fought strenuously, but he was personally one of the kindest men it was possible to meet. I am sure that all of us who knew him regretted the vicissitudes of public life which led to his disappearance from this House during one of those periodical upheavals which trouble the political history of the country.

I endorse every word that has been said about the late Mr. Foster by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin) and the honorable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory). Mr. Foster was no plaster saint, but he was as straight as a gun barrel. He had strong convictions and the rare courage of his convictions. The vicissitudes of life, both public and private, he met breast forward, and I question that he ever entertained a momentary doubt that right would ultimately triumph. When :we meet on an occasion like this to consecrate ourselves to the service of our King and country, and remember with honour those who have gone before, I sometimes wonder whether we are not compassed about with a great cloud of unseen witnesses - those who have finished their course and gone before. It may be so. One thing of which I feel certain is that men such as those whose memory we are honouring to-day, being dead yet speak to those who have ears to hear. They are saying to us,  Work while it is yet day, for the night cometh when no man can work. The most effective way in which we. can express our respect for the memory of such men is by giving earnest heed to their silent admonitions.Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE R.

It is about nine years since the late gentleman was a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, but up to that time he had been a prominent figure in the public life of Tasmania and of the Commonwealth. He commenced his parliamentary career in the State of Tasmania, being elected to the House of Assembly for .Waratah in 1906. He subsequently represented Franklin in that House. He was Premier of Tasmania on two occasions - on the second occasion for a period of two years. I was personally associated with him, being a member of his Ministry which was in office from April, 1914, to April, 1916. The late Senator Ogden was also a member of that Ministry. Mr. Earles appointment as Senator dated from the 1st March, 1917, and he was re-elected at the general election of 1917, holding his seat until 1922.

I now refer to one who, having been elected to Parliament, did not live to take his seat in this chamber. Mr. John Joseph Clasby was elected to the House of Representatives as member for East Sydney at the general elections in December last, and died in Sydney on the 15th of January. The stress and strain associated with an election campaign had taken their toll, and he was suddenly stricken with an illness which ended in his untimely death at the age of 38 years. His was already a very useful life, which had included active service in Egypt and France during the war, and association with movements having for their object the stimulation of interest in public affairs. It seemed that he was on the threshold of a promising career of parliamentary and public service, but he was not destined to take his seat in Parliament. His funeral was attended by myself and several other members of the Government. The tributes paid to Mr. Clasby on that occasion afforded a striking testimony of the esteem in which he was held by all sections of the community. The members of this House share the universal sympathy with his mother and members of his family in their sad bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF MR.

Although Mr. John Joseph Clasby was in a different category, his death made a special appeal to our sympathy. Mr. Clasby was a young man who had just taken the first step in a promising parliamentary career when he was stricken down. His end was, no doubt, accelerated by the strenuous election campaign in which he had participated. We all feel the deepest sympathy with his mother and the other members of his family, who, no doubt, were looking forward with pride to the time when their son and brother would win an important position in the national life of Australia. But Mr. Clasby was not privileged to sit for even one day in the Parliament to which he had been elected. That circumstance has aroused the sympathy of the whole nation. I did not know Mr. Clasby, although I believe that I met him for a few moments on one occasion when I was travelling to Queensland and he was returning from that State; but I have heard those who knew him well in Sydney express the highest opinions of his ability, manly qualities and fine disposition. My party joins with honorable members generally in expressing the deepest sympathy with his mother and family in their great sorrow and bitter loss.","N/A","DEATH OF MR.

His death was largely the result of war service, and of the strenuous efforts he made in the time at his disposal after his ordinary work was done to benefit the public life of Australia. He was of the right age to enter political life, for although he was a man of experience, he still had the energy of youth. His death is a definite loss to Australia, and we associate ourselves with the motion of sympathy moved by the Prime Minister.","N/A","DEATH OF MR.

I appreciated the fighting qualities of the late Mr. Clasby, and shall long remember the battle which was waged in that electorate in December last. I took an active part in that struggle, and fought Mr. Clasby strenuously in a political contest. He was a fair fighter, who took his part manfully, and he won from us a seat which we had held for many years. He was not permitted to enjoy the fruits of the victory he won, and we regret his death. As we look round this chamber to-day we feel that his mother and the other members of his family would have felt honoured to witness the ceremony of the opening of this Parliament, and to see their son and brother in the place to which he was elected, but it was not to be.

I sincerely regret that Mr. Clasby did not live long enough to enjoy the fruits of his victory. He was a good fighter in the interests of his party. The vote which he received on the 19th December, was to me an indication of the personal esteem in which he was held by the electors of East Sydney rather than an endorsement of the principles of the political party in the interests of which he stood.

It was a tragedy with, fortunately, but few equals in the naval history of Great Britain. While exercising in the Channel off Portland, Dorset, on the 26th January, the submarine dived, and did not again come to the surface. At first there was a slight hope that the lives of those on board would be saved, but that hope soon gave way to the sad realization that the 56 officers and men comprising the crew had gone to their deaths. We can hardly imagine the plight of those unfortunate men, but we can be certain that when the time came for them to abandon all hope they faced their deaths bravely, and in keeping with the best traditions of the Royal Navy. We extend our deepest sympathy to the relatives of those who perished in the disaster, and to His Majestys Government in the United Kingdom in the loss the country has sustained.","N/A","LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMAKINE M2","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The news of the sinking of the submarine M2 struck the whole civilized world with horror, not only because of the loss of so many lives, but of the circumstances under which the men went to their death. Although we can only imagine the feelings of those who went down in the submarine, we can appreciate something of the tragedy of the whole occurrence. We extend our very deep sympathy to the relatives of the men who died. The sinking of this submarine reminds us of the great risks taken by those who man such vessels, not only in times of war, but also in times of peace. Of course, the risks are very much greater during war time. This occurrence affords additional evidence of the urgent need for the nations to do everything that they can do, not only to prevent the possibility of war, but also to render unnecessary any preparations for war. It is one of the hopes of this Parliament that the Disarmament Conference will take the first real step towards total disarmament, and thus remove the possibility of similar disasters to this occurring in the future.Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places.","N/A","LOSS OF BRITISH SUBMAKINE M2","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In New South Wales not nearly so much bounty ha? been paid out as in the States of Victoria and South Australia. In New South Wales there seems to be a much wider misunderstanding than in the other States mentioned of what is required on the forms. This not only causes delay to the individual, whose application forms have to be referred back, but it results in delay throughout the department. It has been necessary to employ in New South Wales nearly double the staff to carry out the checking that has been necessary, for instance, in South Australia. I hope that henceforward the payment of the bounty will be proceeded with much more expeditiously than in the past, since everybody concerned is now becoming more familiar with the procedure.","WHEAT BOUNTY","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[9]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The present Government recognizes the existence of that agreement, and it does not propose that by any direct action, that agreement should be broken; but it feels that the time has come when the parties to the agreement should be invited to reconsider the matter, in view of the sacrifices made by every other section of the community throughout Australia, and that a voluntary agreement might be arrived at until the financial and economic conditions in Australia improve.

I advised what amounts Commonwealth understood were due and asked you to confirm same. I also asked what contribution your Government was prepared to make towards paying overdue interest. On 13th February, I gave undertaking sought by you that Commonwealth would not without consent of State use or suffer to be used any reply to my telegram of 10th February in evidence against State in any pending or future litigation.
