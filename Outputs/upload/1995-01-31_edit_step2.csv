I refer to a third generation logging contractor possibly sitting in the Senate today wondering whether he will have any work when he returns to Wandandian tomorrow. He has 25 employees, $3 million worth of equipment and is typical of seven or eight other logging contractors servicing six timber mills between Nowra and Bega. I ask the minister: does he realise that each one percentage point increase in interest rates costs that man and his business an estimated $10,000 and that the government has forced up official interest rates by 58 per cent in the last five months? Does the minister also realise how his governments confused logging policy is adding uncertainty to that logging contractors business? What does the minister say to that particular logging contractor about the governments intention to now impose a so-called carbon tax, which will simply be a further tax on the fuel that this contractor needs to run a profitable business? I ask the minister: how does the government expect Australian businesses to survive, let alone prosper, with such foolish and confused policies?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[1]/question[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","VIC","ALP","N/A","1","—There is nothing confusing about the governments position so far as logging is concerned. The Prime Ministers statement was a straight down the line recognition of the reality that there are two major competing interests in issue in this country—the issue that is of deep concern to a very large number of members of the community about saving native forests and which not only is a matter for the Commonwealth government and its export woodchips policy but also is very much a matter, so far as the logging itself is concerned, of the responsibility of state govern ments.It is about time people woke up to the fact that the basic responsibility for determining the future of this industry—whether it does or does not survive, or in what form or to what extent it survives—is very much a matter for the state governments. You put some of the heat upon them rather than just upon the Commonwealth. What we have been trying to do as part of the national forest policy strategy is get people together, get a rational assessment of the matters in issue and get a rational balance between not only the interest in the environment and saving native forests but also the interest that is so clearly and starkly there in preserving employment in this country and doing nothing unnecessary to undermine it.We are acutely conscious of that side of the equation as well as the environmental one. That is why it is such a difficult issue and it is not dealt with sensibly by the kind of noisy malarky we hear from the other side of the chamber on this particular issue. I hope that, if we are going to see a new and sensible approach on policy issues from the other side, we will get a better recognition of the difficulty of drawing this kind of balance in this situation.As to the question of a carbon tax or any other fiscal policy change that might be involved, that is of course something that is utterly unresolved at this stage. It is the subject of some discussion obviously within the government—as you would expect, given the nature of the fiscal issues that are confronting the country at the moment and the nature of the environmental responsibilities we have—but certainly no decision of any kind has been made, and we are acutely conscious of the employment and the economic implications of going down that path in any very substantial way.As to the question of interest rates which was also raised, the situation is, of course, that you have to be sensible when an economy is coming out of recession to ensure that the growth that is generated by that is sustainable growth; that when you come to the traffic lights you can keep going, you do not have to come to a shuddering stop. You have to adjust the speed of the economy so the lights are always green, so that you can always keep going. That is why, of course, we have had a series of small changes, small increases in interest rates—to reflect the reality of an economy coming out of recession, surging with growth, surging with capacity.There is a need accordingly to ensure, particularly given the lead times that are involved in these judgments, that the economy does not move so fast that it is necessary to over correct and produce a stop. That is why interest rates have been rising. The hope, of course, is that the overall situation of the economy, the demand side of the equation, is slowing down. There is some evidence for that. It is to be hoped certainly, as most commentators have been saying, that the nature of the economic situation and the nature of the governments response to it so far, is such that it will not be necessary to go further in any very drastic way down that particular path. That is a matter about which you cannot make premature judgments. Any responsible government recognises that and any responsible opposition should do the same.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[1]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is only this minister that would tell Australian business that it can cop a small interest rate increase, which is a 58 percent increase in five months. It just demonstrates how out of touch the government is. The real question is: does the government really understand what its policies are cumulatively doing to Australian business? You are forcing up interest rates; you are now seeking to impose upon them new taxes on production; and, in the case of this particular industry, you have added a confused logging policy. Does this government not understand that small business in particular cannot grow, cannot prosper and cannot employ in that sort of environment? When is this government going to face the realities of what it is doing to Australian business, rather than giving the sort of airy-fairy academic answer that has just been given by the minister today?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[1]/question[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This publication outlined that there is extremely strong employment growth in the services sector with some 420,000 jobs being created in service industries over the last two years.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator COOK","RF4","WA","ALP","N/A","3","—I should thank Senator Colston for his question because it enables me to give some more and better particulars to the headline answer Senator Evans just gave to the opposition. The figures from a range of various statistical sources on manufacturing performance in Australia make the manufacturing sector in this country the stand-out performer in the Australian economy. Over the last two years, it has seen the strongest ever sustained growth in manufacturing production since the Australian Bureau of Statistics commenced collecting figures. We have done better in the last two years than ever before according to the bureau, which commenced the collection of figures in 1974.Production increased by 12.2 per cent per year to the September quarter of last year. This has taken the surge of production to 12.5 per cent above the record in the June quarter of 1989. We are now at the highest ever level of growth in manufacturing industry production. The manufacturing sector has directly contributed 23.6 per cent of total growth in the Australian economy since 1991. That is an outstanding performance, when one considers that it represents only 16 per cent of gross production.If one looks at investment as an indicator of future trends, one sees that in this section of the economy investment has been surging and is a foundation for continuing growth. Manufacturing investment went up by 10.3 per cent seasonally adjusted for the September quarter last year. Growth over the last four quarters represents 26.9 per cent—that is the year on growth—a huge amount of investment growth. The bureaus forward surveys suggest that these trends are set to continue.If one looks at the export performance of this section of the economy, one can see an equally impressive performance. Manufacturing exports have gone up by 9.9 per cent each year in real terms since 1986 and 1987. Elaborately transformed manufactures, the most complex and sophisticated manufactured goods, have gone up the most. They have gone up by 17 per cent per year over the decade, which puts Australia as the best performed country in the OECD in terms of the growth in elaborately transformed manufactures. We now earn $11 billion from the export of elaborately transformed manufactures. We earned $2 billion just over a decade ago. This is set to continue.The announcement last week by Mitsubishi Motors Australia that it has been selected as a world source for the next generation family sedan car indicates a great deal of confidence in the Australian manufacturing sector, and the Australian automotive sector specifically. Our quality is up, our prices are competitive and design and other inputs put us on the world stage as a leading player. It is evidence, too, that the governments policies in manufacturing development are working. The Button car plan is effective. It is also a compliment to the companies which have performed in this sector, particularly Mitsubishi which has adopted best practice guidelines.There are two other surveys out which indicate what the future trends will be—the Chamber of Manufactures survey and the ACCI-Westpac survey of industrial trends. They come to these conclusions: strong growth went through in the December quarter; higher production levels were reported; significant increase in production is expected by most of the companies in the field; and profits and investment in plant and equipment are expected to remain high—a strong performing sector in the Australian economy.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As with my original advice, precedence was given to old-growth forest and wilderness values.The 509 coupes and compartments identified represent those areas considered to be of the highest priority for the protection of their conservation values and/or those areas which could be strategically important for the development of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system to protect old-growth forest, wilderness and nature conservation values.Two states, Tasmania and New South Wales, have undertaken an assessment of the original list of 1,300 coupes since my advice was first released.

You can argue validly for stopping clearing or, indeed, for reafforesting the 15 per cent of currently cleared land that has been claimed by the coalition it will reafforest as a habitat for flora and fauna, and for a whole range of other valid reasons.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator COLLINS","OF4","NT","ALP","N/A","4","—You might be pleased to hear this, Senator Kemp. Research in Victoria carried out by the Victorian Department of Conservation and Natural Resources has demonstrated very clearly that soil, properly managed, is capable of sequestering more carbon than trees are. In fact, the solution—and it should be adopted—is whole farm management practices, particularly things like minimum tillage. If the land is properly managed, organic carbon levels in soil can actually be built up to a greater extent than they can in trees. The Victorian agricultural department has shown only too clearly that that in turn results in more productive cropping. So it is an absolute win-win situation. I notice Senator Brownhill nodding in assent. It is true: if you manage the land properly, you will not only absorb more carbon into the soil but you will actually get better cropping and better production as a result.Not only is this an entirely fallacious policy on agricultural grounds, but it is also totally uncosted. Mr McLachlan said in the policy that to do this would be `both simple and inexpensive. He based this on the South Australian process, which I have to say is excellent, of compensating landowners for taking land out of production and, in fact, not clearing it.The current cost of that program—I have checked with South Australia—is around $120 per hectare. Translating that into a national policy, how the coalition can say in print that this will be both simple and inexpensive is beyond me. As I have pointed out already, the cost of implementing the reafforestation of 660,000 hectares of currently cleared land every year that it has targeted would be between $5 billion, using direct seeding, and about $15 billion, using plants. So the government, in pure fiscal terms, will not be adopting that either.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[4]/answer/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","VIC","ALP","N/A","5","—The situation in Myanmar continues to be a deeply unhappy one. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi remains under house arrest despite the introduction of some dialogue with the regime and the hopes that had widely been felt in the latter part of last year that this might lead to her release in January. Those hopes have not been realised.The national convention process shows at the moment no grounds at all for confidence that any kind of democratic accountability of the military regime will emerge from that process. Many political prisoners remain incarcerated. Political and civil freedoms are effectively non-existent. Forced labour is still a reality in many parts of the country. So far as minorities are concerned, the offensive against the Karen National Union, about which Senator Bourne asked, which the Australian government deplores and which has now already resulted in the fall of Manerplaw, has called in question any real commitment by the SLORC administration to reconciliation with the minorities.The Australian governments policy under these circumstances is to continue to apply every conceivable form of pressure or encouragement or persuasion that we can that is likely to be effective, to try and get movement against a number of benchmarks that we have articulated. That approach has largely found common acceptance not only with the United States and Europe but also with the ASEAN countries, which are very much more influential than any of us in Myanmar, at the discussions we had earlier last year. Australias position on trade and economic relations has led us to take the approach of neither encouraging nor discouraging trade and investment but holding out the prospect of more active support for trade and investment if again movement is made on those benchmarks.It was against all that background that Mr Hawke made his visit to Myanmar a few days ago. I was not aware of the visit until after it had occurred. Mr Hawke did, however, seek and receive standard briefing from my department earlier in January before the visit when he indicated to them that he was about to go. Had I known that he was going there I would have expressed no basic objection to the visit itself for exploring commercial opportunities. To have done so would have been to discriminate in a way that we have not done with other business firms that have indicated a desire to go there and see the opportunities. As I said, we neither encourage nor discourage.What I certainly would have done is urge him to use his undoubted stature and reputation internationally to make some very important points about the need for change in Burma, and in particular to address the intolerability of the continued detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. In the end, Mr Hawke chose not to do so, though he had ample opportunity to make these points, particularly in his discussions with Khin Nyunt. I have conveyed directly to Mr Hawke, in a phone conversation which he initiated this morning from Hong Kong, my disappointment at the missed opportunity to reinforce the views of the whole world community in this respect and also the significance likely to be attributed by the regime to the issue not being raised.Mr Hawkes response, to be fair, is that of course he feels intensely about these issues but that he will be in a better position to pursue them and to influence the SLORC if he has an ongoing or a continuing presence there, and at this stage he is simply in the early stage of doing just that. I have no reason whatsoever to doubt his genuineness in this respect but, as I indicated to him, I did differ quite fundamentally from his judgment in that respect.

The Minister for Resources is writing to woodchip companies and state governments to inform them of the areas that the government intends to protect, and the 222 national estate areas are explicitly protected in terms of the licence.The reality is that the states have primary responsibility for the management of forests and, as the Prime Minister has indicated, the government wishes to work cooperatively with the states to find the most effective way to end logging in the 509 high conservation value coupes. The mainland states, of course, have accepted an obligation, in signing the national forest policy statement, to protect forest areas likely to be of high conservation value until such time as those values can be thoroughly assessed, a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system put in place and a system of forest reserves established. I think it is time that the states joined with the Commonwealth in honouring that obligation of the national forest policy statement.Subject to the outcome of consultations with the states, it is anticipated that the principal means of protection for these coupes will be through conditions that are attached to the new licences. Of course, that will depend on the companies giving up their current licences, according to the processes that the Prime Minister outlined in his statement of 27 January. The Prime Minister has invited them to do so in order to remove the uncertainty that has been created by the Federal Court decision.I believe that it is in the best interests of all parties involved in this issue that they respond positively to the invitation the Prime Minister has issued. State agencies will need to reschedule their planned logging activities to avoid the nominated coupes. If after such rescheduling the resources available to industry are inadequate, the government has indicated that it will work in consultation with the industry, the unions and the states to assess the need for industry assistance.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[6]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

National Estate values are important; World Heritage values are important; bio-diversity values are important; and endangered species values are important. I point out to you, Senator, that on page 24 of the national forest policy statement, dealing with comprehensive regional assessments, those values are outlined very clearly. I will quote the NFPS for Senator Alstons information. It states:These assessments will provide the basis for enabling the Commonwealth and the States to reach a single agreement relating to their obligations for forests in a region. Commonwealth obligations include assessment of national estate values, World Heritage values, Aboriginal heritage values, environmental impacts, and obligations relating to international conventions, including those for protecting endangered species and biological diversity.I say to Senator Alston that the process that was used in determining these forest coupes and the original list of coupes that was provided by my department to the Minister for Resources was a transparent process, a consultative process, a rigorous process—","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[7]/answer[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

That is true. But Mr Souris fails to acknowledge the fact that the quarry in question is very small and the compartment in which it is situated is, by comparison, extraordinarily large.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator McMULLAN","5I4","ACT","ALP","N/A","9","—Notwithstanding the oppositions interjections, this is a program that has widespread support amongst state governments and the private sector. It is a straightforward team Australia proposal which this morning reflected that cooperative approach in a meeting of the Market Australia Advisory Group. The meeting was attended by myself and my colleague Peter Cook, representing the federal government, Hendy Cowan from Western Australia, David Hamill from Queensland, Phillip Gude from Victoria and Shane Stone from the Northern Territory, together with representatives of other Commonwealth government agencies and representatives of the private sector.The Market Australia initiative had its origins in the McKinsey report on behalf of the Australian Manufacturing Council about emerging exporters. The report identified a concern for Australian companies, particularly small to medium enterprises, and identified the need to raise international perceptions—by implication, particularly in our region—about Australias capacity in the manufacture of sophisticated goods and the provision of sophisticated services.There has been some delay in the commencement of that program to enable research to be undertaken because I did not wish—and the other ministers and representatives shared the view—to respond merely to an assessment as general as that from McKinsey, so we undertook a research campaign in seven markets in the Asian region which substantially reinforced the concerns which McKinsey outlined and gave some indications of the sort of campaign we ought to undertake to deal with them.The matters we dealt with this morning particularly related to marketing campaigns conducted essentially by the Commonwealth but with the cooperation of, and some funding from, the private sector to seek to change those images. It is a truism of any sort of marketing that images are quick to form and slow to change. But it is important to have a campaign to start the process of change. This mornings meeting decided to test the marketing concept in selected markets, particularly China, Indonesia and Thailand. We will be looking at some sector specific activity probably in the Republic of Korea.This is not all the Market Australia campaign will be doing. It has already got under way campaigns in association with the private sector to promote Australias skills in rural telecommunications, aerospace and environmental technology. The meeting this morning also decided that the campaign should concentrate on some specific sectors over and above those which I have outlined and will be using case studies of Australian excellence in high technology goods and services to support that.The advisory group proposed quite forcefully—and I think accurately—that there need to be sets of performance indicators against which the success of the campaign can be measured. It is not intended that it should be funded by the public sector as a long-term proposal. It is intended that we will seek to show whether a strategy such as this can succeed and, if it can, we hope that it will then be taken up by the private sector. We will be having discussions later this year and early next year about initiatives to encourage the private sector to take up this proposal when the government commitment to it concludes.I think it is an important and appropriate initiative. It is the sort of thing that the public sector should initiate briefly as a catalyst in concert with Commonwealth, states and the private sector in the hope that, if it succeeds, it will become a continuing feature of Australian market performance subsequently funded by the private sector. I thank all those corporate and state and territory representatives for their cooperation and assistance this morning.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[8]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have, as I have indicated in this chamber time and time again, taken seriously that responsibility and also the conservation elements of the national forest policy statement, one of which, as I have mentioned before, is the so-called moratorium clause of the statement which says that until assessments are completed forest management agencies will avoid activities that may significantly affect those areas of old-growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value.I was charged with the responsibility of providing Mr Beddall with advice on conservation values. I did that from the perspective of the environment minister. As you know, Mr Beddall, with his responsibilities under the national forest policy statement, is required to take into account other considerations as well. Not only does he take into account environmental considerations in coming to his conclusions; he also takes into account social and economic factors as he makes a determination.The 509 coupes have been identified as those of the highest priority that are required to protect areas of environmental significance pending a full assessment as part of the regional forest agreement process. Those areas have the potential to be strategically important for the development of a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system. The point is that they were areas assessed as having outstanding conservation attributes such as old-growth values or wilderness values; or they might be endangered species habitat or perhaps there was a conjunction of a number of other values. Particular attention was applied to coupes in areas listed on the Register of the National Estate or those where harvesting operations had the potential to impact on World Heritage values and, in coming to the 509 coupes, supplementary information and comments from state agencies were also utilised.In the first process, Senator, the state that you represent in this chamber did not comment—in fact refused to comment—on the information I made available to it.

In other words, it was a question about the process that this government has in place with regard to the export of woodchips from this country.For the edification of honourable senators, question on notice No. 1893 pointed out that alleged breaches of prescription in compartment 13 of Croobyar State Forest had come to our notice. We alleged that activities were taking place which were not in accordance with the national forest policy statement. We therefore asked: what is the forestry policy statement worth if breaches could be noticed on 22 November 1994? We wanted to know what was being done about it and whether a new licence would be issued to these people if such breaches were in fact found to have occurred. The fact that it has taken so long is not really the issue. The real issue is that we are concerned—and the Democrats have a right to be concerned—about the forest policy statement. We want to know whether the government is serious about enforcing it.I appreciate the fact that Minister Collins, in his answer to my question without notice, was able to say that there is an increased supervision of the terms and conditions of these licences. But, in the case of 27 November, we would have thought that there would be some sort of response to suggest that this government is serious about policing its own policies. It is not that we want inspectors hiding behind every tree or people running around in hard hats poking about in other peoples business all the time, but we do want some attempt to demonstrate that this government is serious about the terms and conditions that have been established. It has got a policy. Let us see it enforce it.Suggestions and allegations have been made and I would have expected a much more immediate response. I look forward to the ministers response, which I have been assured is forthcoming. But I make the point that, if there can be two examples found here, I wonder what else is going on.","N/A","QUESTIONS ON NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is just further evidence, if it needs to be given, of the absolutely incompetent way the environment minister and the resources minister handle these things. They have made Australia a laughing stock from a business investment point of view. They simply cannot handle, and are incapable of managing, the forest industry in Australia. It is something that was supposedly agreed upon in 1992 by the Commonwealth and all the states.The government in my own state of Queensland has been trying to get the Commonwealth government to move. It has been unable to do so simply because this federal government has no idea of how to handle Australias forest industry. Its ministers in the relevant areas are incapable and incompetent of managing these areas, and the sooner they get aside and let some competent ministers handle the issues, the better off Australia will be.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","QUESTIONS ON NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator GIBSON","BX5","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A","14","—I move:That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), to a question without notice asked by Senator Alston this day, relating to logging and woodchipping.Senator Faulkner said that the process of nominating the original 1,300 coupes was thorough, rigorous, open, transparent, done with consultation and will stand scrutiny. What hogwash! What absolute nonsense! He knows it and his government knows it. Everyone who has been interested in this matter knows that he and his government deliberately went about sponsoring extreme green groups throughout this land to come up with their nominations. In fact, he gave those groups $120,000 of taxpayers money to come forward with the 1,300 coupes.He gave them only seven weeks to do it, and so it was done in a very cursory, offhand way. He did not consult with the experts in the states—and he acknowledged today in this chamber that the state governments are the experts in land management and do in fact hold all the detailed information. Did he consult with them? No, he did not.With regard to the specifics that Senator Alston asked the minister about and which he failed to answer, let me refer the Senate to a letter in the Financial Review of the 16th of this month by Dr Hans Drielsma, the Managing Director of the State Forest of New South Wales. Dr Drielsma said:It is . . . interesting to note, therefore, that in the north-east of NSW, 125 out of 155 areas nominated as having high conservation value (ie, 80 per cent) have been logged at least once previously, presumably destroying their natural values.It was the minister himself who said in this chamber just a little while ago that the highest values the government was chasing were for old growth and for wilderness. Dr Drielsma said:Many of the areas, in addition to previous logging, were ringbarked or given . . . silvicultural treatment . . . to encourage good . . . regeneration. Obviously, these treatments have been highly successful.The whole thing has been a sham. I refer to a note put out by the Tasmanian government in December. Again, of the 181 areas nominated of the 1,300 that were in Tasmania, planned logging has been completed in 14 of those coupes. Logging is in progress in a further 19 of the coupes. A further 117 have been previously logged for a variety of products, including sawlog, pulpwood, mining timbers and firewood.This whole thing was a sham, and the minister and the government knows it. It was a deliberate move by the government to try to con suburban Melbourne and Sydney that it was supportive of Green sentiments. The government thought it could play one side of the coin as well as the other by renewing the licences. It thought it could get away with doing that. The demonstration outside this parliament by the people who are directly affected and the demonstrations that have been in Tasmania, Perth and in forest areas all around the nation show that it will not work.The minister knows what the solution is. The solution is to get agreement between the Commonwealth and the states as to what are parks and what are multiple-use forests. The minister claimed here today that his process has been open and transparent. He blamed the states for not settling the national forest policy process and ending up with regional agreements. What a load of hogwash. He knows as well as I do that his department and the Greens—Toyne and Co.—have been the source of obstruction on this matter.The states have tried to get criteria out of the Commonwealth for this regional assessment process, and they have failed. It really has been a shonky business by the minister. The community of Australia ought to be well aware of that. The government has been trying to play politics for the benefit of suburbia and to the detriment of all the affected people in the forests throughout regional Australia.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[1]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator FAULKNER","5K4","(New South Wales-","ALP","Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories)","15","—In December 1993 the cabinet decided that the Minister for the Environment would provide advice to the Minister for Resources on matters relevant to the national forest policy statement as it applied to the granting of woodchip export licences. The process I undertook in developing that advice, I believe, was the most comprehensive, thorough and transparent that has ever been undertaken. It was, however, complicated by a lack of cooperation from state governments.All states were advised in July 1994 by DPIE of the Commonwealths information requirements on the renewal of export licences. The states response to this request for information was very patchy and in many cases quite late. In fact, a comprehensive list of coupes likely to be logged were only ever received for Tasmania and the southern forests of Western Australia. This made the task of developing advice for Minister Beddall very difficult indeed.On 22 August the acting environment minister wrote to state ministers informing them of my initiative with the conservation organisations and inviting them to comment and to advise the department on the advice from the conservation organisations when received. This was also made clear and contacted at official levels.The New South Wales and Tasmanian governments responded that they would not cooperate in the assessment process. When reports were received from conservation organisations in early November, they were forwarded to state governments, NAFI, the Forest Protection Society and the CFMEU. They were asked to comment and provide information on any areas to my department. There were almost no responses to that invitation. No analysis was provided on the merits of individual coupe analysis.My portfolio analysed information from a wide range of sources before making its recommendations to me. As part of that process, the conservation organisations were funded to provide substantiated advice on areas likely to be of high conservation value. My advice in no way was an endorsement of the information provided by the conservation groups. My department undertook its own detailed assessment of the conservation significance of the areas that were planned for logging. It involved itself in a step by step process.The geographic locations of the coupes were checked. The Australian Heritage Commission checked coupes against information that was held on the register of the national estate. This information included the growth stage, the disturbance history and the presence of endangered species in the vegetation communities for the areas concerned. The environmental resources information unit used GIS technology to map the location of coupes with information holdings on nationally threatened species, including rare species of plants obtained from the records of museums, herbaria and botanical gardens around Australia.ANCA plotted the location of coupes against information holdings on rare and threatened species and communities, wetlands of significance and migratory paths of birds. ANCA also undertook a detailed analysis of the significance of places for the conservation of biodiversity, including an analysis at a national level of the importance of regions or areas.The conservation status of forest communities was checked by the portfolio against all the available information. Where it was considered to be poorly reserved, the area was also listed as likely to be of high conservation value. Analysis was undertaken on habitat requirements and strategies that needed to be put in place for protection of species listed in the Endangered Species Protection Act. The AHC was also involved in analysing the information against the national wilderness inventory. This represents a very thorough and detailed process.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator PANIZZA","JI4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A","15","—I join this debate very briefly and for one reason: to put paid to the lies that have been perpetrated by the green lobby movement around Australia, particularly around Western Australia, during the last few months. This has led to the fiasco of the cancellation of those licences, and that is why we see the ring of trucks outside. It is good to see a display of the machinery that we have in the forests, but it is very unfortunate that those machines are not in the forests working and earning foreign export income for Australia rather than sitting idly around here.Unfortunately, when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) could see the green lobby votes going out the window some time before Christmas, he decided to do something about it and overrode two of his ministers—Senator Faulkner and Mr Beddall—cancelling those licences, which had been issued under the national forest agreement almost two years ago. He had to intervene because he could see those green lobby votes disappearing. That is why we have the 509 blocks around Australia locked up. I refuse to call these blocks `coupes—I expect chickens to be running out of them.What effect does this have on Australias economy? We know what the economy is doing. It means the loss of jobs. It means the loss of jobs and incomes in remote areas—not around Canberra, not in Senator Faulkners town and not in Senator Gareth Evanss new electorate of Holt, but out in those remote areas where we cannot afford it.These are the lies the Greens put around. If you listened to the Greens—I half believed it myself for a while—you would think good, straight, millable karri and jarrah logs were going into woodchipping. That is a lie. That is a plain lie because only five per cent of hardwood forest goes into woodchipping as a by-product. The logs do not go in as a whole. The Democrats are not bad at pushing this lie either. Only five per cent of the hardwood goes in. Otherwise, that material would be left on the forest floor to rot and cause further diseases in the forest or to burn and add more expense. This way it has a value. The Greens say that that is the case. I say it is all lies.In all states of Australia, public forests are controlled by state authorities. In Western Australia they are controlled by the Department of Conservation and Land Management. It manages the forest. It decides what logs are cut, what logs are not cut and where not to cut. For example, it decided that there would be no cutting for 200 metres on either side of a stream. It decides not to cut on too steep a bank—anything over 15 degrees, I believe—whereas a lot of other countries cut on steeper banks. CALM decides all that.It decides what may be cut and then it decides the trees that have to be left behind for natural seed. When it allows the logging, then it appoints the contractors to fell the trees. CALM does that. Private enterprise does not do it—willy-nilly to make a fast buck. CALM decides. It has its own dedicated contractors. Then it has dedicated contractors to cart those logs to the mill. It sets the price the mill has to pay.You would think that is probably where the control of those logs finishes. But it does not. In Western Australia, the mill has to undertake that 70 per cent of first-grade, hardwood timber logs go to value adding, which puts paid to the argument of Mr de Bruin of the South Australian softwood industry. He said last night on television that 90 per cent finishes up in housing. That is a lie also. He is only protecting the softwood industry.We could debate for a lot longer than five minutes on this matter, but the lies the Greens are perpetrating are what caused the Prime Minister to come in to save the green lobby votes for himself for the next election by overriding the licences.If the green lobby group and the Democrats have a message, let them tell the truth. They should tell the truth about what happens. I know what goes on in the forests of Western Australia. I have made a good study of it and I know what is going on. The two Greens are missing today. Sorry, three Greens are missing today—there is a new one—but we hope they will come in and join this debate in time.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[3]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator HARRADINE","6H4","(Tasmania)","IND","N/A","16","—Certainty before the law, I believe, is a most important principle for not only the democratic process but also the prosperity of Australia. As it applies to industry, as it applies to the jobs of workers and as it applies to the environment, the governments new policy fails on that crucial test.The governments announcement on this matter is absolutely confusing. That is a matter that is common ground for persons who are supportive of the forest industry and also persons who are supportive of the environment. I fit into both categories, I hope, and quite a lot of people fit into that category—supportive of the environment and supportive of the industry. Frankly, knowing the number of foresters that I do, I take exception to the fact that they are classed very often as vandals of the forests.I had the pleasure recently of tenting with my wife up in Blue Tier in north-eastern Tasmania. Not many people know about Blue Tier—only the locals, and I happened to marry a local. It was a wonderful experience there for four or five days after Christmas. That was an area that a century ago was mined for tin. What has happened there is that Forestry Tasmania has ensured that that particular area is protected, and I refer to the massive myrtles that are swept by the mists of a night-time watering of the whole area. Forestry Tasmania has protected that area.I take exception to what Senator Faulkner says about no cooperation between the states and the government. I, along with everybody else, had thought this was gone from politics when the Resource Assessment Commission did the study and the national forestry policy statement emerged. In fact, that statement said:. . . until the assessments are completed—when it was talking about various assessments—forest management agencies will avoid activities that may significantly affect those areas of old growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value.Apparently Senator Faulkner thought that as minister he was the only one able to make that particular assessment. That was not what was envisaged in the national forestry policy statement. In fact, the states in cooperation with various Commonwealth areas did the assessments.People might say that I am parochial. In order to avoid appearing so, I seek leave to have incorporated into Hansard a summary of some of the documentation that a departmental officer of State Forest New South Wales gave me this morning, including a document entitled 1995 Logging in the Eden Management Area .Leave granted.The documents read as follows —1995 Logging in the Eden Management Area:1.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator CRANE","UW4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A","18","—I too rise to speak on Senator Gibsons motion to take note of Senator Faulkners answer to Senator Alstons question on coupes. I note that the question referred specifically to New South Wales. But in his answer the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) wandered all over the place, as he has done also in his comments here.I am going to make reference to some Western Australian aspects. In particular, I want to pick up the point made by Senator Harradine about certainty before the law and also that there must be some ability by people who deal with governments to have faith in government statements—ministerial statements, in particular.In connection with Western Australia, I refer in particular to the 1992 AHC-CALM agreement. At that time the then minister, Mrs Kelly, heralded that agreement by saying:I believe this is an outstanding example of the way in which federal and State agencies can work together for common good . . . I hope its the beginning of a new relationship between forest industries and State governments.She further went on there to say that this would improve the productivity in the forest sector while conserving the National Estate. At the time this was supported, might I add, by Senator Coulter, the then Leader of the Australian Democrats, by Senator Chaney, who was the environmental spokesman for the opposition, and by a number of other people, including some from the Green movement.We now have a situation where that has been thrown out the door. It is indeed unfortunate that both Senator Collins and Senator Faulkner have chosen to leave the chamber, but I note that the Leader of the Government, Senator Gareth Evans, is here. I put the fact that we are already seeing the fallout of this particular decision with the uncertainty that is apparent here: Whittakers, one of the operators in Western Australia, has applied to the Stock Exchange to suspend trading of its shares and this has been granted. This is the sort of thing that happens when we have a government that is inconsistent in its policy position and does not know where it is travelling. There is conflict between Senator Collins, Senator Faulkner and Minister Beddall in the other place. We now have the intervention of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). As a result we have thousands and thousands of jobs at risk, with the flow-on effects of that into our current account, higher national debt, higher interest rates and all other things flowing from them.What we have to say to those sitting on the other side in relation to this is that if they are going to change the rules of the game, if they are going to say that they no longer have faith in what the Australian Heritage Commission did in 1992 in making the assessment in terms of the Western Australian forest—if they no longer have faith in that decision and the identification process that went on then, then they should damn well come out and say so. They should just be a little bit honest about it. They should not hide under it and undermine the industry, undermine the people involved in it, mislead the people who are genuinely concerned about conservation values, undermine the work that has been done by the conservation and land management division in Western Australia and totally confuse everybody in the process.That is the challenge that this government has to answer as to why it has changed its particular position. It certainly cannot be for conservation reasons. It certainly is not because of the management of the particular operations that go on there, whether it be saw-milling or—as Senator Panizza said—picking up the residue of that saw-milling and utilising it for chipping and earning export dollars. It is all about the governments political position and how it perceives it can buy votes. It is not about the best interests of Australia. It is not about the best interests of the particular states involved in it. It is not about honouring agreements which have been put in place, as I have mentioned, between the Australian Heritage Commission and the conservation and land management department in Western Australia. In fact, it is a total no confidence vote in those entities.But, in terms of identifying the `coupes, as they are called in Western Australia, one must ask why the government got a list from the conservation council but never bothered to refer those on the list to the conservation and land management division and, as I understand it—but I cannot be certain about this—nor did the government bother to have those identified or assessed by the Australian Heritage Commission. The government has gone back in over the top of the work that was already done in 1992; it has given no valid reason for the action it has taken; and it has thrown an industry, a very successful industry, into chaos.Finally, I wind up my remarks by asking: why did Senator Faulkner refuse the invitation to go down and inspect the management programs now occurring in the south-west forest? I think a visit there would be an object lesson to him and to anybody in the government.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[5]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is an absolute insult to this chamber and indeed an insult to the forest industry and the families and communities that it supports that the minister is not in the chamber to listen to the debate on such an important issue.The simple fact is that, on an economic basis, this is a multi-billion dollar industry earning vitally needed export dollars for our economy. We know that our balance of trade is blowing out every month with now multi-billion dollar deficits turning in by the month. The one area where the federal government could be redressing that is in the area of providing certainty, as Senator Harradine so eloquently put it, to the forest industry.But, no, it does not. Why not? Because it has only one agenda. That agenda is to do the work of the conservation movement—that is, to fund the conservation movement and to give it reports to act upon to close down certain forest coupes. We ought to be aware that the 146 areas of high conservation value in Tasmania, which Senator Faulkner previously listed, were seriously flawed in science. Some 80 per cent of the areas that he nominated in my home state did not qualify under the national forest policy statement definitions of high quality, old-growth and wilderness. Large numbers of the areas nominated had a history of past logging and reafforestation.I put it to this house that it is absolutely essential for sound public policy that there be certainty, that people know the process and that the process is fair and reasonable so that the outcome can be looked upon and accepted by the community at large. What Senator Faulkner has done, on his own admission, is to consult with only the green movement, the conservation groups. To make it easier for them, he threw in $120,000 to assist them.What was the purpose of that? Well, his predecessor has told the world how the Labor Party operates— Whatever it takes . It is not what is good for Australia, not what is reasonable and not what is sound—whatever it takes. In this case, it is whatever it takes to get the green vote. We in Tasmania had an outrageous government called the Green-Labor accord. It destroyed the economy of our state. The Liberal government is still trying to get Tasmania out of the doldrums created by the Green-Labor accord. The people of Australia ought to be aware that this government is in fact a de facto Green-Labor accord wreaking exactly the same havoc over Australia that the Michael Field/Bob Brown government did to the people of Tasmania.It would be a great tragedy if people like Bob Brown were to come into this place. They would continue to destroy the lives of people, their investments, their livelihoods, their families and their communities. That is what this debate is all about. It is about time that the Labor Party put its principles on the line and said to the workers and trade unionists of this country, `We support you before the extreme greenists. This is its test. It has already failed it. It has the opportunity to redeem itself before the next election. If it does not, I am assured that the workers within regional Australia will absolutely desert the Labor Party and we will regain all those seats that are required to ensure that John Howard becomes the next Prime Minister of Australia.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[6]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator BELL","7U4","(Tasmania)","AD","N/A","20","—It is wrong that we should be here today after so many years of this government still unable to resolve this issue. Senator Panizza, quite rightly, described the particular system that was being used in Western Australia which took account of the needs and aspirations and particular concerns of West Australians about their geography and environment.We have heard descriptions of the arguments put forward by Mr de Bruin from South Australia—arguments which Senator Panizza has rightly described as being particularly relevant to South Australias softwood industry, an industry which is not replicated anywhere else in Australia. We have everybody in this debate approaching it from a particular point of view based on their particular world view and with their particular information.This is the debate to take note of Senator Faulkners answer. In his answer he described a process which he felt was transparent, consultative, thorough and rigorous—the list that Senator Gibson gave when he first sought to take note of this answer. There could be some dispute about whether that process was thorough or public enough.I think what we are really debating is not actually that but some of the phrases and the slogans which have crept into this—slogans which have replaced actual discussion and actual information. One of the slogans that we pass over far too readily without thinking about what it actually means is the expression `high conservation values. We are still debating what that really means. It could mean that in that area there are heritage values, national estate values or values which would protect endangered species.I think one of the values which has not received sufficient attention in this debate so far is the value where you have a remnant species which needs to be protected. I know that at least all the Tasmanian senators in this chamber know of the incredible value of the remnant species Huon pine. It is crucial that we protect, in all instances, every single example that we can find of that particular species. Of course, that also applies to a number of other particularly valuable species in Tasmania.In Tasmania, whatever else happens in a coupe or a block of forest, as Senator Panizza described them, if that particular area contains a representation of some of our minority species of timber, it could justifiably be argued that there is reason to protect it. That is why we see what appears to be difficult to understand when there has been exploitation beforehand, when there may have been quarrying work or tin mining—","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[7]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

If in an area there has been some quarrying, mining, bushfires, logging, railways—goodness knows what there might have been—and if there is representation of one of our threatened species, our remnant species of timber, then there may be justification to preserve the whole area. That is a very good example of the complicated process that should be undertaken when assessing the value of these particular coupes of forest. There are so many problems in this debate that no one person could define them, but I think one of the big problems has been the fact that reasons have not been fully explained for the offering up of some of these areas for protection.What we need to see is a process by which the reasons for logging this area rather than another are fully explained and debated and what is contained in the national forest policy is enforced. When licences are given, they should be enforced. The operator must be obliged to comply with their terms and conditions, and suitable penalties should apply. That is what I have been on about today. That is what we ought to be discussing in great detail in the future.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[7]/speech/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

But we also know that some of these areas have been logged more than once in the last 100 years. I put it to the minister: if an area has a high conservation value after having been logged more than once in the last 100 years, why will it not continue to have a high conservation value in 100 years time?One of the reasons the minister has given as to why something might be declared a high conservation area is that it might contain endangered species. I put it to the minister that the biggest endangered species around at the moment might be the timber worker.

This particular dispute encompasses those three areas quite distinctly. It is at the expense of our foreign debt, timber workers and their families, and the creation of sustainable jobs.The timber industry has had decades of uncertainty. Every time groups of selfish radicals put pressure on this Labor government, it just caves in. Our native forests are some of the best managed forests in the world. Over the last 50 years—maybe more recently than that—many forest inquiries studies and EISs have been carried out.

Much of this imported timber is from countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia which have very little in the way of sound forest management.I put it to the Green movement that, if it were truly interested in the global environment, it would not be attempting to close down our well managed and sustainable forests to the detriment of the worlds forests. Generally, the international environmental organisation supports sustainable management of our native forests. However, the local organisations appear determined to oppose it at every opportunity.There is much more at stake than the so-called woodchip industry. Those of us who live and work in rural New South Wales appreciate the full worth of the timber and forest product industry to our local communities. It is one industry which has prospered during the drought, keeping jobs and income in otherwise hard-pressed towns of rural and regional Australia.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[8]/speech/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator CALVERT","5F4","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A","22","—I support my colleagues. On Saturday morning, with my colleagues Senator Gibson, Senator Watson and others, I was very proud to march through the streets of Launceston in the pouring rain along with 3,000 members of the forest industry. Alongside us were state and federal members of the Labor Party. It is an indictment of this government and the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), who is here today, that this situation has arisen. I do not think those forestry workers, loggers and truck drivers wanted to be there and they do not want to be here today protesting. They want to get on with their jobs and families. They want to make some money and get on with life.The fact is that this minister and this government have put them in a position where they have no other way to go but to come here and demonstrate and march through the streets to put their side of the argument. Until now, we have only heard one side of the argument—indeed, the answers we got today were only one side of the argument. Why is it that the government is funding one side of the argument and not supporting the other side of the argument? Why is it that the unions and some Labor Party members have to join with us to try to make a point? Why is it that all the time so-called compromises keep on eating away into the livelihoods of those in the forest industry?I note that Senator Harradine tabled some documents that were given to him this morning by a forester from New South Wales, David Ridley. I sat through a briefing with him. He talked about the very controversial area at Eden in New South Wales. He took us through the process that the forest industry in New South Wales is going through at the moment. I was quite amazed. I believe that the same thing happens in Tasmania. They look for everything. The whole process is transparent, scientific and auditable; they are the three words he used.I wonder how much further the forest industry is expected to go. If Minister Faulkner has talked about being even-handed, why do the loggers have one-year term leases? If the government is out to be even-handed and fair, at the very least these licences and leases should be for a period of five years to allow the industry to have something that is bankable when it tries to borrow money and something that gives it some security.In my state, we have had some 20 assessments, inquiries and impact statements over the years. No doubt everybody would agree that everything was not good initially. We have come a long way. There is possibly further to go. But the fact is that we have a minister and a government that can create so much uncertainty in a state that is really crying out for development. At present, we have the prospect of at least one pulp mill downstreaming woodchips. The uncertainty that has been created by this move of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his minister will cause havoc in my state of Tasmania. It will send a clear message to people throughout the world who want to invest in downstreaming woodchipping in Australia that this is not the place to come. That is not what we want. Unfortunately, that is the message that is being given. I think it is the message that the extremist green movement wants to put out.An incident having occurred in the gallery —","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[9]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator BOSWELL","YE4","(Queensland-","NP","Leader of the National Party of Australia)","23","—Mr Deputy President, I ask you to have patience with the forest workers. They are desperate. They are coming here because their jobs are on the line. I ask you to excuse them if they do get a bit emotional, because everything depends on the outcome of what happens in the next couple of days.Today in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans said, as he tried to pass the buck to the states, that the states were not signing the national forest agreement and that therefore they could not get any accommodation. I have letters here from Mrs Kirner and Mr Fahey, the Premier of New South Wales, all pleading with the federal government to give them the criteria to allow them to go ahead and sign or complete the national forest agreement.The national forest agreement was signed two years ago. The criteria that would allow the agreement to go forward has not come from the federal government. If it is anyones fault that this debacle has happened, it clearly rests with the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) and his department.It is a debacle. Today as I was approaching the parliament I saw on the lawn members of the forest union abusing the federal government. For one minute I thought I was at a National Party rally. That is an absolute debacle, and it is a debacle caused by the Labor Party not knowing which horse to back. Does it back the workers, the traditional supporters of the ALP, or does it back the white wine socialists, the Volvo socialists?It is very simple: you cannot ride two horses in one race. The Labor Party is trying to do that and it is getting itself into a mess. The signal that you are sending out to the unionists of Australia is that you have deserted them. They have been prepared to pay $180 a year of their hard-earned wages to support your government. The unions are the organisational strength of the ALP and you have ratted on them, you have deserted them and you have walked away from them. You are sending out the clear message that the ALP no longer represents the working class men and women of Australia.Now you have got yourself into the absolutely ludicrous position of removing those 509 coupes, of allowing sawmilling and timber cutting to go ahead. Huge resources will be burnt down, will be put through the fire hole. Huge resources that are worth export income to Australia will have to be either left on the floor of the forest or burnt—wasted. Dollars are going up in smoke.The other thing that may happen if the sawmills cannot get a return on their woodchip is it may reduce the mills to unviability and put a number of people out of work. Those are the two options: burn the timber, burn the resource—if you can live with that, the price of timber and homes will go up—or shut down the mills in regional Australia. As my colleague Senator Sandy Macdonald said, the timber industry has sustained a number of rural towns that have been hurt by the drought.This government has a lot to answer for. It has a lot to answer its unionists for. I give the government this message: find out who you are backing, pick the industry that you are supporting. At least Senator Devereux had the honesty to say that he was agreeing and was deserting the ALP and the work force. But you guys are trying to cover two areas—the Green movement and the worker—and you are not succeeding in either of them.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[10]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator COULTER","TF4","(South Australia)","AD","N/A","24","—A moment ago Senator Sandy Macdonald gave us figures which underscored the serious deficiencies in the forestry industry in Australia over a large number of years. He indicated that the disparity between Australian exports of forest products and imports went to several billion dollars.I am a member of a number of conservation bodies, and have been since the mid-1950s, and I make no apology whatsoever for the position taken by the conservation movement over a long period. It is the conservation movement that has been telling the forestry industry and successive governments over many decades that we should get into extensive plantation forestry. I point the finger here at the opposition, which was in government right through the 1950s, the 1960s and into the early 1970s, and then from 1975 to 1983, for its failure to insist that the forestry industry in this country be based on plantation forestry.In the state of South Australia, where we unfortunately chopped down our small amount of forests very early on and established plantation forestry in the 1920s mainly in the south-east of the state, we have and have had for decades the only forestry commission that has been running at a profit. A few moments ago Senator Calvert talked about Tasmania. Doesnt he recall that the Tasmanian government had not so long ago to write off $450 million worth of debt which the Tasmanian Forestry Commission has got itself into because of the total inadequacy of the way it was managing the forests?I am particularly sympathetic towards those men and women who work in the forestry industry because at present they are the meat in the sandwich between inadequate government policy over decades and a totally inadequate policy by the forestry commissions and the forestry industries in every state of Australia except South Australia. They are the people who are now being screwed. They are not being screwed by the conservation movement; they are being screwed by the inadequacy of the policies which have been pursued over a long period.The claim that has been repeated here today that it is only waste which is going to the chippers is a lie. I have been to many forests and seen exactly what are the operations. I suggest to the opposition that, if it goes and has a look, it will see at least 30 per cent of the timber which is being cut down is being left on the forest floor. I have seen it in Queensland; I have seen it in New South Wales; I have seen it in Victoria; and I have seen it in Tasmania. Again, it is the workers who are being screwed in this because many of them—they are outside this building with their rigs—are working on contracts in which they are paid by the tonnage of logs delivered to the chippers. The companies have mobile chippers. They could go out into the forests, chip there and transport the timber in bins, which can be seen around this building also.Those workers, who have those expensive rigs and who are tied to large overdrafts, are forced by the system to go out and take just the maximum weight of timber to the chippers. Logs two feet in diameter and branches are being left on the forest floor and burnt simply because it is not economical for those workers, because of the economic situation that the chipping companies have put them in, to pick up those important pieces of timber and take them in to be chipped.It is simply not true that this industry is efficient economically or efficient in terms of the timber that it has used. As I say, I expressgreat sympathy for those workers who are really being caught as the meat in the sandwich. I believe it is wrong for them to blame the conservation movement. If we had taken notice of the conservation movement from the 1960s onwards, we would be at least 20 to 30 years down the track towards having more extensive plantation forestry, and there would be adequate timber both for the imports which Senator Sandy Macdonald referred to and also for the supply of timber and chips to Australia.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[11]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator HERRON","VW4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A","25","—I move:That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to a question without notice asked by Senator Herron this day, relating to the endorsement of a safe sex guide.I move this motion reluctantly, because this is an issue. I am not a subscriber to Cleo magazine, but my attention was drawn to this so-called sex guide by a columnist in the Courier-Mail called Lawrie Kavanagh, who is regarded very affectionately by people in Queensland as a voice of the people. I would like to read into Hansard something he said in his column which I think is apposite to this. He states:If anything Australia has been at the forefront of the looney left, politically correct takeover of society, a takeover sanctioned, indeed encouraged, by our politicians.What is it about our politicians that they almost break their weak spines bowing to the worlds whims, particularly the whims of the looney left? Such a numerically small nation with such a huge contrived guilt to bear. How does Australia stay afloat, I wonder?How long will we continue to put up with looney left minority excesses, I wonder?Many of those excesses slip by because the majority either dont know or dont care.That must have been the case with Carmen Lawrences endorsement of a national womens magazine safe sex guide in its December issue.Carmen has been touted as a chance to become our first female PM and is Minister for Human Services and Health at this stage.As her department and our taxes collaborated with the magazine to produce the safe sex guide, it seems only natural that the Minister should endorse it with enthusiasm, but the question is did she do a Ros Kelly? Did Carmen Lawrence read the guide before she wrote her endorsement which ended with this recommendation: It deals with sexual health in a factual and non-judgmental way and is a resource that everyone should read.If she did read this guide then she has recommended the delightful and health-giving joys of anal intercourse, or sodomy as it was called in less enlightened times, for heterosexual couples.So does Julie, 23, one of the case histories in the guide, endorse sodomy with enthusiasm—. . . each time, the sense of forbidden fruit has made it so exciting . . . the vibe is more primeval, more erotic . . . like losing your virginity all over again.But remember, as the Health Minister of this nation says, it deals with the issues in a non-judgemental way.And after all it does not fail to stress the need to take precautions and use condoms, certainly when Anal stimulation can be enjoyed in various forms through rimming (licking and sucking on the area around the anus) which the guide reports can be a real turn on.I hope you appreciate these extracts from the safe sex guide because it is a resource that everyone should read and a lot of concerned people worked long and hard with your money to produce it.But while nothing the looney left minority writes, says or does would surprise the majority, the Health Ministers endorsement of anal intercourse and its associated health-giving foreplays is a bit of a worry.For instance medical experts believe AIDS would be virtually wiped out in Australia if anal intercourse, or sodomy, was suddenly to disappear.Yet here we have a national Health Minister endorsing a tax-funded sex guide which recommends the very act that can lead to death.Unless, of course, the Minister did a Ros Kelly and didnt read the material before endorsing it. In which case she is still a bit of a worry.That is the article that was in the Courier-Mail . I speak here as a parent—a parent of seven daughters and three sons. I speak as a medical practitioner with over 30 years experience. The reality of life is that that Cleo guide advocates this as a normal sexual practice. It puts it out in glamorous fashion as something to be enjoyed and an activity that normal people should encourage.I am sending a copy of this guide—at least the extract that I referred to—to every member of parliament, on both the government side as well as the opposition side, because it is an issue that affects all of us in this society. It is not something that should be fobbed off as being just something about which a crazy fellow on the other side is trying to score off the government. I am not. It is something fundamental in this society. We have to stop advocating this in society because, if we advocate that it is normal, we destroy the basis of the family unit and we destroy the very fundamentals that we stand for.I am certain that this guide affects not only the Christian churches but also the ethnic groups in our community. It affects every mother and father in this community. Any doctor will tell you that anal intercourse is damaging to the rectum. Various associated conditions are caused by this, like fissures in the anus, chemical irritations of the rectum, damage to the sphincters of the anus, warts and all the other communicable diseases. This is a matter of very serious significance.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[12]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

These forests should be protected by the commitments of the Commonwealth and State Governments under the NFPS.These forests include:Coolangubra Wilderness and other areas of the S.E. Forests of NSW along with rainforest and other N.E. areas of NSW including Wingham, Mistake, Richmond Range, Chaelundi, North Washpool, Barrington and Dorrigo.The Southern Highlands, Great Western Tiers and Tarkine Wilderness of Tasmania.The Karri and Jarrah forests of S.W. Western Australia.The Errinundra Plateau and other areas of the East Gippsland forests of Victoria.The rainforests of the Proserpine region of Queensland.We request that the Government act urgently to protect our precious forests by utilising the Commonwealths legal and constitutional powers, including:Refusal of export woodchip licencesPowers to control corporationsProtection of areas listed on the register of the National EstateProtection and effective funding of areas identified for their World Heritage values.Genuine and effective action by the Government to protect these and other old growth and wilderness forests is critical. A comprehensive plantation strategy rather than exploiting native forests is the way forward for a truly environmentally responsible timber industry.

and(b) show a greater commitment to programs which prevent family breakdown.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:The petition of the undersigned shows:We, the undersigned citizens respectfully submit that the proposed signing of the UN Convention on Desertification has the potential to adversely affect the rights of farmers to manage their farms, and of local authorities to govern their shires as well as infringing the constitutional responsibility of the states on land management issues.We therefore request that the treaty not be signed without first receiving the scrutiny and approval of the Senate and subject to such reservations as the Senate might recommend.As your petitioners in duty bound shall ever pray.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the Senate the need for changes to the Family Law Act of Australia and to the child support scheme.Your petitioners therefore request that the Senate support the following changes.(1)That the existing Family Law Act be scrapped and replaced by a more simplified version together with the minimum of rules and regulations necessary.(2)That the Family Court be replaced by a Tribunal and that all matters resulting from divorce and family breakdown be heard before, and determined by a panel; the panel to be made up of persons qualified in matters arising from family breakdown.(3)That legal professionals be barred from appearing before the Tribunal resulting in vast savings to the disputing parties.(4)That a modified fault clause be re-introduced to Family Law primarily designed to discourage adultery and to stop rewarding adulterers at the expense of deserted and innocent parties.(5)That the Child Support Agency be scrapped and replaced by an appropriate administrative procedure within the Tribunal.(6)That apart from cases of exceptional circumstances parental-child access become the inalienable right of all parents.(7)That alternative counselling, (Government funded) be made available through the Churches and that much more emphasis be placed on mediation in resolving disputes prior to the commencement of legal proceedings.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:That this Bill intends to bring about changes which will grant more power to the Human Rights Commission, which in itself is not a court but can recommend offenders be taken to court not under Australian law but under a foreign law.And that Australia has signed 2223 UN treaties and covenants compared to the United States 400. In the US all treaties and covenants are debated in Congress, but here in Australia the Government of the day has the power to sign these instruments without any debate taking place in Parliament.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:Whereas the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994 is a direct surrender of Australian sovereignty to the dictates of an unelected United Nations Human Rights Committee made up of foreign nationals, many from countries with no respect for human rights, andWhereas it will deprive States of their ability to legislate, in accord with community views, on any matter of public policy which touches on sexual conduct b ecausde such legislation could be overturned by the High Court following UN Human Rights Committee rulings.We the undersigned pray that the Senate will reject this Bill.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled—The petition of the undersigned show that:We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully submit that as the current debate proceeds on the Family Law Reform Bill, that the role of the grandparents be included in discussion, with particular emphasis on the needs of the children affected by divorce (including defacto partnerships).We submit that the grandparents, in the majority of cases, can be the one constant element for the children, to help maintain their stability and peace of mind, with someone who is part of the extended family and whose main concern is their wellbeing.Your petitioners therefore request that:The Federal Government amends the Family Law Reform Bill to ensure that the role of grandparents be included in any considerations of the needs of the children affected by divorce (including defacto relationships).And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled.The Petition of the undersigned strongly opposes the increase in the Pensioner age for women from 60 to 65.Your petitioners ask that the Senate take action to reverse this decision.To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:The petition of the undersigned of Western Australia shows:Their objection to the proposed revamping of ABC television local news and;(a) rejects the proposal being put before the ABC board to replace state based news and current affairs with a national service;(b) notes that Western Australia viewers will be particularly disadvantaged from this proposal because of the time zone differences that operate around Australia;(c) questions the managements suggestion that local news and current affairs be relegated to a 6.30—7 pm timeslot; given the ABC viewers have consistently rejected news broadcasts that begin before 7 pm (e.g. the failure of The National and the 6 pm weekend news);(d) calls on the ABC board to reject this proposal as incompatible with the corporations aims of providing a service to all Australians, not just the residents of the larger Eastern states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/petition.grp/petition[1]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Defence)","34","—I table the explanatory memorandum and move:That this bill now read a second time.I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard .Leave granted.The speech read as follows —The purpose of this bill is to enable the recently enacted safe third country provisions of the Migration Act 1958 to cover Vietnamese refugees who had already been successfully resettled in the Peoples Republic of China but who lodged claims for a protection visa in Australia after 30 December 1994. More generally the bill is also to enable the safe third country provisions of the Act to have effect from a specified date preceding the date of commencement of any future agreements and relevant regulations.In the last session of Parliament the Government introduced safe third country amendments to the Migration Act to ensure that certain non-citizens in relation to whom there is a safe third country, or who are covered by the Comprehensive Plan of Action for Indo-Chinese Refugees (CPA), should not be allowed to apply for a protection visa. The purpose of the legislation was to prevent forum shopping by people who had already found a country which offered them protection, or whose claims for refugee status had been rejected under an appropriate determination system. The first application of the legislation was in respect of people who arrived in Australia from Galang in Indonesia where they had been assessed as not being refugees under a refugee determination process approved by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.The legislation has been effective in ensuring that the relatively small numbers of asylum seekers from Galang arriving here after the legislation was passed were returned and others in similar circumstances were discouraged from attempting to circumvent the Comprehensive Plan of Action brokered by UNHCR. What the current legislation did not foresee was a situation where large numbers of people arrive very quickly from a place where they have received effective and on-going protection, but with which Australia does not have an existing safe third country agreement. Under the legislation as it stands, Australia has no choice but to process to finality all claims from these people lodged before a safe third country agreement has been reached. In other words, it is possible for people to arrive in Australia from what is in fact a safe third country, and access our refugee determination system because an agreement between that country and Australia has not been negotiated. This is not in the interests of the safe third country, the country to which the asylum seekers travel or UNHCR. It encourages rapid and destabilising irregular movements of people and undermines the concerted actions of governments and the UNHCR to provide durable solutions in countries of first asylum.From October 1994, 695 people, largely ethnic Chinese Vietnamese from Southern China, have arrived by boat in Australia. Neither Australia nor China considers it desirable to encourage this flow of people. More importantly, information from UNHCR, the Government of China and our own representatives in southern China has shown conclusively that these people have received the protection of China since they began arriving there from Vietnam in the late 1970s. The details outlined in the statement on the prescribing of the PRC as a safe third country, which will be tabled in Parliament shortly, reveal the group in question to have been treated humanely and that every effort has been made to help them integrate socially and economically into Chinese society. To encourage the belief that simply by sailing to Australia they, and the many like them who remain in China, can undermine the resettlement efforts made on their behalf by China and the UNHCR is wrong. The Government does not believe that this in the best interests of the ethnic Chinese Vietnamese community in China and it is not in the best interests of the international community.Australia makes a considerable effort internationally, through our overseas aid program, our significant contribution to UN peacekeeping initiatives and our assistance to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to support efforts to help refugees return to their own country or to resettle in their country of first asylum. Where resettlement in Australia is the most appropriate approach, cases are considered in an orderly way under our Humanitarian Program, which this year will bring 13,000 people in need of resettlement to Australia to begin a new life. The irregular and illegal movement to Australia of people who have no grounds for claiming to be refugees from China undermines these and similar efforts made by the international community.On 30 December 1994, it was announced that the Government would introduce into this session of Parliament legislation designed to ensure that, from that date, certain unauthorised arrivals from the PRC would not be allowed to gain access to Australias refugee determination system. The announcement underlines the fact that a country may have, in fact, been a safe third country well before it has been prescribed as one by Australia. To alleviate the paradoxical situation of a country appearing to be an unsafe country one day and a safe country the next, and to avoid the possibility of a similar situation to that which we have recently found ourselves in respect of China, Australia would have to negotiate safe third country agreements with every country in the world.The sensible alternative, clearly signalled on 30 December 1994 in the case of the boat arrivals from China, is to amend the legislation to enable Australian law to reflect the pre-existing reality.The bill being introduced today will allow the sensible operation of the safe third country legislation by ensuring that all people who have protection in a safe third country will be treated in the same way, rather than the anomalous situation that exists under present law where people from the STC who apply before a safe third country agreement is concluded are allowed to engage our protection obligations whereas those who arrive in precisely the same circumstances but after an agreement has been reached cannot.The legislation `will not, and cannot result in people being returned to a country that is not a safe third country. No-one will be returned unless they are covered by a safe third country agreement or there has been proper examination of their claim for protection. The legislation also does not apply to anyone who has been granted a substantive visa or to whom it has been determined Australia owes protection obligations before the safe third country regulation takes effect.It should also be noted that the Minister retains a non-compellable discretion to allow a persons application to remain valid despite this legislation if the Minister judges that to be in the public interest.This bill seeks to make Australias contribution to international efforts to reduce the large-scale illegal movement of people effective and consistent. Its main effect will be to eliminate inconsistencies in the way people are dealt with under the safe third country provisions of the Migration Act who are in all respects the same, other than in the date they arrived in Australia. It contains a very effective safety net to ensure that people affected by it are either returned to a prescribed safe third country or allowed into our refugee determination system.I commend this bill to the chamber.Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until the first day in the winter sittings 1995, in accordance with the order agreed to on 29 November 1994.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Defence)","36","—I table the explanatory memorandum and move:That this bill now read a second time.I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard .Leave granted.The speech read as follows —This bill has two purposes, both of which relate to the need to protect the integrity and effectiveness of Australias refugee determination system.The bills first purpose is to ensure that the fertility control policies of the government of a foreign country are disregarded in determining if a non-citizen is a member of a particular social group within the meaning of the Refugee Convention as amended by the Refugee Protocol for the purposes of considering an application for a protection visa.Australia was among the first to sign the Refugees Convention, and the Migration Act and our refugee determination system reflect the seriousness with which we take our obligations under the Convention. The Convention states that a refugee is a person who has a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group. A commonly used example of the kind of social group the Convention had in mind is that of the Kulaks of the then USSR who were persecuted because they were a land owning class which the Government of the day wished to eradicate.Useful though the ground of social group undoubtedly is, it is also the most difficult to define in practice. Assessment of whether a claimant is a member of a particular social group is usually left to those who administer and review our refugee determination system. However, the implication of the recent Federal Court judgement that a person may be recognised as a member of a particular social group simply because he or she is a person to whom the fertility control policy of a foreign government applies, or who objects to such a policy, has such potentially serious consequences that the Government has decided to introduce the current bill.The Government considers that the recent judgement distorts the meaning of the Convention ground of particular social group to such a degree that the integrity and effectiveness of Australias refugee determination system would be threatened if it were allowed to stand.To regard a large proportion of the population of China, or any country, as a social group and therefore as potential refugees simply on the basis of their governments fertility control policy is inconsistent with the intention of the Convention to provide protection to refugees with a well founded fear of persecution.In introducing this legislation I emphasise that the Government is not questioning that the Convention ground of particular social group is a useful and necessary concept. Indeed the Government is seeking to bring the application of this concept into line with our international obligations following the recent Federal Court decision.I also wish to make it clear that this bill will not deny access to our protection to a person who seeks it as a member of a particular pre-existing social group, or on any of the other Convention grounds, who has a well founded fear of persecution because of fertility control policies. What this means is that a person from a particular village or workplace who is subjected to the rogue application of a fertility control policy in a manner which amounts to persecution could still have a claim accepted under the legislation introduced today. Nor will a person who is a member of a particular religious, political or racial group subject to the persecutory application of fertility control policies be denied consideration of their claims under this legislation.The Government is concerned to address issues which might arise from gender based persecution and has been working actively in this area for some time. For instance our Humanitarian Program contains a specific women at risk component which targets resettlement assistance to refugee women in particularly vulnerable situations.However, the Government is concerned to ensure that the Convention is interpreted correctly. This will ensure the retention of public commitment to our refugee determination system and the integrity and effectiveness of that system. Incorrectly diluting the meaning of particular social group under the Convention has the potential to undermine that public confidence and the ability of our determination system to do the job it was set up to do—to afford protection to genuine refugees.The legislation introduced today will help provide a common sense approach to the definition of a particular social group under the Convention by precluding the possibility of very large numbers of people with nothing in common but that they may be affected in some way by the fertility control policies of their government being caught within the definition of a social group under the Convention.The second purpose of the bill introduced today is to prevent a non citizen from making further applications for a protection visa when they have already made an application, whether or not the prior application has been finally determined.Australia operates one of the most thorough, efficient and equitable refugee determination systems in the world. A persons claim is assessed against the Convention definition of a refugee, and if it is not accepted at the primary stage, the person may appeal to the independent Refugee Review Tribunal which may reverse the primary decision. If a persons claim is still not accepted at the RRT stage, it is open to that person to seek review on administrative law grounds from the Federal Court.Under current legislation, when a person has exhausted this process, it is not difficult for them to lodge another application for a protection visa and start the whole process again. The fact that repeat applications serve to delay the removal from Australia of the applicant has led to their increased use. The processing of these repeat applications, which like the initial application are free of charge to the applicant, is both expensive and time consuming.When a system is fair, open and contains the right to appeal the primary decision, claimants will generally have no need to repeat the whole process to get a fair hearing. That fair hearing is amply provided by the system as it exists already. The bill introduced today therefore will have the effect of barring repeat applications in the majority of cases. Its intention in doing so is to protect the integrity of, and support for Australias refugee determination system and to ensure that available resources are expended on claims for protection which have not yet been exhaustively assessed.In introducing this bar on repeat applications, the Government is aware that there will remain circumstances in which particular repeat applications may merit consideration. These cases are likely to include repeat applications which contain information which was not available to the claimant during the course of the first application, and which is of a nature that is likely to have a real bearing on the assessment of the need for protection. Events in the country of origin of the claimant that have occurred since the first claim may also mean that a second consideration is warranted. The Government has therefore decided that the Minister will retain a discretion to allow particular repeat applications to be assessed by the full refugee determination process.Although the Ministers non-compellable discretion may only be exercised by the Minister personally, measures will be taken to ensure that all cases in which the Minister might wish to exercise his or her discretion are identified and brought to the Ministers attention. In such cases the Minister will present to Parliament the reasons for the exercise of his or her discretion.Both aspects of the bill introduced today demonstrate the Governments resolve to maintain a refugee determination system that is targeted towards those with a claim to Australias protection under our Refugee Convention obligations. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has estimated that there are some twenty million refugees in the world today. Australia has an obligation to help these people through the most effective means at our disposal. We meet this obligation through our overseas aid program, our assistance to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, our significant contribution to UN peacekeeping initiatives, our Humanitarian Program, which this year will bring 13,000 people in need of resettlement to Australia to begin a new life, and through our on-shore refugee determination system.When the need arises to defend these efforts and to maintain their credibility, public support and effectiveness, as in the present case, the Government will do so.I commend this bill to the chamber.Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until the first day in the winter sittings 1995, in accordance with the order agreed to 29 November 1994.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1995","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator KEMP","WW4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A","38","—by leave—I move:That the Senate take note of the document.I rise to comment on this very important, albeit very brief, report of the Auditor-General. There has been very widespread concern in the community about the capacity of this government to use taxpayer funds for partisan political purposes.This report indicates that the Auditor-General sought to carry out an efficiency audit of the National Media Liaison Service. The 1 1/2 pages of the report indicate that the government and the service blocked the efficiency audit. In other words, the Auditor-General was not allowed to assess the efficiency of the work that is carried out by the National Media Liaison Service—more commonly referred to as aNiMaLS. This is a very serious matter which has come before the chamber and which has been brought to our attention by the Auditor-General.The role and functions of the National Media Liaison Service were set out some years ago by Senator Bolkus. The first role was to provide accurate and timely information on government policies and programs to the media throughout Australia, as well as information on policies to interest groups within electorates.The second role was that representatives in each of the state capitals, Darwin and Townsville should cooperate with ministerial staff to coordinate media arrangements but not have any direct responsibility for arranging itineraries. The third role was that state representatives are to provide local members of all parties with details of government programs.The fourth role specified was that representatives will not work with local or state party branches and will not be involved in party programs, nor electoral campaigning. The fifth role was to coordinate the distribution of detailed information on government policies—and I stress that it is government policies—and programs from the information units of various departments to local media. The final role was to monitor local media to provide media summaries. Monitoring, however, was stated as being secondary in importance to media to achieve information dissemination.We know that, whatever the role specified there, the NMLS in fact carries out work that is very substantially different. It costs the taxpayer $1.5 million. The essential work of the National Media Liaison Service is not, I believe, to inform the public about the activities of the Labor government but to monitor and analyse the work of the opposition. It is no wonder that the Auditor-General was very savage in his report about the blocking of an efficiency audit. The last thing the government wanted was for the Auditor-General to look at the books and to look at the work that has been carried out in this unit.I give notice that I shall be calling before a Senate estimates committee on Friday the director of the National Media Liaison Service, Mr Epstein, so that he can explain to the Senate just what work he has been carrying out. We intend to pursue this with vigour. The government has set out the role of the National Media Liaison Service, but we know from what the press says and we know from the activities of NMLS that it is carrying out a very different role indeed.It is interesting that the West Australian of Tuesday 17 January 1995, after this report was tabled, ran an editorial headed: `Time to axe partisan media unit. I wonder if Mr Epstein, in his monitoring of the media, circulated that to the press gallery. I wonder if he circulated it to ministers of the government. Among other things, the editorial in the West Australian stated:If the Keating Government was serious about saving public money and enhancing the integrity of the political process at the same time it would move immediately to scrap the National Media Liaison Service.Abolition of the service—which is little more than a taxpayer-funded propaganda unit—would remove a blot that has perverted the nations political system for too long.And saving the $1.5 million it costs to run the service each year would be a small contribution to the big cuts that the Government needs to make in its spending. . .I put it to the Senate that there is continuing a serious misuse of public funding. We all remember the infamous sports rorts affair. We remember a number of multicultural grants being made before the 1990 election which were never announced to the wider community. We know the ability of this government to use funds it compulsorily raises from taxpayers for party political purposes. If the government wants to have a taxpayer funded unit, a taxpayer funded hit-squad, to attack the opposition, then let it come out and say that that is what it is doing and let us have a debate on that issue. But the government should not pretend that it is a government information unit.As I said, I give notice that we in the opposition will be pursuing this matter with vigour at the estimates committee to find out precisely what Mr Epstein and his mates in the unit have in fact been doing and what sorts of files they are collecting—not on government information but on people in the opposition: leaders and senior shadow ministers. I seek leave to incorporate in Han-sard a list of the employees of the National Media Liaison Service. This list was recently provided to me by the government.Leave granted.The list read as follows —(1) National Media Liaison ServiceNATIONAL MEDIA LIAISON SERVICE (a)N/AClassification Travel Code Occupant Home BaseMedia Adviser 3 VACANT -Media Adviser 1 Mr T Counihan CanberraMedia Adviser 3 VACANT CanberraAssistant Adviser 3 VACANT -Assistant Adviser 3 VACANT -Secretary 3 Ms O M Ivancic CanberraAdmin Assistant 3 Mr V S Pham CanberraMedia Adviser 1 Mr A Woodward SydneySecretary 3 Ms D OSullivan SydneyMedia Adviser 1 Mr I Mackay MelbourneSecretary 3 Miss J M Green MelbourneMedia Adviser 1 Mr M B Fishpool BrisbaneSecretary 3 Ms H Mittag BrisbaneMedia Adviser 1 Mr T Loftus AdelaideSecretary 3 Ms M A Holder AdelaideMedia Adviser 1 Ms C A Olney PerthSecretary 3 Ms M Perkins PerthMedia Adviser 1 Mr N E Andrews HobartSecretary 3 Ms T Reynolds HobartMedia Adviser 1 Mr R B Creswick DarwinSecretary 3 Ms C Phillips DarwinMedia Adviser 1 Mr C Campbell TownsvilleSecretary 3 Ms E P Cusack TownsvilleN/A","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2[1]/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator KEMP","WW4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A","38","—The National Media Liaison Service is not the only media arm of the government. It has also the Ministerial Media Group, which has some 12 to 15 employees. So there is a very extensive use of taxpayer funding to attempt to promote government activities, and much of the groups work seems to be mainly concerned to look at the activities of the opposition.It is clear that the government itself has been embarrassed and has hidden behind the Audit Act as it stood to prevent the efficiency audit by the Auditor-General. But in the coming weeks a new audit act will be brought before this parliament. The former Auditor-General, Mr Taylor, says that he understands that this act will not provide explicitly for the performance audit mandate of the Auditor-General to extend to activities such as those of the National Media Liaison Service, but he goes on to say—I suspect he must have been told by the government itself:I understand, however, that it is intended that this will be addressed by regulation only and therefore not be a central tenet in the provisions of the legislation. The accountability arrangements for all activities that involve the use of taxpayers funds should be enshrined as a central tenet of the provisions of any new Auditor-General Act.If, as the government has hinted, the new regulations will in the future allow an efficiency audit of the National Media Liaison Service, I am prepared to place a bet that the activities of that unit will be changed very rapidly. Files will be cleaned out and shredded to avoid any close examination of the work of this unit.The government will have to come up-front. If it wants to use taxpayers money, it will have to be explicit about what those funds are being used for. It will not be able to use the front of pretending to provide government information when in actual fact 23 people are employed as a political hit-squad. I hope those people understand the seriousness of this. I believe it is time this parliament took action to ensure that the accountability the Auditor-General mentioned in Report No. 17 is properly carried out.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2[1]/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator COULTER","TF4","(South Australia)","AD","N/A","41","—I rise to speak briefly on the Auditor-Generals report on the National Media Liaison Service. I point out in opening that in the budget last year, in which the government sought to further squeeze the Auditor-General, it was the Democrats who were able to press for a wider and more comprehensive brief for the Auditor-General and also to extract from the government an undertaking that the Auditor-Generals financial situation would be improved so that he could more adequately carry out his very important task. The Auditor-General is one of those individuals, one of those institutions, who actually stand between the executive government and corruption.With that as a background, I believe the parliament must take very careful note of this report from the Auditor-General. Here we have a report from a very important servant of the parliament. He is not a servant of the executive government. He is a servant of the parliament, therefore a servant of openness, and indirectly a servant of the Australian people in general.The Auditor-General, in his report, is informing the parliament that he is unable to undertake his duties because of barriers which, in this case, have been put up by executive government. The proposed efficiency audit of the National Media Liaison Service was to be part of a broader efficiency audit of government information and advertising. This audit was to address the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the governments massive information and advertising activities, and we share many of the concerns that Senator Kemp has just mentioned in relation to the activities of this body.The NMLS, or aNiMaLS as it is known in popular jargon, plays a vital role in the governments information machine. Many have long suspected that aNiMaLS is a purely political beast designed to publicise the case for re-electing the Labor government and to collect any dirt it can on the opposition through its extensive media monitoring. In using the term `opposition, we would include ourselves because we believe that the government would also be wanting to collect dirt on the Democrats, Independents and minor parties.ANiMaLS has constantly denied this allegation, arguing that its job is to publicise government activity rather than the government per se. An efficiency audit would have been a very effective way of proving the case one way or the other, but there is the hole to which the Auditor-General refers. ANiMaLS, while paid out of government money, is not technically part of any government department. Therefore, the Auditor-General cannot conduct an efficiency audit of the service without the approval of the minister—in this case the Minister for Administrative Services, Frank Walker.The ministers response delivered to the Australian National Audit Office in November was that the proposed review was ultra vires. He has refused to allow the auditor of public money to attest whether public money is being used efficiently and effectively. This is frankly scandalous. It highlights the urgent need to pass and to strengthen the Auditor-General bill coming before this place next week. It highlights the need for the mandate of the Auditor-General to be able to access any government body whatsoever in any of the bizarre forms that this government has created and to examine what has been done with the money.I wish to foreshadow that the Democrats will be seeking to amend the Auditor-General bill next week to confirm the widest possible mandate for the Auditor-General. This is in line with the steps that we took last year to widen the Auditor-Generals brief and also to guarantee that he had more adequate facilities to carry out his task.The minister should not be let off the hook. The government or the Department of Finance has already agreed that organisations like aNiMaLS should be subject to efficiency audits and is drafting a regulation under the new bill to achieve this. Ignoring the question of where it should be, in regulation or in the bill proper, the fact is that after the bill comes into effect, most likely on 1 July, an efficiency audit will be possible. So the question still stands: why is the minister now denying the Auditor-General access to NMLS? What has aNiMaLS got to hide between now and 1 July?Suggestions that were hinted at earlier, that there will be a massive shredding of documents before that occurs, may well indicate what the minister does have to hide. I call on the Minister for Administrative Services or his senior minister, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), to immediately authorise an efficiency audit of aNiMaLS and/or any other information or advertising agency of government not within his department but within his portfolio.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator ELLISON","9X5","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A","42","—Like the two former speakers, I join in calling upon the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) to conduct an immediate inquiry into the National Media Liaison Service, commonly known as aNiMaLS. I refer to the Auditor-Generals report No. 17 in which he states:NMLS—the body in question—is therefore not subject to the normal accountability mechanisms in place over Government programs. As a consequence, although NMLS is fully funded by the taxpayer and its stated roles and functions are predominantly administrative in nature, its operations are not subject to the scrutiny normally associated with the expenditure of public monies.What we have here is a grave breach of accountability of government expenditure and the operation of bodies that act at the governments direction. We also have another grave issue and that is the fact that the government is using taxpayers money to conduct operations which are of an electoral nature. In fact, an editorial in the West Australian dated 17 January this year stated:By sending to media groups transcripts of statements by Opposition MPs highlighting any blunders, policy or personal conflicts or other material damaging to the coalition, it has played a blatantly partisan role.That was stated in the editorial of the West Australian earlier this month. So even sections of the press can recognise what a partisan political role this body plays at the expense of the taxpayer. In fact, on 17 January this year there was a report on this body in the West Australian which followed a previous report in that paper which had stated that aNiMaLS had assembled old video clips and a dossier damaging to John Howard in anticipation of his replacing Alexander Downer as Liberal leader.There have been complaints before by previous Liberal leaders as to the partisan role that this body plays. The press has picked this up and has recognised that this indeed is a most serious situation. The government is pushing a propaganda line, a line which is anti-opposition or anti any opposition to it, using taxpayers money in the process. This body scrutinises anyone who dares voice opposition to the government and sets to work exposing any conflicts or problems that opposition might have and then sends it off to the media. That is really what this body is all about.It is outrageous that there cannot be any scrutiny by the Auditor-General of this body and its practices. It is not surprising that when the Auditor-General set out to scrutinise this body he was stopped. That any body such as this should not be subject to scrutiny by the Auditor-General is frankly outrageous. I join with previous speakers in demanding that in the interests of democracy and in the interests of accountable government there be an immediate inquiry into this matter. I ask fellow Australians to wake up and look at what the government of the day is doing. It is using taxpayers money to pursue its own political ends via this nefarious body.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2[1]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That organisation employs 23 staff. What is their role and what do they do? Senator Kemp has already alluded to what they do. Senator Ellison has highlighted an example that was referred to in the West Australian and, to the best of my knowledge, in the fortnight since that article appeared the National Media Liaison Service has not attempted to deny the allegation made. Of course, we know why it was not denied—because undoubtedly it is true. ANiMaLS trades in political sleaze in an attempt to damage the opposition.The audit office sought to inquire into the National Media Liaison Service. The scope of the proposed audit was to assess the economy, efficiency and administrative effectiveness of government information and advertising activities. What on the face of that could be more innocuous, except if you have something to hide and behind the facade of this agency a more sinister agenda is being pursued? Of course that is why the audit was refused.In October of last year the Audit Office sought to have an interview with the National Media Liaison Office. This was declined several times; in fact, it declined to enter into any—and I underline the word `any—discussions whatsoever. One can only speculate as to why that would be the case. Undoubtedly, it was because it was concerned as to what would be revealed.The Audit Office then, quite properly, wrote to the minister seeking his assistance in resolving the impasse. But what happened? The minister replied on 5 December saying that the `review you propose is ultra vires the Audit Act, and referred to a legal opinion—undoubtedly, once again obtained at taxpayers expense to create a legal technicality behind which the government could hide and avoid an audit of the National Media Liaison Service. Of course, technically it was ultra vires. However, the new Audit Act will overcome that problem and, once it has come into force, hopefully we will get to see what this outrageous organisation has been engaging in.One can ask why the minister has simply delayed the inevitable. Undoubtedly, the National Media Liaison Service will get the shredders working overtime to ensure that nothing is left behind which could indicate the type of work it was doing. But of course it begs the question: why didnt the minister say, `Look, technically youre not entitled to audit aNiMaLS. But I, as the responsible minister, am more than happy to have this part of my administration audited by you to confirm that it is a genuine body, to confirm to the people of Australia that the likes of Senator Kemp have been pedalling untruths about the National Media Liaison Service. This would have been a classic opportunity for the minister to embrace an audit to show that Senator Kemp has been absolutely wrong.But the government has not embraced that opportunity. It has run from that opportunity with its tail between its legs. It does not want an audit because the allegations being made by Senator Kemp and others are undoubtedly true and correct. Of course, as the auditor says, the National Media Liaison Service—in other words, $1.5 million of taxpayers funds—cannot be subjected to efficiency audits under the Audit Act.Very interestingly, today I read the Salvation Armys budget submission. I saw how the funding for the Salvation Army in certain areas had, in fact, declined over the past few years. That $1.5 million could have been much better used by the Salvation Army to keep its funding up to level rather than to fund this political propaganda machine.The situation is, as stated in the audit report:The Parliament, through both the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts and the Standing Committee on Finance and Administration, has expressed the view that all—and I stress `all—Commonwealth undertakings, of whatever legal form, should be audited by the Commonwealth Auditor-General.I have read those words from the bipartisan report of those committees. Those committees are of the view that everything ought be audited.

Clearly, government senators are very concerned about this, and the commencement of interjections from the other side clearly indicates they are very nervous. So they ought be. Whilst they might have been able to stymie the Auditor-General, I would not think them able to stymie the Senate estimates committee process. The Senate estimates committee has the power to call before it certain individuals and, in fact, ask them how they spend the day and who tells them what to do—who told them to develop this video of John Howard clips from the past; who gave them that direction; and how is that of assistance to the people of Australia?We know that it may be of some assistance in the Labor Partys desperate attempt to hold on to office. But we know that, with the leadership change and the way the Liberal Party is performing now, we will see a change in government. No matter what attempts the Labor Party makes through this sleazy National Media Liaison Service, which it will not subject to audit, we will still win, we will still beat it. The reason for that is that the people of Australia are starting to see through the way this government acts. As former Senator Richardson said, the Labor Party will do whatever it takes; no matter how immoral, no matter how amoral, it will do whatever it takes. When it comes to a question of public accountability of $1.5 million, it will hide behind a legal technicality to protect its propaganda machine. But the people of Australia are now aware of the sorts of campaigns being undertaken by the Labor Party, and that is why they will reject it at the next poll.This Auditor-Generals report is, quite frankly, a very sad reflection on the way this government operates. Whilst there is a legal technicality, which I trust will be overcome by the new Audit Act, I would have thought the government could have shown good faith by saying to the Auditor-General and the people of Australia, `Look, there is a legal technicality, but we dont mind that legal technicality; we will not rely on it. We invite you to audit the National Media Liaison Service and see what it really gets up to. But the government did not want that, and the reason for that is very clear.This report is a very sad reflection on this governments commitment to public accountability, its commitment to integrity. In fact, the governments reaction—as demonstrated by the Labor Party interjections during this debate—clearly confirms the very worst fears of many Australians; that is, that the National Media Liaison Service is not a dinky-di organisation but simply a front for the Australian Labor Party to pedal its propaganda.I look forward to Senator Kemps investigations at the Senate estimates committees and to hearing some of the alleged media advisers within that organisation explain how they really do fill in their day, what their tasks are and how they benefit the people of Australia. This report really deserves much greater prominence because it highlights the politically corrupt way the government goes about its business.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2[1]/speech[4]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

We have to recognise that it is not just a loophole in the law that has enabled this spying, cheating organisation financed by the taxpayer but directed by this government to escape the scrutiny that all bodies spending taxpayers money should be subjected to. Everyone accepts that proposition, which is stated in the amending Audit Bill which has not yet passed this chamber.This is a matter of principle that the government accepts should be enshrined in law and yet, because there is a loophole in law at the present time, this organisation, which is a disgrace and which has demonstrated itself to be a propaganda arm of the Labor Party, not of the government, is spending an inordinate amount of its time eavesdropping on opposition statements and operating in a political way. For example, as we have heard it has drummed up a video of Mr Howards past statements. This organisation is being protected from proper scrutiny, as I said not by a loophole in the law but by a decision of a minister of this government, Frank Walker.Mr Frank Walker has the power to allow the Auditor-General, as it does with every other body, to conduct a proper investigation of the National Media Liaison Service. He has refused that permission. He has decided to block the Auditor-General from investigating the expenditure of $1 1/2 million by a dishonest, crooked organisation that was appointed by a dishonest, crooked government for dishonest, crooked purposes.Why would the minister make that personal ministerial decision? Is it because the minister does not support the principle that this government is now pursuing that all expenditure should be subject to audit? Does this minister have something to hide, or does it fit into the pattern of deception by this minister in his dealings with this parliament of which so many of us are well aware. I am certainly aware of this because of his disgraceful responses to my requests to have my electorate office in Wollongong moved after the lease expired to an area near my principal place of residence.This minister will do or say anything in pursuit of political power. When he exercises his discretion, he invariably comes down on the side of self-interest rather than in the interests of this nation. Here we have yet another example. Perhaps he is following the `honourable tradition of the previous ministers who have been in charge of this disgraceful body. We had Mr J.J. Brown, a former member of the House of Representatives, who `resigned. We have had a self-confessed professional liar called Richardson.We have had some people in that role whose activities are beyond reproach, but they are the exceptions. The minister at the table, the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan), is one such minister. I do not think anyone here would direct the sorts of remarks I am directing to the other occupants of that office to him.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[1]/debate.sub2[1]/speech[5]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A","45","—But I would not be so generous in respect of Madam Whiteboard, who had her claws in this matter for a while. There was Senator Bolkus, and the less said about him in this context the better. We have a tradition of ministers, obviously appointed by a government, whose main objective is to misuse taxpayers money through this organisation in a disgraceful way. The government has picked people to run or to have administrative control over the organisation who, in general, it feels will operate in a blatant and dishonest political way.That is what this debate is all about today. This government has chosen to misuse taxpayers money in this way. It has chosen to misuse the ministers discretion in this way so that the minister can block a proper inquiry of the expenditure of this money. There is a deliberate pattern of deception and deceit, but we expect that from this government.We have to recognise that an efficiency audit is not just an audit to determine whether this organisation is being efficient. It is an examination of whether it is properly spending taxpayers money and whether the pattern of its expenditures relates to its objectives and its directions on how it should be spending its money and what it should be doing. We have already heard about the role of the National Media Liaison Service. There is hardly any evidence that justifies this organisation spending its time spying on the opposition or creating videos of past speeches of the new opposition leader.Naturally, an efficiency audit would determine whether this body is spending money in the manner which is appropriate to its creation. The fact clearly emerges, as a result of the refusal by this minister to allow this inquiry, that money is being improperly spent. Part of the $1 1/2 million—we do not know how much—being spent by the National Media Liaison Service is being improperly spent.This raises another interesting question. It was the Attorney-Generals Department that told the minister that, in its opinion, the Audit Act did not in fact cover efficiency audits of this body. It seems unfortunate that all the Audit Office had to rely on was advice from the Attorney-Generals Department. There was a clear conflict of interest within the Attorney-Generals Department. I do not know what sort of glass walls they have there. If the Auditor-General had the right to seek independent legal advice, I wonder whether it would have been the same as the advice that the Attorney-Generals office gave to the minister. After all, I suppose you can say that it is the minister and the ministry that employ the Attorney-General, not the Auditor-General.If the advice did have any partisan elements, to what extent would the best interests of the client, the Auditor-General, be served by the Attorney-Generals Department, bearing in mind its relationship with the minister, rather than with the Auditor-General? Whatever the merits of the advice, we have a simple situation where the government has deliberately blocked the proper inquiry that is appropriate and relevant and accepted for every other government body.I raise in passing an interesting question. According to the answer to a question asked by Senator Calvert last year, it was said that the cost of the National Media Liaison Service in New South Wales was $140,558, of which 84 per cent was involved in wages and salaries.Animals is located in the central business district of Sydney in fairly substantial office space. It would surprise me, in view of the likely cost of that office space, that 84 per cent of the $140,000 spent in New South Wales related only to wages and salaries. I wonder what would be the costs of equipment, maintenance and so on. I wonder what the hidden costs are of aNiMaLS that are not revealed in this document.

It seems to me to be of some substance and significance that one of his last acts was to point out the impropriety of the government, the disgraceful behaviour of the minister and the mismanagement of taxpayers money by the National Media Liaison Service.

I wish to speak briefly about an ILO convention which has been tabled, not in the Senate today but since the last day of sitting. This is the ILO convention No. 174 and recommendation No. 181 entitled Prevention of major industrial accidents .Mr Acting Deputy President, as you will be aware, I have been very concerned about the lack of involvement of the parliament of this nation in the consideration of the treaty-making activities of this government. There have been many cases where multilateral conventions, UN treaties and conventions, have been signed, as well as ILO conventions which have been done, without any proper consideration by the parliament or without any public debate.Often some years down the track we find that under international law Australia is bound to act in a certain manner. Of course, the most dramatic example of that was really the discovery by many Australians that, for the first time since 1986, Australian domestic disputes could be adjudicated offshore by UN human rights committees. I have expressed my concern a number of times in this parliament that such an important decision was taken by the executive without any significant public debate or any wider consideration of the long-term ramifications of such an action.Equally, in relation to the ILO, this is a tripartite body—a body which I think over a long period of time has generally enjoyed the support of unions, industry and governments. Regrettably, I think, because of the actions of the Keating government and the industrial relations ministers and the secret treaty making of the government, that tripartite and bipartisan approach to the ILO has come under very severe pressure.Just before the last election, the Keating government ratified ILO convention No. 158, concerning the retrenchment of employees, without making a press release. We discovered after the election that Mr Keating and his colleagues had ratified this convention hours before the writs were issued. This convention, along with a number of others, provided a head of power for the so-called Industrial Relations Reform Act, which in itself has now been challenged before the ILO. But the point of me drawing this to the attention of the Senate today is that I have not had time to closely examine the convention, which has been put before us today, and whether there are ramifications of this which would require more careful consideration.I note that it has gone to state officials and that the ACTU is supportive of the convention but, interestingly, Mr Brereton tells us that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is supportive of the development of a national standard `described below. It is not clear from what Mr Brereton tells us in this document whether the ACCI is supportive of the ratification of the convention. If it is not, it would have been handy for Mr Brereton to actually inform the Senate why it is not supportive. I put that question. It is one to which I would be interested to receive an answer.I was intrigued to read in the background statement tabled by Mr Brereton that `in accordance with article 19 of the ILO constitution the Australian government is required to submit the text of new conventions and recommendations to the competent authority—that is, the Australian parliament—following their adoption by the International Labour Conference. I would be intrigued to know whether that practice was followed with ILO Convention No. 158? If that practice was not followed, what flowed from that? I will be seeking further advice on this matter.It is important that this parliament consider very carefully international treaties and conventions which the executive government goes off and signs. A number of UN multilateral conventions have had quite profound effects upon the legal system of this country. Although I welcome the fact that the text has been signed and that the minister has given us a covering statement, I think the ratification of this convention raises important questions for this parliament, such as: what is the position of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry?","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[3]/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

I wish to make some observations about international conventions and what I term their misuse by this Australian government in particular in setting domestic law. I draw the attention of the Senate to Senator McMullans questioning of our right—if I can put it that way—to address that issue at this time and question what the procedure should be. The third paragraph of the background statement of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) reads:In accordance with Article 19 of the ILO Constitution, the Australian Government is required to submit the texts of new Conventions and Recommendations to the competent authority, that is, the Australian Parliament, following their adoption by the International Labour Conference.One complaint I hear constantly is that these conventions are not dealt with by the parliament in a proper manner. We get these conventions delivered to us. They have already been agreed to, and that is it. Even when they are tabled here, our right to examine them and question them is challenged. It provides some insight into the arrogant attitude of this government when it comes to these types of conventions.I can well and truly understand having international treaties and international conventions between two nations for defence reasons, trade reasons or a whole variety of reasons. But I can never understand why they have to be used to establish domestic law and, in particular, to override the constitutional rights and authority of the states.Many of the conventions of this country have been overridden and overruled by legislation carried through this place in recent years. I find that absolutely and totally untenable. It is unsatisfactory. In fact, it is wrong. Sooner or later this whole situation has to be resolved. I am damned if I can live with a situation where people in Geneva or elsewhere determine what happens in the parliament of this country. That is what has been happening. I must mention that it was just over 12 months that we dealt with the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, which relied very heavily on conventions.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[3]/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

It does not worry me whether or not Senator McMullan calls me a liar. A colleague of mine said to me, `If you get this over in about seven minutes, youll get away with it. The fact is that this government has consistently misused international conventions to override the rights of the states and this place in a manner which is not in the best interests of Australia. It suits the lawyers of the country. It keeps the High Court of this country occupied. Until we get a process where these conventions are properly examined and dealt with in the best interests of Australia, we will continue to see legislation being passed on the basis of conventions being challenged in the High Court. That is fact; it is not myth. It is happening right here and now in this place.I do not object to some of the material in the conventions. I object to the fact that they are not brought into this place and debatedproperly so that a decision can be made by the Australian parliament as to what we should be agreeing to internationally. It is a total abuse of the sovereignty of this country. I will conclude my comments at this point. I will continue to pursue this issue of having a proper process for as long as I can. No convention should be agreed to unless it has the approval of both the houses of parliament of this nation.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[3]/speech[2]/talk.start[5]/para","N/A","N/A"

The research also found that women in this group are less concerned about cancer and have a lower level of knowledge about cancer than women from English speaking backgrounds. They are more likely to attend if they can be screened via their community groups so women can support one another during the process.

While the reforms result in both gains and losses to this sector, from an economy-wide perspective the losses quantified above constitute a transfer from one sector of the economy to the other, not a loss to the economy as a whole.

In the case of water stored for environmental purposes one approach could be to treat such costs as part of the production costs of total water supply of that particular system and spread the costs across all relevant water consumers. Similarly, in the case of water stored and subsequently released simply to maintain flows for recreational and/or tourist activities a charge against the community as a whole might be appropriate. It is suggested that ARMCANZ, with the assistance of the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, work towards determining, for inclusion in the first annual report to COAG, the charging principles to cover the financial implications of environmental allocations and recreational uses of water bodies and courses.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[1]/proctext/para[1493]","N/A","N/A"

For the Murray-Darling Basin jurisdictions, where it is essential that consistent entitlement systems be put in place to facilitate cross-Basin trading, the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, in conjunction with ARMCANZ, should settle the form of the arrangements by the end of 1994.

For example, overallocation of water could be addressed by determining the environmental needs of the (river, groundwater) system involved and then allocating the residual water on a pro-rata basis, having regard to previous entitlements and usage. Having done this, entitlements might then be traded. In the event that there are cross-border implications, as in the case of the Murray-Darling Basin, jurisdictions should, however, co-operate in finding solutions.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator WEST","1X4","(New South Wales)","ALP","N/A","139","—by leave—I move:That the Senate take note of the document.I wish to speak to the government response to a report that the Standing Committee on Community Affairs presented earlier last year. This was a unanimous report by the committee, which worked very hard and held many consultations around the country. The issue is of vital importance. It affects many women, most particularly those over the age of 50. That the committee was able to come up with a unanimous report speaks very highly of the work of the committee and the hard work of the secretariat. We today have the government response to its report.The committee made 27 recommendations in the original report. Of them, the government either accepted or supported 24. For a committee, that is not a bad rate at which to score support. It is an issue that traverses a number of things that are also the responsibility of the states. That would have made it more difficult in responding to the report. I understand from quickly reading part of the response that our report was sent to a number of the states for them to also comment. Some of their replies have been fed back into this response, which is very important.I will highlight a couple of areas that I notice are outside the resolve of the Commonwealth to deal with. But there is a response, and things are being taken to the Australian Health Ministers Conference. One in particular is improving the level of travel and accommodation assistance available to women living in areas outside the major metropolitan areas who require radiotherapy treatment. Whilst this is primarily a matter for the states, concerns about the recommendation will be referred to the Australian Health Ministers Conference. That is a very important move and the way to go. As I said, our report traversed a number of areas that are also the concern of the states. The fact that they are going to be brought to the attention of the states is very important.Another vitally important issue that we dealt with is the collection of statistics by the cancer registries of the states and territories. We recommended that the statistics collected by state and territory cancer registries be collected on a more uniform and consistent basis and that the data on cancers generally be provided to the Commonwealth government on a timely and regular basis to ensure that current national statistics on the incidence of cancers are readily available.The government supported the recommendation in principle. However, it is powerless to do very much about it because it is dependent upon what happens at the state level. The uniformity of data collection is being addressed by the National Cancer Statistics Clearing House at the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in conjunction with the state and territory cancer registries. I commend those organisations involved in doing that.At present, the core set of data and the standards imposed on this data are robust and directly comparable. That is also very important because we want to be able to compare the incidence, mortality and morbidity figures of breast cancer not only within Australia but internationally to know whether some of the treatment mechanisms that we are using are working.The response goes on to state that the timely reporting of national cancer incidence data is dependent on the supply of data from the state and territory cancer registries. While some cancer registries are able to provide data 18 months after the completion of the calendar year, others are not able to supply data for up to four years after the completion of the calendar year. It gives several reasons for this: the nature of cancer reporting, such as the compilation of multiple reporting sources; the lack of resources; the volume of the case load; historical impediments; and legislative inadequacies.The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and state and territory cancer registries are attempting to improve the timeliness of national incidence reporting. We noticed when we started our inquiry that the reporting of incidence by a number of cancer registries was very out of date; some registries were more than four years out of date. Our inquiry served as a fillip to some of the states to get their registries up to date and to report on a more timely basis. To me, that is an extremely important issue and one that I hope the states will continue to address.The importance of the treatment regimes and being able to evaluate screening programs is dependent upon getting good, accurate and timely data through. If that is not going to happen in all the states in this country, we are going to find that we do not know where there is a timelag—that is quite significant if it is four years—in being able to evaluate and implement alterations and changes that need to be brought into play. I very much urge the states to take on board the need for this and to do something about improving the timeliness of their reporting.At the back of the response, an attachment outlines the national program for the early detention of breast cancer and its communication strategy. We found a lack of education and knowledge in the community. For example, women under 50 are not encouraged to come. Women under 40 are certainly not included in the program because it is a mammographic screening program, not a diagnostic program. The difference between screening and diagnostic mammography is not well understood in the general community. I am pleased to see that there is a national program.There is also a list of the terms of reference for the National Breast Cancer Centre, which was announced just as we were finishing our report. We obviously made a recommendation for it to fulfil a role which is outside what its role was going to be. We did that because we were not sure in our own minds. There is also a listing under the heading `Policy and practice in relation to symptomatic women in the program. We thought about that issue very deeply, because it involves what is done if people with signs and symptoms who turn up to a clinic are loathe to go elsewhere. It also involves how they are incorporated into the mainstream system so that they do not go away, decide that they have made one attempt to have their problem dealt with and, because they did not get the response they hoped to get, do not bother again. That is also dealt with in this report.I know that our sister committee in the other place is now compiling a report on the treatment of breast cancer. I await its report with a great deal of interest. I thank everybody who was involved in this report for their contribution. We have made a valuable contribution to this issue. That is borne out by the fact that the government has endorsed just about every one of our recommendations.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[3]/debate.sub2/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator HERRON","VW4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A","141","—I commend Senator West on this report from the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, of which I am a member. She was the chairman of that committee at the time. I also commend the government response. There must be few occasions when a government response is published with the endorsement of the opposition and the unanimous endorsement of the Senate committee concerned.I want to refer to two aspects that are subsequent to the publication of the report and the government response. There are dangers in the program in so far as the recent publications on this issue show that 70 per cent of the target numbers have to respond to screening for it to be shown to be successful. That figure is not being achieved.The second aspect of it is that we have discovered since the initiation of this inquiry that women are not going back for re-screening after two years. If that does not occur, the program will fall down in terms of the early detection of breast cancer. There is a tendency for women to have a mammogram and say, `I have had my mammogram. I do not have breast cancer—even knowing that one in 10 will not show up anyway. Having said that, time elapses, they forget and they do not go back for re-screening.Two major issues must be addressed: firstly, women in the target group must come forward to have a mammogram; and, secondly, they must be re-screened. If 70 per cent of the target group do not come forward and then they all do not come back for re-screening, it will be a waste of money in terms of being able to prove that it has had an effect on the Australian community. With those two caveats, I am very happy to recommend the acceptance of the government response to the report of the Senate standing committee.I still have one issue to raise with the government and that is in relation to the funding of biopsy, which is a removal of the suspect area to prove whether it is a cancer or not. Our recommendation was that biopsy should not be included. Admittedly, it is a state problem, but, speaking as a surgeon, it is essential in the management of the woman who has breast cancer, particularly from the surgical aspect, that the treatment should continue after the biopsy and that it should not be part of the screening program. If it is part of the screening program, the woman is handed over to the surgeon, having had surgery of some kind or another. This often distorts the picture and does not give the surgeon the full knowledge that he or she needs to have in managing that particular patient. It is a somewhat minor thing from the reports point of view but major to the individual patient concerned.As a result of our report and the governments response the National Breast Cancer Centre was established. I am very happy to report that the centre has produced its first publication which is to go to every general practitioner and surgeon in Australia to bring them up to date with the current management and detection of breast cancer. I particularly want to commend Emeritus Professor Tom Reeve, who was appointed head of that National Breast Cancer Centre, for the speed with which he has initiated the program and the quality and accuracy of the document that has been produced.If we cast our minds back, we will see that in the last two years breast cancer has become a major issue within the Australian publics consciousness, not only from womens point of view but from the whole of the publics point of view. The NHMRC has been directed to pay particular attention to this and separate funds have been issued to be spent on the early detection of breast cancer.When I look back on my time in the Senate, I can speak with pride about the fact that I initiated this within the Senate itself and it had the concurrence of the Democrats, my coalition partners and the Labor Party. This is a unanimous report, as Senator West has mentioned. Speaking as a professional in this field, I was aware of the fact that something needed to be done to raise this topic within the community.It is an ongoing topic. The incidence of the disease is increasing. It will get worse as time goes on because of the ageing of the population. This is something that we will have to come back to at a future date. I am quite delighted about the raising of consciousness within the community and the fact that we have been able to put the pressure on the states to do something about it. The Victorian government has allowed its electoral roll to be used. This had not happened previously.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator COULTER","TF4","(South Australia)","AD","N/A","142","—by leave—I move:That the Senate take note of the document.The main point that I want to stress very briefly this afternoon is the slowness of the governments response with respect to what is really a very important issue. We have seen extensively around Australia outbreaks of blue-green algae. Several years ago we saw 1,000 kilometres of the Darling River infected with blue-green algae and the impossibility for quite some time for people along the river to use that water because of its toxic nature.We have had repeatedly in South Australia outbreaks of algae in the lower part of the Murray, specifically in the area of Lake Alexandrina and Lake Albert, and this has made it impossible for people in the townships of Clayton, Strathalbyn and places like that to again use water for irrigation, stock purposes or, indeed, for human consumption. In the last fortnight I have heard that the people in Strathalbyn have had to switch to alternative water supply. It is a serious problem and one which is increasing in severity and in its spread. It seems to me from reading this government response that it is a totally inadequate response to a very important problem.In a sense, the blue-green algae outbreaks are really only an indicator of a much more serious underlying problem with our water supplies—namely, that the quality of the water with respect to such things as tepidity, temperature, flow, nutrient content is deteriorating. What happens at the end of that long chain is that sometimes one has an outbreak of algae and that, in a sense, is an indicator of this deteriorating quality. For those reasons, I think it requires a much more vigorous and timely response than is indicated by this report.The report itself was published, as the document indicates, in December 1993. The government response refers back to the December 1992 statement on the environment by the then Prime Minister in which he gave a Commonwealth commitment to assist in the improvement of water quality. That was in December 1992; it is now almost February 1995.One finds that throughout this report the government is taking note of the recommendations of the committee, that it is supporting the recommendations, but in fact very little is actually happening. This is against the deteriorating quality of water. Adelaide, for instance—fortunately, although I live in Adelaide, I do not have to drink Adelaides water; I live in the Adelaide hills and have my own water supply—is seriously in danger of losing its water supply. If there is a combination of very low winter rainfall, similar to what we had in the last year, and high summer temperatures, an outbreak of blue-green algae would make it impossible for Adelaide to pump water from the Murray. In dry years the Adelaide city is sometimes dependent up to almost 90 per cent on Murray water being pumped into the essentially empty catchments of the Adelaide hills and then reticulated down to people in Adelaide itself.I think that in itself is an extremely serious problem which has not received the sort of response that it should have from government. For instance, on page 3 the governments response states that there is:growing community concern about the gradual deterioration in the quality of the nations water bodies.That is an admission by government that there is a gradual deterioration, despite the fact that it gave an undertaking in December 1992 to do something about it. It further states:The Strategy will set an overall strategic direction for water quality management and is based on the principles . . .It is still future tense. The government is still about to do something. The government has not actually done anything despite the fact that it has been aware of this situation for quite a considerable period.When one turns to the governments response to the specific recommendations of the report one finds that in relation to the country towns water supply improvement program the government has put up $16 million over a period of four years—that is, $4 million per year for the water supply of country towns throughout the whole of Australia. The government response goes on to point out:In 1993-94 as a result of the Statement the Commonwealth provided assistance of $4.5 million to 41 wastewater projects in small centres . . .This is of the order of $100,000 each. It is a totally inadequate amount of finance to undertake the very important work which is necessary. Again turning to the Murray-Darling system, we know that many of the small towns along that very important waterway have inadequate waste water treatment, have inadequate sewage treatment and have inadequate treatment of nutrient run-off from farms. That is what is leading to the nutrient build-up in the Murray-Darling system and ultimately to the toxic blue-green algae.I mention one other issue that I think should have been attacked far more vigorously by government: the issue of phosphorus in detergents—in household detergents, washing detergents and a range of commercially-used detergent products. The committee has made recommendations in relation to these detergents. The report states:The Committee recommends that existing and proposed campaigns to achieve lower phosphate levels in detergents through marketing strategies be continued.It further states:. . . if a significant reduction in levels of phosphorus in detergents has not been achieved within two years—we are already halfway through that period—then legislation be enacted to reduce levels or to ban phosphates in detergents.These are quite reasonable recommendations which came from the committee. But we find again that the government is leaning over backwards to be kind to the detergent industry. I will read one sentence which I found quite horrifying when I read it. It states:It should be noted that reducing or eliminating phosphorus in detergents may not be enough to have a significant impact on reducing algal blooms while there are other sources of phosphorus reaching waterways and while there is already a store of phosphorus in streams and sediments.In other words, the government is saying that, because two or three sources of phosphorus are getting into our streams, we will not tackle this very important source—namely, detergents, which could be tackled very quickly and very easily. Surely, any reduction in the levels of phosphorus is important, particularly in a country like Australia where many of the soils are very low in phosphorus and where, under those conditions, phosphorus is the critical nutrient not only in soil with respect to weed growth but also in our waterways.The government response goes on to talk about the most acceptable mechanism from an industry perspective being the use of economic instruments. In other words, there is an ideological commitment to protecting the needs of industry rather than protecting the needs of the environment.I simply stress that water is one of the most critical resources in this country. We have an extremely dry continent. We have a continent in which water is the limiting resource for much of our activity. We have a problem with deteriorating water quality. It is urgent for government to take the longer term view. I mentioned this earlier in connection with woodchips and the need for governments over the last three or four decades to have gone into plantation forestry.Here we have another example of the need for longer term strategies. Unless government does not take note now of the importance of water, unless government does not act to remove phosphorus from detergents—remember that not too many years ago we did not have detergents; we used soap, and we got by quite well without phosphorus in detergents, so we can do it—and unless government is prepared to act and act vigorously, the problems which we are creating for future generations with respect to the quality of water will be very severe indeed.Those impacts will be just as serious in the economic area as they will be in the social, human and environmental area. It is very short-sighted of government to be looking at the present industries and not looking at the needs of industry in the long term and the economic impacts which environmental deterioration will have on this country if government does not have a more adequate response to this issue than is indicated by this totally inadequate response to this committee report we have before us this afternoon.Debate (on motion by Senator Panizza ) adjourned.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[5]/debate.sub2/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We are all aware that the government did well to have it ready for the final week of the Senate sitting last December, but there was a great congestion of business. I do not want to make any cheap points about it being put down on the first working day after the Senate rose. Rather, I wish to commend the spirit in which this whole inquiry was undertaken: with the utmost seriousness to seek a comprehensive inquiry by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee of the Senate and to gain the most positive response from the government towards our findings to see all the measures in place that would most seek to eliminate sexual harassment in the navy, army and air force—from the defence forces of Australia.The governments response is very much in that spirit. There is a real sincerity and substance in the way in which the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Punch, advised by the Defence Force senior officers and indeed by the three services—the navy, army and air force—has responded to what I believe is one of the best Senate reports.Senator Jones, who is in the chamber and is the chairman of the committee, Senator Ellison, who also participated on that inquiry, and I, along with three other senators, have been commended by the government for the useful work that has been completed. We are impatient only to see in practice the actual implementation of the findings of the report in which we have placed a great deal of confidence.The background set out by the minister in the response is accurate. So is the context in which there is unanimity on the committees part and the governments part that we firmly endorse the principle of equal opportunity for women in the Australian Defence Force. The government accepts fully the Senate committees recommendation in the report that there needs to be enhanced education of gender related issues in the three services.A summary of the Senate report and a structure for the governments response is given. This usefully says that, although we had 42 recommendations, many of them were quite long and in several parts, and the government is responding not only to the 42 recommendations but to the 66 separate components of the Senate committees report. Fifty-three of the 66 are fully supported. We welcome that. My remarks will concentrate for a few minutes on those others which the minister has listed. Four were supported in principle; five were supported in part; only two of the 66 are not supported; and a further two are still under examination.There is a degree of misunderstanding in the governments perception of what our report said about the 13 recommendations that are not fully supported. No doubt that is partly the fault of our not writing it more clearly and partly because of some errors of communication. This misunderstanding particularly relates to recommendations 1 and 2 that concern the Sex Discrimination Act. We are all aware that the only person in Australia who took any exception at all to this report was the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. I thought that whilst she was no doubt trying to responsibly carry out the duties of her office, her remarks were rather emotional and overly verbose.With regard to the heart of the Sex Discrimination Act, which the commissioner rightly must ensure is implemented, she is in some way being put at significant risk by our call in recommendations 1 and 2 that there be amendments to three matters in that act: the hierarchy of complaints of sexual harassment; the advantage, wherever it is possible, to the complainant in informing the alleged harasser that his or her behaviour was offensive; and the provision of appropriate mechanisms, differentiated mechanisms, for dealing with the different degrees of seriousness of unlawful behaviour. We have in mind in particular that this will impact upon the army, the air force and the navy, because every member of the defence services is subject—as are all Australians—to the Sex Discrimination Act.I stand by not only recommendations 1 and 2 but by all of the recommendations of this report. I refer the government again to pages 30 and 31 of our report. On page 30 of that report, we said:The junior female officers on the SWAN told the Committee, for example, that the reaction of many of the crew after the unfavourable publicity it received in September 1993, was to withdraw from the normal interaction that had been developing, as the men came to accept the womens professionalism during the course of the deployment. A mixture of resentment and uncertainty among the male personnel over where the line on unacceptable behaviour was to be drawn had the effect of isolating the women.We were referring to an unfortunate development which we were trying to remedy. Also, in the next paragraph we referred to the vagaries of the Sex Discrimination Act, which defines a `reasonable person and which also has subjective elements with regard to the person feeling harassed. We have every sympathy for the law as it is now written.Let me put it this way: the second best situation is the Sex Discrimination Act as it is now written, but we are seeking, with regard to the practicalities of the army, the air force and the navy, some flexibility and some more certainty to be given so that men and women in the defence services are not driven to the difficulties that I have just tried to outline. To do that, we brought forward recommendations 1 and 2.Of course there are going to be situations where a person who is being harassed will find it totally obnoxious and impossible to confront their harasser. That is often the case in serious cases, and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner says that that is the case in the majority of cases in which complaints are brought. I do not argue with any of that. I do not want to have any argument with the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, whose work is so important. Rather, I ask for that degree of sympathy for the flexibility that we had been seeking to note the hierarchy of complaints.Sexual harassment can be someone displaying some offensive photograph. We call that a degree of sexual harassment. It is not directed at any individual, and it is not seeking any particular favour from any particular individual. Another level of harassment is where some person touches another person most offensively, or even offensively. That is another higher or more serious level of offence. A very serious offence would be a person requiring a sexual favour of another person in order for that person to gain some advantage or not to suffer some detriment.We saw in the navy in particular, but also in the army and air force, that this whole range of offences could land the offender, or the alleged offender, before the Sex Discrimination Commission. Therefore there was uncertainly amongst many personnel that, if they put up a particular photograph in one part of their cabin, this could lead them to be taken before the Sex Discrimination Commissioner because it can be construed, given the subjective element in the definition of what is in fact offensive, as offending in terms of sexual harassment?I ask the government to please look again at recommendations 1 and 2. Please try to understand what we said on pages 30 and 31. We are in no way wanting to insist that it be compulsory that a person being offended must go and speak with the person who is the alleged offender. We want that only where that is reasonable; only where that is going to stop a cumulative effect and actually nip something in the bud so that it does not become a serious offence. I accept the governments response to recommendation 2, which says that, whilst not putting this in legislation, it agrees with the committee but asks that this be a policy matter at the local level.These are the two main areas where the government is disagreeing with the committee. I note that the other two matters that are still under examination—27 and 39V(a)—are dealing with trials where there are allegations of sexual assault. We are recommending that they be dealt with by a civilian criminal court and, similarly, the investigation towards the trial be dealt with by civilian investigation. This would be the case if the offence occurred anywhere in Australia but, if it occurs outside Australian waters, it would lead to only a court martial being applicable. We want that element to be carefully examined. It is being examined by Attorney-Generals and Defence. We will, of course, listen very carefully to the analysis that eventually comes forward. I reiterate that I support the original recommendations.The other matters supported in part are actually fully understandable. I do not see any difficulty with regard to visits, to telling an offender, to training, to reviewing the electronic warfare section, and to whether the 008 confidential advisory service is amalgamated or remains as three separate telephone numbers. With regard to the support in principle, the government response is understandable.In summary, I very much welcome the governments response and ask that it give a more sympathetic reading to what we meant with regard to recommendations 1 and 2. We will listen very carefully to the eventual examination of recommendations 27 and 39V(a).","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[6]/debate.sub2/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator JONES","LH4","(Queensland)","ALP","N/A","146","—I too wish to comment on the inquiry into sexual harassment in the Australian Defence Force. As Senator Teague said, I was chairman of the committee that conducted the inquiry. I am very grateful that the governments response has, to a large extent, supported the recommendations made by the committee. Of the recommendations, 53 were supported, four were supported in principle, six in part and one was under examination. Only two recommendations were not supported and I will come back to those later. The two recommendations that were not supported were also referred to by Senator Teague.Pressure of time precludes me from covering every recommendation, but I would like to comment on several points. In a number of instances the government response draws attention to written orders and pamphlets et cetera as sources for advice on various aspects of military life. These documents are useful as far as they go, but I cannot stress strongly enough the need to deal on a personal level with the many issues associated with sexual harassment. This includes such a basic decision as the choice of a military career. These issues need to be dealt with on a person to person basis or in a small discussion group.No matter how much information is contained in documents, they cannot be seen as an adequate replacement for open, frank and informative discussion and dialogue about the personal issues involved. One aspect of this—the need for mixed gender focus groups of ADF personnel—is covered in recommendation 39-II(A). The response, which supports the proposal, says:Each of the services has mixed gender focus groups in place. When the Defence instruction is reviewed in November 1995 the input from the service focus groups will be carefully considered.It would be very interesting to know how extensive these focus groups really are. It is puzzling that no mention of these groups was made in the original submissions to the committee. Several of the committees recommendations relate to the need for a practical guide to all personnel for dealing with instances of unacceptable sexual behaviour. The governments response tells us that headquarters of the ADF, in conjunction with the department, have prepared a detailed document entitled Eliminating harassment in the integrated defence environment . It is to be hoped that this document will be available to every individual in the ADF and that it incorporates a section on conflict resolution.The committee urged that the ADF-wide awareness raising seminars should be supplemented by more specific training for any person wishing to develop skills and techniques for dealing with such harassment at the inter-personal level. The governments response supports the proposal and outlines the supplementary training offered by the three service. It should be noted that the response makes no mention of the Australian Defence Force Academy.The committee felt there was a need for the introduction of an external conflict resolution process. The response details the present channels available for conflict resolution. The section on the armys community justice program lists medical officers as among those available to provide conflict resolution. It is questionable on the evidence whether they have the training and capability to provide such a service.One matter raised during the committees hearings was the question of the need for investigating officers to be appointed from outside the unit where the alleged incident occurred. While the response says that the ADF is sensitive to this issue, I would point out that it puts the view that individually deployed units must have the capability of conducting internal investigations. It also says that, if the commanding officer perceives that an investigation may not be impartial, guidance will be sought from a superior officer to appoint an appropriate investigating officer.It is my view, and I believe the committees view, that in all but exceptional circumstances the investigating officer should be from outside the unit. The officer should not be acquainted with any parties involved in the incident. It is imperative that in any incident the complainant and the alleged offender must be apprised of their right to ask the commanding officer for an external investigating officer. The overriding principle must be that justice is done and seen to be done.I would now like to comment on the two recommendations that Senator Teague commented on. Neither recommendation was supported by the governments response. Recommendation 1 and 2 are interlinked and address the basic question addressed by the committee. A very important issue addressed in the committees report was the damage that is done if sexual harassment is not dealt with promptly. Situations that may initially be mild or based on misunderstanding are allowed to fester and develop into major problems.The committee sought to encourage early intervention to resolve a situation that is unsatisfactory to someone before that situation evolves into a formal complaint. Once a situation or formal complaint has been reached, the prospects are that all parties to the complaint—the complainant as well as the alleged harasser—will be hurt. Even if an apology is given or monetary compensation is paid to the complainant, the complainant will inevitably carry the stigma of being called a whinger or someone who does not meet with the requirements that are held within the establishment they are working in. The committee felt that, if possible, such a situation should be pre-empted.Sexual harassment should be nipped in the bud before the parties involved are damaged. It was with this in mind that the committee put forward recommendation 2. It is disappointing that the recommendation has not been accepted by the government. The committee particularly noted the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissions training package for managers. This package encourages in-house informal resolution of sexual harassment complaints, yet it was not developed until 1993—nearly 10 years after the sex discrimination legislation was passed.The emphasis has been on punishment for wrongdoing rather than education to pre-empt wrongdoing. Greater clarity for employers about their responsibilities, as set out in recommendation 2, would ensure better outcomes for all those involved. The governments response to recommendation 2 refers to an alleged lack of clarity—and I suppose the committee in some way must accept the responsibility for that—on whether recourse to in-house facilities would be a precondition to the lodging of a formal complaint. This is a matter which can be looked at in different ways.The issue would have been clearer had the government accepted the committees recommendation 1. This recommendation said that there should be a clearer distinction between serious sexual harassment, such as brutal sexual assault, and the more mild irritants that are perceived by some people as offensive. In instances of less serious types of sexual harassment, it would then have made sense to make in-house efforts or involvement of an outside body part of the informal conflict resolution.The in-house efforts or the outside involvement—such as by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner—would be a precondition for formal complaint. Where the harassment is, by community standards, widely regarded as serious, and there is no ambiguity about the offence, then clearly a direct formal complaint to an outside body would be appropriate. The finetuning involved in implementing recommendation 2 should not pose any major obstacles if the basic need to resolve difficulties before they get out of hand is kept clearly in mind. Sexual harassment appears to be a straightforward matter but, as the committee soon found, it is a very complex issue.Finally, the committee was very pleased with the constructive way in which the government handled the other recommendations made by the committee. The work of the committee and the report that it produced were a credit to the members of the committee and to the Senate.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[6]/debate.sub2/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator ELLISON","9X5","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A","148","—I fully support what Senator Jones said on this matter, in particular the way that the committee conducted itself in carrying out this most delicate and difficult inquiry. I believe that this report will stand as a beacon for future years on this problem of sexual harassment.Although the committees terms of reference related to incidents that occurred on HMAS Swan in 1992 and also to the question of sexual harassment generally in the armed services, I believe that the wider community as a whole could benefit from this report. I think the government has realised that fact in its response to this report. It is interesting to note that, out of the number of recommendations that the committee made, there are only two that the government does not support. I believe that both Senator Jones and Senator Teague have eloquently touched on the problems that confronted the committee and the problems addressed in recommendations Nos 1 and 2.I believe that the government has misunderstood recommendation No. 2 of the committee, which was aimed at the early resolution of sexual harassment problems in the workplace. It was not a recommendation that stated that employers should take all reasonable steps to prevent an employee from engaging in unlawful acts of sexual harassment so that any victim of sexual harassment would first have to avail himself or herself of those `reasonable steps and that not to do so would preclude that person from lodging a formal complaint with an outside body. It was not as structured and strict as that.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[6]/debate.sub2/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator ELLISON","9X5","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A","148","—As Senator Teague says, the committee was not proposing a legal hurdle, and that is where the government misunderstood the recommendation. The government said:. . . it is not clear from the Recommendation whether recourse to `in house facilities would be a precondition to the lodging of a formal complaint with an outside body.The committee was looking for the employer to take all reasonable steps to put in place a system whereby the matter could be nipped in the bud internally—at the workplace, within the place of employment—and sorted out by negotiation—that is, by some form of conciliation between the parties—and thereby would not have to go on to any civil action in the courts. That is what the committee was getting at in recommendation 2. During the course of this inquiry, I believe, the committee found that there were a good many instances of sexual harassment which could be sorted out at that level without any formal litigation or sanction against an individual.In relation to recommendation No. 1, the situation is more complex. The committee recommended:that the definition of sexual harassment under the Sex Discrimination Act be redefined to reflect more clearly. the hierarchy of complaints;.the advantage, where possible, of the complainant informing the alleged harasser that his or her behaviour is offensive;.the appropriate mechanisms and legal sanctions for the different degrees of seriousness of the unlawful behaviour.Quite clearly, there are varying degrees of human behaviour. We have recognised this in the law with our recognition of the varying degrees of assault. You can have common assault, assault occasioning bodily harm and assault occasioning grievous bodily harm. That recognises the degree of behaviour.Similarly, a degree of inappropriate sexual behaviour has been recognised in the various states. I believe that, in the instance of sexual harassment, it is no different. I believe there should be recognition of a hierarchy of situations, starting with the lowest form of sexual harassment and going right through to the most serious form.Since the events on the Swan in 1992, the question of sexual harassment has been canvassed a great deal in the wider community. At the moment, we have an American motion picture entitled Disclosure on this very subject. In fact, it provokes some thought by the viewer in that it is a woman who is perpetrating the sexual harassment against a male subordinate. That is not commonly regarded as the average instance of sexual harassment.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[6]/debate.sub2/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator ELLISON","9X5","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A","148","—As Senator Campbell says, it has never happened to him, and I would not wish it upon anyone. Nonetheless, the fact is that it is now a very important matter which is under consideration in the wider community. I believe that this motion picture has reflected on that. The attention that it has attracted reveals this factor.In recommendation 1, the committee looked at the question of what is sexual harassment. In Australia, we have a society of cultures. As the committee stated:Australian society, perhaps more than most, is made up of a mosaic of cultural backgrounds and experiences. What is acceptable to one person may be unacceptable to another.Professor Kirsner said:. . . many people come from cultures or families where touching is a routine and supportive activity.When we look at the wider Australian community, we have to have regard to the fact that there are many different cultures. There are people in the workplace who have varied approaches to how you deal with grief and joy. Some people are more exuberant than others. Some people believe in touching more than is the case with other people. Some people are quite inhibited. What may be thought to be a very harmless gesture by one person can be received as quite offensive by another. It falls upon the legislature to bring in legislation which covers this situation and takes into account the varying degrees of human behaviour. It was Ms Triulzi, who had been engaged by the Navy, who stated:. . . what we need to understand is that there are lots of elements of grey in understanding what sexual harassment is and is not, and how we distinguish and differentiate those levels of grey.That precisely is the point that the committee was looking at in recommendation 1. In December 1992, section 28 of the Sex Discrimination Act was amended. What was previously a more objective test was changed to a more subjective test, so that the offence that is created is as follows:a person sexually harasses another person (the person harassed) if:(a) the person makes an unwelcome sexual advance, or an unwelcome request for sexual favours, to the person harassed;or(b) engages in other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature in relation to the person harassed;in circumstances in which a reasonable person, having regard to all the circumstances, would have anticipated that the person harassed would be offended, humiliated or intimidated.I stress the words `would have anticipated that the person harassed would be offended. That requires a person in such an instance as the workplace to anticipate what the other person will feel. This becomes increasingly hard, having regard to the fact that I have mentioned—the diverse cultures and backgrounds that Australian society has.One could be in a factory where there are many people of different nationalities and descents, and one has to go through this exercise of anticipation. One has to look at the other person who may have just won the lottery, or at someone whose close relative may have just died. One then has to ask oneself, `Is it sexual harassment if I put my arm around this woman and say, My condolences, or if I slap this person on the back and say, Congratulations on winning the lotto? The average person cannot possibly go through that exercise.I think the government has ignored the problem with a lack of definition. That is precisely what this committee came up against all throughout this inquiry: what precisely is sexual harassment? I join with Senator Teague in asking the government to reconsider this.I join with Senator Jones, who chaired the committee, in expressing disappointment at the fact the government did not not support the recommendations. In fact, I believe that Ms Walpole, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, took somewhat of a trite view in saying that that definition was sufficient and that there was no problem. It was not her role to be there of course, but it could have been of great assistance to her if she had been with us throughout the inquiry to see what level of grey there was. In a very minor instance someone could extend sympathy by putting their arm around a persons shoulder—that is at the low end of the scale—and that could be regarded as sexual harassment. It goes right through to someone touching a fellow worker in an offensive manner. In that say one can see the hierarchy of complaints and the area of grey.Where legislation forbids this, I believe citizens must be given a clearer definition. If subjects throughout the country are to be expected to obey the law, they have to be given direction. It is our duty as legislators to tell them what they can and cannot do. I do not believe that section 28 of the Sex Discrimination Act does that. It leaves it to the individual to anticipate what another person might feel. I really do think it merits close attention.Sexual harassment is an important matter. I believe this committee provided a beacon to the community at large in relation to the problems faced in the armed services. I believe the committee addressed those instances, in particular in relation to the HMAS Swan , admirably.The committee, in recommendations 24, 25 and 26, urged reconsideration of the censure of Captain Mole and argued that he not be impeded in his promotion. These were very good recommendations indeed and I note the governments response to them. I have made inquiries and I believe that Captain Mole has since been promoted and that his censure, whilst not being removed as yet, is under review. I am happy to report that to the Senate because I believe that this officer was serving the navy and his country well. As a result of the attentions of some of the media in this instance, he suffered a great deal. In fact, he suffered a setback to his career generally in the navy. I believe the committee saw that and that is why the committee recommended those things. I thought it important to place that on the record.Nonetheless, I urge the government to reconsider recommendations 1 and 2. I ask it to please look at that section in the Sex Discrimination Act. I would plead for an amendment to that section so that there be more clarity in the definition of what exactly constitutes sexual harassment.Debate (on motion by Senator Panizza ) adjourned.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[6]/debate.sub2/speech[3]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

I seek leave to move a motion in relation to that document.Leave granted.I move:That the Senate take note of the document.The two documents contained in the volume I have just tabled were received by the committee as evidence during its current inquiry into the role of national sporting coaches in the international transfer of Australian players, which was referred to the committee by resolution of the Senate on 8 December 1994. This inquiry has attracted wide public and community interest and the committee has decided to table these documents so that they may become available through the Australia-wide network of the Australian Government Publishing Service bookshops.The committee held public hearings on this reference on Friday, 27 January 1995 in Sydney, at which the Hon. D.G. Stewart and Mr John Hegarty, the solicitor who assisted him in his inquiry, were heard. The committee also heard Mr John Constantine, the Chairman of the Australian Soccer Federation, and Mr Ian Holmes, the federations chief executive officer, on that day. The committee is now proceeding with this inquiry.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I know that my colleague Senator Baume also wishes to say a few words. Firstly, I congratulate Senator Campbell, the shadow minister for sport, on bringing this matter forward. As a new member of this committee—I am only just availing myself of the facts—I must say I have been totally astounded by what seems to be coming out of this report.Former Justice Donald Stewart did not have any powers of subpoena or any other powers that this Senate committee has, but what he unearthed I believe is the tip of the iceberg of what is quite scandalous behaviour in the transfer of soccer players. Naturally, it has received a fair amount of media coverage, because I think most Australians are concerned about sport. No doubt there will be a lot of discussion on this.As the time for the discussion of government documents is approaching, I make the point that I was very impressed by the evidence given by Mr Hegarty and by former Justice Stewart. The additional evidence they brought forward to us under parliamentary privilege last Friday in Sydney is something that we will be discussing. Senator Baume and I will be speaking on this matter in the Senate, but just to give some indication of the situation, I would poiont out that a further document that came forward from Blackburn Rovers Football Club in the UK regarding the transfer of a Frank Talia shows that some $200,000 is missing.The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Colston) —It being 6.50 p.m., the Senate will proceed to government documents tabled earlier this day.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator BROWNHILL","RD4","(New South Wales-","NP","Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia)","153","—I move:That the Senate take note of the document.The Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council performs an important role; namely, it provides a forum to consider industry issues and provides advice to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) from an industry perspective. I think this report outlines the number of important issues the council addressed during the year in review. It provided technical advice to the negotiation process of the Uruguay Round discussions, which we all hope is going to do some good for us.The council has developed feedlot guidelines for the industry, which basically have been very worth while and very good for an industry that has increased in size and stature in Australia. It has also focused on establishing systems within the meat industry to provide more effective links between the producer and the consumer. While it is all very well for government bodies to work on these links, it is something that must be industry driven and meat producers themselves must appreciate the importance of the end user and the importance of, and the need for, consistency in the product.That is something that has caused a great deal of concern in the last little while—the helix contamination of some of our beef into some of our export markets. Some people have said that the AMLC levy should have been used to help some of those people with the helix contamination problems. Basically, there is a big concern by all of those people who have beef contaminated by helix which, as everyone in this chamber knows, was used to spray cotton. It is probably one of the best and softest chemicals that has ever been used in the cotton industry, but the Japanese and the Americans have nil tolerance of it. When the residue levels get up to one or two, the non-tolerance areas will not accept the product.The AMLC has a very big part to play in that contamination scare. I think the job will now be left to the AMLC to make sure those markets that have been hurt by that particular scare are recouped. Quite often some of those other countries use some of these things as non-tariff trade barriers. It is quite interesting that the Japanese use helix to spray vegetables and everything else but they have a nil tolerance of it if it is in imported beef.The report lists a number of project objectives. I am sure many of those are not known about. It does not list what this councils administration costs are, so I cannot comment on whether industry is getting value or not. I think it is very important that any of these industry councils make sure they give full accountability to the producers who make the funds available to keep the councils going on behalf of the growers.I understand that since this report was published the former chairman, Mr Bob McCarthy, has been replaced by Robin Bligh. I wish Mr Robin Bligh great success in his new job. I do not know the reasons for the change, but I am aware that there is some criticism within the industry of that change taking place. So I hope that the industry sticks together and does the right thing. If we are to have an industry council, the advice has to be objective. I hope that this is going to be so with the AMLIPC in the future.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator SANDY MACDONALD","CX5","(New South Wales)","NP","N/A","154","—I support Senator Brownhills motion to take note of the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council annual report. The objectives of the council refer to a body called the residue management group. Its second key objective is to protect export and domestic markets for animal products from disruption to trade and financial losses caused by chemical residue detections. It is in that area that I wish to make a contribution tonight. There are a number of issues concerning the beef residue testing debacle that has come to pass through the feeding of drought affected cattle and even feedlot cattle with cotton trash treated with the chemical helix, which incidentally, as Senator Brownhill said, is a very effective method of killing caterpillars at certain stages of cotton production.I have a number of concerns. Firstly, there seems to have been an extreme lack of leadership in the beginning, and a lack of understanding of the plight of farmers already suffering severe drought being isolated into areas regarded `at risk and then being forced to substantially meet their own testing costs. The New South Wales government has, to its credit, given considerable assistance in this area. Secondly, the AMLC was not prepared to use its $5 million in residue testing funds which had been set aside, I assume, for precisely this purpose.Thirdly, it seems that many northern cattle producers, both in New South Wales and Queensland, have been left in an appalling situation. The industry had washed its hands of many producers who had fed cattle through the most severe drought on record and who presently are unable to sell their cattle because they would be over the maximum residue level of this chemical. I am pleased to see that the New South Wales farmers are looking at some way of compensating these producers.Fourthly, the fundamental point that seems to have been missed by the AMLC is that anything that interferes with Australias legitimate claim as a clean and green supplier of beef to the world is a problem for all producers, not just for those presently affected by this particular residue problem. It is especially so for northern producers and Queensland producers. Their livelihood was further threatened by this unfortunate combination of drought and the CFZ chemical, which hopefully will not happen again.The industry must be assured that in future a national management plan will be in place to handle future residue detection problems—and there will always be those problems. It must be there to answer questions quickly, to give leadership, to provide a speedy trace back of contaminants and, overall, to give confidence, to be of benefit to all producers and, most importantly, to give the sort of leadership our international market requires.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator MARGETTS","DX5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A","154","—I move:That the Senate take note of the document.In relation to the first annual report of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation, the Greens WA objected in the beginning to the whole idea of a levy to fund this corporation. The idea of making money from chopping down trees to pay a bunch of industry representatives and bureaucrats to research how the industry can be sustainable is bizarre. I can be optimistic but, given the attitude prevalent in governments, it is likely that this will only be yet another smokescreen—like the national forest policy, the Resource Assessment Commission inquiry or the ESD forest policy—designed to divert attention, while the trees keep falling.By now we know that the way to make the industry sustainable is by agroforestry or to regenerate plantations on degraded, already cleared land. We know that adding value is the answer, not just increasing export volume to make up for declining prices. We know that the answer is not to eliminate the last stands of old growth forest and then try to become sustainable. How much more research do we need? CALM has researched agroforestry for years, but what has it done? It has lacked the will to implement it.Woodchipping is a tonnage export. It is a high volume, low value industry. It is a heavily mechanised industry that is shedding jobs as fast as possible. It is a large corporate dominated industry; it is a foreign dominated industry. It is not going to create great wealth, unless truly massive amounts of material are shipped out—and the actual benefits will be minimal, relative to expense and sensitive to price.Since 1986 the price of woodchips has fallen dramatically. Brazil has brought seven million hectares of Eucalypt plantation on line; South-East Asia is bringing huge gum plantations on line; and Spain, Argentina, South Africa and China are all bringing gum plantations on line. These are all plantation based trees. Supply is up, the prices are down and the margins on woodchips are getting thinner.Woodchipping is capital and technology intensive. It is highly mechanised in an effort to reduce labour costs. This is typical of high volume, low value products for basic economic reasons. It is not going to change. The trend to replace workers with expensive imported equipment will accelerate. The need for capital—usually foreign sourced capital—is also likely to accelerate. Three results will flow from this: jobs decrease relative to export volumes; imports increase relative to the profits from exports; and servicing of overseas loans increase as a portion of export earnings.As further mechanisation occurs and volume of extraction increases, the use of intermediate inputs, such as fuel, increases. Where they are not imported, domestic supplies that could be used more productively are taken out of availability. Profits are also repatriated and so do not enter into multiplier effects here and are part of a capital outflow from Australia.Finally, there is the issue of subsidy of forest products generally, and woodchipping specifically. Even without this, there are a number of factors which see money flowing out of the country as a consequence of the export of woodchips. This means that the actual contribution of woodchips to balance of payments is liable to be minimal or negative. At best, we are selling our forests for a mass of potage; at worst, we are paying people to take them away.Then there is the issue of subsidy to the forest industry. A 1990 New South Wales Public Accounts Committee reported that the states timber processing industry is heavily subsidised. A Tasmanian report by Saddler, Kohl and Graham concluded that:Forestry Commission, bulk power subsidies and transport subsidies amount to over $80 million per year. This represents a direct cost to all other industries in the State, the Government taxes other industries in order to subsidise forestry operations. The economic consequences of this are obviously serious and contribute to Tasmanias low economic growth and high unemployment rate.Other reports at various times have yielded similar results.Put simply, these operations are not doing the economy any good. The only possible reason to allow them is a hatred of nature and a blind stupidity that believes that chopping down, digging up and killing things is a good way to be a hard-nosed pragmatist.It is the Greens who are the practical people, the ones who wish to sit down with industry and work out a way through the current problems; and it is the woodchip advocates who are the ideologues. What are not included in this report are environmental goals; what are not included in this report are employment goals. If these were included, then we might get an outcome that we can look forward to, sitting down and working with those people who work in the industry, instead of just looking at the profits of very large corporations.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[3]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator ABETZ","N26","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A","155","—I was in the chamber to seek to speak on Aboriginal deaths in custody. But, as time is getting by, I daresay we will not get the opportunity to discuss that. However, I have been motivated to respond to that quite amazing contribution from Senator Margetts. Basically, what she has said to the people of Australia this evening is that the Greens are against the chopping down of any single tree, and that they are opposed to a most dynamic industry which has been very important in Australias economy from the time of white settlement some 200 years ago.The situation clearly is that it is within Australias interests that there be research and development of forest and wood products. I would have thought that anybody who was genuinely concerned about Australias future would be embracing a development corporation which is looking at developing our forest and wood products. I have to say that I agree it would be beneficial if our woodchips did not go overseas. But what happens? When we in Tasmania wanted a pulp mill at Wesley Vale—a mill which at that time would have been the most environmentally sensitive in the world—who were the most vehement opponents of it? It was the Green movement. So instead, the woodchips are being sent to Japan to be processed in a mill which is more environmentally damaging than the Tasmanian mill would have been. These people tell us to think globally and act locally—but their action with the Wesley Vale pulp mill was in exact contradiction to that policy.Senator Margetts tells us that we ought to have studies and look at our forest and sustainability. We in Tasmania—as you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would know—have had to suffer in excess of a dozen studies. We have had the Helsham report and a whole host of others. But when it does not suit the Greens to adopt a report, they go for another one and another one and another one. Then, of course, Senator Margetts quotes from that famous report—which, I noted, had the name of one of the people from the staff of Senator John Devereux—as being one of the supposedly independent reports that they rely on. It is like the Greens, who seem to rely in Tasmania on their own polls, those that they conduct, and then try to sell them off to the community as having been done by an independent organisation, until they get caught out.Really, the amount of muddying of the waters that has occurred in this forestry debate is tragic. I do not have a hatred of nature, as suggested by Senator Margetts; I believe that we ought to live in harmony with nature for the benefit of human endeavour. The way to do that is to use renewable resources, such as wood, such as hydro-electric power—as we have in our state—which harnesses natural resources for the benefit of humankind.There is one thing the Greens will never admit to when they talk about nature and the world and all those wonderful things: human beings just happen to be part of nature; we are to live on this earth; we do have a place in this world. Just as much as rabbits might like to dig burrows for their homes and undermine little banks and trees from time to time, so human beings to make their homes in which they live will chop down trees. If that means that I am a hater of nature, then the chances are that the beavers in Canada, or wherever, that cut down little saplings to dam rivers are also haters of nature. If a little animal does it, it is okay; but when human beings want to do it, that is outrageous; that is a hatred of nature. It is about time that the Greens got onto this planet earth with both feet and realised that— (Time expired)","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[3]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator CHAMARETTE","SN5","(Western Australia)","GWA","N/A","156","—I rise in this debate on the motion to take note of the annual report of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. I will make some very brief comments. This report would normally be commended by the Greens because it endeavours to look at forests and wood products and work out ways in which the industry can become sustainable.If the timber industry were sustainable at present, then we would be in the happy position of the industry never needing to log old-growth and high conservation value forests. Unfortunately, this insistence that the industry cannot survive without logging in old-growth and high conservation value forests means that the industry is not sustainable. It also means that, because there is such a reliance by this industry on these native forests, when those forests are gone the industry will not be sustainable in any sense of the word. It is certainly not environmentally sustainable now.It was pleasing to note that Senator Abetz said that renewable resources are what we are looking for. That is quite correct. I am very pleased to agree with Senator Abetz. However, in relation to the timber industry, renewable resources mean plantation and agro-forestry. Old-growth forests are not a renewable resource. Trees are renewable because they grow, but forests are not renewable.Australia is very fortunate. It is an ancient continent. It has historic, beautiful, longstanding forests that have never been logged. If we log those forests that have never been logged before, then we are destroying them forever. They will never be renewed. Trees will grow, but forests are extinguished by the first logging and intrusion into them. Honourable senators need to learn the difference between trees, plantations and forests because old-growth forests are a unique ecosystem. They are very precious and valued world wide, but they do not seem to be valued in this country.The list that the federal government has developed, which protects only some forests and leaves others vulnerable, even though the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) indicated they are high conservation value forests, is a hit list for the timber industry. It means that where you declare forests to be of high conservation value but you fail to have the political will to protect them, you render them vulnerable.To claim that it is the states responsibility to protect those forest areas against road making and other activities is an abrogation of the federal governments responsibility. The states have already said that they will not protect even those 509 areas that have been reserved for rescheduling and assessment. Therefore, what we are doing is throwing away something very valuable.The forest research levy, from which this study will be financed and which some of my colleagues in the Senate agreed to, is actually a way of giving permission to log all forests and trees for $1 a tree, whether it comes from a sawmill or is imported. The very important point is that if there is a $1 levy for each tree and that levy does not differentiate between a plantation log and a 400-year-old tree, then we are giving moral permission, through this funding to the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation, to act at the expense of our natural heritage.It is of national interest that the federal and state governments do not have the political will to protect high conservation value forests and old-growth forests, and merely charge a levy of $1 per trunk. I take no joy from the fact that the levy goes to fund this organisation. I regret that, by this levy, we are giving moral permission for the destruction of our precious forest heritage.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[3]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator SANDY MACDONALD","CX5","(New South Wales)","NP","N/A","157","—I did not come into the chamber to rebut some of the outrageous statements that the Greens have put on the record tonight, but I think it is an appropriate time to do that in defence of our native forests. Our forests are not disappearing. Australia has approximately 43 million hectares of native forest. Of that, just over seven million hectares, or one-sixth, of this estate forest is managed specifically on a sustainable basis for wood production. About one per cent of that seven million hectares is harvested and regenerated every year. That means that any area logged will, on average, not be logged again for 100 years.The second point that is worth making is that the forests are not logged for woodchips alone. Timber is a natural and renewable resource competing with non-renewable commodities like steel, aluminium and plastic. Native forests are logged for the purpose of providing sawn timber for housing, furniture and for use in the construction industry. The waste from sawmilling is then either converted into woodchips or burnt or wasted at sawmills. Similarly, in the forests, trees from the harvest area that are unsuitable for sawmilling are either chipped or left to burn or rot. If woodchipping were to stop, sawmills would still need the same number of trees to be logged. The only difference would be that the by-product would be wasted, and that has been put on the record a couple of times today.The third point is that no animal or plant has been threatened by logging. The federal governments Resource Assessment Commission determined with its exhaustive study into Australias forests that there is no evidence that any plant or animal species has been threatened with extinction because of forest industry activities. Given that state forests have been logged for more than 100 years, this is sound evidence of the resilience of our forests.The fourth point—and this is a question the Greens would like answered—is why do we not get all our wood from plantations? The reason is that Australias wood needs are currently met about equally by domestic native forests, domestic plantations and imports. Australias 100 million hectares of plantations could not supply further shortfalls from native forests. It simply means that we would have to import more. We presently have a current account deficit on the importation of timber or timber products of around $2 billion a year. If the Greens would like to see our current account deficit rise even more, then perhaps they should look to that as a solution.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[3]/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

The final point is why dont we use all the woodchips in Australia? The Greens would be interested in the reason for that, even though they probably know it. Due to the political uncertainty about the forests, which they engender, companies are not prepared to make the very large investment of up to a billion dollars that is needed to build plants for pulp and paper manufacturing in Australia. Senator Abetz, my colleague from Tasmania, knows a great deal about that. There is a provision in our export wood licences for chips to be first made available to domestic manufacturers for local processing. Only the surplus is exported.","N/A","DOCUMENTS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/debate.sub1[3]/speech[4]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator BOSWELL","YE4","(Queensland-","NP","Leader of the National Party of Australia)","158","—I rise on behalf of the National Party in the Senate to extend our condolences to the family of Thomas Gilmore, who recently passed away at the great age of 87. During an extremely varied working life, Tom Gilmore served as both a federal parliamentarian in the Far North Queensland seat of Leichhardt and as a state parliamentarian in the seat of Tablelands—which is currently held by his son Tom Gilmore Jr.A lifelong member of the National Party, Tom Gilmore was born in 1908 in the mining town of Wolframcamp, west of Mareeba. After leaving school at 14, Tom Gilmore undertook many diverse jobs and the experience gained from working with a wide variety of people from all walks of life enabled him to be an effective representative of the Queensland people when he entered politics later in his life. Tom worked as a clerk in a hardware store, a tally clerk on the wharves, cut sugarcane by hand—truly backbreaking work—and he was also an ambulance bearer and a fireman on a sugar mill locomotive.In 1931, Tom Gilmore returned to the family tobacco farm and worked there until the outbreak of the Second World War when he joined the RAAF and served in Bundaberg and Sydney—age precluding him from participating in overseas war service. When he was demobbed in 1945, he was sent home to Mareeba with instructions to grow vegetables to feed the allied troops who were maintaining a strong presence in the area.In 1949, Tom became an inaugural member of the Tobacco Leaf Marketing Board. That same year he won the federal seat of Leichhardt, becoming a member of the Menzies-Fadden government. A conscientious and hardworking member, he served the people of Leichhardt well and was unfortunate to lose the seat in the double dissolution election in 1951. However, he made many political friends and was able to realise a long-held ambition to serve alongside such Country Party greats as Arthur Fadden and Black Jack McEwen.His friendships spanned the political spectrum with his forging of a friendship with Ben Chifley—possibly due to their shared experience as clerks and firemen early in their working lives. Ironically, it was Chifleys actions in opposing the restoration of the Commonwealth Bank Board, which had been abolished by him in 1945, that triggered this double dissolution—which was only the second in federal history at that time.Tom Gilmore continued to play a significant role in agropolitics and served for many years on the North Queensland Tobacco Growers Cooperative in the capacity of member and chairman. He also continued his strong involvement in the organisation he helped establish—the Tobacco Leaf Marketing Board. In 1957, Tom Gilmore entered state politics when he captured the seat of Tablelands. He continued his hard work for the people of the Tablelands and was an effective advocate for the tobacco and sugar industries that underpinned the economy of that region.I had the honour of knowing Tom Gilmore personally. He was always an excellent fount of knowledge on the detailed workings of the tobacco and sugar industries and was generous in his time in providing me with information about these key industries. He was one of those people who was very highly respected in the National Party. He used to send us little memos when he thought we had done things that warranted his encouragement.In this 75th year of the National Party, it is very important to acknowledge the people who have made a significant contribution to the fortunes of the National Party—to acknowledge those who have played a role in the shaping of Australias second oldest political party that developed from unification of farmers organisations in Western Australia in 1913, instigated to oppose the unconscionable trading practices inflicted on them by some merchants, to the truly National Party it is today with a presence in every state.Lifelong National Party members who have devoted years of service to the party deserve our respect and appreciation. On behalf of the National Party in the Senate, I proffer our respect and appreciation for Tom Gilmores many years of service to the National Party and extend our sympathy to his son and his family and his friends.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[1]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I was fortunate to be able to attend his funeral in a packed church in Randwick with many people who had regarded Jack Birney with affection. People across all political persuasions went to pay their respects to him.He was a `oncer; in other words, he was one of those elected in 1975 who were derided by some members of the then opposition as people who would only grace the parliament for one term. We were called `oncers and, as a result, we accepted that appellation with some enthusiasm when we got returned for two and three terms.Jack Birney survived as a member of parliament until 1983 and was, in fact, a genuine representative of his area. I campaigned with him on several occasions, and it was amazing to see how he seemed to be very friendly with people and known throughout his electorate. If one said that you could not go into a pub in Phillip without most of the people in that pub knowing him, that might give a false impression of his after-hours behaviour.There was no doubt that he was a true son of that area. He played first grade cricket for Randwick. He was a wicket keeper. I suppose he had some of that mischievous, puckish sense of humour that wicket keepers have, particularly when you are about to face a difficult bowler from the other end and the wicket keeper will give you advice about the easiest way to get out to him. He played on the wing for Randwick Rugby Union Club and was a highly regarded sportsman. I imagine that most of us here in parliament remember him for his dedicated service to the people of Phillip.Unfortunately, Jack Birney is now the third of those members elected in 1975 to the Liberal benches to have died. Senator John Knight was the first to die, in office. Jim Bradfield has also passed away—and now Jack Birney.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

I must confess to one and all that I have never heard him called Reginald John Birney; he was Jack Birney. I, like my friend Senator Michael Baume, was one of those elected in 1975 who became known as the `oncers. I think 43 of us were elected at that time. It was an election that changed the face of Australian politics. Jack Birney was an important part of that change. As Senator Baume said, he represented his electorate of Phillip for three parliaments until 1983.I did not have the pleasure of knowing Jack Birney as well as his New South Wales colleagues. He was very much a New South Welshman, but he was also a person who just oozed being Australian. He was a very rugged individual. He was a very laconic chap. He had a terrific sense of humour. He had a very dry sense of humour and a very sharp wit. He was very much a straight shooter. What you saw with Jack Birney was what you got. In that capacity, he was very committed not just to the Liberal Party and its ideals and principles but also to the wellbeing of his constituents, regardless of their political or other allegiances. As I said, he was very much an Australian. He was very committed to Australias present and its future.I join with Senator Baume in saying a few brief words in memory of a man who was respected very deeply by all of those who knew him and who were his colleagues in this place. He will be very sadly missed, as Senator Baume said, by those many hundreds of people who attended his funeral and by the much wider community of contacts that he had as well.Senate adjourned at 7.33 p.m.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","Senator Robert Ray","UI4","QLD","ALP","N/A","165","—The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senators question:(1) The next change to the Group Rental Scheme is projected for July 1995 and under current arrangements will not have any negative effect on DSS entitlements of ADF personnel. This is dependent upon the DSS benchmark for `Special Housing locations remaining at its present level of $80 per week.(2) The number of ADF personnel affected by the change to negative gearing arrangements to be introduced by the DSS on 1 January 1995 is not known. Negative gearing details are a personal matter between individuals and the Australian Taxation Office.(3) Discussions were held on a number of issues relating to the DSS changes to assessments for family payments. The effect of the changes were discussed as a whole, including regarding negative gearing. While Government policy integrity was maintained in the income testing arrangements, agreement was reached on the anomalous impact of the treatment of rental subsidy for ADF members.The Government recognised that the treatment under the Social Security test ran across longstanding ADF policy which treats personnel at the same rank on a similar basis with regard to housing and provides subsidies which standardise housing costs, irrespective of their location. Such an anomalous impact was not seen as being the case for negative gearing.However, in recognising the home ownership difficulties experienced by members, the ADF has two provisions available to members who own homes and as a result of postings are unable to reside in them.The two ADF homes loans, the Defence Service Home Loan and the Defence HomeOwner Scheme are fully portable, ie they can be transferred between properties.Home Purchase or Sale Expense Allowance allows for the reimbursement of some of the unavoidable legal, conveyancing and real estate cost associated with the purchase or sale of residences as a consequence of being posted.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","Senator McMullan","5I4","TAS","ALP","N/A","167","—The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senators question, based on advice from Telstra:(1) Telstra advises that its profit for the 1993-94 financial year was a record for the company and this was due to a number of factors including: higher demand for telecommunications services stimulated by price reductions for those services since the inception of competition; and Telstras continuing efforts to control and reduce expenses.(2)(a) Under the Telecommunications Act 1991, the Minister has designated Telecom as the Universal Service Carrier to provide and maintain the standard telephone service and pay-phones to all Australians, wherever they live or carry on business. As the Universal Service Carrier, Telecom may register a claim with AUSTEL for reimbursement for the cost of meeting the Universal Service Obligation (USO), in loss-making areas, from the other participating carriers.Under the Telecommunications (Universal Service Levy) Act 1991, Telecom, Optus and Vodafone have been declared participating telecommunications carriers. This means that they are required to share the costs of meeting the USO—based on their share of timed telecommunications traffic.AUSTEL is responsible for administering the USO arrangements. AUSTEL is also required to monitor and report to the Minister regarding Telstras performance in meeting its USO.(2)(b) AUSTEL gazetted its assessment of the Universal Service Obligation for the 1992/93 financial year on 3 June 1994 (see Table A). The total Net Universal Cost was estimated at $149,170,304. Telstras contribution towards the costs of providing loss-making services in ensuring universal service during 1992/93 was assessed at $147,714,485. Optus was the only other participating carrier during 1992/93 and its contribution was assessed at $1,455,819.AUSTEL is currently assessing the USO liabilities and entitlements for the 1993/94 financial year.(3) & (4) Telstra advises me that it proposes that by December 1995, all Tasmanian exchanges will have digital equipment available for those customers who need such access for advanced services.Telstra advises that it plans to have all exchanges in Tasmania fully digitised by December 1998.(5)(a) Telstra has advised me that corporatisation and the associated rapid commercialisation of its operations have reaped substantial benefits for the Company through greater attention to outcomes and the relationships between costs and revenues.(5)(b) Telstra advises that the benefits of corporatisation can be demonstrated by: the Companys ability to generate the necessary cash flows to support its capital expenditure program; its improved customer service; and competitive price structure.Telecommunications Act 1991Notice of Assessment of the Universal Service Obligation for the 1992-93 Financial Year, Under Section 308AUSTEL has applied the principles required by sections 301, 305, 306 and 310 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 (the `Act) to arrive at is assessment of the Universal Service Obligation liabilities and entitlements under section 308 of the Act.

He was contracted to provide transport for Aboriginals as part of a training program, Woody Weed Control, jointly administered by DEET, the Queensland Department of Lands and a local Aboriginal organisation, Yamba Housing Co-op.(4) The vehicle was a private vehicle leased in Mr Morgans name.(5) The vehicle was leased from Australian Guarantee Corporation Limited (AGC) at a rate of $134.25 per week.(6) The vehicle is a 1984 model Toyota Landcruiser troop carrier.(7) No specific regulations exist regarding the loan of private vehicles to DEET labour market programs. Program providers may provide transport to and from and during courses/work programs. They are responsible for any arrangements which may include use of private vehicles, vehicles owned by the organisation or hiring from a third party. DEET has insurance to cover participants of a number of labour market programs, such as JobTrain, for Public Liability of $5 million and Personal Accident of $100,000. The insurance covers all kinds of transport including all travel by private vehicles.(8) It was arranged that Mr Morgans vehicle would be available for use in the course from 27 April 1992 for the six weeks of the course.(9) The Training program to which Mr Morgans vehicle was on loan was designed to train Aboriginals in the control of woody weed.(10) (a) At the time of the vehicles breakdown it was being used to transport course participants to Elton Downs via Hughenden.

For example, computer hardware comes in a number of forms and the costs range from small to very large amounts, depending on the hardware in question. It would not be possible, without an expenditure of resources which could not be justified, to extract records of minor purchases.Similarly, software may at one extreme be very inexpensive, and purchased over the counter, or at the other be very costly and acquired through major tendering processes. Much software may not be purchased at all, in the sense of legal ownership transferring from the producer to the Commonwealth, even though there is Commonwealth expenditure. Concepts like average lead times for decisions to purchase, and average life of hardware and software are imprecise and meaningless in this context.In the circumstances, I am unable to authorise the expenditure of money and effort involved in trying to assemble the information.(4)&(8) The department disposes of equipment which it no longer needs in a variety of ways, including by tender, auction and by trade-in, in some instances by item, in others by lot. It is not possible, therefore, to answer this question in its current form.(5) 1991-92—$143,800; 1992-93—$83,330; 1993-94—$141,449; 1994-95—$85,142(6) The department does not keep records in a form which would enable it to answer this question.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","Senator Collins","OF4","NT","ALP","N/A","173","—The answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has agreements on conditions for the export of meat, meat products, edible offal and a range of other animal products with over 100 countries. At any time over 50 different items may be in the process of negotiation in order to gain market access to a new country, to add a different product to an existing market, or to renegotiate existing agreements in the light of recent animal or public health developments. In a few cases veterinary agreements, such as one currently being negotiated with the European Union, provide a framework for the conduct of animal product exports to particular countries.(2) Many countries have been approached by AQIS during 1994 either to gain market access to a new market, to add a different product to an existing market, or to renegotiate existing agreements in the light of recent animal or public health developments. The product range has varied from meat from domestic species to emu and kangaroo skins to feathermeal.(3) Most countries require certification provided by a Government veterinary service for the majority of animal product imports. Usually certification indicates that specific inspection tasks have been performed or contains statements attesting to the animal and public health status of a particular product. These arrangements typically apply also to pet food and offal.One of the objectives of the AQIS International Market Access Program, being developed jointly with industry, is to negotiate greater flexibility in the access requirements imposed by other countries, including in relation to the specification of the body in Australia which is to be responsible for inspection and/or certification.(4)&(5) AQIS staff visit overseas countries as required with the objective of securing favourable conditions for Australias exports of meat and meat products. AQlS also maintains veterinary counsellors in Brussels and Washington. DC to handle matters arising in the European, North America and Mexican markets. No AQIS officers have travelled overseas specifically in relation to the formal renegotiation of quarantine protocols for the export of Australian meat and meat products since 1 January 1994.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[13]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","Senator Gareth Evans","VD4","WA","ALP","N/A","180","—The answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) Spent nuclear fuel containing Australian Obligated Nuclear Material (AONM) in the Republic of Korea (ROK) remains subject to the provisions of the Agreement between Australia and the ROK concerning Cooperation in Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy and the Transfer of Nuclear Material, which entered into force on 2 May 1979. Under Article VIII of this Agreement, AONM subject to this Agreement may not be reprocessed within the ROK or transferred to a third country without the prior written consent of the Australian Government. Requests for such consent would be considered on a case-by-case basis. No such request has been made in respect of reprocessing.(2) Spent nuclear fuel containing AONM in Japan remains subject to the provisions of the Agreement between Japan and Australia for Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, which entered into force on 17 August 1982. Pursuant to Annex B (the Reprocessing Settlement) and the Implementing Arrangement of the Australia/Japan Agreement, Australia exercises its prior consent rights on a programmatic basis so that AONM may be reprocessed in Japan or in an eligible third country as part of a long-term nuclear fuel cycle program. A condition of this programmatic consent is that the facility in which reprocessing will take place is included within the Delineated and Recorded Japanese Nuclear Fuel Cycle Program (DRJNFCP). The DRJNFCP is an integral part of the Australia/Japan Agreement and the provisions of the Implementing Arrangement which outline the DRJNFCP are of treaty status and are published (along with the Agreement) in the Australian Treaty Series (No. 22 of 1982).Australia has also given programmatic consent to certain retransfers of AONM subject to the Australia/Japan Agreement within the Delineated and Recorded Japanese Nuclear Fuel Cycle Program. In accordance with arrangements established in 1992, Japan notifies Australia of such retransfers, including those of spent fuel containing AONM, approximately six months in advance of each transfer.(3) Australian uranium may only be exported or retransferred to countries with which Australia has bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements. These agreements lay down stringent conditions for the use and transfer of AONM. Within Australias network of bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements, five agreements (those with Euratom, France, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland) contain reprocessing settlements, allowing those treaty partners to retransfer and reprocess AONM under a programmatic consent regime based on conditions previously agreed to by the Australian Government. The remainder of Australias bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements, except that with the Russian Federation, require prior written consent from Australia to be sought on a case-by-case basis before reprocessing of AONM could take place.

See also reply to Question 1473(4).(c) See reply to Question 1473(5) and 1480(1).(d) See reply to Question 1555(2) and 1480(1).(2)(a) As stated in the reply to Question 1480(1), it is the Reserve Banks understanding that Mr Johnson was made redundant following a restructure of the merged Tasmania Bank/Savings Bank of Tasmania; the decision to terminate his services was reached after an independent assessment was made of his suitability for a management position in the merged bank. This understanding is supported by the terms of a settlement reached between Mr Johnson and Trust Bank Tasmania following civil action brought by Mr Johnson for wrongful dismissal; the Reserve Bank has been advised formally that the terms of the settlement specify that:(a) Alwyn Johnson and the Bank [ie. Trust Bank] accept that the termination of his employment on the 3rd July, 1991 was as a result of the genuine redundancy of his position and the unavailability of any suitable position to which he could be redeployed.(b) Alwyn Johnson accepts that in no way was the decision to terminate his employment the result of any vindictiveness or persecution whether as a result of any involvements he may have had in bringing to light information concerning the former Tasmania Bank, or for any other reason.(b) See reply to Question 1480(2).(c) See reply to Question 1480(3).(3)(a) See reply to Question 1480(4).(b)(i) See reply to Question 1473(3).(ii) See reply to Question 1480(5)(a) and (b).(iii) See reply to Question 1555(1).(4)(a) See reply to Question 1555(3).(b) See reply to Question 1555(3) and (5).(5)(a) The Reserve Bank monitors continually changes in the assets and liabilities of banks; Tasmania Bank and the Savings Bank of Tasmania were no exception. In November 1990 Tasmania Bank experienced a moderate outflow of deposits following the announcement by the State Government of significant losses for that bank. The bulk of the outflow occurred in the first two days after the announcement. The Reserve Bank consulted with the bank during this period and was fully aware of the extent of the outflow. The Savings Bank of Tasmanias deposit holdings fell by 6 per cent over the four month period following the State Governments announcement of problems in Tasmania Bank in November 1990. By July 1991 this fall had been all but completely reversed. Changes of this magnitude can be associated with factors such as changes in balance sheet structure and a banks pricing policy for deposits.(b) See reply to Question 1473(3).(c) See reply to Question 1473(3). The Reserve Bank did not meet with Mr Kemp on 18 September 1991. Mr Kemp called on the Head of Bank Supervision Department on 17 September 1991 to update the Reserve Bank on the integration of the Savings Bank of Tasmania and Tasmania Bank. The Governor, while in Hobart on 3 October 1991 to speak at a conference, called upon Mr Kemp to discuss various issues relating to the Trust Bank Tasmania. In carrying out its duties as prudential supervisor of banks, the Reserve Bank routinely meets with senior executives of banks.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[21]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In addition, programs for students in other countries would have to be cancelled where institutions were dependent for viability upon the PRC component. If cessation results from actions of the PRC Government the industry has no option but to adjust as best it can. If actions by the Australian Government stopped the program the industry would presumably seek some form of redress . . .

In June 1990, the Commonwealth Government wrote to all ELICOS and Special Studies institutions detailing the procedures and guidelines to be followed if they wished to request provision of temporary financial assistance to cover short-term cashflow problems but not to compensate for any loss of profits. Those institutions which had a solid financial base, recruited students from several countries and, therefore, were not largely dependent upon the PRC market, were able to adjust to the visa changes and sustain viable businesses which have contributed to the further development of the export education industry. (ELICOS figures indicate that there was a 50 percent increase in enrolments in that sector between 1993 and 1994.)(4) The Government tightened global entry criteria for ELICOS and other non-formal courses of less than twelve months duration in 1989 when it became apparent that large numbers of students were remaining in Australia after completion of their studies or were using educational programs, especially ELICOS, as a means of back door migration.The new visa processing arrangements were introduced in all countries to ensure that bona fide student applications for study in Australia were processed speedily. The new criteria for the entry of genuine students were implemented to enhance Australias multi-million dollar export education industry and to uphold the integrity of Australias immigration policy.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[24]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","Senator Robert Ray","UI4","WA","ALP","N/A","185","—The answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) The options for the disposal of the former HMAS Derwent after being decommissioned on 8 August this year were limited to sale for scrap, or sinking. This was as a result of a series of destructive tests planned by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. The sale for scrap option eventually became non-viable because of the extent of the damage to the ship.(2) The decision to carry out a series of destructive tests on the Derwent hulk was made because the planned disposal date for the Derwent coincided with the Defence Science and Technology proposal to conduct the Ship Survivability Enhancement Program. The program involves not only blasting tests but also fire, smoke, fragmentation and limpet mine damage.(3) The most important asset of the Royal Australian Navy is its personnel. Both the Falklands and the Gulf conflicts showed that the survivability of the ships themselves is critical for the survivability of the crews. In both these conflicts, little-understood secondary effects of weapon strikes significantly exacerbated the effects of the initial `hit. In 1991, the Navy first proposed a series of destructive tests on a recently de-commissioned warship to validate computer models and engineering algorithms with a view to improving the combat survivability of Australian warships. As a result, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation developed the series of destructive experiments currently being performed on the Derwent hulk to collect data to assist the Navy to meet that goal.(4)(a) A variety of disposal options were considered for HMAS Derwent and this included sale as scrap.(b) The option to sell Derwent as scrap was not considered viable as the damage inflicted by the Ship Survivability Enhancement Program will more than likely render the hulk unsafe to undertake a long-term tow on the open ocean to the ship-breakers yards in mainland China or the Indian Sub-Continent.(5) There is always a market for scrap in any configuration and at any time.(6) Equipment required by the Navy has been removed from the Derwent with some removed for sale and/or exhibit purposes by community groups. Sale of ships of this nature and demolition markets are basically confined to mainland China which is paying in the region of $US157—160 per light displacement ton delivered to the Shanghai area under its own power. Ships under 6000 tons light weight are basically not attractive and require payment of an import tariff of 6 percent. Prices quoted from the Indian Sub-Continent are somewhat higher at approximately $US 170—187 per light displacement ton dependent on type and time of delivery.It is an accepted fact that sales to China are on a more reliable cash basis in contrast to the Indian Sub-Continent which requires the sellers to negotiate on the basis of letters of credit payment after the ship has been beached at its point of delivery.On the above quotes it is estimated that the Derwent would attract in the vicinity of $US 330K—350K in revenue if sold for scrap value less costs associated with this option, ie. delivery.(7) Copies of a Feasibility Study and a Development Plan undertaken by the Navy prior to the experimental program are provided. These reports consider the environmental impact of the experimental program as well as a Risk Management Plan. These reports were examined and approved by both the Commonwealth and West Australian Environment Protection Authorities. The Navy has consulted with local, state and federal authorities at each stage of development of this plan. The experiments will be completed on 2 December 1994 and have been extremely successful, providing much valuable scientific data and very realistic training opportunities for the Navy fire-fighting and damage control teams.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[26]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A final overview report of the Australian Living Standards Study (ALSS) project is due to be submitted to the Department of Human Services and Health by the end of the year.(3) A copy of the original contract dated 7 December 1990, with amendments on 1 March 1991 and 30 June 1992 has been provided to the honourable senator.(4) The reports have only recently been received and have not been analysed in sufficient detail to offer a specific summary, however, there are two general findings:there are different advantages and disadvantages which attach to living in different types of areas—inner, middle and outer metropolitan and rural areas. It must be noted that such major costs as housing are greater in inner metropolitan areas and generally less the further one lives from the centre. Also, the further one gets from the centre, access to public transport diminishes, reliance on the private automobile increases, and distances from services and amenities are often greater.For those in outer metropolitan and rural areas, disadvantage to those on lower incomes is reported as more significant than disadvantage arising out of the distance from their homes to essential private and community services.(5) Initial specific-purpose funding by the Commonwealth was agreed in December 1990. Some questionnaire development—including broad consultation with Government agencies, service providers, other researchers—had preceded the agreement for this supplementary funding while further questionnaire design, printing and training of fieldwork supervisors took place in 1991. Fieldwork commenced in 1991. Changes in personnel within Australian Institute of Family Studies and the re-orientation from locality to issue based report delayed work on the project.The contracted reports were completed progressively, with the final six rural topic reports delivered on 31 October 1994.(6) A specific-purpose grant of $1.08 million was provided by the Commonwealth for the Australian Living Standards Study.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[28]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","Senator Gareth Evans","VD4","NSW","ALP","N/A","191","—The answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) My Department has studied the Amnesty International report and noted its concerns about human rights in Hong Kong.We are aware of the debate over how to strengthen institutions to promote and protect human rights in the Territory. This debate should not obscure the fact that Hong Kong is one of the freest societies in the region, where the rule of law operates effectively.The Australian Government considers that adequate provision has been made to safeguard human rights in The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after 1 July 1997 under the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which has international treaty status and has been registered with The United Nations. We consider that the two sovereign powers, which are signatories to the Joint Declaration, have an obligation to ensure that its provisions are fully implemented after the transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China in 1997, including, in particular, the provisions guaranteeing independent judicial power, and rights and freedoms, including those of the person, of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, of strike, of choice of occupation, of academic research and of religious belief ensured by law.We also hope that China will continue to report to the UN annually on human rights and civil liberties in Hong Kong, under the terms of the two human rights covenants, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which extend to Hong Kong, as mentioned in Annex One of the Joint Declaration.(2) China has declared its intention to dismantle the three-tier political structure in Hong Kong as it presently stands, having been modified through legislation passed by Hong Kongs Legislative Council in June this year, and to create an interim legislature in 1997 to ensure continuity in laws, to handle urgent business and to arrange elections for a permanent legislature. We hope that whatever arrangements are made for the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region are democratic and transparent and in accordance with the wishes and interests of the Hong Kong people. The spirit of the Joint Declaration and Chinas 1990 Basic Law in fact encourages building an even more accountable and representative government in Hong Kong over time. China has enshrined these guarantees in its own domestic laws regarding Hong Kong, i.e. the 1990 Basic Law.(3) Australia monitors developments in Hong Kong closely and will continue to do so during the transition period. We have an active dialogue with both sovereign powers on matters relating to Hong Kong and our interests in the Territory. I myself have raised Australian concerns about human rights and political reform issues with senior British and Chinese representatives, as have my Ministerial colleagues and senior Australian officials. China has given assurances that it will meet its obligations under the Joint Declaration.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[31]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","Senator Collins","OF4","SA","ALP","N/A","198","—The answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) No.(2) Yes. There are several instances where rural properties have been connected to the grid when renewable energy power supply systems would have been a cost effective alternative. This is particularly so where rural properties are far removed from the nearest grid lines and/or the electricity requirements of properties are small. For example, the University of New South Wales has estimated that, in many instances, renewable energy power supply systems could represent an economically viable alternative to grid connection for rural households faced with a grid connection cost of more than $15,000. Cost estimates of this nature underpin the Renewable Energy Promotion Program through which the Government has provided $3 million over the past three years to promote the use of commercially viable renewable energy technologies, particularly in rural and remote areas of Australia. Approximately 80 renewable energy displays which will be available for public inspection are being established throughout Australia.(3) I am not aware of the context in which these specific statements were purported to have been made. However, I understand that they may relate to the launch of a book by journalist Gavin Gilchrist entitled The Big Switch—clean energy for the twenty first century. The book contains considerable criticism of officers of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Examination of these criticisms (see, for example, the Hansard report on the Alternative Energy Seminar hosted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies on 28 September 1992) shows that these officers have been selectively quoted. This results in a misleading impression that these officers were not providing balanced advice on the prospects for using renewable energy technologies in Australia.(4) Over the past decade, the US Federal and State Governments have undertaken major energy efficiency programs. They have also put in place regulations for electricity utilities to invest in energy efficiency through what is commonly known as demand side management (DSM) programs. Although the US has benefited economically from implementing many of these measures, recent studies suggest that several of the utility-DSM measures were far from economically viable on their own account. The results of these studies has led to a thorough re-examination of the cost effectiveness of DSM measures in the US, particularly compared with the cost-effectiveness and consequent benefits to the overall economy of government run energy-efficient programs.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[42]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","Senator Schacht","4J4","SA","ALP","N/A","200","—The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senators questions:(1)(a) The Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET), provides assistance for Aboriginal health worker accredited training in two ways. Through the Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program (AESIP), DEET provided a total of $5,265,383 for the period 1990 to 1994. Assistance is also provided through its labour market programs. However, information on assistance provided under labour market programs is notreadily available and to collect and assemble the information required to answer the honourable Senators question would be a major task. I am not prepared to authorise the resources involved in assembling this information solely for the purpose of answering the honourable Senators question. (b) The breakdown of the AESIP funding for the period 1990 to 1994 is Queensland $1,437,203, Western Australia $330,444, Tasmania $15,000 and Northern Territory $3,482,736.(2) ATSICHET has not received any funding for health worker training under AESIP. In late September 1994 ATSICHET submitted a proposal for funding of health worker training. That proposal did not set out the details of the assistance that ATSICHET was seeking from the Commonwealth and DEET has been undertaking discussions with ATSICHET in an attempt to finalise the details of their requirements. However, regardless of the outcomes of those discussions it will not be possible to provide supplementary AESIP funding for the 1995 academic year as all funds have been allocated.(3)(a) Funding for training provided by the Commonwealth to the Northern Territory is provided from three sources: Vocational Education and Training assistance is provided to States and Territories through the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) which is responsible for the actual allocation. In 1994 gross funding from the Commonwealth to the Northern Territory, provided through ANTA, will total $9,990,455. Second, assistance may be provided under labour market programs. The allocation to DEETs Northern Australia Area for the training component of labour market programs in 1994/95 is $18,255,000. Third, assistance is provided through AESIP and the Northern Territory will receive $18,231,950 in 1994. (b) and (c) Allocation of ANTA funding to Batchelor College is a matter for the Northern Territory Education and Training Authority. Direct funding to Batchelor College that can be identified for the period 1990/91 until 1993/94 totals $240,435 under labour market programs. During the same period an amount of $3,482,736 under AESIP was paid as supplementary assistance to Batchelor College through the Northern Territory Department of Education.(4) Information on the level of funding the Department provides directly to Aboriginal medical services for training purposes is not readily available. To collect and assemble the information required to answer the honourable Senators question would be a major task. I am not prepared to authorise the resources involved in assembling this information solely for the purpose of answering the honourable senators question.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[44]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
