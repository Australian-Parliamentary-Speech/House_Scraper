The Appropriation Act and the Appropriation Works and Buildings Act provide for the ordinary services of the current financial year and for the construction of additions, new works, buildings, &c, and the Treasurer will have no need for Supply until the second week in July.

The Government, apparently, are anxious to make the people believe that the deficit on the years undertakings will be less than it would have been if they had not been in power. We shall have no financial statement from the Treasurer, since the financial year will probably not have ended when Parliament is dissolved. The Government, therefore, will be able to go to the country and make all sorts of statements regarding the finances of the year without fear of contradiction. We shall not be in possession of the information necessary to enable us to refute their allegations. They hold the key to the financial situation. The Treasurer should be candid enough, therefore, to tell us now what proportion of the Works and Buildings Estimates remains unexpended. We want to know why certain works for which provision was made in those Estimates have not been carried out. We desire, also, to know when the general election is to take place, and upon what roll it is to be conducted. I appeal to the Treasurer to tell us what reasons he assigned for asking the Governor-General to send down these messages to enable us to appropriate certain sums of money. I do not know whether His Excellency is, in this respect, like a former Governor-General, but I trust that he first looked, as he should do, through the proposals submitted to him. Honorable members desire to know what information the Government gave the Governor-General when they asked for these messages. 1 regret that the Treasurer should have seen fit to propose that the two messages should be discussed practically at the one time. There must be a separate Bill and a separate Resolution in respect of each of them. At a later stage on the motion that you, sir, do now leave the chair and that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply, we shall be able to deal with grievances, and I propose then to give expression to my feelings regarding the way in which public works have been starved by the present Administration. Even during the drought, in the early years of Federation, when we were suffering from great depression, the Departments were not starved as they are to-day. I do not know whether the Treasurer is under the influence of the Attorney-General, or the Prime Minister, but I appeal to him to deal with these two matters separately, so that we may consider them in a legitimate way.","N/A","SUPPLY BILL- SUPPLY (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/speech[1]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is fair to ask the Prime Minister what the Governor-General said when he told the honorable member that he would give him a dissolution of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. . Was there any condition attached to that promise? There was a time in the history of New Zealand when Sir George Grey asked Sir Hercules Robinson, the then Governor, for a dissolution. Sir Hercules wrote a memorandum making certain requests in connexion with the granting of that dissolution, and his last paragraph read -I hope that the Premier, in making his statement to the House, will give my reply in my own words.And, surely we in this House, and the people in the country, are entitled to know from the Prime Minister what the Governor-General said when the honorable gentleman obtained the promise of a double dissolution. It may be said that honorable members on this side are already endeavouring to avoid facing the double dissolution; but, judging from the signs I can see in the political atmosphere, honorable members on the Government side will get the fight of their lives. Never in the history of Australia was there an election such as the forthcoming one will be, and never before were the opponents of the Liberals arrayed before them as they will be when the next appeal to the country takes place. At the risk of even holding up the election for an hour or two, we are entitled to ask thePrime Minister what the Governor-General said, and we want a reply, not in the Prime Ministers paraphrase, but in His Excellencys own words.

If we have the writs issued ten days afterwards and nomination day seven or eight days after that again, and the election twenty-one days after nomination day we shall be brought to the 5th September, but we shall also require at. least a months Supply to cover the period for the return of the writs.

Mr. McLaren said that he could begin to give the Government Printer the rolls during this week, so that wo can practically say that in a months time we may expect to have the New South Wales rolls. Then there is the question of the accuracy of the rolls. It seems to me that, in the circumstances, the better plan would be to make the revision of the printed rolls on supplementary rolls. These would necessarily be a little larger than in ordinary circumstances, because there will not be sufficient time to correct the principal rolls after they are published. There is, however, no reason why every name that is inadvertently put on or taken off rolls that are printed should not be accounted for on supplementary rolls. Whether names are on or off printed rolls, the matter can be put right on supplementary rolls. As to all these matters, I wish to say, right here and now, that the Government will co-operate with the Leader of the Opposition in any way he can suggest, and do anything to facilitate the election being carried out without a tittle of advantage to either side.","DATE OF ELECTION: PRINTING OF ROLLS: URGENT BILLS","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/answer/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There are two painters unions in Sydney. I am informed that there is a federated body registered throughout Australia under the name of the Federated House and Ship Painters Paperhangers and Decorators Employees of Australasia. A disagreement occurred, and the New South Wales branch then registered under the State Act in the name of the Amalgamated House and Ship Painters Paperhangers and Decorators Employees Association of New South Wales. The federated body then formed another branch in New South Wales, which, [ understand, has not yet obtained registration.Yes.Because, in the opinion of the Resident Engineer, his statement of experience was not satisfactory. The reply sent to Smith was on a stereotyped form to the effect that there were no vacancies at present.Under the late Government the Works Branch was instructed to write to or inquire of the Secretary of any Trade Union if any men were required, or if men applied at the office they were asked whether they belonged to a union.No, it is not correct. The Government has no objection to its employes belonging to unions, and throws absolutely no bar in the way of the employment of unionists. The principle of every artisan having an equal opportunity for Government employment is the only innovation it has introduced. An instance of this is the case of the employment of Painter C. York at Jervis Bay mentioned below.The painter in question - C. York - applied for work on 21st April, 1914, nineteen days before S. Smith applied, and, as his statement of experience was satisfactory, he was employed. When applying he did not state whether or not he belonged to a union, and the Resident Engineer did not ask him before employment whether he was a unionist. Painter York took up work, and has continued to work to date. He was not asked whether he belonged to a union until the matter was referred to by the honorable member for West Sydney. It has now been ascertained that York has been a unionist for 15 years.","UNIONISTS ON PUBLIC WORKS","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[21]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

However, I waive that objection now. My reply to the right honorable gentleman is this: I advised His Excellency the Governor-General, in accordance with the provisions of section 57 of the Constitution, to dissolve simultaneously the Senate and the House of Representatives. I assured him that the requirements of the Constitution had been complied with. I pointed out to him the almost equal numbers in the House of Representatives and the small number supporting the Government in the Senate. I pointed out that in consequence the Parliament was unworkable, that it was impossible to manage efficiently the public business, and that, in my opinion, a dissolution of both Houses should be granted. His Excellencys reply was to accede to my request, and to grant an immediate simultaneous dissolution, on. condition that a definite assurance was given that the financial position was such that adequate provision could be made for carrying on the Public Service during the period of time covered by the elections. In reply to that, I reminded His Excellency that adequate provision existed for Supply to the 30th June, and that I proposed, with His Excellencys permission, to inform Parliament of His Excellencys decision, and to at once ask Parliament to make provision - for Supply to cover the election. I also told him that I did not propose to invite the House to do business other than Sup ply, and that as soon as this was granted we should recommend him to prorogue Parliament immediately and proceed at Once to the elections. His Excellency gave mc the desired permission to inform Parliament of his decision to dissolve both Houses, and to prorogue Parliament as soon as adequate provision for Supply had been made.","Dissolution","SUPPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

177,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HUGHES, William Morris","DQC","West Sydney","N/A","N/A",1971,". - The Prime Minister has given what he assures us is au exact statement of what has taken place between him and His Excellency the Governor-General; but we have not heard any of the reasons which must have been supplied to the Governor-General to induce him to take the gravest step yet taken in the history of the Commonwealth. Surely it is not too much to ask for the memorandum which, we understand, was sent to His Excellency, setting forth the constitutional and other grounds for a dissolution of the twoHouses. The Prime Minister says that his relations with the Governor-General are confidential. It is no doubt proper and necessary that these should be confidential ; but this is a matter which touches Parliament vitally. Parliament has rights, and is surely entitled to the fullest information concerning the reasons which induced the Governor-General to grant a double dissolution. Before the Governor-General agreed to do this, he must have required something more than the mere assurance of the Prime Minister that the requirements of section 57 of the Constitution had been fulfilled. The Prime Ministers statement on this particular point is meagre to the point of vacuity. All he tells us is that he advised His Excellent;/, in accordance with the provisions of section 57, to dissolve simultaneously the Senate and the House of Representatives, and that he assured His Excellency that the requirements of the Constitution had been complied with. But surely this is not all! No Governor-General will assent to any Bill until he has received a certificate signed by the Attorney-General that it has been passed by both Houses, and that there are no reasons why he should not assent thereto. Are we to assume that the Governor-General was satisfied, without some definite legal assurance to that effect, that the requirements of section 57 of the Constitution, so far as the Government Preference Prohibition Bill was concerned, were fulfilled. Being a layman, he must have had recourse to legal advice, and to whom would he go for it but to the Attorney-General? Surely a bare statement by the Prime Minister that the conditions of section 57 had been complied with would not suffice to satisfy His Excellency, without precedent, legal training, or even knowledge of the facts to guide him?The Prime Minister says that he does not propose to furnish to the House a copy of the memorandum suggesting reasons why the Governor-General should dissolve Parliament. He says these should be regarded as confidential. Let me remind him that it has been the practice to publish memoranda of this kind. In the Votes and Proceedings of the Victorian Legislative Assembly are to be found various memoranda submitted to Governors, giving reasons for the dissolution of the State Parliament. Keith, in Responsible Government in the Dominions, gives many such cases. Not only has the head of a Government supplied Parliament with the reasons which he furbished to a Governor for a course that he desired to be taken, but Governors have been called upon to furnish, and have furnished, memoranda of the kind. I am unable, on the spur of the moment, to quote particular cases; but every one knows the outcry in the press of Australia, so recently as the other day, when, the Governor of Tasmania having refused a dissolution to Mr. Solomon, and having then granted it to Mr. Earle, the correspondence between him and Mr. Solomon was not forthcoming, having been destroyed, or, at any rate, not being on the file. It is surely suggestive, as. showing how widely the attitude of the press in that case differs from its present attitude.In any case, the question of whether or not the publication of such correspondence is sanctioned by precedent is not very much to the point. It is not so much whether it has been done as whether it ought to be done. The dissolution of the Senate is itself without precedent. For we have to remember that the Senate is an integral part of the Constitution. It baa rights co-ordinate with those of this branch of the Legislature. It acted strictly in accordance with those rights, and for doing so it is to be dissolved. We want to know why. We have a right to know. The Treasurer has furnished the House and the country with admirable reasons why that course should not have been pursued. Had he, instead of the honorable member for Parramatta, been at the head of the Government, the Senate would not have been dissolved.","Dissolution","SUPPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

181,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HUGHES, William Morris","DQC","N/A","N/A","N/A",1972,"- Section 57 was drafted to meet a real dead-lock on national questions. I call attention to the fact that the Government Preference Prohibition Bill was introduced with the deliberate purpose of creating a deadlock. The Bill does not deal with a vital question, it deals with a dead one. The thing it proposes to do has been already done. Yet the Senate has been dis solved. It is most material, therefore, that we should have the recital of the facts put before the Governor-General in order that we may know whether His Excellency was correctly informed as to what the facts were. I am perfectly persuaded that on an impartial review of section 57 no Court would say that the Senate ought to be dissolved in such circumstances. Let me put this to the Attorney-General : Supposing he had to argue before a Court - if such a thing were possible - whether the action of the Governor-General was or was not constitutional, would he, for one moment, expect the Court to believe that, under section 57, the Senate, which was created as the foundation of the Federal system, must be dissolved because it had thrown out a petty measure that it was invited to throw out? No Court would so hold. It is, consequently, most material that we should know the terms of the memorandum to the Governor-General in order that we and the country may learn whether His Excellency has been correctly advised in this matter. In the very nature of things, His Excellency could not be familiar with the facts, except upon information given to him by his Advisers. He had not the advantage of being a resident here for any length of time, and of knowing the facts firsthand. He had to take everything as it was stated to him. It is clear that when it is to the advantage of a party that the Senate shall be dissolved, and when it is the avowed intention of that party to create a dead-lock which will technically satisfy section 57, the reasons, which that party furnished to His Excellency in support of the request for a double dissolution should be available to the Parliament. I hope that the Prime Minister will furnish us with those reasons. If he declines to do so, we must assume that they will not bear public examination. If they were sound, if they will bear examination, why should he hesitate to lay them on the table, and to let us see what they are? The provisions of section 57 have been abused in order that party interests may be served. The scope of section 57 is qualified by other sections of the Constitution. The Constitution as a whole must be looked at. The section cannot be taken as standing by itself. It has- reference to the Senate, and to the powers of the Senate under, the Constitution. It has reference not to a deadlock created by one party to serve a party interest, but to a dead-lock between two branches of the Legislature: the one representing the States, and the other the people as such. It has reference to a real dead-lock - an actual stoppage of public business. But in this case there is no dead-lock, no stoppage. On the contrary, indeed; for no sooner had the Government Preference Prohibition Bill been rejected than proposed legislation was showered on . the table. No fewer than five Bills, I think, were introduced after the summary rejection of this measure by the Senate a second time. How could there be a dead-lock when it was proposed to go on with all this legislation? It was not until the so-called dead-lock had been reached - and reached by deliberately withholding and blocking necessary legislation - that the Government commenced to go on with the work of legislating in the interests of the country. How could there be a dead-lock in such circumstances? And how could the Governor-General, if he was supplied with a full and detailed statement of the facts,, say that a dead-lock within the meaning of section 57 had been reached ? In these circumstances, it is obvious that this Parliament has a right to see the reasons submitted to His Excellency. We shall want something more than a mere capitulation about the practice being to treat all communications with His Excellency as confidential, or any other mediaeval doctrine, to satisfy us. We want to see the reasons themselves. I hope that the Government will supply us with those reasons. I hope that the Attorney-General will enable us to understand the extent to which his advice was sought, and the nature of that advice. These things are very material. We must suppose, in view of the difficulty that a layman feels in the face of section 57, that neither the Governor-General nor the Prime Minister was capable of giving a satisfactory interpretation to it, and I hesitate to believe that the Governor- General would have acted if it had not been upon the advice and the assurance, in writing, of the Attorney-General himself.Mr. W. H. IRVINE (Flinders- At member for West Sydney has put forward what I believe to be an entirely new view of the relation of Cabinet Ministers to the Governor-General. He has stated the proposition that upon the demand, of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, Ministers, who., on taking office, enter into relations of the most absolute confidence, and subscribe to the oath of secrecy as to every communication that is made, are bound to tell the House the substance and the exact details of the advice which they have tendered to. the Governor-General. That is a position which has never been put forward in any representative House in the British Dominions.","Dissolution","SUPPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I must remind honorable members of one important fact. Those who have read the reports of the debates at the Convention will know that the provision embodied in clause 57, for enabling, in certain circumstances, both Houses of the Parliament, which was then being created, to be sent to the electors, was a condition which formed part of a general bargain between the larger and the smaller States. Without it, the larger States, as appears from every page of the report of the debates at the Convention, would not for a moment have assented to the principle of equal representation in the Senate. It was stipulated as a condition upon the right of equal representation in the Senate being given that if, as was inevitable, certain difficulties arose between the two Houses, thus differently constituted, there should be an appeal from those differences to the electors by both Houses. That was embodied in the Constitution for the express purpose of giving a constitutional appeal to this House, which represents the whole of the people, against the decision of aHouse rejecting its advice, which represents the people, not according to numerical proportions, but according to State divisions.","Dissolution","SUPPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Another argument put forward by one of the leaders of the Labour party in another place was that this section related only to financial measures.","Dissolution","SUPPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member for West Sydney went on to point out -This point needs special emphasis. There seems to be good reason for the opinion that in the present case this fact has been ignored, or has been ingeniously glozed over by the legal advisers to the Crown.What right had the honorable member to say that? He knew nothing. He did not know whether the legal adviser of the Government had given any advice to the Governor-General -A supposed analogy between the powers and basis of the House of Lords and the Senate, and of those reasons which afford sufficient grounds for granting a single dissolution, have apparently been considered sufficient, but the rights and liabilities of the Senate are determined, not by the traditional relationship between the Commons and Lords of Great Britain, nor by expediency, but by the terms of a written document.The honorable members argument is that it is entirely false and wrong to suppose the same principles to apply in the granting of a double dissolution under this section as had been applied in connexion with a dissolution of the House of Commons. But I find that no longer ago than the 17th April, 1914, the same honorable member, speaking on the Address-in-Reply, said this -Section 57 was passed to deal with deadlocks legitimately arising on great questions between the Houses. As to the position of the Governor-General in this regard, my contention is that, as to a double dissolution, the Governor-General will be guided by exactly the same reasons as in an ordinary dissolution in the Lower House.The honorable member had forgotten his own argument when he rushed into print with an entirely new one. In the latter he went on to say -And this must be interpreted according to its spirit, and always with the presumption that, as the Constitution is based upon the equal legislative rights of the Senate, so any doubts as to the powers of the Governor-General under section 57 must be resolved in favour of that presumption, and so against a dissolution of the Senate. As to the question of expediency, the same may be said.What does that mean? I will read it again, and show how I read it, and I challenge the honorable member to say whether his argument can bear any other construction.And this - referring to the written document or Constitution - must be interpreted according to its spirit, and always with the presumption -What presumption? that as the Constitution is based upon the equal legislative rights of the Senate, so any doubts as to the powers of the Governor-General under section 57 must be resolve.I in favour of that presumption - the presumption that the Constitution is based upon the equal legislative rights of the Senate - and so against a dissolution of the Senate. That entirely confirms the view which the honorable member put forward before, that so long as the Senate is acting within its constitutional rights, there can be no double dissolution.","Dissolution","SUPPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I can tell the Attorney-General that in the very State from which he comes, Victoria, the whole of the correspondence that took place between Sir Thomas Bent and Sir Thomas Gibson -Carmichael was published.

Tonight the Attorney-General has endeavoured to show that what the Convention had in mind when framing the Constitution was a dead-lock between the two Houses in a merely casual way. I do not hesitate to say, however, that any one who reads the Convention debates on this section must come to the conclusion that it was never meant that one party or the other should create dead-locks. When Mr. Wise, in the Convention, moved an amendment that there should be a single dissolution instead of a double one, Sir Edmund Barton pointed out that the only likely cause of a dead-lock had been removed by the Constitution, inasmuch as tacking by the House of Representatives was debarred, while the Senate was prohibited from initiating money Bills.","Dissolution","SUPPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[21]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I can imagine that a Government which felt itself somewhat weak, or which thought that the occasion was an opportune one for an appeal to the country, might encourage a conflict rather than try to avoid it, in order that in this way it might be able to recommend a dissolution of both Houses in the hope that that would strengthen their followingThat is exactly what is taking place at the present time - or, at any rate, give it more time.

The newspapers favorable to the Government will at once begin to threaten the Upper House that if they do not pass the measure they will be dissolved.

During the same debate in the Federal Convention, Sir Edmund Barton said -  Dead-lock  is not a term which is strictly applicable to any case except that in which the constitutional machine is prevented from properly working. I am in very grave doubt whether the term can be strictly applied to any case except the stoppage of legislatives machinery arising out of conflict upon the finances of the country. A stoppage which arises on any matter of ordinary legislation, because the two Houses cannot come to an agreement at first, is not a thing which is properly designated by the term  dead-lock  -These are the words of the leader of the Convention -  Australias noblest son, as I am reminded - who was thought so much of that he was made first Prime Minister, and was afterwards given a seat on the Bench of the High Court. Sir Edmund Barton further said - because the working of the Constitution goes on - the constitutional machine proceeds notwithstanding a disagreement. It is only when the fuel of the machine of government is withheld that the machine of government comes to a stop, and that fuel is money.It will be seen that Sir Edmund Barton took the point that there is no dead-lock until the whole machinery of government has been stopped, and that this can be brought about only by the stoppage of Supply - the very view to which the Attorney-General to-night took such strong exception. I do not attempt to question the legal knowledge of the Attorney-General, but I refer him to the words of Sir Edmund Barton. The present situation has been brought about by means of a measure of no importance, whether it be passed or rejected, because the Government have already declared that there shall be no preference to unionists. No one accused honorable members opposite of favoring preference to unionists. What, then, was the need for an Act of Parliament to prohibit it? Was it necessary to assure the country of the views of the Liberal party on the subject? Was it thought that the people did not believe Liberal members when they said that they did not favour preference? Or did honorable members desire to advertise themselves, and to pass the measure as a monument to their wonderful intelligence? This is what Sir William McMillan said, speaking at the Convention -I do say that if you create any machinery which, under the guise of settling dead-locks, will really be used to create dead-locks, you will strike a blow absolutely at the power and dignity of the Senate.Sir George Turner also expressed himself in this way -I am quite in accord with those who say that wc are not to allow one House to dominate the other unless we know that particular House has the people at its back, and that in endeavouring to force certain views upon the other Chamber, that House is simply carrying out what is really the will and desire of the people of the Federation.Sir Josiah Symon, referring to the double dissolution, said -If it exercises that function, you are to give it credit for honesty and bona fides. If it is still out of harmony with the Lower House, let the Lower House go to their constituents with whom the Upper House says the House of Representatives was not in harmony. If the members of the House of Representatives come back from their constituents with the mandate for that particular piece of legislation, this Senate, like every other Second Chamber, will be bound to give way. If the Senate does not give way, then I say, at once and unhesitatingly, send it to its constituencies.","Dissolution","SUPPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[25]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In Victoria, a measure dealing with the franchise was rejected by the Upper House nearly a dozen times, and the legislation of the Lower Houses has been similarly treated by Upper Houses in all the States. But do we hear the Liberals advocate the dissolution of the Legislative Councils of the Parliaments of the States? No. Liberals do not do that, because these Councils are composed of men of their own way of thinking politically; of representatives of vested interests. Their members are the landed proprietors, and big capitalists, against whom the members of the Liberal party have not the courage to say a word, because it is they who support the party, and gi-ve to its members their political significance. But while Liberals are not prepared to attack the Legislative Councils for opposing the will of the Lower Houses of the State Parliaments, they are very ready to attack the Senate for opposing the will of this House. That is because the Senate represents the working classes of Australia. The one desire of honorable members opposite is to strengthen their party by hook or by crook. I do not find fault with them for that, but they had no right to drag in the Governor-General, and to bring Federal politics into the political mire by violating every constitutional principle and right.

The Prime Minister in his statement admitted that there was other correspondence which he does not feel it would be proper for him to disclose. What is the reason for withholding that correspondence? Is it that there was something placed before the Governor-General which was not exactly as it should be, and which would have a tendency to mislead him ? Or is it that the Government do not intend to allow their reasons to be placed before the public? Are those reasons of such a shaky character that they are afraid to let the public know what they are? I very much regret that the Ministry have not given us full and complete information in regard to this matter. We want it, and the sooner we get it the better it will be for all concerned. At the earliest possible moment, the Ministry should place before us the whole of the correspondence which has passed between them and His Excellency the Governor-General upon this question. There is no reason why that course should not be followed. I hold in my hand the Votes and Proceedings for the 1909 session of the Victorian Parliament, in which the whole of the correspondence between the Governor of this State at that time - Sir Thomas Gibson Carmichael - was published . I merely cite this fact as an argument in support of my contention that the correspondence between the present Government and the Governor-General in regard to the request of the Prime Minister for a double dissolution is not sacred. Why was it necessary to publish the documents to which I have referred ? For exactly the same reasons as operate in the present circumstances.","Dissolution","SUPPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[33]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I did not for a moment believe that when the test measures were sent to the other Chamber they would be sent to a body of men who were so unacquainted with our written Constitution that they could not see clearly that a double dissolution would be granted if those measures were rejected a second time. But the position was so absolutely clear that fifteen years ago the prediction was made by the present Treasurer as to what would happen in such circumstances. Now that that prediction has been fulfilled, the members of another place seem to be quite unaware of the discussions which took place in the Federal Convention at the time section 57 of our Constitution was being framed. The right honorable member said that only a technical difference would be required between the two Houses, and then if advice was tendered by the Prime Minister for the time being to the Governor-General to grant a double dissolution, either that advice must be accepted or the Prime Minister must resign. In the latter case there would be an abdication of the powers of members of this House at the dictation of another House. I am sure if the boot were on the other foot honorable members opposite would not argue that position for a moment. I cannot conceive of there being twenty-nine Liberal senators so destitute of common sense as to act in the way that the present Senate has acted, but if there had been twenty-nine Liberal senators who had acted in the same unconstitutional way-","Dissolution","SUPPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not wish to make any reflection on the want of intelligence of honorable senators; perhaps they acted according to their fullest lights, but nobody will say that those lights were very wise ones. In fact, they seem rather comparable with the foolish virgins. The Attorney-General quoted from the statement of the honorable member for West Sydney that appeared in the papers last Saturday. If he had only read the same honorable members utterance that appeared the day before he would have seen how the honorable member himself foresaw that a situation had been created in which, in his opinion, the Governor-General could grant a double dissolution. He did not go so far as to say whether he should, or should not, but on the day before he knew whether a dissolution was to take place or not, he uttered the following words -Either Mr. Cook does not understand the position of the Ministry created by the recent summary rejection of the Preference Prohibition Bill, or, understanding, he is ignoring it. But it is a position that cannot and will not be ignored. It calls for action, and that immediately. Let me state the position shortly.The idea that the Parliament can go on with the threat of a double dissolution hanging perpetually over its head is unthinkable. It is also absurd. Section 57 provides a solution for dead-locks. The principle underlying the section is that the legislative machine having been brought to a standstill by disagreement between the two Houses upon some matter of such grave importance as to make further progress impossible, a double dissolution may, if His Excellency pleases, be granted. The essence of the whole tiling is that, legislation being impossible, an appeal to the electors must follow.He then went on to say that, if Mr. Cook liked to delay, the position would be entirely changed, and added -The provisions of section 57 having been technically satisfied - (1 do not even admit this) - the Government may ask for a double dissolution. True, they may ask; but only if they do so at once.Did not the Government do so at once ? Are they not accused now of doing it at once? He went on to say -And on this point there can be no doubt at all. The situation having been created, it must be at once resolved one way or another. Inaction is fatal in the matter.I quite agree with the honorable member -But in the meantime the right to ask for a double dissolution on the first test Bill is lost. And such a position is in accord with common sense. Time is the essence of the contract. Even if Parliament would allow Mr. Cook to hold this threat over its head indefinitely, the section would not allow it.And here are very important words, uttered after careful consideration by an honorable member who has just given us a dissertation the other way -Therefore, either Mr. Cook must summon up enough courage to ask for a double Absolution at once, or must for ever hold his peace.That statement by the honorable member was a complete answer to his letter of the following day. He has refuted his argument out of his own mouth. When honorable members opposite cheered the other day on hearing that a double dissolution had been granted, it appears now it was only a sham cheer - another instance of bluff. I did not want to hear it, and I confess that I did not cheer. When they cheered I really began to wonder how many sensible men there were in the House except myself. If a body of men are in such a state of mental confusion that they do not even know the plain words of the Constitution, and act in such a manner as to force a double dissolution, it does not lie in the mouths of members on the other side, or in another place, to complain of it when they get it. They asked for it, and now they are howling because they have got it. They do not like the taste of it.","Dissolution","SUPPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I admit that I was one of those who suggested that some such proposal should be brought forward ; but I went much further. I suggested that the test should be not only as to preference in the Government service, but as to preference anywhere - in the Courts or otherwise. I hold that no Parliament has the right, under laws, to grant preference to any citizen, but that every citizen ought to be able to go before the High Court of justice of his country, as Parliament should be, and get a fair field and no favour. That principle is being entirely departed from. The provision I suggested ran as follows: -Notwithstanding anything contained in the Arbitration Act, no Court or Judge shall grant preference to any citizen or class of citizens.That was plain, short, and simple; but, with a consideration for the feelings of members opposite which seemed to me at the time to be very weak, the Ministry met them more than half-way. They first brought forward the ordinary business, and some time afterwards brought forward the Bill, saying, We will put this so mildly that even the most extreme man amongst them can accept it if he likes. If the Senate intends to let us do any business at all, surely it will accept a mild proposal of this sort. The Bill absolutely tested the sincerity of honorable members opposite as to whether they intended to allow any legislation to go through. Honorable members on the other side had boasted that they would take advantage of their numerical majority in the Senate, and not allow legislation to go through. We tried the Bill in this House first, and it was soon plain that there was no intention to let legislation go on. A mild and moderate Bill, providing that no preference should be granted in the Government service was brought forward; but the other side considered it so important that they discussed it day and night. Although one or two of them said it was not a serious Bill, the opinion of nine out of every ten in the party was against that view. They considered it so serious that they continued to discuss it for day after day, and week after week. It was sent up to another place, which summarily rejected it. It was brought forward again this session, passed by this House, and again sent up to another place, where it was rejected without a moments consideration. It was treated in the way in which we were told Labour senators would treat all legislation brought forward by the Liberal party. In the circumstances, what other course was open to our party but to ask for a double dissolution ? Every requirement of section 57 of the Constitution had been complied with. We had the opinion of the honorable member for West Sydney, who was Attorney-General in the Labour Government - an opinion given as late as Friday last - that everything had been done to create the required situation under section 57. I cannot understand how the honorable member was able tonight to go back upon that expression of opinion, unless it was that he thought that the public would remember only the last and not the first statement made by him on the question, or that they would not imagine that any public man would be so lost to what was due to himself as to say one thing one day and something quite different a day or two later. He also thought, perhaps, that the speech which he delivered to-night would be published in Hansard, and read by thousands who would not see his first statement as published in the Melbourne newspapers.","Dissolution","SUPPLY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He would seem to be more indifferent as to what he says than I at first imagined him to be. The honorable member for Kennedy, another member of the Labour party, has pointed out that this situation was foreseen years ago. Surely, in the circumstances, everything has been done to justify the granting of a double dissolution. Let us test the situation by changing the position of parties. If there were twenty-nine Liberal senators, whilst the Labour party had a majority of one in this House, does any one imagine for a moment that in the event of the Senate twice rejecting legislation passed by this House, and the right honorable member for Wide Bay advising the Governor-General to grant a double dissolution, his advice would not be followed. There is no doubt about the matter. The position of the Prime Minister for the time being, no doubt, is made all-powerful, but I have not heard of any case in which advice tendered to the Governor-General by the late Ministry was rejected. They cannot quote an instance. I was surprised to hear the honorable member for Kennedy, who has occupied the position of Speaker, advocating the publication of all documents.

There is not one instance in which the correspondence between the Governor-General and the Government for the time being has been published. In 1904, Mr. J. C. Watson, the first Labour Prime Minister, advised His Excellency to grant a single dissolution, but he never dreamt of publishing the correspondence. Again, in 1909, when the right honorable member for Wide Bay, Mr. Fisher, suggested a dissolution, he did not dream of publishing the correspondence which passed between himself and the Governor-General. What is more, no one on this side had the bad taste to suggest that the parliamentary procedure which had so long been followed should be departed from by the publication of the correspondence. There must be absolute confidence between the Governor-General and the Government, and between the Governors of the various States and the State Cabinets.

He is responsible for the advice given, and must accept the blame foric, if there is any blame to be attached to it. The honorable member for West Sydney has admitted that section 57 had been fully complied with. If the position had been the other way about - if the Liberals had been in the majority in the Senate, and the Labourparty had had a majority of one in this House, would not honorable members opposite have said that the Governor-General was acting as a partisan if in similar circumstances he refused a request for a double dissolution ? And they would have had some ground for such a statement. What becomes of the bold utterances on the part of honorable members on the other side, and in another place, too, that they were anxious by every means in their power to obtain a dissolution? Is it true all those utterances were made with a view to deceive the electors? Is it true that the members of the Labour party distrust the good sense of the people, and do not now want to go before the country ? Quite recently they were ranting and raving to us about the good sense of the people; but now it appears that they are rather fearful of an appeal to the people,, and if I am a judge of public opinon, judgment will be passed upon the unscrupulous opposition they have shown to the Liberal party proceeding with its legislation on very much more fruitful and sounder lines. Do not let us hear again from honorable members these fearsome grumbles against having to face a double dissolution. The request has been granted, and nothing can get over that fact. We have to make the best of the position.

That is wrong advice to give to the public, because it is not in the power of a State Parliament to deal with the matter consistently with the interests of the country. If there are natural advances in the price of products, those advances, especially in a country of primary production, are of great advantage to the people in it.
