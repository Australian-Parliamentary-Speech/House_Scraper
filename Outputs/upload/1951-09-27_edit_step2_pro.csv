I understand that a vise was either refused or withheld until it was too late for Professor Oliphant to attend the conference, although ample notice of his intention to visit the United States of America was given. I ask the Minister, first, whether the facts of the case came to his knowledge or to the knowledge of the Department of Immigration? Secondly, what does the Minister consider to be the duty of the. department for the protection of Australian citizens who wish to visit other countries for lawful reasons against the slur involved in apparent refusal or deliberate delaying of the issue of a vise? Thirdly, if the Minister is not aware of the circumstances himself, will he ascertain whether any official of the Australian Government took any part whatever in the refusal to issue a vise to Professor Oliphant, an action which has tended to injure Australia in the eyes of the world. I ask him whether officials, not only of his own department, but of any other department, such as the Department of External Affairs, were consulted on the withholding of this vise?","PROFESSOR MARCUS OLIPHANT","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Our only information has been that which has been contained in reports in the press. No application or request, so far as I am aware, has reached my department. It certainly has not reached me, nor, to the best of my knowledge, has it reached the Minister for External Affairs. The honorable member has asked what action can be taken to protect Australian citizens in these circumstances. This is a matter for determination entirely by the United States Government which alone decides whether it will issue a vise to persons who seek to visit the United States of America. Prom time to time in the past, when episodes of thissort have occurred, the citizen affected has made representations to my department, or to the Minister for External Affairs, or even to the Prime Minister, and have asked for intervention. In suchcases it has been the practice from time to time to make such representations when the government of the day considered it proper to do so. I am certain that if Professor Oliphant had made any such request to us it would have been given speedy and full consideration. The right honorable member asked further whether I could give an assurance that no action was taken by the Government or any department of the Commonwealth which would have brought about the refusal of a vise to Professor Oliphant. On such knowledge as I have I do not know of any action which was taken in my department or in any other department which would have had this effect. To the best of my knowledge the Government departments were not consulted, and took no step in the matter.

Every State in Australia, except the two Labourgoverned States of New South Wales and Queensland, agreed to that increase being paid to the farmer through an increase in the retail price. The Governments of New South Wales and Queensland have deliberately refrained from allowing the dairy farmer to recoup his costs of production, and by the abuse of their pricefixing powers are preventing the farmer from getting a just price.","DAIRYING","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The plan provides for the Commonwealth to undertake to fix such a price to the farmer at the factory door, as is determined by the Joint Dairy Industry Advisory Committee. If the States care to use their powers to fix the price of the commodity from the factory door to the retailer, that is their proper function. The Government submitted this plan to the six State Governments and asked for their approval. The governments of Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania signified their agreement and, in each of those States, the price of butter has now been increased so as to return to the farmer a fair price based on the found cost of production. New South Wales and Queensland are standing out from the plan.

Do they differ only about the methods by which the payment should be made ? Is it further a fact that, if the price charged to the consumer were increased to the amount that has been determined as the cost of production, the basic wage would rise by about 2s. a week? If those are facts, will the Government cause an inquiry to be made in order to ascertain, first, the price that would have to be charged to the consumer in order to return by that means a fair price to the farmer, and, secondly, the probable effect upon the basic wage of the payment of the desired increase to the farmer by means of subsidy. Will the Government disclose the result of the in quiry to the House so as to show whether an increase of the return to the farmer by means of an increase of subsidy would prevent such a substantial basic wage rise as would occur, with consequent further inflationary effects, as the result of increasing the price to the consumer?","DAIRYING","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/question[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
16,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ANTHONY, Hubert","JLZ","N/A","N/A","N/A",143,"- There was originally a disagreement among the States concerning the method that should be used to provide dairy-farmers with a fair return based upon the found cost of production. At the outset, some of the State governments requested that this Government should find an amount equivalent to 3 1/2d. per lb. Finally, as I have said previously, Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania agreed to find the full -amount of the proposed increase. In the early stages, the Government of New South Wales refused to find even Id. per lb. It completely disowned the farmer and declared that it would not grant any price increase. The Queensland Government said that it would go so far as to grant an increase of 6d. per lb. but that this Government should find the remainder of the amount that would be needed. The fact is that, since this Government has been in office, it has increased the subsidy payment on butter from 6d. per lb. to ls. lid. per lb. This has increased the annual total of the subsidy from £6,000,000 to £16,800,000. Therefore, the Government says that it has gone far enough and that the burden of any further increase should be borne by the consumers.","DAIRYING","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/answer[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

During July, 1950, 1,092 tons of butter was exported, compared with 260 tons during July of this year. In August, 1950, 1,583 tons was exported, compared with 40 tons in August of this year.

It is a fact that the 4.5-in. guns of the destroyer Anzac which demolished the Communist coastal battery recently were made in Australia, and I am pleased to have this opportunity of paying tribute to the skill of Australian engineers and artisans who produced weapons of such deadly efficiency. I do not think it is generally known that both the 4.5-in. guns and mountings with which Anzac is fitted, were made at our government ordnance factories. They were, in fact, the  first off  last year and represent a remarkable Australian engineering achievement. When the  first off  were officially handed over last year to the Minister for the Navy by my colleague the present Minister for Supply, the First Naval Member, Admiral Sir John Collins, remarked that the Holden car achievement was a simple straightforward piece of work in comparison with the production of the 4.5-in. guns and their automatic twin mountings. We are producing these new types of guns . and mountings simultaneously with the United Kingdom. The first ship scheduled to be commissioned, Tobruk, was to be fitted with British 4.5-in. guns, as the United Kingdom had promised earlier delivery. However, the British guns did not work well on being fitted to Tobruk, so Anzac, equipped with Australian-made guns that were satisfactory from the start, went first into action. It is these Australian-made 4.5-in. guns, which figured in the ceremony last year, that answered so accurately to the ships gunners when Anzac went into its first action against the Communist coastal battery.","ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I mate that statement, not to criticize my predecessor, but to show that I fully endorsed his proposals. The officers of my department and I regard the two conventions which have been held as being of the greatest value to the successful conduct of our immigration programme. The total expenditure on such conventions is not great. It is a matter of a few thousand pounds, the greater part of which is incurred in the payment of fares to government instrumentalities and of accommodation costs in Canberra itself. So, there is no excessive use of resources which are in short supply in the community. In the production of goodwill and of voluntary effort, itself an* indispensable factor in a successful assimilation programme, the conventions have proved of the greatest value indeed. I do not understand the reference by the honorable member for Brisbane to conventions which have been held in the various States, because I am able to inform him that, so far as I am aware, no citizenship conventions have been held other .than in Canberra, and, certainly, no substantial expenditure on similar functions has been incurred by the Commonwealth.

Does the Government propose either to request the United States Government to take over Manus Island or other islands in the South- West Pacific as air bases, or to set up its own operational bases to defend the northern approaches to Australia? It is a matter of very great concern to the people of Australia and also, I suggest, to our allies that we have no South- West Pacific Island bases capable of accommodating modern bomber and jet-fighter aircraft.","SOUTH-WEST PACIFIC","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[6]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As a result, I venture to believe that in spite of the shortness of my visits, it was possible to obtain a cross section of opinion which has helped me greatly to form a balanced judgment of the various problems of the area as a whole.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/para[17]","N/A","N/A"

That would take far too long and, in any event, is hardly necessary. I shall try, however, to sum up my main impressions and conclusions because I believe that it is important to take them into account if Australian foreign policy is to be realistic and objective. The most vivid impression of my trip is that of the intensity of the political problems which exist in South-East Asia. All of the countries of the area are pre-occupied with the difficult task of maintaining their independence, in most instances only recently achieved. It should be remembered that the following formidable list of countries was controlled by European nations before the war is India, Pakistan,. Ceylon, Indonesia, Indo-China, the Philippines. Korea was controlled by Japan. In many cases those countries are still trying to recover from the .devastation and chaos caused by the war with Japan. The Japanese occupation and subsequent withdrawal greatly increased the speed with which nationalist movements moved towards complete independence. Occupation by Japan cut immediate ties with the past, while Japanese withdrawal provided weapons for large numbers of people, many of whom during the war period had become accustomed to guerilla warfare. There would have been much dislocation in the countries of South-East Asia, even if no such thing as Communist imperialism existed. In fact, of course, the problems of reconstruction and of maintenance of political stability were made infinitely more difficult because international communism saw a golden opportunity to take advantage of the distress, chaos and general unsettlement caused by the last war. By pretending to espouse the cause of nationalism, communism hoped to break quickly the control of the old  colonial  powers. By maintaining and increasing economic chaos, communism could hope to secure, through its own disciplined minority, early control of governments. As a result, the tasks of the vast majority of the peoples of the area, who, I believe, are non-Communist in sentiment, was made infinitely more difficult. Moreover, the success of the Communist regime in China in securing control of the mainland of China with extraordinary speed during the post-war years substantially affected the attitude of mind of the large Chinese populations of South-East Asia. Many of these Chinese began to fear that Chinese communism might well penetrate throughout the whole of the area, particularly if urgent political, military and economic help from the great non-Communist countries of the west was not forthcoming. Indeed, it is something of a miracle that in Indonesia, Malaya, Indo-China, Thailand, Burma and the Philippines, nonCommunist governments remain in power. This is due, I believe, in large degree to the momentous decision of the United Nations to resist armed aggression in Korea. If South Korea had fallen to the North Koreans without a blow I find it difficult to believe that all the countries of South-East Asia which I have just mentioned would still have non-Communist governments in control.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/para[18]","N/A","N/A"

Without this large-scale American aid, it is certain that the countries in the area would have found it much more difficult to maintain their stability and independence. If the difficult circumstances of the war years and the postwar years in South-East Asia were properly understood, Australians would, I believe, be far less critical than they sometimes are of present conditions in some of the countries to our near north. New governments have had to be established, new administrative machines built up, production re-organized and markets found. All this had to be done amongst people many of whose lives had become completely unstable during the war years and some of whom had become accustomed to the use of force as trained guerillas. In the light of the situations that have existed in the countries of South-East Asia, I believe, if I may say so, that they have done very well indeed in all the circumstances.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/para[19]","N/A","N/A"

It will be remembered that early in 1951 United Nations forces in Korea were being subjected to very heavy Communist attacks and there was some degree of uncertainty about whether a stable line could be held. The present position is vastly better. United Nations forces stand for the most part north of the 38th parallel and have shown their ability to hold a line and inflict heavy casualties on the enemy.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/para[20]","N/A","N/A"

However, after a visit by General Juin, the French Government sent to Indo-China as High Commissioner General De Lattre de Tassigny with whom I had the opportunity of long discussions in Saigon. General De Lattre is a remarkable personality who has succeeded in very substantially improving the military situation in Indo-China. It is now reasonably certain that the democratic forces in Indo-China can withstand the present scale of Communist Viet Minh attacks in the vital Tonking Delta area in the north. If the Chinese Communists were to come south and invade Indo-China in strength, a different situation would arise, in which probably United Nations action alone would be effective. Again, the Philippines campaign against the Communist Huks has achieved much greater success in recent months largely, it appears, due to the efforts of the new Philippines Minister for Defence, Mr. Magsaysay. While I would not in any way wish to minimize the difficulties which, still remain to be overcome in South-East Asia as a whole, E think that it is important for us to understand that there has been in the countries mentioned a noticeable improvement during the last six to nine months.

I believe that the realization of this particular point was probably the most important single result of my trip. If Indo-China and Burma were lost to the Communists - indeed if either of them was lost - Thailand would be immediately outflanked and it would be difficult if not impossible for Thailand successfully to resist heavy Communist pressure unless very substantial help were afforded it from without. If Thailand were lost to the Communists, the large export surplus of Siamese rice which is important for Malaya and many of the countries would cease to be available. In other words, the internal position in Malaya could deteriorate substantially even before any question of direct military aggression against Malaya from the north arose. Australia has always shown a special interest in the situation in Malaya, with good reason, as the last war showed. It seems to me only logical that Australia must pay greater attention to developments in areas to the north of Malaya on which the security of Malaya may well substantially depend. If SouthEast Asia and Malaya fell to the Communists, the position in Indonesia would become much less secure and inevitably the security of Australia itself would be directly imperilled.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/para[23]","N/A","N/A"

It. is proposed to make payments to the States for this purpose on the same conditions as have applied in previous years. The Commonwealth agreed to reimburse to the States the administrative cost of controls over prices, rents and land sales when responsibility for these controls was assumed by them in 1948. The arrangement has been continued each year. The States have since relinquished control over land sales, but are still exercising controls over prices and rents.The Australian Government has been asked to extend the financial arrangement concerning these controls for a further year. It has agreed to do so in order that their administration will not be hampered by financial considerations. As has been  the case in previous years, the bill provides for the making of periodical advances to the States, which will be adjusted upon the submission of audited statements of expenditure after the close of the year. Under this arrangement, expenditure amounted to £703,596 last year and is estimated at £819,000 in 1951-52.Debate (on motion by Dr. Evatt) adjourned.","Second Reading","STATES GRANTS (ADMINISTRATION OF CONTROLS REIMBURSEMENT) BILL 1951","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The scheme was basically designed to help an ex-serviceman of moderate means to obtain his own home. Between then and the 30th June, 1951, 75,500 homes have been provided for ex-servicemen, at a total cost of £86,S74,000. For record purposes, it is interesting to note that 37,385 homes had been provided by the 30th June, 1940. From 1940 to 1945, during the war years, there was naturally a reduction of activities, but from the 1st July, 1945, to the 30th June, 1951, no fewer than 37,920 homes were financed by the War Service Homes Division.The progressive achievements since 1945 are clearly shown, and they indicate a highly commendable activity on the part of the departmental officers concerned. In the first of the post-war years, 428 homes were financed, and the expenditure was £372,000. Next year, the total advanced to 2,263, and expenditure was £2,136,000. Next year, it had grown to 3,677, and expenditure was £4,438,000. Next year, the number was 6,084, expenditure being £8,566,000. In 1949-50, the total jumped to 10,303, with an expenditure of £16,154,000. In the year just ended, no fewer than 15,165 homes wore provided, at an all-time record expenditure of £25,071,000. It is estimated that in. the year ended June, 1951, the War Service Homes Division build or financed no less than 11.6 per cent, of all new houses built in Australia.There is probably no greater factor in promoting stability in a community than that of home ownership, and the desirability of this is probably of greater importance to-day than it ever was before. It can be stated that more homes are provided by the War Service Homes Division at present than by any other individual housing scheme, in the Commonwealth. As I have stated, in the year ended the 30th June, 1951, the all-time record amount of £25,071,000 was expended by the War Service Homes Division in building and financing homes. Although the Government is faced with inescapable but enormously increased commitments for defence requirements and other high priority expenditure, it has been decided that the record sum mentioned for last year will again be made available for the current year.When the construction of war service homes was commenced in 1919, there was an accumulation of applications awaiting attention. The Commonwealth Rank handled the financing of existing properties, and the War Service Homes Commission undertook building operations. Expenditure during 1919-20 was £4,838,349, of which £3,835,220 was expended on existing properties. A comparison of the expenditure in some subsequent years is given in the following table : - lt has been the custom for the division to arrange for homes for ex-servicemen in four distinct ways.Group building. This involves the purchase of areas of land, their development, preparation of layouts, modern planning of houses of various types and a contract with a well-established builder for the erection of the homes which, when completed, are made available to eligible persons on the basis of urgency of need.Individual home building. Three different methods are employed : (a) The supply of one of the many standard plans and specifications designed by the division, at a reduced price; (b) the preparation of individual plans ana1 specifications by the division to meet the applicants requirements; and (c) the supply by an applicant of plans and specifications prepared for him by a practising architect or other competent person. Tenders are invited by the division, or the applicant may introduce his own builder, who submits a tender. In the majority of cases, the contract is between the division and the contractor, when the division carries out the full supervision. In other instances, the applicant prefers that the practising architect shall carry out the detailed supervision, and the division exercises a general oversight and makes progress payments on the basis of the value of work done.Purchase of existing property. The applicant indicates the property in respect of which he requires assistance.The division arranges for the valuation of and a technical report on the property. It is necessary to see that it is a good security for the moneys paid by the applicant and by the Commonwealth, that the construction is sound, and that the title is clear.Discharge of mortgage. The functions in connexion with these are the same as for the purchase of existing properties.Of these four functions, undoubtedly the first two, which cover the building of new homes, are the most important and desirable. Although the purchase of existing homes and the discharge of mortgages have been of great assistance, they have not improved the overall housing position of the Commonwealth. On the other hand, every new home erected not only has discharge a part of our obligation to ex-servicemen, but also has had a very real effect on the housing problem generally. Unfortunately, during recent years there has been a regrettable decrease of the percentage of new homes financed, and an effort, to which I shall refer later, is being made this year to restore the proportion of new home building.Of the 75,000 homes provided since the inception of the scheme, 33,000 new homes have been built and 42,500 existing properties have been purchased or mortgages discharged. Approximately 44 per cent, have been built to 56 per cent, existing properties purchased or mortgages discharged. Since 1945, however, the proportion has dropped considerably; 11,576 homes have been built, but 26,344 have been existing properties or mortgage discharges. Expressed in percentages, homes built have dropped from 44 per cent, to 30 per cent., whilst existing properties have increased from 56 per cent, to 70 per cent. In the last completed year the percentage figure? are: Homes built, 26 per cent.; existing properties and mortgages discharged, 74 per cent. These figures do not include the 6,301 under construction and contracts let at the 30th June, 1951.There is also much evidence to suggest that some ex-servicemen have paid for existing properties, prices far in excess of their value, in spite of valuations given by departmental officers. The reason is, of course, that the ex-serviceman is prepared to pay a higher price to get immediate possession. On the other hand, undoubtedly the most productive activity of the division is the building of group homes and individual homes, where the whole of the operation is arranged by the War Service Homes Division and regular contractors are employed under departmental supervision. The division has been extremely fortunate for a number of years in having had a reasonable number of contractors who have carried out its building projects. Because of rising costs, however, and the fact that the maximum loan provided under the act was £2,000, contractors concerned have turned elsewhere and in particular the number of group home contracts let has fallen considerably. By means of a substantial increase of this loan, together with a realistic adjustment of the deposit required and other measures, the Government will make a determined effort to restore that activity in the present year.Applications for loans continue to be received at the rate of approximately 2,000 a month, and as it is impossible to meet the demand in full under existing conditions every effort is being made to give priority assistance to the building of individual and group homes by increasing to £2,750 the maximum loan for that purpose. For the purchase of existing properties the maximum loan will remain at the present amount of £2,000, but assistance under this heading will not be given where the total purchase price exceeds £3,500. The practice of discharging mortgages will be discontinued. It is considered  that these provisions will ensure the most equitable distribution of the very considerable amount provided in the budget and will encourage a home building programme of the most desirable form.The other major amendment provided for in the bill is designed to give Korean and Malayan ex-servicemen rights under the War Service Homes Act equal to those enjoyed by ex-servicemen of the 1914-18 and 1939-45 wars. The locations of hostilities and separate enlistment for the purpose of these activities have made it necessary to provide in the bill that only those ex-servicemen who actually leave Australia for service will be eligible. This conformsto the general practice observed in the amendments to the Repatriation Act. The bill also provides for an amendment of the basis for determining the amount of the deposit to be lodged by an applicant. Under the existing provisions in the act anomalies arise and these would be accentuated with the increase of the maximum loan for building. The provision included in the bill will rectify these anomalies and at the same time will keep the deposit on a realistic scale despite the higher costs of building and purchasing homes.Debate on motion (by Mr. Pollard) adjourned.","Second Reading","WAR SERVICE HOMES BILL 1951","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

144,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"DRAKEFORD, Arthur","KCM","Maribyrnong","N/A","N/A",160,". - The reports concerning this matter have been available for some months, and it seems now that there will not be much opportunity for honorable members to discuss, at any great length, this matter which is of great public concern and is also, I consider, of some personal concern to honorable members who travel frequently by air. To support my statement that the matter is of great public concern I point out that since the disaster occurred I have been approached on many occasions with regard to it by people outside. That fact illustrates the degree of anxiety that has developed as a consequence of the tragedy. I know, as a former Minister for Civil Aviation, that such accidents are inevitable, but I can also affirm that they occur less often in Australia than in most other countries. Perhaps we have natural advantages of terrain and climatic conditions that account for that fact, but I am of the opinion that we are fortunate in having in Australia aircrew men whose qualities are equal to any produced elsewhere. Records over the years have established the truth of that belief.The information available on this matter is contained in two reports by the Air Court of Inquiry which were tabled by the Minister on the 28th June. The accident occurred on the 26th June, 1950, or about a year earlier than the date on which the Minister tabled the papers. A year seems a very long time to have elapsed between the accident and the tabling of the reports, but I know that thorough investigations were being made and that, the Air Court of Inquiry having found it necessary to hold a second inquiry, the time that elapsed between the occurrence of the accident and the tabling of the reports was probably longer than would normally be the case. I consider it to be wise to take the fullest advantageof whatever inquiries can be made into such accidents with the intention of developing, if possible, a method of inquiry which will elucidate the causes of them.The main report consists of 22 closely typed foolscap pages, and is rather an extensive document to study. The supplementary report consists of five pages. The recommendations of the Air Court of Inquiry are on pages 20 to 22 of the main report and on page five of the supplementary report. I am sorry that the reports have not been available to honorable members, at all events since the Parliament last assembled, so that they could have examined them thoroughly. Had they been available I am quite sure that some honorable members would have liked to make contributions to the debate which might have proved to be of value. The story of the tragedy was set out in the statement that the Minister made on the 28th June, which traversed briefly what is contained in the reports. But the reports contain many matters which, I consider, could be examined with advantage by many honorable members. Not only members of the Opposition, but also Government supporters, feel great concern about the accident. A number of honorable members opposite have expressed such concern to me.The aircraft set out at a specific time I think it was 9.55 p.m. and signalled after a normal take-off, that it was on course. Fourteen minutes after that signal the crash occurred. It cannot be denied that the aircrew were very capable and experienced men. The aircraft was flying under the correct limitations of weight. Reference has been made to a number of possible causes of the accident. The court, for good reasons which it set out in two reports, was unable to determine exactly what took place. I do not consider it should be assumed that it is not possible to establish the cause of accidents in all cases, because the departmental investigation committee has done magnificent work in that connexion. I believe it would be hard to find a body of men. who so thoroughly examine every possibility in endeavouring to ascertain what might have given rise to such accidents. Whilst many persons consider that once a crash has occurred the cause cannot be ascertained, it is well known that it can be determined whether a machine struck the ground with the power on or in a falling crash with no power on.The Ministers statement to the House made it clear that the primary cause of the accident to the Amana on the 26th June, 1950, has not been discovered. That, too, is clear from the reports of the inquiry and all the evidence submitted. No doubt the Minister has examined the original report of the Air Accidents Investigation Committee of the Civil Aviation Department, which, in my experience, has invariably done its work most thoroughly. The interests of the air-travelling public, the department and the operators demand that. Anything less would cause not only anxiety in the public mind, but also a lack of confidence in the travel facilities provided. We cannot afford to have that. Australia is as air-minded as any country in the world, and I think that Tasmania is more airminded than any other spot on the earth.Although the debate is taking place long after this regrettable accident, I have no doubt that further critical examination is being made of factors which may have given rise to it. That, however, does not imply that the accident itself should not be the subject of discussion by lay people who almost invariably are not expert in discovering causes of accidents but who compose almost the whole of those who are their unwitting victims. Nowadays, a considerable margin of safety is provided and, indeed, is generally, if not invariably, applied with meticulous care by the mechanical staff as well as the operating staff. As a consequence of this our minds are turned in the direction of human falability. I think it can reasonably be claimed that the human factor in air transport, particularly on the operational side, is as highly qualified and as trustworthy here as in any other part of the world.As usual in such cases, there is a crop of rumours and suggestions which, however unlikely to be correct, may contain some grains of truth and should therefore be examined. The first of these is that one of the caps of the opening through which the tanks of aircraft are filled with petrol was found on the tarmac .after the aeroplane had departed from Guildford and that, in some way, a spark from the ignition or electrical system got across from one of the planes transmitters to the opening in the tank and caused an immediate outbreak of fire. Although that has been suggested I could not see much evidence of it in the report. The report does show that no radio message was sent by the air crew to Guildford after the message sent four minutes after departure which stated that they were then on course, although it is indicated that the flight as originally planned was not, for some unknown reason, adhered to. Nor was a message received which would have indicated that the crew was having trouble immediately prior to the accident. Since the court, after thorough examination, was unable to ascertain the cause of the accident, this theory, or rumour, seems to me to deserve some attention.The court seems to have been convinced that a fire did not occur in the aeroplane prior to the crash and it must be borne in mind that the court was assisted by two capable assessors with the qualifications of experts who agreed in every particular with the finding. It should be easily ascertainable whether or not one of the filling caps of the Ama,ia was found on the tarmac after the plane departed. It is possible, however, that a small fire occurred in the cockpit of the aeroplane which prevented the sending of a message by the crew, who may have been engaged in an attempt to suppress it before it reached the petrol tanks, and were prevented from maintaining control of the aircraft.A fire-detection device made in Australia to which the Civil Aviation Department has given approval, is carried in all aircraft flown by Trans-Australia Airlines. Honorable members may inspect these instruments if they ask to be shown them. A red light shows on the instrument in the cockpit of the aeroplane when a fire occurs and this indicates, not only that a fire has occurred, but also where it is located in the aeroplane. A fire might start in the cockpit itself, in the forward luggage hold, in the body of the aeroplane, or in the rear luggage or freight hold. The instrument shows its location instantaneously. I have seen this appliance demonstrated in the presence of experts and can say that it is most effective as an alarm system and is protective in the sense that it enables immediate steps to be taken to prevent the spread of a fire which, if not extinguished at once might, and almost certainly would, prove dangerous if not disastrous. I understand that there are devices other than the Australian one to which I have referred, but- expert opinion seems to be that there is none quite so effective. I do not know whether the Amana was fitted with the Australian device, but I understand that it was not. I doubt whether the Civil Aviation Department has power to compel its use, but I offer the suggestion that all aircraft should be fitted with the best device available for the protection of its occupants. Whenever protection can be afforded in that way, such instruments should be fitted provided that they pass trials of an exhaustive character which show that they are useful in matters of this kind.In view of the difficulty - perhaps it would be better to use the word  impossibility  - of determining the exact cause of this unfortunate disaster, the Minister should have the position with regard to fire detection in aircraft thoroughly investigated. Should it be within his power to do so, he should insist, without regard to any particular person or interests involved, that all aeroplanes shall be fitted with the most effective fire detection appliances. Another aspect which develops is whether the best method of ascertaining the cause of accidents is being used. I am satisfied that the departmental investigation committee which investigates an accident subsequent to or coincident with the investigation by the proprietors, company or corporation concerned, is efficient and is just as eager as is any member of the public to discover causes of air disasters and to make its conclusions available to the court and to the people.It is within the bounds of possibility that the instrument in the cockpit of the aircraft which is referred to in the language of the layman as the  artificial horizon  may have been defective. This instrument is used for the purpose of indicating whether the aircraft is flying in a correct attitude or posture. If it became defective, particularly when flying in darkness over country with few landmarks, the aeroplane could have been following a slight downward path without the air crew being aware of it. I think it would be admitted by competent pilots that it would be possible, if that instrument were defective, for a pilot to fail to realize that the aircraft was following a downward path instead of flying level or ascending. It would not be a case of flying, off course. The aeroplane could be on course but descending when it should be flying level or ascending. I realize that the altimeter should indicate the height of the aircraft ; hut if that, too, were defective a combination of defects could give rise to an accident. It is usually the case that a combination of defects or errors is the cause of an accident and the violence of the crash prevents the causes from being ascertained.Does the court appointed by the Minister or the Government provide the best means of elucidation possible? In this case it is clear that the assessors were in complete agreement with the court but if they or anyone of them should not be, there is no way in which they can give expression to their views unless the court itself chooses to allow that expression or itself expressed disagreement. In this case it is clear that the assessors were in complete agreement with the court: and they were very competent men. I think that one of them was Captain John Bonnett, the Flight Superintendent of British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines, and the other was a Captain Hudson, an engineer. They agreed in every particular with the courts findings at both inquiries. But if they or any one of them should not have agreed there was no way in which they could have given expression to their views unless the court itself had chosen to allow that expression or had itself expressed disagreement. The assessors are merely advisors, as experts in various aspects of aviation whose knowledge is available to the court; men of high status in the aviation world whose integrity is undoubted but who do not shave in bringing in the finding.I am of the opinion that what is done in other parts of the world in ascertaining causes of accidents should be examined in an endeavour to produce an authority which will be the best possible. I consider that to be vital. The matter was under examination while I was Minister for Air and endeavours were being made to determine what would be the best form of inquiry to develop. That is not a reflection on the court or on the departmental committee of inquiry but it may be possible to establish something better. I consider that the Department of Civil Aviation, which is in charge of the lives and safety of so many people and so much valuable property, ought to .be and is prepared to, determine what is the best form of inquiry. I am not criticizing the department adversely, . but I believe that something better might be done; and if it can be done we should leave no stone unturned - even financial stones - to see that it shall be done. I believe that the proprietors, companies or corporations concerned do their utmost to avoid air accidents for selfish if for no other reasons, as the reputation of an airline or an operator is at stake. However, there is the ever-present possibility that some one lower down the scale may not, under heavy pressure of work or limitation of time, be so exacting as he should be in ensuring that the duties imposed upon him are completely carried out or that the person appointed to do the job actually does it. That is a possibility, particularly when acting under strain and stressOn page 9 of the courts report the following paragraphs appear: -In relation to engine No. 4 Mr. Gibbs was of the opinion that it was not rotating at the point of impact for reasons which are better discussed under the next heading.Accepting Mr. Gibbs evidence in relation to No. 1, 2 and 3 engines, that each was rotating and adding thereto the evidence of Mr. Storey, the propellor expert, I have come to the conclusion that No. 1, 2 and 3 engines were all, at the time of impact, rotating under power.I venture to suggest that that strengthens the belief that the aircraft was flying downwards and that the power was on at the moment of impact. That could have been caused by an attempt to lift the plane as the pilot was approaching the ground. No 4 engine did not have the power on, but Nos. 1, 2, and 3 did. I submit that that is very important. I do stress that that matter might be worth further examination. [Extension of time granted.]I suggest that the Minister be .good enough to have the findings of the Air Court of Inquiry incorporated in Hansard because they are of tremendous value to both technical people and the general public. The court made it clear that the causes of the accident were not ascertainable.On page 13 of Mr. Justice Simpsons report appears a reference to the weatherheads. It was suggested that water had by some means got into the engine. On this point the court reported -The weatherheads were not drained at Essendon despite the existence of an Air Navigation Order that was made by the Department of Civil Aviation that all fuel tank drain cocks must be checked for water after each refuelling.Although the court seemed to think that presence of water did not bring about the accident, it nevertheless saw fit to make that reference. The court also referred to the fact that there were other irregularities which perhaps I shall not be able to touch upon. Another important matter is mentioned on page 16. There the court said -In those circumstances I find it impossible to believe that any water was put into Amana from the respective tankers that refuelled it from the time it left Sydney on the morning of 26th June, until the time it set out on its last and fatal journey.I suggest that that also is a matter of importance. At page 20 the court said with regard to the theory of an expert, Mr. Berry-I consider this theory completely untenable.At page 20 the court set out its findings, and I cannot do more at this time than merely point out that they are in paragraphs 76 to 91. Paragraph S6 at page 21 is particularly important. In it the court states -Although it had no part in causing the accident there was a serious dereliction of duty on the part of ground engineers employed by the operating company in not obeying thu appropriate Air Navigation Order which required the draining of the weatherheads of fuel tanks of the aircraft as Essendon. Parafield., and Guildford.Perhaps the Department of Civil Aviation could exert more pressure to ensure that such action shall always he taken in the future.","Loss of Airliner  Amana  - Reports of Air Court of Inquiry","CIVIL AVIATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Paragraph S7 at page 22 reads -There was evidence that on this occasion the Amana was carrying 8,545 feet of photographic film in breach of the order which limits the carriage of films to 3.000 feet. This played no part in the accident as it is clear Amana did not catch fire prior to impact.That lends point to what I have already said about the possibility of an -attempt to suppress a fire, but everything happened so quickly, only nineteen minutes after the take-off, that it is really impossible to ascertain what did occur. Moreover, no radio message was received from the pilot after the aircraft had been airborne for four minutes, although he did not comply with his flight plan.I thank the House for having been good enough to extend my time sufficiently to enable me to refer to the matters upon which I have since touched. I should like to hear the opinions of the trained aviators in this House, and those of other honorable members on this side of the House. I suggest that further opportunity should be given to the House to discuss this matter. I also suggest that whatever else is done, there should bc no reduction of the staff of the Department of Civil Aviation. That department needs all the staff that it has. On the technical side there are men in that department who are as good as those employed in similar positions in any part of the world. The organization that has been built up should not be lightly altered. I also submit that any retrenchment in the Department of Civil Aviation would cause great uneasiness in the minds of those who use our aviation facilities, and in the minds of the public generally. We must retain the confidence of the people. I am not making accusations against anybody; in fact, much of what has been done in our aviation services is. highly creditable to the operators and the department; but there may be a degree of negligence somewhere. If there is, we should endeavour to eliminate it immediately.","Loss of Airliner  Amana  - Reports of Air Court of Inquiry","CIVIL AVIATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

148,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"DRAKEFORD, Arthur","KCM","N/A","N/A","N/A",164,"- Then, with the consent of the House I shall incorporate the findings in Hansard. In the first report, they are as follows : -I have to report therefore that the aircraft VH- AN A (Amana) was owned and operated by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, that this company was operating under a current Airline Licence.That the aircraft held a valid Certificate of Registration, was operating under a current Certificate of Airworthiness and a valid Certificate of Safety.That the aircraft had a crew of five, three of whom were pilots all * holding the necessary certificates duly endorsed where required for DC.4 aircraft. The pilots were all of considerable experience including experience in night flying.The aircraft was operating within the permissible limits of maximum load and was correctly loaded.The aircraft carried 24 passengers,, including two infants in arms, and all the occupants were killed at the moment of thecrash except one who survived a few days but subsequently died of his injuries.Before the aircraft departed from Guildford the pilot had prepared and had had approved a flight plan of his proposed course and height.The aircraft took off from Guildford aerodrome at 9.54 p.m. without experiencing any difficulty, became airborne, turned to port and climbed to 2,000 feet at a stage where it passed over the aerodrome and signalled that it was on course.By the time ithad gone a distance of something under 10 miles the pilot was experiencing some difficulty with his engines and by the lime the aircraft had reached the vicinity of approximately 12 miles from. Guildford it had departed from itsflight plan in so much as it was not climbing at the planned rate of climb.That the pilot in these circumstances should have reported, to the Air Traffic Control at Guildford, that he was departing from his flight plan. There is no explanation of why he did not do this. There is nothing to suggest that his communication systems were not functioning.That by the time the aircraft had reached approximately 30 miles from the point of departure it was in serious difficulties. At this point it was flying some 5.000 feet below its planned height.That at this point the engines all ceased to deliver power and about the same time the aircraft went intoa very steep and sudden dive.That the engines again came on for a short space of time and the aeroplane made a definite turn to port.That the pilot had, at some time, during the voyage feathered the propeller of number 4 engine and immediately before the crash into the ground he had probably attempted to unfetter this engine.That the machine collided with the top of a hill in the vicinity of York at a distance of about 36½ miles from Guildford aerodrome and on a bearing 078 degrees magnetic.That the aircraft struck the ground inadvertently and not during any deliberate attempt on the partof the pilot to land the aircraft.I am satisfied there was no structural failure in the aircraft.I find that the aircraft crashed after a sudden loss of height and after a period when the engines were delivering no power. The evidence dons not justify me in finding either the cause of the sudden loss of height or the cause of all the engines of the aircraft simultaneously ceasing to deliver power. There is no doubt that these two factors, irrespective of their orderof happening, caused the accident.An examination of the engines proves that there was some corrosion in parts of No. 1 engine fuel system and considerable corrosion in parts of No. 4 engine fuel system. I am not satisfied that this corrosion or any of it is to be attributed to water being in the petrol in the aircraft.I am satisfied and have to report that there was no water in the petrol (except possibly in the undrainable section of Nos. 1 and 4 main tanks), when Amana left Sydney on the morning of 26th, and that no water was in the petrol when  Amana  was refuelled at Essendon. Para field and Guildford.Although it had no part in causing the accident there was a serious dereliction of duty on the part of ground engineers employed by the operating company in not obeying the appropriate Air Navigation Order which required the draining of the weatherheads of fuel tanks of the aircraft at Essendon, Parafield and Guildford.There was evidence that on this occasion the  Amana  was carrying 8,545 feet of photographic film in breach of the order which limits the carriage offilms to 3,000 feet. This played no part in the accident as it is clear  Amana  did not catch on fire prior to impact.I recommend that the Oil Companies who supply petrol for aircraft purposesshouldbe required to test each compartment of their tank wagons at least after each re-fill of the tank wagon and that such tests should be made by withdrawing petrol from each compartment into a transparent or glass container and an inspection made for the presence of water.I recommend that the Department of Civil Aviations Air Navigation Order Number 105.0.22 should be amended to require that the checks of the fuel from the weatherheads be made into transparent or glass containers.I recommend that the Department of CivilAviation reconsider the appropriate Air Navigation Order (A.N.O. 40) with a view to requiring all pilots to be periodically tested for asymmetric flight on each type of aeroplane in which they regularly fly.In explanation of this last recommendation.Every pilot flying in Commercial Aircraft is required to have his licence endorsed for the particular type of aircraft he is flying and he is also required to be tested in asymmetric flight once in every six months for his licence renewal.As the order is at present worded a pilot can renew his licence when flying say, four engined planes and have his asymmetric tests on twoengined planes. This matter was mentioned in the inquiry but not pursued at any length and I am not justified in the circumstances in making a positive recommendation that this be altered.The concluding paragraphs in the supplementary report are as follows : -1 ) I do not find it necessary to alter any of the findings I made in my first report.I recommend that the Department of Civil Aviation take the necessary steps to advise Civil Aviation authorities elsewhere and Operating Companies in Australia of the significance of their experiments into the vortex theory.I am asked by my Assessors to state that they are in complete agreement with my findings and recommendations in this Supplementary Report.","Loss of Airliner  Amana  - Reports of Air Court of Inquiry","CIVIL AVIATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
149,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BURKE, Thomas","JTF","Perth","N/A","N/A",165,".The honorable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Drakeford) has dealt with this matter in his usual moderate fashion. All that I want from the Government is an assurance that it is learning the lessons of this tragic happening. The Department of Civil Aviation has a record which compares more than favorably, I think, with that of any similar service in the world. The record of Australian aviation is a very proud one. It is tragic happenings such as this that bring home to us the possibility of such failures on the part of the men and machines associated with our aviation services. This accident was particularly tragic. Not only was it. the only crash of a four-engine passenger plane ever to have taken place in Australia, but it also happened with such suddenness that it shocked the people of Western Australia and caused great concern throughout Australia. The aircraft was scarcely more than airborne, had scarcely reached its normal operating height, when the tragic event occurred.It was beyond the power of the court to establish the cause of the accident. It is true that this event should make us more vigilant to ensure the constant observance of the highest standards of civil aviation. The inquiry revealed that in three matters the normal practice laid down for civil aviation companies had not been complied with. One was of a minor nature, and concerned the distribution of the load. Another was the carriage of a quantity of photographic film in excess of what was permitted by the department. The third matter was the failure of the company to drain the weatherheads before the aircraft left Guildford. There was, I believe, a similar failure before it left Melbourne. Whilst it- is unlikely that that caused the accident, the cause has not been and cannot be discovered. Tho court assumed that those matters had no bearing on the accident; nevertheless it is laid down by the Civil Aviation Department that certain precautions must be taken. The department must insist that these precautions shall be carried out according to rule. The Minister should give consideration to the imposition of heavy penalties on those who do not strictly adhere to the rules. If they are sufficiently important to be given the force of law by the Department of Civil Aviation, then the department and the Government should ensure, by the provision of severe penalties, thai they shall be carried out.The honorable member for Maribyrnong referred to possible retrenchment in the Department of Civil Aviation. I hope that the Government will not carry out such retrenchment. A reduction of the staff of Trans- Australia Airlines, or of the Department of Civil Aviation, might do a great disservice to the Australian people and to Australian aviation. It is not sufficient that there should be adequate staffs, it is necessary that the public who travel by air, and their relatives whom they leave behind, should be assured of the best possible service. This tragic happening shook the whole of Australia. No blame can be attached to the aircraft crew and no cause has been assigned to the crash. Nevertheless, it should make the Government, the department and the Parliament most anxious that no such happening shall occur in the future. I hope that the Government will learn the lesson of this accident and that civil aviation in Australia will be made safer thereby.","Loss of Airliner  Amana  - Reports of Air Court of Inquiry","CIVIL AVIATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
150,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ANTHONY, Hubert","JLZ","Richmond","CP","Post- . master-General and Minister for Civil Aviation",166,". - in reply - I appreciate the approach that honorable members opposite have made to this matter. I refer particularly to the remarks of the honorable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Drakeford). He was formerly Minister for Civil Aviation and he had the responsibility of arranging for the investigation of aircraft fatalities. Such accidents, of course, are lamentable, and in almost all instances it is difficult to determine the actual cause of the accident. However, we learn as we go. As a consequence of regrettable accidents of this kind regulations are framed with the object, if one may use the phrase, of taking advantage of the lessons that are to be learned therefrom. The Department of Civil Aviation insists firmly upon observance of its regulations. Indeed, in some instances its strictness is resented to some degree by airline companies. However, for some time past, there has been a recognition by the major companies of the necessity for measures to ensure the safety of the travelling public. Civil aviation in this country has a proud record. Last year Australian airlines carried 1,7.50,000 passengers and the fatality rate  was approximately five deaths in every 100,000,000 miles flown. Consequently, air travel to-day is probably the safest form of transportation with the possible exception of rail transport. When one compares the infinitesimal number of accidents in civil aviation with the appalling number that occurs almost daily on our roads, one cannot but conclude that to-day air travel is not the hazardous venture that it once appeared to be.The Air Court of Inquiry made certain observations which have been noted by the department. As the honorable member for Maribyrnong has stated, the court directed attention to the fact that the weathercocks of the 4mana appeared not to have been drained as prescribed under the regulations although, at the same time, the court expressed the opinion that that omission was not a contributing cause of the accident. The purpose of draining weathercocks is to determine whether there is any water in the petrol. However, in such tests in the past, the petrol was drained into containers that were not transparent. An air navigation regulation which has now been gazetted provides that containers into which petrol from weathercocks is drained shall be transparent so that testers may be able to see at a glance whether the petrol contains water.I have had personal discussions with the head of Australian National Airlines Proprietary Limited, the company which owned the Amana, and I obtained from him an assurance that the observations that were made by the Air Court of Inquiry would be carefully studied and heeded in the future. The company had noted the fact that a quantity of inflammable material in excess of that permitted under the relevant order was carried on the Amana. I was assured that from the date on which the company became aware of that fact it took stringent steps to ensure that such action would not be repeated in the future. The company has also taken steps to ensure that the draining of the weathercocks shall be carried out under expert supervision. I do not think that I can add anything further to what the honorable member for Maribyrnong has said. I shall give careful consideration to his suggestion that courts of inquiry could, perhaps, be constituted in a more effective way. I shall direct the attention .of departmental officers to that suggestion for their examination of it. I conclude by again expressing my regret at the accident. I extend my sympathy to those who sustained loss as a consequence of it.Question resolved in the negative.","Loss of Airliner  Amana  - Reports of Air Court of Inquiry","CIVIL AVIATION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Yesterday, the Minister for Immigration (Mr. Holt) said that the Government desires to encourage a greater proportion of immigrants who are suited to agricultural and horticultural  pursuits. I believe that that view is supported by many people in the community. However, it does not appear to be in line with ideas which are prevalent among prospective emigrants from thu Netherlands. During the last few days one of my constituents told me that through an organization which assists Dutch persons to emigrate to Australia be had been in touch with a young man named Adam Pot, who is an expert in horticulture. My constituent is a man of substance and he is prepared to employ and provide a home for this youngDutchman. However, although both of them have made many inquiries in the matter, they do not seem to be making progress. The circumstances of the case arc set out in a letter which I received from a man named Meulenbelt, who, incidentally, is an Australian citizen resident in Holland and who, whenever the opportunity offers, assists Dutch people to emigrate to this country. The letter reads - 29 Boardstreet.","Immigration","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He referred to an apparent drying up of the flow of Dutch immigrants to Australia. That is contrary to advice that has been given to me by officers of my department. I appreciate the honorable members motive in raising this matter and also the manner in which he has done so; but he may be interested to learn that during the year before the present Government took office fewer than 1,000 Dutch immigrants came to this country whereas because I, myself, believed that the Dutch would make admirable settlers in this country, approximately 12,000 Dutch came to Australia during the first year after the Government took office. According to my recollection of the advice given to me by officers of my department, the rate of flow of Dutch immigrants is increasing to such a degree that it is anticipated that during the current year approximately 25,000 Dutch settlers will reach Australia. I, for one, welcome that development and I am sure that it will bo applauded by all honorable members.I am glad to be able to say that no group of immigrants has been better received or morehighly commended in Australia than have immigrants who have come from the Netherlands. I cannot recall a single complaint relating to .
