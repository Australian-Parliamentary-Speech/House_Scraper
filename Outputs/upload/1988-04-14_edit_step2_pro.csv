27,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Transport and Communications)",1527,"—I table the explanatory memorandum and move:That the Bill be now read a second time.I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.Leave granted.The speech read as follows-This Bill replaces the Broadcasting (Ownership and Control) Bill (No. 3) 1987 which was introduced in the Senate towards the close of the 1987 Budget sittings of Parliament. That Bill has been withdrawn because of the extensive drafting changes required to implement an adjustment to the policy for the grandfathering (i.e. protection) of certain interests which contravene relevant ownership and control limits.The Bill provides for a major new package of commercial radio ownership rules and will provide an efficient and equitable framework for the future development of commercial radio services in Australia. The opportunity has also been taken in the Bill to accomplish a substantial rearrangement and consolidation of existing ownership and control provisions in broadcasting legislation.These new rules, which implement the policy announced on 28 October 1987, will substantially complete the Governments unprecedented reform of the ownership structure of the Australian media.The Bill presents the results of the review of ownership limits for commercial radio. It also completes the review of cross-media ownership by addressing this issue in the context of revised radio rules. The new cross-media limits will effectively mean that media proprietors will have to choose between a major role in television or radio or newspapers.The existing radio limits in the Broadcasting Act 1942 are:one metropolitan radio licence in any State;a total of four metropolitan radio licences;a total of four radio licences in any State;a total of 8 licences.The factor that triggers the application of these limits is the holding of a prescribed interest in a commercial radio licence or the holding of a directorship in a company in a position to control a commercial radio licence. Broadly speaking, the threshold for attribution of a radio prescribed interest is the holding of more than a 15% direct or indirect shareholding in a licensee company. This Bill does not propose changes either to this threshold level for radio prescribed interests or to the methods of tracing indirect interests. A change in the current 5% prescribed interest level for commercial television licences is proposed, for the purpose of the revised television/radio cross-media limit. I will explain this change in addressing the provisions of the Bill in more detail.Since the inception of the radio limits in 1935, the number of commercial radio licences has more than doubled, and more new services are in the pipeline.In February 1987 the Government announced the plans for twenty-seven additional commercial FM radio stations in regional areas. In October 1987, I added to this list so that, by 1922, commercial FM radio services will be available to more than three million people living outside the mainland State capitals.This expansion of commercial radio services represents a radical change in the commercial radio environment in non-metropolitan areas which is not catered for by the existing radio ownership and control limits.The Government believes that the public interest will best be served if commercial radio services are competitive. A competitive industry will strive to present the best in commercial radio programming in order to attract audiences and, consequently, advertising revenue. Competition within radio markets will also promote diversity of programming in terms of news, information, opinion and entertainment.In summary, the new package of ownership rules introduced by this Bill will consist of:A national limit of 16 commercial radio licences;A State radio licence limit of no more than half of the service areas in that State;A limit of one radio licence to a service area; andNew and revised cross-media ownership limits.National LimitN/AThe new national limit for commercial radio licences is to be 16. The number of these licences has more than doubled since the eight-station limit was introduced in 1935. To maintain the ratio of permitted licences to the total available today (that is 139) would require a new limit of seventeen. If one takes into account the 37 new commercial or supplementary radio licences in the pipeline, the number may need to go as high as 21 to maintain that ratio. When the new services are in place the new limit could represent just over 9% of licences as compared with 6% under the current eight station rule. In this context, the new 16 licence limit is both realistic and conservative.State LimitN/AThe present State limit of four licences impacts unevenly upon the States because it takes no account of the differing numbers of licences among them.The new limit in the Bill will prohibit a person from holding prescribed interests in more licences within a State than half the number of service areas in that State.For this purpose, service areas that are substantially coextensive with each other will be counted only once. If the revised State limit were to come into operation today, the maximum number of licences in the States would be:NSW (including ACT)...17Victoria...7Queensland...11South Australia...3Western Australia...7Tasmania...3The principle underlying the State limit is that no-one should be able to exercise too great an influence within a State. The combined effect of this limit and others included in this Bill will achieve this result.Local LimitN/AThe Government believes that diversity and quality of programming is best ensured by the provision of competitive services at the local level.Under the current rules, there is a prohibition against holding two or more radio licences serving any State capital city. Only a few cities outside the State capitals have more than one commercial radio service and these are not commonly owned. However, with the planned expansion of commercial services in non-metropolitan areas, it is necessary to give the metropolitan area prohibition general force. The general application of the one-to-a-market limit is consistent with the one-licence-to-a-market rule for commercial television.The intent of the new rule is that, where licences are in direct competition, they should not be commonly owned. There are many services that are not in direct competition but whose service areas, for historical or other reasons, overlap. The ``one-radio-licence-in-a-service-area rule therefore has a built-in margin of tolerance of 30%. That is, if two service areas overlap to the extent that more than 30% of the population of one is also within the service area of the other, then the licences serving those areas will not be able to have common ownership links.There will, of course, remain the case of supplementary licences. These will be granted only where the service area concerned is judged to be unable to support a competitive service. As at present, supplementary radio licences will not be subject to the radio ownership rules.Cross-Media LimitsN/AIn early 1987 the Government introduced cross-media limits in connection with changes to the television ownership and control rules. Those limits restricted, for the first time, holdings across media-in that case, television/radio and television/newspapers. Since then there has been a considerable realignment of interests within the industry with a significant uncoupling of cross-media linkages.The present Bill extends the cross-ownership restrictions to radio/newspaper holdings and amends the application of the existing television/radio restrictions.In the case of television/radio, the current restriction is that prescribed interests may not be held in both a television licence and a radio licence if, anywhere within the television service area, there is a monopoly for the commercial radio service. The new rule will prohibit the holding of prescribed interests by one person in both a television licence and a radio licence if more than 30% of the population within the service area of one of those licences is also within the others service area. For this purpose a prescribed interest in a television licence will be attributed to interests of more than 15%.This television/radio limit will mean that there is uniform application of the prescribed interest levels to radio and television for the cross-media rule. The rule will apply universally across Australia-not just in monopoly radio markets.For radio/newspapers, cross-media holdings will be limited in an equivalent manner to television/newspapers; that is, a person will not be permitted to hold prescribed interests in both a radio licence and a newspaper if that newspaper:has fifty per cent or more of its circulation within the radio service area;is published, in English, on four or more days per week; andis sold, as a newspaper, to the extent of fifty per cent or more of its circulation.The threshold for a prescribed interest will be fifteen per cent for both radio and newspapers, as already defined in the Act.The effect of these rules will be that media proprietors will essentially have to choose between a major role in television, or radio, or newspapers.DirectorshipsN/AThe existing radio directorship limits in the Act has also been changed to make them consistent with the revised radio prescribed interest limits. The existing television/radio cross-media directorship limit has also been amended to reflect the changes made to the corresponding cross-media prescribed interest limit. The new radio/newspaper cross-media prescribed interest limit is also supported by a corresponding directorship limit. The changes made to the cross-media directorship limits include an exemption to cover the circumstances where a person holds more than one directorship within a corporate group which has grandfathered cross-media interests.Administration and EnforcementN/AFor the purpose of the new radio rules, the Minister will be required to determine the percentage service area population overlaps between radio licences (to give effect to the one-radio-licence-to-a-service-area limit) and to determine the number of discrete service areas in each State (to give effect to the revised State limit). The Minister will also be required to determine percentage population service area overlaps between commercial radio and television licences for the purpose of the new television/radio cross-media limit. The determination of service area population overlaps is to be based on Census Count results published by the Australian Statistician. For the purpose of the new radio/newspaper cross-media limit, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will be required to determine those newspapers having more than 50% of their circulation within the service area of particular commercial radio licences.The Bill will ensure that these determinations made by the Minister and the Tribunal are available to the public in the form of Ministerial Gazette Notices and the Tribunals Associated Newspaper Register. The Notices and the Tribunal Register must also be updated to take account of new circumstances such as new Census Count results, changes in service areas and changes in newspaper circulations. The administration and enforcement system closely follows the scheme which applies at present to the 60% population reach television limit.Investors in the media will thus be able to ascertain those investments that would contravene the new limits through reference to the Gazette Notices of the Minister and/or the Associated Newspaper Register of the Tribunal. Contraventions of the new limits will be treated in the same way as contraventions under the existing Act.GrandfatheringN/AAs already indicated, this Bill implements a revised approach for the grandfathering of interests than that which was provided in the Broadcasting (Ownership and Control) Bill (No. 3) 1987. In my Second Reading Speech for that Bill I indicated that, following consultation with broadcasting industry representatives and other interested parties, amendments of the grandfathering rules would be considered when debate on the Bill was resumed in these Sittings. In particular, I foreshadowed that consideration would be given to the application of grandfathering to inadvertent contraventions of the new radio and cross-media limits caused by changes in Census Count population figures for relevant commercial radio or television licences.Following this consultation process, it has been decided to amend the provisions in the previous Bill by extending grandfathering protection to:(a) eligible prescribed interests or directorships held before the date of Ministerial announcement not only if they contravene as a result of a subsequent change in service area, but also if they contravene as a result of a subsequent change in population distribution between service areas or a subsequent minor change in the circulation of a newspaper; and(b) prescribed interests or directorships acquired after the date of Ministerial announcement, if they contravene as a result of a change in population distribution between service areas or a change in service area, not including television service area aggregation.These adjustments to grandfathering policy are designed to provide protection from inadvertent contraventions of the new ownership and control limits caused by circumstances beyond the legal control of licensees or media investors. This protection does not apply, however, to prescribed interests or directorships acquired after the date of Ministerial announcement where they contravene as a result of television service area aggregation. This is because such prescribed interests or directorships have been acquired in full knowledge of the new ownership rules and the impact of aggregation on those rules.Similarly, no protection is provided under the adjusted grandfathering rules for prescribed interests or directorships acquired after the date of Ministerial announcement which contravene the relevant cross-media limits because of a change in the circulation of a newspaper, or other changes in the circumstances of newspaper publication sufficient to cause a contravention of those limits. This is because such circumstances are ultimately within the control of newspaper publishers and because the extension of grandfathered protection in this way could allow a fundamental change in the character of a newspaper which would not be caught by the cross-media rules.The new grandfathering rules also maintain the requirement in the previous Bill that, to be protected for prescribed interests or directorships held before 28 October 1987 which contravene a revised radio or cross-media limit, a person must not have contravened the corresponding existing limit immediately before that date.For example, if a person contravened the existing State limits (four commercial radio licences) by holding prescribed interests in five commercial radio licences in South Australia before 28 October 1987, that person would, if the revised State limit for South Australia is three licences, be grandfathered for the holding of a prescribed interest in only four of those licences. On the other hand, a person who was grandfathered under the existing television/radio cross-media limits would continue to be grandfathered for contraventions of the new television/radio limit.The revised grandfathering rules will apply not only to the new radio and cross-media limits introduced by the Bill, but also to the existing television limits and television/newspaper cross-media limit. In particular, there is special provision in the Bill for the application of grandfathering rules to the 60% population reach television limit to provide protection in the circumstances where that limit is contravened as a direct result of a change in service area or a change in population distribution between service areas.This is subject to the requirement that additional or new television interests are not acquired after the grandfathered date. Again, television service area aggregation is not included within the scope of grandfathered protection.Consequential Drafting ChangesN/AThe Bill provides for consequential amendments of the licence grant, renewal, and transfer provisions of the Act to take account of the new limits. A cursory glance at the Bill will also reveal that significant structural changes have been made to the arrangement of the ownership and control provisions to accommodate the new limits. The existing and new cross-media provisions will be contained in a separate Division of the Act. The existing and new grandfathering rules have been consolidated in a new Division to avoid the need to refer to the transitional grandfathering provisions in recent broadcasting amendment Acts.The Parliamentary Draftsman has also taken the opportunity to provide a more logical and coherent arrangement of the ownership and control provisions and to streamline the ownership and control rules by deleting duplicate radio and television provisions. I am sure that these improvements will be welcomed by lawyers and representatives of the broadcasting industry.Financial ImpactN/AThe new measures will place some additional administrative burden on the Department of Transport and Communications and on the Tribunal. These will be absorbed within current resources, although some reordering of priorities may be required.ConclusionN/AThis Bill marks the culmination of a process of reform for radio that commenced when my predecessor, early in 1985, asked the then Department of Communications to inquire into future directions for commercial radio.That process has resulted in two major advances. Firstly, there is the program to provide additional radio services in regional areas, which was announced in 1987. Secondly, there are the rules provided for in this Bill. These new radio and cross-media rules and the new radio services, together with the television rules and the television equalisation scheme, will usher in a new era of broadcasting that will increase the quality and quantity of broadcasting services available to the public at all levels and in all areas. This new era has not been brought about by new technology or outside or overseas influences. It is a direct consequence of the Governments policy initiatives.I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the Senate.Debate (on motion by Senator Reid) adjourned.","N/A","BROADCASTING (OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL) BILL 1988","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

So far as the situation in relation to any possible change in the television ownership reach rules is concerned, the position is exactly as I described it in a public statement made last week; that is to say, the Governments position in terms of decisions both by the Cabinet and by the parliamentary Party remains one of preference for a 75 per cent rule. That was the decision we came to last year. As a result of opposition in this place a lesser figure of 60 per cent was in fact agreed to in the Parliament. If it should become apparent that it is appropriate to reconsider that, we will do so. The only point I would make about the policy aspects of this at the moment is that there is no obviously rational ground for preferring 60 per cent to 75 per cent.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[1]/answer/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

The only point I wish to make at this stage, because this is a matter for ongoing consideration and discussion in the Parliament and, of course, outside the Parliament, is that there would not appear to be anything that has changed in the circumstances which now exist as compared with the circumstances which existed last year when these various decisions were arrived at.

The emphasis in Japanese defence policy is on self-defence in accordance with the constraints laid down under Japans Constitution. Within that context, there has been a marginal increase in military expenditure in recent years following the decision in 1987 to lift the self-imposed limit of one per cent of gross national product. There is no indication that Japan has any intention to develop a nuclear capability and, in particular, as a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Japan has committed itself not to manufacture or otherwise to acquire nuclear weapons-an assurance and a commitment which we welcome in the region.It is the case that an expanded regional role would arouse sensitivities in many Asian countries, sensitivities of which the Leader of the Opposition, in his recent excursion-which one can only describe as bumbling and heavy-handed-into this area, appears to be largely ignorant. The Japanese are aware of these sensitivities. I think it is fair to say that Japan is uncomfortable with the idea of a greater military role. It is hard to imagine circumstances in which it would be in Japans interest to depart from its current defence policies, the cornerstone of which is the security treaty with the United States. We believe that the most effective way in which Japan can enhance regional security and stability is through its capacity as an economic power to act as an engine of growth for the region through trade, investment and aid programs. We believe that it would be far more in the national and international interest for that particular line of approach to be adopted rather than for us to see the kind of excursion into the military area and defence cooperation area that the Leader of the Opposition embarked upon.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

So Mr Elliott is advocating a consumption tax on the footie tickets that the people who sit in the outer area buy to get into the ground. He wants them taxed. He wants to tax the pies that they munch while they are in the outer watching the footie, while he and his mates sit up in the business box at Princes Park with the VAT-guzzling their tax deductible Vat 69-and gobbling their free lunch, having already got free entry into the ground.

In the absence of a firm assurance that there would not be across the board attempts to recover those higher prices through higher wages, instead of having a blip in the inflation rate we would move to a new plateau of inflation. Had it been done under those circumstances at the time it was seriously considered in Australia in 1985, we would have had a short term inflation rate of the order of 15 per cent, which would probably have become a plateau rate for inflation in the absence of such an assurance or agreement on wages policy.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[5]/answer/talk.start[7]/para","N/A","N/A"

People who are, I suppose, cynical about, or even aware of, the internal contradictions and the ongoing humbuggery and hypocrisy of the Country Party, or the National Party as it calls itself these days, might not be so surprised.It is an inescapable fact that the level of expenditure, at least in the long term, is determined by the level of taxation. In the short term that fact can be escaped from, as of course Mr Howard escaped from it in 1982 when he brought down the most irresponsible Budget of all time, with an impending Budget deficit of 5 per cent of gross domestic product which, as Senator Stone pointed out to Mr Howard, was the highest Budget deficit in Australian history. One can escape for a while from the reality that the level of expenditure is determined by the level of tax, but in the long term it cannot be escaped from.

In regard to paying pensions to millionaires, which was the other demand for increased taxation put forward by Mr Sharp, the Government published some time ago a figure of $160m-that is the cost of abolishing the assets test. More recently the Department of Social Security has published a figure of $300m, which I regard as extremely conservative, for the following reasons: The proportion of people in the relevant age group in receipt of a pension declined from 84 per cent to 78 per cent, on the last occasion I looked at the matter. That decline has an implicit saving of the order of $500m, or a little more.

The 1985 proposal would have boosted the consumer price index by some 6 1/2 per cent and in the absence of a firm assurance or agreement that that one-off increase in prices would not be recovered in higher wages, we could anticipate a continuing inflation rate some 6 1/2 per cent higher than it was prior to the introduction of such a tax.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[10]/answer/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

98,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WALSH","TJ4","WA","ALP","N/A",1537,"—In response to the second part of the question, concerning whether the Government will introduce a tax on superannuation fund income, I have nothing to add to answers that I have given on a number of previous occasions-that is, essentially, we will have to wait for the outcome of the review. The main part of the question concerns the statement put out by Mr Peacock two or three weeks ago, which was either a pure fabrication or a product of the dabbling of yet another Liberal Party innumerate. It demonstrates, if it was the latter, that Mr Peacock, as shadow Treasurer, is not likely to be of any assistance to the Liberal Party in getting together prior to the next election a set of figures which are arithmetically sound. His statement contained numerous false assumptions and arithmetical errors, some of which I will detail. First, he assumed that a 15 per cent tax on superannuation fund earnings would generate a tax liability equal to 15 per cent of those earnings. That is wrong because it ignores the income which would be eligible for imputation credits, plus the fact that the funds could deduct a range of expenses for taxation purposes and would be liable for tax only on realised capital gains. Those are a few errors, to start with. On present indications a 15 per cent nominal rate would generate an actual rate, an effective rate, of about 10 per cent. To the extent that superannuation funds move their investments into equity holdings and therefore receive franked dividends, the rate would fall.Mr Peacock used several salary ranges and ages to present examples of the supposed effects of a tax on benefits. While the final benefits were calculated correctly-that is, according to his false assumptions-there were arithmetical errors in calculating benefits as a proportion of final salary. I will give an example of the outcome of some of those calculations. For a 22-year-old in receipt of a salary of $22,000 with a tax rate of 15 per cent, Mr Peacock calculated a reduction of 40 per cent in final benefit. The realistic figure, given the present distribution of superannuation fund investments, is about 19 per cent. Likewise, for a 28-year-old in receipt of a salary of $24,000 with a tax rate of 15 per cent, the figure calculated by Mr Peacock was about double what the correct figure should have been. The same applies to a 35-year-old on a salary of $35,000. For the benefit of honourable senators, I table an evaluation of the arithmetic and assumptions underlying Mr Peacocks statement, prepared by the Department of Finance.Finally, I note that the real threat to the value of superannuation fund benefits is the consumption tax being contemplated by the Liberal Party, which would erode the value of whatever lump sum was received because of the increases in prices on the application of such a tax. Unfortunately, the pure fabrication or product of innumeracy, whichever it was, which Mr Peacock put out a few weeks ago, was widely published by the Press. So far it has shown no interest in publishing the corrections.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[11]/answer/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

104,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator RICHARDSON","4E4","NSW","ALP","N/A",1538,"—National accounts are primarily the responsibility of the Treasurer and I will not attempt to answer all of the question that relates to him although Senator Coulter has raised a number of issues within the environment portfolio and I will attempt to address them. In the last 200 years Australia has managed to lose half of its forest and to degrade half of its land mass. Also our air and water are still being polluted. In the Murray-Darling Basin alone, it is estimated, we lose $220m a year because of land degradation and the figure for soil erosion throughout Australia is calculated at something like $700m per year. Cost-benefit analysis is important, but not just in relation to heritage and park proposals: it has to be remembered that only 4 1/2 per cent of Australia is within parks or World Heritage areas. So over 95 per cent of Australias land is outside national parks but nonetheless subject to environmental degradation.National accounting procedures are designed to provide information so that we can analyse the performance of our economic system, and our economic performance obviously depends to a large extent on the continuing and sustainable use of our resources, including soil, water, minerals, fisheries, forests, plants and animals. As I understand it, manufactured assets such as buildings are valued as productive assets and their depreciation is written off against the value of production. That shows up in national accounts, but much of our national resources are not so valued and consequently they are not shown up in looking at depreciation against current income.I understand the point that Senator Coulter is trying to make; that is, that in considering stocks and flows in national accounts the example of cutting down a native forest is a good one. If we simply export most of the forest as woodchips we may lose an extremely valuable asset for a sum of dollars. National accounts then do not show up the effect of the destruction of the forest such as the loss of plants and animals and the general degradation of the land and water catchments. With respect to value adding, it has always been the policy of the Government to encourage as much value adding as possible to resources in processing; otherwise, we would be missing out on the best return from our natural assets. Nevertheless, I do not think Australians regard all of our natural resources simply in dollar terms. There are some values that go beyond mere economic measurement.As to recommending changes in national accounts, their preparation is obviously the responsibility of the Treasurer and the Australian Bureau of Statistics is the relevant agency. Nonetheless, the Australian Environment Council has been addressing this problem and is to produce a paper on it. It has been working with the Bureau of Statistics to investigate ways in which the depletion of our national resources could be taken into account in looking at our national accounting procedures. I welcome those advances. Nonetheless, we should not be misled into believing that dollar values can be placed on all aspects of the environment that we care for. Even considering the suggestions made by the honourable senator, cost-benefit analysis will not provide all the answers. I suggest that, rather than applying cost-benefit analysis to the exploration of that 4 1/2 per cent of Australia that is protected within national parks, processes should also be developed to estimate more thoroughly the costs and benefits associated with the use of resources in the 95 per cent of Australia that is outside national parks and outside protection.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[13]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I was asked whether I could cost Mr Lloyds apparent alternative policies. His alternative policy appears to entail no threshold contribution from the State before it attracts a Commonwealth subsidy. If that is correct, the cost of the change he is proposing in Queensland alone would be around $14m and for Australia as a whole it would be around $77m. So what Mr Lloyd was proposing, like Mr Sharp, is in fact a $77m increase in taxation.I was asked whose constitutional responsibility it is. The answer is that the constitutional responsibility rests with the States. However, the Commonwealth Government for some time has maintained arrangements to assist States in periods of unusually high levels of damage caused principally by drought, flood and fire, given that the risks of such occurrences can be carried more effectively by the larger, that is, the Commonwealth Government, than by any State government. That arrangement has been maintained for some time at considerable cost from time to time to the Commonwealth Budget.

110,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COOK","RF4","WA","ALP","N/A",1540,"—Secretary John Herrington visited Australia early this week. I think he may still be in the country, in the Northern Territory, looking at the Ranger uranium project and later going on to Borneo. Secretary Herrington was confirmed in the position of US Energy Secretary in 1985 after having served in the White House as an adviser in other areas. Since he has been US Energy Secretary he has pushed in the US Administration an interest in developing alternative liquid fuels. He has raised the issue of alternative fuels in the International Energy Agency (IEA), a sub-agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. More recently he has been, in part, responsible for backing an Australian initiative in the IEA for getting full transparency in terms of protection for coal as an energy source. In the third coal round of the IEA the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany and Japan resisted Australian overtures to quantify the level of protection for coal in those countries. The US supported us. We now have quantification of levels of protection for coalmining in those countries through the IEA. We are pushing for full transparency.The main purpose of Secretary Herrington being in Australia was to sign on behalf of his Government-with me signing on behalf of the Australian Government-a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Australia and the United States on alternative energy supplies. That memorandum of understanding says in its introduction that its purpose is to expand and enhance both countries efforts to improve energy security. That is the emphasis this Government puts on energy-to ensure security of energy supply, not, as Senator Parer said yesterday, simply self-sufficiency in oil. Our approach to that matter is the same as that of the United States because both countries are in a similar situation. Our recoverable reserves of crude oil will decline, as opposed to our need for crude oil, as the end of the century draws near. It is our belief that we should enhance our strategic supply while bolstering research into alternative energy sources, in particular, alternative liquid energy sources. As I have said, that is also an interest of Secretary Herrington.The MOU that we have signed reflects that. It also reflects a joint understanding by Australia and the United States on three projects in particular, the first two in which Australia will have access to ongoing research in the US on alternative fuels and, in particular, research on alternative liquid fuels, specifically into methanol. The MOU reflects the access by Australia to US research in those areas. The US, for its part, will take advantage of what we can inform it of in terms of the energy chemistry division of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the activities it is conducting in oil shale research in this country. So the MOU consolidates the international initiatives Secretary Herrington has taken in the IEA on alternative energy sources. It brings Australia into that picture, enabling both countries to share in it-a considerable achievement.The Executive Director of the International Energy Agency, Madam Helga Steeg, arrived in Australia today, which will enable further talks between this country and the IEA on alternative energy sources. The significance of the $1 increase in the price of a barrel of crude oil reported yesterday and an analysis of other trends in world energy demand lead me to indicate that Australia is one of the few net exporters of energy. Between now and the end of the century Australia will export, in net dollar terms, energy to the value of $63 billion. Thus it is important that we have the talks we will have with Madam Steeg today. The exercise undertaken by Secretary Herrington is also very valuable for this country.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[16]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

114,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOLKUS","XE4","SA","ALP","N/A",1541,"—I wish to add to an answer to a question asked by Senator Devlin in the Senate yesterday. In answer to a question from Senator Devlin on the advertising of wine coolers, I indicated that a food standard covering wine coolers governing the level of alcohol content and the size of the container was ready for adoption. The food standard covers the naming and labelling of certain alcoholic beverages, including wine coolers. An agreement, however, on the level of alcohol content and the minimum size of the container was also reached between Federal and State Health Ministers and the industry late last year. At the end of my answer I mentioned that Lindemans had agreed to change the labelling of the wine cooler. What Lindemans informed me was that it would no longer use the words `Government Endorsed in its advertising campaign. I again thank Lindemans for its constructive response to my inquiries on this matter.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[17]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
115,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","VIC","ALP","N/A",1541,"—Yesterday in Question Time Senator Knowles accused me of misleading the Senate in a matter relating to Amann Aviation Pty Ltd. Having now checked, as I said I would, the relevant materials, I rise to set the record straight. Senator Knowles initially asked me on 18 March whether the then Department of Transport had released confidential financial information which it had obtained from Amann Aviation Pty Ltd to Mr Graeme Campbell, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who subsequently disclosed that information to Skywest Airlines Pty Ltd. I replied that I had no information whatever about these matters but would be glad to follow them up if Senator Knowles had any evidence to back up her assertions.I have nothing to add to the answer I gave on 18 March except to draw to the attention of the Senate that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, in a personal explanation in the House of Representatives on 23 March, described Senator Knowless suggestion as a total falsehood, with no substance whatever, and stated that the information he had on the proposed financing of Amann Aviations aircraft had been provided by Mr Robert Amann himself for the express purpose of responding to certain allegations that had been put to Mr Campbell by Skywest.Senator Knowles, yesterday, on 13 April, claimed that my answer of 18 March misled the Senate because, she said, this matter was raised in a letter to me by Mr Vanda Gould of Amann Aviation of 9 February to which I had replied in a letter sent on 1 March, dated erroneously-I acknowledge-`30 February. I deny absolutely that I misled the Senate in any way. Senator Knowless question of 18 March was not about my knowledge of some particular allegation that may have been made but whether I had knowledge of certain matters of fact, that is, communication supposedly made by the Department to Mr Campbell and by Mr Campbell to Skywest. My answer remains as it was on 18 March-that I had no such knowledge-and I note that Senator Knowles has not provided any evidence in regard to this matter.The most that Senator Knowles could possibly claim is that I had knowledge, as a result of the Vanda Gould letter, of allegations made by Amann Aviation along the lines of her question. However, having refreshed my recollection of the contents of this 16-page letter, I find it very difficult to construct such allegations, and suggest that any other senator would find likewise, from the relevant two paragraphs which I table and seek leave to incorporate in Hansard.Leave granted.The paragraphs read as follows-By March 24, 1987 Bill Meeke was fully aware of Amann Aviations association with the Westpac Banking Group. When Mr Graeme Campbell, the Federal MP for Kalgoorlie, spoke to Bill Meeke on that day, Mr Campbell said that Amann had arranged his finance with Westpac to which Bill Meeke replied that this was incorrect, that Amann was still hunting around to put together his financing arrangements and that Westpac had not approved the loan finance.In view of the actual experience of Amann Aviation with respect to finance with lenders being ``warned off (as outlined in my previous letters) I point out that Skywest was fully aware at an early date of these confidential details which were provided by Amann Aviation only to the Department of Transport.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[18]/answer/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"
116,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","VIC","ALP","N/A",1541,"—These paragraphs are very imprecisely expressed, and at best convey implicit allegations. Moreover, there is nothing in them inconsistent with Mr Campbells explanation of what occurred. I point out, finally, that the letter of 9 February was but one of four which I have received from Mr Vanda Gould in recent months. Together they total some 57 pages, make a very large number of allegations and assertions, and generally are not missives of a kind such as could be expected to long detain the personal attention of any Minister in any government. I should perhaps add to that, in view of any possible misunderstanding, that there can be no suggestion that the Vanda Gould letters were not responded to in a proper way.I initially referred the matters raised by Amann Aviation to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in November 1987, when it appeared that Mr Vanda Gould was making allegations that might involve breaches of Commonwealth law. I similarly referred Mr Vanda Goulds letter of 9 February to the AFP to take such action as it considered appropriate in response to such allegations as it could identify. I have also urged Mr Vanda Gould, in my replies to him, to himself place any information he may have in relation to these matters before the Australian Federal Police. I am advised that Mr Vanda Gould has declined to be interviewed by the AFP on his legal counsels advice pending the completion of current civil proceedings.The very last thing I would say is this: it is no light matter to accuse a Minister of misleading the Senate. I suggest that Senator Knowles think long and carefully about the weight and the credibility of the information in front of her before she makes similar accusations in future.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[18]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
