I had the privilege, when in Adelaide last week, of investigating houses that had been constructed by the Housing Trust of that State, and a further investigation of them will be made by officers of my department in the very near future. There are certain differences between the costs of land and materials in Victoria and the costs in South Australia; but the honorable gentleman, and other honorable members, may rest assured that the action which the Government is taking will result in the economical construction of homes that will prove both adequate and congenial, and the rents charged will not be at all disproportionate to those of private homes in the neighbourhood.","HOUSING FOR MUNITION WORKERS","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
