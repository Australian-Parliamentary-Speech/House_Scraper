I do not have the date in my mind, but I think the departments were asked to reply by 3rd April. The Prime Minister has obtained the cooperation of the Premiers in pinpointing research expenditures in the States. He asked them to nominate Ministers with whom I could deal and who would be interested in research. They have nominated Ministers, and these number SO.

There is no basic conflict at all between what the GovernorGeneral said in his Speech and the statement I made that the economy is now somewhat overheated. 1 trust that the Leader of the Opposition has seen the latest statistics which were put out by the Commonwealth Statistician yesterday on the national income and expenditure for the December quarter. If he has not, I hope he will. From those figures he will reasonably deduce that the pressures which have been evident for some time have built up lately and have built up quite sharply. What was said in the GovernorGenerals Speech was a reasonable deduction at the time. In the period since, the economy has not fallen into a disastrous situation or anything approaching it, but the inflationary trend is now a matter for concern. Next week the Leader of the Opposition will also have the benefit of being able to study the lastest employment statistics in great detail when they are announced by my colleague, the Minister for Labour and National Service. If after this study, which I hope he will make in the meantime, he has further comments to make on any disparity, I will be glad to answer further questions next week.","AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He has aided those people who denigrate Australias efforts in our very difficult task there. Of course the Leader of the Opposition did not choose to look at all that has been done by Australia in Papua and New Guinea. I recollect reading an article in one of our newspapers which described the present situation in West Irian. I make this point only by way of contrast. According to my recollection of the article, it said that 60 cents per capita was spent on the people there. On the other side of the border the figure is $60 of Australian money, not taking into account the other money which is spent there. I suppose one can compare the two countries. Twenty years ago the Territory of Papua and New Guinea was in just about the same situation as West Irian. It had been ravaged by war; all that was left was, I think, 2 schools and 2 hospitals. Last year I opened a hospital at Goroka which cost $2m. Papua and New Guinea now has 31 high schools, a university, an institute of higher technical training and an agricultural college. All of these were provided by Australia. The allusion to wages and so on is, of course, utterly ridiculous. In Papua and New Guinea the minimum wage is equivalent to S20 a month, but in, for instance, some African countries the minimum wage is only $8 to $12.

At present there are 100,000 Yugoslavs and their dependants in Australia. They have proved themselves to be very hard workers and to have a capacity for effective integration. As I indicated when the agreement was tabled, in the case of Yugoslavia and all source countries for our migration programme, Australia has always reserved the right to determine which settlers will come to our shores. That certainly includes settlers from Yugoslavia.

They did not have access to the domestic market for sales, they were limited by the shipping arrangements, and basically they produced a type of meat that was of a manufacturing nature which was mainly available for sale to the attractive American market. Having been told this I suggested that they ought to make a submission to the Meat Industry Conference on Diversification, which consists of the Australian Meat Board and exporters.

It then began to take steps to reduce the mortality rate, and the rate is now down to 60 per 1,000. But in most areas, because we refuse to classify people according to race, we do not have the special statistics we ought to have, and so we are dependent on private surveys in the Northern Territory such as that conducted by Dr LancasterJones, which showed that in some areas of the Northern Territory the Aboriginal infant mortality rate was 200 per 1,000 compared with less than 20 per 1,000 for the European community. I have seen the statistics for Alice Springs. They are not kept separately according to races but those who have abstracted them, in what is, at any rate, a high degree of likelihood as to selection of race, show that in those considered to be Aboriginals there is a very, very high mortality rate indeed.","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","ABORIGINALS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/para[6]","N/A","N/A"

One of the things which emerged from the conference and it was a concrete suggestion was that the use of unfortified milk in the period immediately on weaning was a great source of trouble. The view was expressed that if the Aboriginal mothers could be induced to use fortified milk in place of unfortified milk a great many of the problems not all of them, but a great many of them would be eliminated. When I heard this and found this opinion expressed by the most competent authorities I checked it in a number of places and personally contacted a number of doctors who were active in the field of Aboriginal welfare.

I found that the fortified milk was available free of charge but it was not being used and they could not induce the Aboriginal mothers to use it consistently. This is exactly in line with what the Medical Journal says, that there will be a great number of disappointments and much that is disheartening. So I have taken another step in this regard. I have had some tests made in adding specific amounts of iron and ascorbic acid to unfortified milk so that it will have the virtues of fortified milk. At the present moment on my instructions experiments are being conducted to find a product which can be placed in normal stores and which will have this fortifying element in it. I believe that within a few weeks the experiments will be completed.

It is not a small thing, but it is not the whole answer. I cite this as the kind of concrete thing we are doing in order to approach and overcome the very real problems which the honourable member for Fremantle has brought forward. This is related to the thesis of Dr Kalokerinos, which he elaborated when he saw the circumstances of many Aboriginal children in the west of New South Wales. He believes, rightly or wrongly, that there is some kind of mechanism perhaps a genetic mechanism which makes it difficult for Aboriginal infants to absorb ascorbic acid and therefore there is a tendency towards scurvy amongst them.","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","ABORIGINALS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[7]","N/A","N/A"

But there must be a proper relationship between the capacity of a select committee of Parliament and the task in which it would be involved in nominating and selecting sites for new airports, which is another field altogether. It is quite competent for the Committee in the case of Mascot, Eagle Farm or any other airport in Australia, to come forward with facts and evidence to show that the future use of those airports provides some hazard of a nature for which there is no solution. The responsibility is then on the shoulders of the Government to deal with the question of other and alternative sites. That is exactly the way that the Committee set about its task.

This springs primarily from the fact that many aircraft approaching Sydney come over the ocean, circle over National Park and then come on to the runway across Botany Bay. With most of the flights I take into Sydney, particularly in the early evening, I find that this adds between 7 and 10 minutes to the journey from the point of departure, whether it is Brisbane, Grafton, Coffs Harbour or some other centre.

But once it affects the cows in the electorate of Cowper action should be taken. Let us have a look at the Concordes. The British built prototype Concorde is to do 50 high speed test runs shortly down the western coast of Britain, laying a swathe of sonic booms 50 miles wide. Imagine a Concorde on a trip from Brisbane to Sydney passing over the electorate of Cowper and leaving a sonic boom 50 miles wide. During the tests in Britain the sound is expected to be within earshot of 1.7 million people, 700,000 of them in Northern Ireland. Belfast will be the biggest city affected. But it is important to note that a shift in wind could involve Dublin or Glasgow, so we just do not know how far the noise from the boom will spread. The boom will be 50 miles wide but, depending on shifts in the wind, the boom may be heard over a much wider area.","AIRCRAFT NOISE","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/para[4]","N/A","N/A"

He asked what the Government has done to use its influence in the international field in the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is commonly called ICAO. I remind him that when I attended, as leader of the Australian delegation, the last triennial conference of ICAO in Buenos Aires I did, on behalf of Australia, introduce a resolution to the assembly. At that particular time Australia took the initiative in this field by introducing a resolution which was adopted, and a new annexe was added to the convention of ICAO. In other words. Australia led the world in this particular field in the international sense, in having this matter brought forward and raised up on to exactly the same plain as the convention on safety and the other conventions which form the basis of ICAO. When I returned to Australia I made a statement in the Parliament, and although I cannot disclose what was said in the Party room. I did make a statement in the Party room. I also referred to this matter on at least three other occasions in this Parliament. So I would have thought that all those who were members of the last Parliament would have been as much aware as my friend the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones) was of what I think was a considerable achievement by Australia. It showed that Australia was an important civil aviation nation and that it was. playing its part in the international field.","AIRCRAFT NOISE","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/para[3]","N/A","N/A"

I merely say this to try to indicate the emphasis which Australia has placed on aircraft noise. As a result, there has already been an improvement in the perceived noise decibles PNdBs which are generated by the latest type of jet aircraft engines. The honourable member for Bradfield referred to the jumbo jet, or to the first aircraft in this field, the Boeing 747. Bench tests, which were carried out on each engine of course, the engine was enormously greater in thrust than the engine of the 707 showed IS PNdBs less in sound effects than the engine of the 707 showed. This, of course, is a very substantial improvement. I have not the figures since then because I have been out of touch with this field for some months. I believe that when we get the figures for the tests which have been made since the 747 has gone into regular service, we will see that there has been a considerable improvement.","AIRCRAFT NOISE","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/para[4]","N/A","N/A"

My friend the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Turner) has also indicated that he proposes to support the amendment on the basis that this would lead to positive action for the selection of a site for a major airport to service the metropolis of Sydney. I say to the honourable member for La Trobe in particular that I feel that the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Newcastle ought to have been sought to be included as paragraph 1 (k) because the positioning and development of major airports, as the Minister for National Development (Mr Swartz) has made clear, is a problem to be resolved after great investigation, after analyses of the most technical nature, and after considerations involving the governments of the States and local government communities in the various major cities. i would imagine that this is the type of conclusion that can be reached after a long period of time by appropriately equipped people in the technical field and, in the first place, by the advisers of the Government within the Department of Civil Aviation. I feet that if the amendment, for example, were carried and subparagraph (c) of paragraph 1 read: That a select committee be appointed to inquire into and report upon the effects of aircraft noise on persons, property, institutions and communities with which is associated the positioning and development of major airports it might be contested that this in fact does not mean that the Committee could set out to make decisions about or recommendations concerning the positioning and development of major airports unless these matters were to be directly associated with the effects of aircraft noise as such. Therefore, I have suggested to honourable members that the only sensible way in which the amendment could be put would be to include it as paragraph 1 (k) and to make it separate, because it is in fact an absolutely separate matter. Surely a distinguished and honourable gentleman like the honourable member for La Trobe or the honourable member for Bradfield, who is in his own right a lawyer, will agree that this is a reasonable assumption on my part and that if they do vote for the amendment they will only be supporting the honourable member for Newcastle in some political tactics that he is putting forward here this evening. They would not do it for that purpose. They would vote for the amendment only because of its actual validity and I recommend to both honourable gentlemen, including my learned colleague the honourable member for Bradfield for whom I have a great respect, that they consider the amendment and ask themselves whether voting for it would be justifiable in terms of intellectual integrity or whether it would be simply a case of supporting tactics that will bt an irritation here in the House.","AIRCRAFT NOISE","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1/speech[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They say that all we are doing is going about having a look at things and not getting any results, but I should like to assure the House that in the previous 12 months when the former member for St George, Mr Bosman, was Chairman of the Committee, the Committee visited every major airport in Australia, with the exception of Darwin, and examined the problems there. The Committee visited Darwin in February. The former Committee made suggestions which have resulted in the adoption of procedures by the airline companies which have mitigated the great annoyance that many people have had inflicted on them by the new method of transport jet aircraft. One must have a lot of sympathy for the people residing near the KingsfordSmith Airport who have to listen to the noise of these aircraft. People in the municipality of Rockdale have to put up with the noise that is inflicted on them by this modern progression in transport which brings them great benefits but which they do not really appreciate because it impinges on their way of life.","AIRCRAFT NOISE","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/subdebate.1/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Turner) expressed concern about the noise of aircraft using the north south runway which is pointed in the direction of the electorate of Bradfield.

Honourable members will be aware that 2 levels of electorate allowance are paid to members of the House, namely, $2,750 per annum to a member whose electorate is classified as city and $3,350 per annum to a member whose electorate is classified as country. The second schedule to the Act fists electorates for which the lower, or city, rate is paid. The higher, or country, rate is paid in respect of all other electorates. Changes in the schedule are necessary because of the redistribution of electorates. Some existing electorates have been abolished and new city electorates have been created. The classification of existing electorates has also been reviewed following adoption of the new electorate boundaries and changes, in the character of some electorates since 1 956. The new second schedule takes into account these changes. There is no change in the basic rates of electorate allowances for members of the House of Representatives that is, $2,750 for members representing city electorates and $3,350 for members representing country electorates.","Second Reading","PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCES BILL 1970","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1/speech/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

The opportunity has been taken to clarify these provisions in 2 respects. In the first place, clause 3 of the Bill proposes the insertion of a new section which specifies that, for the purposes of paying allowances, the day of election is polling day, or, when there is no poll, the day the result is declared. This practice has been followed for many years in the payment of parliamentary allowances. The Bill therefore gives expression to existing practice. Secondly, under the present Act, parliamentary allowances of a sitting member who stands for reelection but is unsuccessful cease with the election of his successor. Last years redistribution has drawn attention to interpretation of the term successor and to the possibility of doubt arising in cases of changes in boundaries as to the identity of each successor to members of the previous Parliament. Any possibility of doubt is avoided by redrafting the provision to ensure that a member will be paid his allowance until the day before the day of his reelection or, if he is not reelected, the day before polling day. Clause 5 of the Bill covers this matter. I commend the Bill to honourable members.","Second Reading","PARLIAMENTARY ALLOWANCES BILL 1970","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1/speech/para[3]","N/A","N/A"

For the purpose of expedience he chose to muddy the policies of the Australian Labor Party on health and social welfare rather than to debate the alternatives.

Yet this committee unanimously recommended that America end conscription of a selective nature and substitute an all volunteer army. In the process the Commission made some very cogent criticisms of the nature of conscription in Australia. Its report said that the return of Australia to conscription in 1964 had been put up as an analogy that an all volunteer force was not feasible for the United States.

These basic arguments have been reinforced by the economic arguments against conscript forces put forward by the Gates Commission. The basis of this case against conscription is that a tax in kind in the form of involuntary service is imposed on a small proportion of the population. Men are forced to serve in the military forces at artificially low rates of pay. This means that these conscripts pay a form of tax which subsidises those in the community who do not serve. This amounts to a very substantial hidden cost which does not show up in the budgetary costing of the defence forces. There are other substantial social costs resulting from conscription which are not revealed by standard accounting techniques. There are costs borne by young men who are not conscripted but who arrange their lives in response to the possibility of being called up. Another factor is the loss of output to the domestic economy from those called up to serve.","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[6]","N/A","N/A"

But this paper increase in defence spending is actually a shift in the tax burden from a small number of conscripts to the whole taxpaying community at large. Taxpayers pay more in cash for their defence forces but this is achieved by elimination of a vicious tax in kind borne by a handful of 20yearolds.

The benefit of this tax goes to all taxpayers in the form of a lower defence payroll budget. Because young men are coerced into service at pay levels well below what would be required to induce them to volunteer, the whole structure of service pay is distorted. The supply of conscripts can be varied according to demand by the Government. One turn of the conscription screw and any shortfall in recruiting can be sopped up. This puts the volunteer serviceman in an invidious position because his pay rates are not dictated by market forces. They are controlled artificially by a Government which pays lip service to the free play of supply and demand. Again, if there is any lack of specialists in the military forces the conscription laws can be manipulated to fill the gaps. There have been complaints that this has happened in Australia, notably with doctors and engineers. With this very effective tool always at its disposal there is no need for the Government to concern itself with better pay and conditions for servicemen or with improving techniques of recruiting. For volunteer professional soldiers, military service in a conscript oriented army imposes severe financial penalties. These strains are weighing with increasing severity on the non conscript component of the army as their wages and conditions become increasingly noncompetitive.","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[8]","N/A","N/A"

In addition, it is extremely damaging to the longterm status, dignity and effectiveness of the armed forces. The trend of overseas experience is against conscripts and volunteers on the Australian model. Great Britain and Canada have been able to assure their national objectives without resort to conscription. In Britain the abolition of conscription has increased the average length of service per man by approximately 200%. It has reduced the proportion of troops in training by a third, thereby cutting turnover rates and training costs. This has enabled the maintenance of a higher proportion of troops in an effective status.","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[9]","N/A","N/A"

According to evidence submitted to the Gates Commission the quality of entrants is remarkably high and the number of enlistments could be doubled or trebled without difficulty. Now the United States of America has opted clearly for transition to a volunteer army. Australia has relied on all volunteer armies except in the two Great Wars, in the 1950s and since 1964. lt fought in two wars in the 1950s, Korea and Malaysia, without resort to conscription for overseas service. Only in Vietnam, the most dishonourable and discredited war in Australias history, has conscription for overseas service been sanctioned and applied ruthlessly. At a time when countries in a similar position to that of Australia have dropped conscription or are moving to drop it this Government remains wedded to a selective draft and refuses to examine the alternatives. With cynical opportunism the Government has settled on an easy solution which suits it and which it can vary with a minimum of effort. In this context the manpower study announced by the Minister for Defence can be used only to determine the future levels of conscripts required. The probability is that the future will see steadily increasing inputs of conscripts with volunteer levels dwindling as Service pay rates and conditions deteriorate.

He moved that Service pay be brought into line with the pay and conditions of comparable industry. With an eye, no doubt, on his own electorate and the Nowra naval base he has cited the trade groupings and pay rates applying in the Navy. According to a report in the Canberra Times last week this motion has been made to preempt Opposition action on Service pay. Unfor tunately the move comes years too late. Higher pay rates for the Services have been part of the Labor Partys policies for several years. It has been consistently expressed by the Labor Party that substantial improvements in pay and conditions are needed to attract volunteers and to raise the effectiveness of the forces. Therefore the matter that has been placed on the notice paper by the honourable member for Macarthur is not new. As I pointed out, this is a policy that has been advocated by the Labor Party for some years. The honourable member for Macarthur can read the Labor Partys platform on defence. There he will find that we have advocated, as a means of raising a volunteer army for this country, better pay and conditions, to move their pay and allowances to rates equivalent to those in professions outside the armed Services, and in addition to provide to all members of the armed forces the benefits of the war service homes legislation and full repatriation benefits whether they are serving in Australia or whether their service is outside Australia. So there is nothing new in this policy, as undoubtedly the honourable member for Macarthur now believes.","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[11]","N/A","N/A"

However, these pressing problems should not be examined in isolation from the whole range of sociological disabilities affecting servicemen. On the subject of pay and conditions generally, the Pay and Conditions of Service Branch established in the Department of Defence is a commendable innovation, but its work must be associated with a fresh approach to the pay and conditions of servicemen. An approach of this sort has been made in the United Kingdom where the Standing Committee on the Pay and Conditions of the Armed Forces has been established and reports regularly to the National Board for Prices and Incomes. The Committee has made a series of valuable reports on Service pay and conditions and the peculiar disabilities associated with Service life.

No soldier will ever concede that the work value of his job can be assessed by reference to civilian labour. Of course there will be components which are comparable for example, the work of a carpenter or plumber who may transfer his trade to the Services. But there are many aspects of military service which cannot be assessed by a civilian yardstick. In the civilian economy premium pay is offered to attract workers to risky and odious tasks. These are accepted as part of the everyday work of a combat soldier. In the United Kingdom it has been suggested that these peculiar aspects of Service life should be assessed in terms of a special factor called the X factor. This would take into account the special conditions of Service life and provide a compensation factor in Service pay rates. The X factor, as defined by the Standing Committee on the Pay and Conditions of the Armed Forces, takes account of four basic elements peculiar to Service life. The first is the soldiers commitment to his Service and his subjection to a code of discipline much more far reaching than in any form of civilian service. The second is the soldiers exposure to danger on active service. The third is his obligation as part of normal peacetime service to endure bad or uncomfortable conditions while in the field or on board ship.","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/para[14]","N/A","N/A"

The lack of such a study or of some special factor in Service pay rates puts a highly skilled soldier at a considerable disadvantage when compared with civilian earnings. For example, a private soldier of relatively high skill earns about $60 a week, including his marriage allowance. A very highly skilled soldier who is married will earn about $80 a week. A Warrant Officer Class 2 who is also a tradesman of high skill may earn about $100 a week. Against these figures it is worth noting that in the December quarter of 1968 the average weekly earnings for a man were $70 a week. Bearing in mind the demands and responsibilities of Service life, it is beyond question that servicemen are poorly paid on a work value basis.

The evidence is that the Government is just as deficient in its knowledge of trends in military manpower as it is in future projections of the workforce generally.

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition spoke against conscription in particular, selective conscription and about pay and conditions in the Services. Firstly, I shall deal with the question of selective conscription. I think it is true to say that most Australians certainly a good number of the members on this side of the House including myself are not entirely happy with the system of selective conscription.

We needed reserved occupations during the war to maintain our civilian war effort at an acceptable level and we would need reserved occupations now to maintain our national growth at a satisfactory rate. As soon as the concept of reserved occupations was introduced there would be all sorts of abuses. 1 think it would be a worse system than the selective system which, whatever its faults, is at least impartial.","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

In all the other countries he quoted there is a far higher degree of unemployment than there is in Australia. The very success of the Governments policies has made it impossible for it to maintain Australias defence forces at a satisfactory level by voluntary enlistment. The point is that for forward defence planning in any constructive and responsible sense it is necessary to know how many troops one will have at any given time and how many will come in at a later date. The fact of the matter is that the Government is not prepared to abrogate its responsibilities by putting itself in the position in which it is not able to plan for the future defence requirements of this country.","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[2]","N/A","N/A"

I refer to the GovernorGenerals statement that the Government will continue to work with representative organisations to grapple with the problems facing the primary producer. Last week in this House we discussed a matter of public importance, namely, the problems of primary producers. The debate was notable chiefly for the lack of constructive suggestions by the Opposition. I propose to remedy this situation by putting some forward myself. Firstly, I think we should ask ourselves whether assistance is necessary. I think there has been an extraordinary change in recent times in public awareness of the necessity for assistance to primary producers from the public purse. Far more publicity has been given in the newspapers and through other media to the plight in which many primary producers are finding themselves. All honourable members who represent country electorates could speak from their own experience on this aspect. The figures of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, which indicate a fall in primary industry income and so on, are welt known, as are the tables showing the rise in costs. ls assistance justified? I think it is justified, firstly because of the position rural exports have in the national economy. Rural export earnings are still over one half of the total export earnings of this country. Government assistance is justified also from a moral and social point of view. Many of the primary producers who are in trouble today can justifiably claim that they arc in trouble because of the policies pursued by the Government in other fields as well as, in some cases, the deliberate policy of closer settlement which was pursued by the Government very successfully in the 1950s when prices were high. As a result of these policies many primary producers are now in an extremely difficult position, although the policies were adopted by the Government in the light of what was economic at the time. Governmest assistance is also justified because, in general, primary industry is efficient. I know it is very difficult to make accurate generalisations, but the last figures I obtained indicate that the Australian primary producer feeds and clothes 59 people whereas his nearest competitor in any other country in the world feeds and clothes 41 people. Therefore, I think it can bc said that, in general, primary industry is efficient.","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[3]","N/A","N/A"

In the present critical situation there is a danger that the wrong things will be done under the pressure of present circumstances. There is tremendous pressure on industry organisations, on the Government and on the individual members of the Parliament who represent country electorates. In this situation there is a very natural inclination, I am afraid, on the part of industry organisations and individual primary producers to grasp at straws. There is also a very natural inclination on the part of the Government to offer apparent solutions which may be superficially attractive for instance, the concept of direct or indirect subsidies and the producers can be excused if they agree with whoever is advocating such policies.","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[4]","N/A","N/A"

They were not urging apparently facile solutions to their difficult problems.

At the base of the trouble is the fact that with farms which are at the limit of production and which are still earning insufficient income for their owners and their families, particularly those with younger families, it is very difficult to see a way out.

They just cannot earn sufficient income at present day costs and prices under their existing acreage. What does the owner do in these circumstances? The first thing he probably does is to try to borrow in the hope that things will improve. It must be noted that this borrowing is not for the purpose of increasing production or for diversification. Therefore, the income is mainly so that he can carry on.

The conclusion to which I come, therefore, is that much of Australias rural debt, because of the reasons for borrowing, is not capable of being repaid in the existing circumstances, and that, in itself, is a frightening prospect. The interest bill on many farms is the biggest fixed cost of the farmer. But a further consequence of this situation is that the farmer cannot take the measures necessary to increase his production to give him an income level commensurate with the rest of the community. There are two ways by which his income can be raised when he is at the limit of production and prices are not likely to rise and I think we would be unwise to consider that they are likely to rise very much in current circumstances.","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[8]","N/A","N/A"

Undoubtedly, the subsidising of the dairying industry for many years has had the effect of accentuating the surplus position in which we find ourselves today, because the provision of a subsidy was responsible for dairying being conducted in areas which were not entirely suited to it, and production from these areas has accentuated our surplus production and has reduced the equalised price received by producers all over Australia. This factor has operated very much against those efficient producers in the favoured dairying areas of Australia, and it has also resulted in a misal location of resources since the dairying industry is not concentrated in the areas which are most suited to it. Now this subsidy is built in to the system and it cannot be taken out of the system without creating a great deal of disruption and hardship. This subsidy is a classic example of a subsidy ending up harming the very industry which it was designed to help and making eventual solution of the industrys problems even more difficult.

Do not let us forget that the money which will be used to maintain this income will have to come from the 85% of people who do not live in country areas. I think they have every right to expect that money which is provided from the public purse to assist rural industry will result in the strengthening of the industry in the way which I mentioned a moment ago. I believe that help is justified, and 1 believe that those who are going to provide it are entitled to ask that it be provided in a way which will reduce dependence rather than create a situation in which dependence is created for as far ahead as we can see.","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[11]","N/A","N/A"

The second means by which a primary producer can raise his income is by increasing the scale of his operations, but when the farm is at the limit of production on the existing acreage, this can only be done by acquiring more land. At present interest repayment terms of about 8% over 10 years, this is just not a paying proposition under the present level of costs and prices. The result is that land tends to be bought by people who do not have to make a living off it or can afford to accept a very low return on their capital. This situation is resulting in frustration and disquiet amongst the farming community which can see at least a partial solution to its problems but which is unable to do anything about it. 1 believe that the time has come when the Government should have a very careful look at the tax concessions available to those whom I call nonbona fide primary producers. From now on, ] think that whatever concessions are available should be given to existing primary producers, using the Federal estate duty legislation, which was recently introduced into this House, as the basis for definition of a primary producer. Very roughly, a primary producer is one of whom it may be said that at least 50% of his assets and 50% of his taxable income over the previous 5 years have been derived from primary industry 1 say this because in the present circumstancesI do not think we should be encouraging further production when we have difficulty in disposing of what we are already producing. Therefore, my main proposition is for the Government to grant assistance to bona fide primary producers as I have defined them, by making available to them long term loans at lower rates of interest subsidised rates of interest, if you want to call them that. Certainly lower rates would have to be paid for by the rest of the community, but it would result in a stronger, more independent primary industry, rather than one continually having to be propped up by direct subsidies. This therefore fulfils the objective which I mentioned a moment ago of the taxpayer getting better value for his money. In addition to this main proposition should go measures to attack the great problems of rising costs. For example, I would like to see expert economic advisers available to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the adoption of a much more discriminatory and critical tariff policy as advocated by the Tariff Board in its recent reports.","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/para[12]","N/A","N/A"

The Government could well consider taking over the expense of testing the whole of the Australian wool clip by objective measurement, that is. by core testing.

If, as I sincerely hope will be so, the Government makes available substantial funds to encourage a certain degree of amalgamation of farms to take place, there is an equal obligation on the Government to provide generous assistance to those who choose to leave the business of primary production. I say equal obligation because, as in the problems themselves, it can justifiably be argued that the Government itself through its closer settlement schemes and pursuit of the desirable objective of rapid national growth is to some degree responsible for the present situation. The farmer is in general a hardworking, intelligent, independent individual, but as a rule he is not trained for any other job. It is inconceivable to me that all of these attributes and qualities would be largely lost to the community by his having to take an unskilled job and I ask therefore that hand in hand with policies to enable efficient, able farmers to increase the scale of their operations should go provision for those who wish to leave the industry to be trained to continue to play a full and useful part in the economy.

In any case, real feelings of guilt are rare. A study has shown that in the small minority who were depressed after the abortion there was clear evidence of depression and guilt beforehand. Thus, despite all the laws and all the religious and moral arguments, the fact is that more than 20% of the population, at a conservative estimate, has been actively associated with illegal abortions.

Due to the fact that women demand the right to have an abortion they will inevitably find some way to achieve this in certain circumstances.

If a legally qualified medical practitioner is not available some women will attempt to induce an abortion on themselves or they will persuade their husbands to try or they will go to some neighbour or backyard abortionist. At all levels, because of the illegality of the situation, bribery, corruption and extortion add to the misery and suffering, the feelings of anxiety and fear. To all this is added the increased risk of infection, severe illness, permanent damage or even death for some women when the operations are performed in poor surroundings or by unqualified people. To cap it all the community is dismayed by the hypocrisy at all levels and views the law enforcement agencies with scorn, ls it any wonder that the young despise law and order? Paradoxically I have suggested at all levels that the seemingly guilty are not guilty. Whilst some police might take bribes, most ignore the law because they are reasonable and humane. Whilst some doctors charge exorbitant fees to do illegal abortions, most doctors in fact implicate themselves they break the law without any financial return but only because they are humane and wish to help. Many men and women in the community break the law not because they are promiscuous and irresponsible but because they are married, over stressed and desperately seek abortions as the only way out in a perfectly respectable family situation where an unexpected pregnancy threatens the health or welfare of the mother and her whole family.","GOVERNORGENERALS SPEECH","QUESTION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/para[14]","N/A","N/A"

They receive $2 a day more than the American other ranks up to the rank of lieutenant. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition spoke about conscription. Despite the ballot, our system is the fairest and most just of all. The families that made the sacrifices in World War I were the same families that made the great sacrifices in World War II. I could number hundreds of families which made no effort in either war but who, while our men were away, feathered their nests and are now very wealthy. Our system is just and fair. The only unfair part about it is that every lad is not involved. We would like to have every lad involved but because of lack of instructors and the necessary equipment it is not possible at this stage. The voluntary system has never been fair or just for the reasons that I have stated. The Americans have adopted our ballot system realising that there is no better method of arriving at a number when the whole is not wanted. 1 want to speak to all phases of the GovernorGenerals Speech as far as time will permit me. We fought two world wars and the Korean War to prove that an aggressor should never succeed. Once we allow this principle to dissolve the world will be a much worse place.

If honourable members care to refer back to 1966 and examine a pamphlet The Dissent and the Dissenters, prepared by an American journalist, they will see that it proves how right he was and how right we were over Vietnam. In his pamphlet he states that Mao Tsetung and Ho Chi Minh knew that if they could prolong the war sufficiently the doves and weaklings in America would succumb. Unfortunately for a great nation and a great President this is what has happened. Had the psychological war not broken in America and Australia the war in Vietnam would have been over and our men would have been back home. That is the truth and I defy anyone to prove that I am wrong. Just at the time when we were in the ascendancy the psychological war broke and history have no doubt about this will judge many people as traitors to their country. Many clergymen and the like were hoodwinked and unwittingly succumbed to the advice of these other people.

Essentially this proposal was concerned with motor cars and how to facilitate their movement through and around Melbourne.

Thus we have a growing band of astute  speculators cashing in on the profits accruing from the land whose value appreciates and having for themselves for their own private use those profits which more properly should accrue to the community.

If the world wants wool every avenue must be explored and explored urgently to ensure that a price consistent with 1970 basic commodity values is obtained.

This year the industry faces further problems, and so once again it has come to the Government with a plan. This proves that this Government stands ready to act on behalf of the industry.

The RSL had written to the Prime Minister, to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) and to various national newspapers. Indeed, representatives of the RSL had even gone to the national newspapers and asked them to print that conferences in New South Wales and Queensland had condemned strongly and violently this most atrocious and disloyal call for Australian troops to lay down their arms. But they got no publicity at all. They are wondering what is happening in this country when these things can happen and where no action appears to be taken. They wonder when somebody gets up and says: Well, this is a question of policy and it is a matter of what decision I make when I make my decision. I am not criticising the AttorneyGeneral for this because I can understand his problem, but surely to goodness if we expect men to go to Vietnam to fight for this country, each and every one of us, whether we agree with the war or whether we agree with the issues or not, has to see that they are supported. Anyone who has seen mutiny or has seen mutiny threatened in a situation where the morale of troops is lowered knows how terrifying it can be.

I was interested in one remark by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) and I am sure you also were, Sir. He said he found difficulty in being defiiant. I have never before seen him labouring under that difficulty. Perhaps you have not done so either, Sir.","Treason","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Firstly, not necessarily by any means in order of importance, may I refer to the questions posed to me by the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Daly)? The honourable member put this to me: Why, if proof of the offence of treason, as defined in section 24 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, requires as one of the ingredients in the proof that the war should be a proclaimed war, does the Government not amend the law so as to abolish that requirement? That, in truth, I hasten to say, is a matter of legislative policy which would require consideration, if any amendment were to be made, by members of the Government other than myself. It does not lie solely within my jurisdiction to alter the law.","Treason","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

I wonder, Sir, how the honourable member for Grayndler would vote? He and his entire Party, unless I judge its members amiss, would vote to retain ingredient in the offence. T think the simple proposition which I have just put to the House serves to demonstrate and I say this with friendly respect that the honourable member for Grayndler is the most artful exponent of the art of shedding crocodile tears that this House has ever seen.","Treason","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/para[2]","N/A","N/A"

All I want to say about the committee in defiance of the National Service Act is that proceedings are pending in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, in the court of appeal, in which the Commonwealth is an intervening party. In those proceedings one of the prosecutors against people who allegedly signed the statement in defiance of the National Service Act is seeking a writ of mandamus against the Clerk of Petty Sessions requiring him to issue warrants for the committal of the defendants to prison. As I say, the Commonwealth is intervening in those proceedings by leave of the court of appeal. I think the House will accept my assurance that for me to open up this question at this present time would infringe most seriously upon a very important rule, and that is that in this House noone should canvass the merits, one way or another, of litigation which remains sub judice. The honourable member for Reid, I hope, will accept my assurance that were I to do so I would be trespassing against that rule and opening up matters which should not be opened up until the court has given its decision.","Treason","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Undoubtedly the resolution was published which, in its natural meaning, amounted to an incitement to mutiny. I confirm precisely what the honourable member for North Sydney put to me. The terms of that resolution reflected no credit upon those who were responsible for its publication. But i am going to be dispassionate, I am not going to go over that ground. The action by these people has been roundly condemned In terms upon which I could not improve. As a law officer of the Crown it is my task to approach in a calm fashion the question whether people should be prosecuted for alleged offences, fastening upon the principles of law involved, bearing in mind that as AttorneyGeneral I have a discretion whether to prosecute, and that that discretion is to be exercised on clearly settled grounds.","Treason","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/para[4]","N/A","N/A"

However, that is only one of the questions that is relevant to the exercise of my discretion. I have to consider not only that bare question but the further question of whether, upon the whole of the information available to me as a result of the inquiries I made in this case and in the case of Roebuck, a prosecution would be likely to succeed. That is a very important consideration for any law officer of the Crown to take into account before he decides whether to prosecute for an offence. I have exercised my discretion. It is a discretion, of course, for which I am answerable to this House and I readily accept the fact that I am answerable to this House for it. But I say this, and I say it without any hesitation, that after the most careful examination based upon very full inquiries which were made into the case of the mutiny resolution, I concluded, as a law officer of the Crown, that it was not a case in which I should regard it as proper to prosecute.","Treason","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[24]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/para[5]","N/A","N/A"
