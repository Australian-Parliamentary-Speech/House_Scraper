With Johns help, the help of Bob Ellicott and, more recently, the help of Michael Hodgman, I was able to begin to achieve something in that direction.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM KNIGHT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

On a number of occasions he was kind enough to fill in for me when I was not able to attend functions, as often happens in a very large electorate. He was a man of great balance. He and his wife Karla performed a very good function in pulling politicians and their wives closer together when they came to Canberra. In that context Karla has also been a tremendously important person to us. I would like to add my thoughts and prayers to those I have heard expressed to Karla, Jason and Joshua and also, of course, Mrs Knight senior on this very sad occasion.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM KNIGHT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[10]/para","N/A","N/A"

I wish to do so briefly today. John and I were students together at the East West Centre in 1968 and we were both in the same discipline. We became very firm friends. I remember quite clearly the sense of sadness which we felt when John drove me to the airport when it was my turn to come home. He was then respected and greatly liked, possessing all of the qualities to which other speakers have attested. I first met Karla then. My wife Julie and I extend to Karla and the boys our very deep commiserations.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM KNIGHT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I probably knew John Knight longer than most members in this chamber. In 1965 we both joined the Department of Foreign Affairs as cadet diplomats. We had similar careers in terms of postings in which we served. Throughout all those years he was without doubt one of the most outstanding of the group of people recruited during that period. I have no doubt that had he remained in the service he would have been one of the youngest heads of mission that Australia has produced to date. Nevertheless, Mr Speaker, he chose another route as you are aware. He served on your staff. He helped tremendously in our days in Opposition when we developed together foreign policy matters in particular. In fact, he was one of those very rare people able to generate not only a tremendous intellectual capacity but in addition he was a great doer. In every sphere of activity, whether it was sport, his ordinary political activities in the Australian Capital Territory, or his work within the Parliament, he demonstrated a total commitment to life and a total commitment to the objectives before him. He respected the views of others but equally he expected them to respect his views. He achieved in the chamber in which he served so well an undoubted standing which very few people have been able to achieve. Undoubtedly, Canberra has lost a great representative. The Senate has lost a strong advocate and many of us have lost a very dear friend.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM KNIGHT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is sad that on this occasion all but one of the speakers who have so far contributed to this condolence motion are older than John Knight. It is also sad to know that he is the youngest senator to die in office, if not the youngest member of Parliament. He did his job extremely well. Those people who endeavour to do their jobs well suffer a tremendous amount of stress and that dedication eventually tells on them. I remember in particular that John used to take very seriously every issue that came before him as senator for the Australian Capital Territory. I admired him on one occasion when he rang me relatively late at night with a problem regarding one of my constituents which most people would have regarded as being relatively minor. Yet he took it upon himself to contact me so that we could solve this problem as soon as possible. I also went to Japan and China with John in 1977. It was on those visits during difficult circumstances that I realised his tremendous capacities for diplomacy, good common sense, humour and a high degree of tolerance of the idiosyncrasies of his fellow travellers.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR JOHN WILLIAM KNIGHT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is certainly true that it is mainly through committee work that we get some added opportunities of forming friendships, of getting to know people and of understanding some of the work that they do. I joined the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory in 1978 and so for three years I had the enjoyable opportunity of getting to know John both as a friend and as a colleague possessed of considerable skill and ability. All of us on that Committee will miss him very much indeed. His very many fine qualities have been put on record today. I thoroughly endorse what has been said and embrace the sentiments that have been expressed. I simply add that I liked John enormously. I am greatly saddened by his death.

The inquiry was never intended to be a full scale review of the regulation of domestic civil aviation. It was initially expected that the inquiry could complete its examination by the end of January 1981 and the committee of inquiry felt that that was a possible date.","INQUIRY INTO DOMESTIC AIR FARES","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The fact is that throughout my period as Speaker I have permitted the asking of questions based on newspaper reports simply because almost every honourable member seems to base his question upon a newspaper report. If I were to apply the Standing Order strictly, there would hardly be a question in order. It is only when the questioner makes a statement arising out of a newspaper report as to which there is clearly controversy that I call for the member to vouch for the accuracy of the report. I thought I had made clear the reason the question asked by the honourable member for Griffith was out of order, and that is, that I am determined to protect the privacy of party room discussions from either side of the House. That is the reason the question was ruled out of order. I pointed out that in addition, it would have been necessary for the honourable member for Griffith to vouch for the accuracy of the report. But in this case, in relation to this question, were I to rule the question out of order on that ground it would stifle discussion in this Parliament on matters of major national issue which ought properly to be ventilated. It is my intention, exercising the inherent discretion which I have as Speaker, to allow the question. I call the Prime Minister.","AUSTRALIASOVIET UNION RELATIONS","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[3]/answer/interject[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There were Press accounts of the Ambassadors remarks to a number of journalists. I think it is worth noting exactly what the Ambassador said. The reports suggest a failure on the part of His Excellency the Ambassador to understand the Governments position in relation to the Soviet Union, although that position has been explained in general terms to the wider community and in detail to His Excellency the Ambassador himself. The present strained relations between Australia and the Soviet Union are a direct result of the Soviet invasion, occupation and suppression of Afghanistan. The Government, along with many others around the world, condemned that in the strongest terms and took a series of measures in concert with its allies and friends. These measures, as is the case with other countries, remain in force. We certainly stand for the peaceful settlement of disputes, but this did not happen in Afghanistan. We hope very much that it will be allowed to continue to happen in Poland and hope also that the state of preparedness of Soviet forces on the borders of Poland does not herald some other Soviet intention.","AUSTRALIASOVIET UNION RELATIONS","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[3]/answer/talk.start[8]/para","N/A","N/A"

An Embassy official suggested that the Government ignored a request to expand the Embassys trade section. I am advised that no formal request has been received by the Department of Foreign Affairs. If it is, it will be considered in a proper fashion in accordance with the circumstances prevailing between our two countries. Indeed, we have examined some aspects of relationships between the Soviet Union and Australia in recent times and at the appropriate time an intention to apply a more reciprocal relationship to some aspects of that relationship will be revealed. There are proper and improper ways of conducting business between governments. Accusations to journalists, no matter how eminent, represent an improper way of conducting relationships between countries and that procedure is not likely to advance the cause of the Ambassador.","AUSTRALIASOVIET UNION RELATIONS","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[3]/answer/talk.start[10]/para","N/A","N/A"

That part of the remarks of His Excellency the Ambassador adds to grounds for concern felt by the international community concerning Soviet expansionism and militarism. Soviet policies underline the vital importance of Australias relationships with her friends and allies which have been enhanced and improved by this Government over the last five or six years. Again I emphasise that if His Excellency the Ambassador really wishes to advance relationships between his country and mine then the way to do so is clear.","AUSTRALIASOVIET UNION RELATIONS","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[3]/answer/para[2]","N/A","N/A"

I inquired of the secretary of the Labor Council of New South Wales about that situation. We are endeavouring to obtain, through the unions, through the employers and especially through the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia a list of all persons employed there. The extent of our inquiries so far reveal that the persons employed about whom the complaints were madethat is, Korean tradesmenwere either here legally as permanent residents or were here on temporary entry permits. I think there was one such case involving a temporary entry permit. The investigation also revealed that some were here illegally but had applied for amnesty under the Regularisation of Status Program to become permanent residents. We have yet to receive from the unions or the employers concerned any evidence to substantiate the allegations that anyone was here other than by those means.","GUEST WORKERS","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[4]/question.block[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The worst feature of this, of course, is that whenever tertiary students find part time jobs they are inevitably taking jobs away from people who need those jobs even more than they do.

That means that a great class of children of a particular group of income earners who a few years ago would have been entitled to the maximum living allowance under TEAS are now not eligible for the full living allowance simply because the adjustments to the Scheme have failed to take account of inflation that has occurred. A person now has to be very much poorer than was the case a few years ago in order to qualify for the full living allowance. The combination of these two factors has meant that whereas in 1976 40 per cent of university students were receiving living allowances under TEAS, in 1979, on the most recent figures available, only 35 per cent were receiving some living allowance under TEAS.

That is of course what this Government always thought was the natural state of things in this community. One of the most depressing things is that the revolution has really been killed. What we find now is that a very disproportionate number of university students come from families in which the breadwinners received tertiary education of some kind. I cite a couple of figures.

However, I emphasise once again that the levels of allowances and means tests of all forms of student assistance, including TEAS, are reviewed annually in the Budget context and will continue to be reviewed annually.","N/A","SECONDARY AND TERTIARY EDUCATION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/para[8]","N/A","N/A"

Foremost amongst these is their restrictive nature which is the direct cause of their failure to meet the objectives originally set for them. This is especially true of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. TEAS was introduced by the Labor Government in 1974 to open up tertiary education to students from low and middle income families. Since then the real value of TEAS has been eroded and whittled away to a point where many students simply cannot make ends meet and the very people it was designed to help originally are now excluded from tertiary education.","N/A","SECONDARY AND TERTIARY EDUCATION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The means test was recently revised, but it is still outdated. The limit for a maximum allowance is now a family income of $10,321. As the honourable member for Fremantle pointed out, this is now 74 per cent of average male earnings yet in 1976 it was 84 per cent of average male earnings.

In the time available to me, I will set out four brief criticisms of this scheme. The first is the level of assistance. Although, as the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) has pointed out, this level has been increased, it is simply not adequate. Anybody putting a student through the last two years of high school, the senior years, will say that $12 a week assistance is insufficient. Again, the means test is too restrictive. For the full allowance, the adjusted family income must be $7,440 or less and any allowance of any kind cuts out when the adjusted family income reaches $10,080. Thirdly, the scheme does not cater for year 10 students and therefore does not cater for the body of students who are reaching the age of 14 years 9 months and whose family income will not permit them to continue their schooling. There is nothing to cover the student from the age of 14 years 9 months to when he or she begins the final two years of secondary schooling.","N/A","SECONDARY AND TERTIARY EDUCATION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/para[11]","N/A","N/A"

Again, in my electorate office recently there was a widow who had a student in year 12 at school. She qualified under the family income limit but she had missed out on assistance last year because she had simply not been aware of the scheme. The scheme had been so poorly promoted that information about it was simply not available. I can tell the Minister that I have been advertising in the newspapers advising parents that the scheme is available and offering assistance. The response has been quite surprising. There are a number of parents in this country who are not aware of the assistance available to them under this scheme. The intention of the scheme is to assist those families whose children would otherwise be forced, through economic circumstances, to leave school at year 10, the school certificate level in my State. The scheme has failed. It is failing to provide a realistic level of support and it is failing to provide it to all of those families who need it.","N/A","SECONDARY AND TERTIARY EDUCATION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/para[12]","N/A","N/A"

I think the best measure of its worth is the number of people using it. It is estimated that across the whole of Australia there are only 1,940 students using the schemefewer than 2,000 across the whole country. That is a measure of the kind of assistance that the Government is offering and the appropriateness of the scheme to the needs of adult secondary education. Clearly, the scheme needs to be extended. Either the Government should lower the age to 18 if it is an adult schemewe accept 18yearolds as adults in this countryor remove the substantial break clause in regard to secondary education. The Government ought at least to consider the position of those people who are making an effort to educate themselves to high certificate level on a part time basis.

Thus, there has been a significant increase in funds provided and allocated to achieve increases across the range of programs, to which the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) has referred.

The proposition put by Labor Party supporters in this debate is a continuation of their fetish with quantity in education being all important. That proposition flies in the face of the facts. Pouring more and more money into education will not produce a better education system. It ignores the fact that recurrent funds provided per student place at all levels of education are the highest ever in real terms. A major concern of the Fraser Government has been to ensure quality of outcome from the education system. There is no demonstrable evidence to show that funding above a certain level will have any further impact on the quality of outcome of education.

Additional increases in student allowances beyond those provided in the last Budget can be achieved only by reducing some other items of expenditure. Perhaps the honourable member for Fremantle or the honourable member for Macquarie will suggest that we ought to abandon indexed increases in pensions. Perhaps they will suggest that we ought to abandon the provision within the last Budget for young unemployed to earn more without those additional earnings having any effect on the level of their unemployment benefit. Perhaps they are suggesting that the additional money required ought to be taken from some other area within the education vote itself, such as teachers salaries. Given the limits to government spending, that is the real logic of the Oppositions proposals. That is the only way that increases in allowances beyond those provided in the last Budget could be achieved. It is to the great advantage of Australia and to its economic growth that the Labor era of unlimited government spending has well and truly passed.","N/A","SECONDARY AND TERTIARY EDUCATION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/para[2]","N/A","N/A"

It is not acceptable for the family to abdicate responsibility for the continuing welfare of members of the family who have chosen not to enter the work force. To abdicate that responsibility completely to government, and therefore in the final analysis to taxpayers, is certainly not acceptable to the Liberal Party either in philosophy or in practice. Of course it is the aim of the Labor Party to make as many as possible dependent on the Government. For the wellbeing of the community it is essential to ensure that people retain the maximum possible independence from government. As the Auchmuty inquiry concluded, there is no short cut to improved education nor national consensus on what improved education implies. The Fraser Government will continue its commitment to quality education well aware that the short cuts of big spending proposed by the Labor Party will not achieve the goal of quality education.","N/A","SECONDARY AND TERTIARY EDUCATION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/para[3]","N/A","N/A"

A single woman, aged over 70 years, who resides in my electorate, worked for most of her life for the then New South Wales Government Department of Railways. She is now in receipt of a Department of Railways pension. She, like a lot of other people in this community, cares for her fellow man and would like to try to do something to help. She has some small savingsan amount of some $7,000. She keeps $2,000 of that $7,000 in a bank account. In her own words: That money is to bury me. Previously, on a number of occasions, I have brought to the attention of the House the attitude of a number of pensioners who like to keep some money in the bank so that they can pay for their funeral. But the Government imposes a charge on them if they receive any interest on that money. The lady to whom I have referred has placed the remaining $5,000 into a Department of Main Roads loan because she believes it is better to put her money into government bonds than to have it in the bank or to invest in any other more speculative areas.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","This woman receives $55.50 a fortnight from the New South Wales Department of Railways as superannuation and $28 a fortnight interest from the Department of Main Roads loan. The money which she receives in interest she places at the disposal of Technical Aid to the Disabled Charit able Organisation. This is a charity which does a great deal for people in distress in this country. It is a charity to which we should be giving a little more attention, particularly in the International Year of Disabled Persons. This woman, who wants to do something for her fellow man, makes that money available to those people because, as she has said, she does not really need the interest herself. But she has started to run into trouble because, unfortunately for her, if one adds up the pension and the interest which she receives one finds that she earns $1.75 a week more than the $40 which she is allowed to earn, and, therefore, loses the majority of pension benefits. It does not matter, so far as the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Social Security are concerned, that she pays that $28 a week to a needy charity. It does not matter that she has some concern for her fellow man. The money which she receives is considered to be income and she is penalised for it.

I noted at that time that a great body of medical opinion suggests that it is much more beneficial to aged people to stay in the home environment for as long as possible. They can be assisted by home care services. I have extracted the Victorian figures. The Federal Government has provided to Victoria on a matching grant basis far more than it has provided to New South Wales.

The most obvious way of protecting the public is to ensure that a broker himself has adequate insurance cover against liability of the client. The appalling fact revealed by the Law Reform Commission report and this companys collapse is that roughly onethird of all broking houses in Australia have no cover whatsoever of this type, let alone adequate cover. That is an indictment, and it is high time that the Parliament itself took action to implement appropriate legislation. If we see it in the brokerage field, we can see it in the insurance field.

The Bathurst circuit, at Mount Panorama, is the last true road racing circuit remaining in Australia. It has special significance for both road racing enthusiasts and bicycle racing enthusiasts.

It is the only public circuit in Australia and, as I have said, it is the venue for not only the Hardie Ferodo 1000 motor racing event but also the motor cycle grand prix of Australia. In conjunction with these events, private industry has invested a considerable amount in the circuit, the total asset value of which at present is some $7m.
