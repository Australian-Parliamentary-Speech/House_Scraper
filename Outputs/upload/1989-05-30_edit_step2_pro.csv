The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:We are concerned about the increase in violent television programmes for children and particularly those programmes promoting violent toys that are available for sale in Australia.Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you support the Broadcasting (Prohibition of Violent Programmes for Children) Act 1988 which has been presented by WA Independent Senator for Nuclear Disarmament, Jo Vallentine. This act aims to prohibit the broadcasting of childrens TV programmes that are violent and that promote toys modelled on characters, weapons or other war accessories which are also available for sale in Australia.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia showeth:That your petitioners deplore the Federal Governments decision to remove 53 pharmaceutical drugs-including the best available for the treatment of high blood pressure, cancer, epilepsy, high cholesterol and uneven heartbeat-and place them for cost saving reasons only on a special list requiring authority from a Canberra bureaucrat, and;That we believe a patients doctor is clearly the best judge for medication needed for their particular illness and that it is therefore wrong and unfair to force that doctor to waste valuable time referring a case to a person in Canberra who has no personal knowledge of that case.Your petitioners pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should heed the above. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.To the Honourable the President and Senate assembled in Parliament:The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate that the Government is about to introduce into the Senate, legislation changing health insurance. These changes will increase the cost of health insurance to members of employee based funds and will do nothing to help the elderly, as is being claimed. Big public funds will increase their surpluses by taking money from more efficient funds. People will be forced back onto Medicare, which will not help to maintain private health insurance.Your petitioners therefore pray that the Senate reject this legislation.To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth, that:We are concerned that the National Party in Queensland is diverting money given by the Federal Government to the Queensland Government to alleviate natural disasters; that it might not be finding its way to its intended targets; and that it is being diverted to the coffers of the National Party itself or otherwise to expansion projects promoted by members or supporters of the National Party.Your petitioners therefore humbly pray the Federal Government be asked to legislate for an audit of account from the Queensland Government for every dollar or cent provided by the Federal Government for any type of relief operation in Queensland.To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in the Parliament assembled, the petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the Senate to the continued Government interference in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which has severely affected the viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide the quality and quantity of services to which we Australians have as a right.Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to guarantee the provision of our adequately funded Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which ensures the availability of Pharmaceutical Benefits through local community Pharmacies.And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.To the Honourable the President of the Senate and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that,Australias population is ageing and most people require more health services as they grow older.If open not-for-profit health Funds are to be able to meet the costs of providing benefits to their older members at affordable rates, they need to share these costs equitably.Some health insurance organisations are being allowed to avoid meeting the health costs of sick and elderly people.Your petitioners humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to, take the necessary action to reverse rising cost trends and provide positive incentives to encourage all health funds to share the cost of health care for sick and elderly Australians.And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/petition.grp/proctext/interject/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
6,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"The PRESIDENT",10000,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—Pursuant to the procedures laid down by the Senate under its resolutions of 25 February 1988, Senator McGauran has raised with me a matter of privilege. The matter which he has raised is an allegation that Senator Schacht, in speaking during the adjournment debate last night, made use of an unauthorised record of proceedings of a meeting involving senators and disclosed those proceedings without the permission of the meeting. Under the procedures prescribed by the Senate, I am required to determine whether a motion relating to the matter should have precedence over other business, and in doing so I am required to have regard to certain criteria.In assessing this matter, I have assumed that the facts are as alleged, namely, that the proceedings of the meeting were recorded and disclosed without the authorisation of the meeting, and I have considered whether such actions should be investigated as a matter possibly involving contempt of the Senate. The Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 provides, in section 4, that the essential element of a contempt is that it involves `an improper interference with the free exercise by a House or committee of its authority or functions, or with the free performance by a member of the members duty as a member. I believe that it would be stretching the contempt jurisdiction of the Senate beyond its proper bounds to hold that an unauthorised disclosure of the proceedings of an informal meeting of senators could constitute an improper interference of the kind referred to in that section.Moreover, one of the criteria to which I am required to have regard is `the principle that the Senates power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for Senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions. I do not consider that the matter raised meets this criterion, in that, even if the facts are as alleged, it would not in my view be open to the Senate to find that there had been an improper act tending substantially to obstruct the Senate, its committees or senators. For these reasons I have determined that a motion relating to the matter should not have precedence over other business.","N/A","PRIVILEGE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/proctext/interject/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
7,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"The PRESIDENT",10000,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—Senator Coates has raised with me another matter as a result of the remarks made by Senator Schacht last night, namely, the security of the sound reinforcement system in committee rooms. Each committee room is fitted with a sound reinforcement system which reinforces the sound within the committee room and may also be used to broadcast proceedings on the internal broadcast systems throughout the building. I am advised that the meeting in question was publicly announced and listed on the television monitors throughout the building. There is some evidence to suggest that the broadcast system may have been active during the meeting in question. I have asked the Usher of the Black Rod and the Parliamentary Information Systems Office to make an urgent and full investigation of the matter.I am very concerned about these matters, as is Madam Speaker. Following receipt of a full report on it, the Speaker and I will direct that the system be modified in such a manner as to ensure that participants in meetings in the committee rooms will be aware at all times of the status of the broadcasting and sound reinforcement systems in the rooms. In particular, it will be important to ensure that during private meetings the systems are completely inactive and that occupants of the rooms have a clear indication that the systems are inactive. I will keep honourable senators fully informed on these matters.","N/A","COMMITTEE ROOM SOUND REINFORCEMENT SYSTEM","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/proctext/interject/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do, however, indicate that the Opposition regards this matter with great seriousness as a situation which warrants the most careful examination by the Senate and as a matter which may or may not give rise to a matter of privilege, but which almost certainly involves censurable behaviour.On behalf of the Opposition I welcome the fact that as soon as the matter was drawn to your attention, Mr President, you took the matter up and that you have taken the matter up with the other Presiding Officer. I welcome your positive statements that action will be taken to ensure that abuses do not occur in the future. As soon as you call for notices of motion this afternoon, I will give notice of a motion, which we will seek to have dealt with at the latest tomorrow morning, calling upon Senator Schacht to leave his pathetic present position of denying the source or refusing to divulge the source of the document from which he quoted yesterday. That is a matter on which there will no doubt be debate when it is brought on tomorrow.To the Opposition, it is apparent on the face of the statements which were made by Senator Schacht last night that there has been a gross breach of confidence in this building and that Senator Schacht was purporting to quote from a document and to give direct quotes from conversations held between senators--","N/A","PRIVILEGE: COMMITTEE ROOM SOUND REINFORCEMENT SYSTEM","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Of course there are. There is a great deal of chat and gossip and passing on of information to people who are not strictly supposed to have it. But we are not dealing with that; we are dealing with the honourable senator coming in and purporting to quote from a document in the form of a transcript. It is of a totally different nature, in a building which is extensively wired for recording, if rooms in this building cannot be used with confidence that meetings are not being taped. This is a very serious matter in terms of the operation of this institution. It is a matter which the Opposition takes extremely seriously.I make no challenge at this time to the view you have expressed, Mr President, that this is not a matter of privilege. It would be too early for me to do that, given that your own opinion has had to be based on an assumption as to the facts which is not proven.

One was the matter of privilege and the other was the matter of the security of the broadcasting system in Parliament House. In respect of the first matter, whilst I listened to and understood what you said, it is my view that what occurred last night has implications for innumerable informal committees of members and senators in Parliament House. I do not know how many of those committees exist but there must be dozens of them. I am a member of about nine of them. One example is Amnesty International. What if a foreign government were to hear some of the discussions that take place in Amnesty International meetings, relating to whether we should be writing to an ambassador, or taking up a matter with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I refer also to the statements that are often made by the representative of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at those meetings. There are serious implications for the running of this place and for the discharge of the functions of members of parliament.This particular group, the parliamentary Pro-Life Group, was established in February last year after all parties were advised of it.

I do not usually depart this place so early, but at about 5 past 10 Senator Walters was asking Senator Walsh questions and I thought, `That ought to see it out for the rest of the night. I was not advised by Senator Schacht-and I am very disappointed about this-that this matter was to be discussed, notwithstanding the fact that I attended a meeting of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters with Senator Schacht only a few hours beforehand. Over a period I have implicitly trusted all of my colleagues in this chamber and in the other chamber, whether or not they disagree with me on issues. I hope that that mutual trust has always been there, whether or not they disagree with me on issues. I am a little disconcerted because this element of trust is now at stake.It is clear that a recording was made because statements were quoted verbatim. The worst part of it was that those verbatim statements were taken completely out of context last night, and it was quite unfair for that to be done.

If he does agree with the Prime Ministers statement, does this mean that the Government will be rejecting the recommendation of the Inter-State Commission (ISC) on depot coverage, which is for the Waterside Workers Federation to man waterfront depots and the TWU or National Union of Workers to man inland depots, with free competition among those depots subject only to customs regulations?

In view of mounting concern in Australia about ageing civil aircraft of all types, can the Minister reassure the Australian public that the findings in the United States report will be examined closely by the Civil Aviation Authority here and that any necessary actions will be taken as a matter of urgency? Finally, has the Australian Government been advised of United States reports that the banning of smoking on domestic airliners, which I fully support, can make it more difficult to detect metal fatigue cracks on aircraft bodies compared with the situation in the past when small nicotine stains on the exterior of aircraft reportedly helped in the discovery of cracks?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[2]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
31,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator GARETH EVANS","VD4","VIC","ALP","N/A",2979,"—It is certainly apparent that any cracks on VIP aircraft will well and truly show up with the Prime Ministers cigars. I do not know about that part of the question relating to nicotine stains. Of all the bizarre justifications I have heard for continuing to allow smoking on aircraft, that is probably close to the limit but I will follow up that part of the question.As to the early parts of the question, the Civil Aviation Authoritys representative in Washington has advised the Civil Aviation Authority of the Boards finding on the probable causes of the Aloha Airlines accident. The full report has not yet been received, but the Civil Aviation Authority has given an undertaking that the report will be carefully examined and any necessary action taken. The honourable senator should be aware, however, that the four contributory causes do not directly affect any Australian aircraft, any Australian operator or the Australian airworthiness authority. All findings relate to lap joint desponding and metal fatigue in early model Boeing 737 aircraft and no aircraft of this configuration are flying in Australia. However, the Civil Aviation Authority is very aware of the implications for similar fatigue and corrosion problems in other aircraft types which are currently operating in Australia and which may enter this country following economic deregulation of the industry in 1990. The airworthiness area of the Civil Aviation Authority is actively working on this problem in association with Australian operators, overseas manufacturers and overseas airworthiness authorities. A research program involving a composite preventative repair of lap joints is currently being negotiated between the Civil Aviation Authority and the Aeronautical Research Laboratories in Melbourne.The matter of ageing aircraft in general has been closely considered by the industry and the United States Federal Aviation Administration recently. A large number of changes to maintenance practices and procedures for these aircraft will start to be introduced shortly in the United States. It is anticipated that their introduction to Australia will follow in respect of those models which operate in Australia.I have a note here about the nicotine question. I am advised that much more reliable methods than nicotine stain examination are readily available for this purpose. I am delighted to inform the Senate that, although in the past cracks have sometimes been found in this way, the ban on smoking, therefore, has not made it more difficult to detect fatigue cracking. If the honourable senator wants further chapter and verse on that matter I would be delighted to do some research and dig the information out for him.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
32,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator STONE","LJ4","QLD","NP","N/A",2980,"—My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to the Treasurers words in his April economic statement when he said:If a government cannot run wages in Australia, it cannot run the Australian economy.I ask the Minister whether he has noted that in the Australian national accounts document released last Thursday the Australian Statistician pointed out:In current price, seasonally adjusted terms, wages, salaries and supplements rose by 3.4 per cent in the March quarter 1989, following a rise of 4.5 per cent in the previous quarter . . .That is, an 8 per cent rise during those six months. Has the total rise in wages, salaries and supplements during the 12 months to March 1989 amounted to no less than 11.7 per cent? How do these figures compare with the Treasurers Budget forecast of a growth in average earnings on the same national accounts basis of 6 1/2 per cent this year? Given a national productivity increase of-and I will be generous-2 per cent per annum, is the Minister in any way concerned about the implications of this sharp rise in wage costs, for both inflation and hence the value of the Australian dollar? Finally, does the Minister agree that, on the basis of these figures, the Government has failed the Treasurers own test of economic competence?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[3]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
33,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WALSH","TJ4","WA","ALP","N/A",2980,"—I have little doubt that what the Treasurer had in mind when he said that if a government could not run a wages policy it could not run the Australian economy was the spectacular failure of the previous coalition Government, especially in 1981 and 1982, when we had wage increases of 13 per cent and 14 per cent respectively. It is true that there have been other periods of extraordinary, unacceptably high wages growth. One of those periods was during the term of the Labor Government in 1973-74. The situation is not unique, but the last wages explosion in this country was presided over, if not engineered by, the last coalition Government. I will check for the record, but the figures that Senator Stone had quoted for wages, salaries and supplements for the March quarter of the year as a whole are, I believe, the aggregate figures. In other words, they measure the total payments and not the unit costs. Therefore, they are a highly inaccurate measure of unit costs because they can be heavily influenced. In that particular 12 months they would have been heavily influenced by increases in the number of people employed and, to a lesser degree, by increases in overtime worked. I do not think the increase in real unit labour costs over the period is known yet. It is certainly not known by me. It will become available at some later stage. But that is the relevant figure, if one is looking at wages, and not the total payments. If everything else remained the same and the number of people employed doubled, obviously wages costs would double but without unit labour costs being changed at all.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[3]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

United States intelligence, at least as reported in the press, suggests that more than 15 countries, including India, Pakistan, Argentina, Brazil, Israel and Egypt, are now engaged in developing long range ballistic missiles. If any country introduces this type of weapon, others in the region are likely to follow, diminishing as a result the security of all states in the region.Australia has very carefully noted Prime Minister Gandhis public statements about the launch, statements to the effect that AGNI is a research and developmental vehicle, not a weapons system, and that India has set an example to the world of a refusal to convert nuclear capability into nuclear weapons and wishes to keep it this way. The Government will continue to urge that governments think long and hard about the implications of developing operational long range missile forces.

36,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HAINES","1H4","SA","AD","N/A",2981,"—My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce. I refer the Minister to my letter to him of 7 April requesting information about the request by James Walker Australia Pty Ltd for the removal of the 10 per cent import duty on aluminium-coated mild steel sheet in coils used in the manufacture of automotive exhaust systems. First, was the Governments decision in December 1987 to discontinue concessional arrangements regarding the import of aluminised steel designed to protect the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP), which produces zircalum, a similar material also used in the manufacture of exhaust systems? Is the Minister aware that BHP apparently supports the removal of this duty providing the material is imported for use in the manufacture of exhaust systems only? Secondly, is the Minister aware that since the import duty on this product was increased from 2 per cent to 10 per cent in 1987, Walker Australia has been significantly disadvantaged in favour of its New Zealand competitors, who are able to import aluminium coated mild steel sheet from Japan on a duty free basis? Can the Minister explain why the Government is allowing a situation to continue whereby a New Zealand manufacturer of exhaust systems is able to gain more of the Australian market for that product due to the imposition of a duty which currently protects no-one? Further, can the Minister explain why the Government, which was so keen to advance the interests of BHP in this matter, is apparently not interested in assisting Walker Australia, the largest manufacturer of exhaust systems in the country, if, as it claims, it is not seeking the imposition of bounties, duties or other barriers to prevent competition from the import of similar products from New Zealand but, rather, is seeking the removal of the duty on this product in order to give it the same competitive base for raw materials as its New Zealand counterparts?","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[5]/question[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
37,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BUTTON","4F4","VIC","ALP","N/A",2981,"—The burden of this question is whether the Government is about helping BHP as distinct from a company called Walker Australia. The concessional arrangements for aluminised steel to which Senator Haines refers were discontinued from 30 September 1987 following a report of the Industries Assistance Commission which recommended that course of action, namely, that the concessional entry arrangements be abolished.It is true, as Senator Haines says, that BHP now supports the removal of the duty, but for a specific end use only: the manufacture of a particular product-in this case, exhaust systems. However, the commercial tariff concession system does not allow concessional entry conditioned by end use. In other words, one cannot obtain concessional entry for a particular end use. That is because end use by-laws-so-called-present economic and administrative drawbacks, and should be resorted to only in very exceptional circumstances.As part of the burden of her question, Senator Haines raised the issue of the detriment to the competitiveness of Walkers as against New Zealand manufacturers. It is true that the imposition of a 10 per cent duty would, in theory at least, disadvantage Walkers against some overseas suppliers. In that connection, there are two points to be made. First, the cost impact is approximately $2 per exhaust system. That, in itself, is unlikely to be a significant disadvantage. Secondly, so far as competing in the New Zealand or any overseas market is concerned, companies such as Walkers, which import aluminised steel and pay a 10 per cent duty on it, are eligible to use the by-law for export scheme. They get a rebate, as it were, of any duty they pay on aluminised steel. Therefore, if they are operating in export markets, that duty does not affect them.Those are the facts of the matter. The Government does not favour BHP over Walkers. The position is determined by an Industries Assistance Commission report and a policy long standing, and that is consistent with overall policy in relation to all industries.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[5]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Despite the early part of Senator Buttons answer, the burden of my question was not about continuing a bounty that protects BHP, but was about continuing a bounty that apparently acts to protect no-one in Australia while benefiting a New Zealand company. Whilst the Minister may not think that $2 on an item is much, Walkers apparently is concerned that it is being disadvantaged, not vis-a-vis BHP but vis-a-vis a New Zealand company. I ask again whether the Government is prepared to consider removing that bounty, as, apparently, it did recently in the case of Shearers.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[5]/question[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Why does the Minister maintain that the military in Indonesia should not act in a traditional military fashion by assessing Australias military posture as a potential threat, given the acquisition of new offensive weapon systems such as the FA18s, with a refuelling capability, six new submarines, backed up by the Geraldton spy base, and a chain of new military bases across the north of Australia, and the holding of the largest peacetime exercise ever held in Australia, starting this July? I draw the Ministers attention to the striking similarity between Kamaria and islands in the Indonesian archipelago. I ask, further, why the Minister insists that the Indonesian military should feel happy with these developments when statements, not only by retired Lieutenant-General Hasnan Habib but also by Dr Des Ball of the Australian National Universitys Strategic and Defence Studies Centre and Russell Rollason of the Australian Council for Overseas Aid, indicate that the Indonesians are concerned. I ask also what the Governments reaction would be if Indonesia were to build a chain of military bases along the archipelago facing south, acquire new aircraft and submarines facing in the same direction, and top it all by holding a massive $96m military exercise aimed at a mythical nation that lies roughly where Australia is on the map. Finally, has the Minister seen articles in the West Australian of 29 April and the Sunday Territorian of 7 May, which draw lurid scenarios of an invasion of Australia by Indonesian commandos on trail bikes?

General Habib was speaking purely in a personal capacity. The official spokesman for the Indonesian armed forces, General Nwihadi, has been quoted as saying as recently as yesterday that Indonesia does not see any threat coming from Australia. Australias defence posture is, in the broadest sense, defensive and the force structure that we are developing reflects this. We have discussed our defence posture and force structure with the Indonesian Government at the highest levels. It has expressed its understanding of the policies that we have adopted. In relation to Kangaroo 89, there is no similarity between Indonesia and Kamaria.Senator Vallentine asked how we would respond to developments in Indonesias defence posture. Of course, we recognise Indonesias right to develop a force structure which meets its security needs just as it recognises our right to do the same. The articles referred to by Senator Vallentine in the Territorian were lurid and sensational. The Australian Government values good relations with Indonesia. We have no reason to believe that Indonesia would undertake hostile acts against Australia; nor do we have any reason to undertake such acts against Indonesia. Therefore, the Minister for Defence does not believe that the scenarios in these articles were credible; nor were they helpful in improving relations between the two countries.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[6]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is fairly obvious that there was a difference in the May Quarterly Review forecast between the actual realisation of $20 a tonne and an export quantity of nearly 16 million tonnes.

Forty-three countries-some of them producers, some of them consumers-are members of the ITTO. Australia has been a member since February 1988. The ITTO Council met last week. A representative of my Department represented Australia at the meeting. With the concurrence of the Malaysian Government the ITTO Council undertook to make a study in Sarawak of rainforest cutting practices and what conservation and human rights issues needed to be considered in the context of what is going on in Sarawak at present. The study team consists of Bolivia, the Ivory Coast and Indonesia representing the producers and Japan, the United States and a Nordic country-probably Norway or Sweden-representing the consumers. On the non-government organisation side environmental organisations will choose someone from the United Kingdom and someone in the timber trade from Denmark.The study will assess the sustainable utilisation of tropical timbers in rainforest areas and conservation and environmental measures that are necessary.

I suspect that that could be applied in this case.The relationship between wage levels and relative unemployment rates for young people has long been a matter of debate and the subject of academic articles. It has not, nor will it ever be, decisively settled. Many young economists will become doctors of philosophy writing theses about it for the next few decades. I certainly do not want to become involved in that debate other than to draw the obvious conclusion that at some point there must be an inverse relationship between wage levels and employability or employment opportunities. More certain is the conclusion that, if there is absolutely no relationship between wage levels for juniors and employment or unemployment rates for juniors, nothing can be gained from providing wage subsidies to employers to employ such people. That conclusion is inescapable, but some of the people who argue most vehemently that there is no relationship between junior wages relative to adult wages and junior unemployment rates relative to adult unemployment rates are some of the keenest proponents of wage subsidy schemes to stimulate employment for juniors.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[9]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

53,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COOK","RF4","WA","ALP","N/A",2985,"—In reply to the first question, I tabled in the Senate last week a consideration of how I had met my obligations in studying the prudent and feasible alternatives under section 30, I think it is, of the Heritage Act. The consideration that I entered into is set out in that document. However, the question related to whether there are limits on what areas have been studied by environmental impact statements and why I did not find prudent and feasible alternatives in those areas. The answer to that question is simply this: as a consequence of a case taken by the environmental movement in the New South Wales Land and Environment Court, the Jarasius case, areas of forest that have not been subjected to an environmental impact statement in my view quite rightly cannot be cut until an environmental impact statement has been conducted. The New South Wales Forestry Commission is conducting an environmental impact statement at present for its cutting for the next calendar year operations. That EIS will be completed in October or maybe early November this year and that will in part show me what prudent and feasible alternatives there might be in other areas outside the National Estate.In any case, the proposal that I put to the New South Wales Government as terms for the Harris-Daishowa woodchip export licence are proposals which would enable me to complete a comprehensive study of the whole of the south-east forest, not just the National Estate areas of that forest, and to make a detailed consideration of prudent and feasible alternatives for the whole of the forest area at the end of the study period I proposed-one year. If the New South Wales Government adopted my proposal, we would be in a position, at the end of the 12-month study period, to plan the long term development of the industry and the long term protection of the environment in the south-east. The prudent and feasible alternatives that I now study are limited by the time span within which I have had to work and that time span after the year I have referred to will be much broader.The second question related to the current rainfall in the area. I have to work on the basis that there are unseasonal and early rains, that they are heavy rains and that they may occur once in 20 years, but they are the rains we are having at present. I cannot plan on the basis of assuming that these rains will suddenly stop and that the one year in 20 scenario will not be realised. I have to plan on the basis of what is practically the case, what is the real operation, and I have done so. If, for some reason, there is a drought between now and the end of the 12-month period and there are no further rains, and if access to parts of the forest which is now not available can be obtained, enabling prudent and feasible alternatives outside the National Estate to be accessed, we would alter our cutting plan to provide for that. That would be a sensible thing to do.Senator Dunn asked what I have done about section 5c. That is an ongoing issue. It is a matter that is regularly monitored. My Department is kept informed of it. There are two commercial constraints. Sawmills would not send material to Harris-Daishowa for processing as woodchips if they had a commercial use for that material, because the best return for them is to cut logs on the basis of their sawmilling use. The income they receive for the material they send to Harris-Daishowa is less than the income they would receive for their sawmilling operation, so there is that commercial constraint on millable material not going for woodchip use.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[10]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In order to move upstream in dealing with our forest output, we need a woodchip operation so that we can move into pulp manufacture, so that we can move into paper manufacture, and so that we can stop being a country that exports raw materials in the form of woodchips and buys back expensive materials in the form of finished paper products. Therefore, I do not see a reason to put this woodchip company out of operation for a period and then require it to start up again, just on the basis of awaiting the outcome of the particular study that Senator Dunn has referred to.

59,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator WALSH","TJ4","WA","ALP","N/A",2986,"—I am aware of some proposals by some Opposition members to cut defence spending. For example, when Mr Peacock became Opposition Leader three weeks ago, or whenever it was, he made Mr Carlton the shadow Minister for defence and said:Ive spelt out the requirements to Mr Carlton as to what I want him to do. I have served myself in a defence related portfolio. I know what has to be done in cutting the fat there and I regard Mr Carlton as the expert to do that in government.That was fighting stuff from the new Leader. He was establishing his new tough image, and trying to rationalise his decision to keep John Howard off the front bench by denying him the defence portfolio. That is, one might think, the kind of thing that might lift a government to have another look at defence spending, which was of course scrutinised by the Government prior to the April statement. However, on Saturday we found out that the Oppositions nerve seemed to be failing it on this matter. Mr Carlton was interviewed by Paul Malone from the Canberra Times. I would like to refer to the whole article but I will select a couple of excerpts. Mr Carlton was asked by Paul Malone:But is there any way of doing these things-increasing morale, having more operations, ammunition and so on-without spending more money?Mr Carlton said:I dont know yet. Thats the real answer to that question. You certainly cant do it by cutting the money any more. Thats absolutely right.I repeat:You certainly cant do it by cutting the money any more. Thats absolutely right.That was a very different tune from the one that Mr Peacock was singing less than three weeks before. It was a very different tune from that sung by some other pipsqueaks on the Opposition front bench in this chamber who are forever demanding more money to be spent on defence. The interview continued:So absolutely no less money will go to the manpower side of things . . .Mr Carlton replied:The April statement has cut the thing way back to zero real increase. Well, we couldnt credibly go into anything that would go below that. Now, Ive got to sort out with my colleagues just at what level we go in or what formula we use.The interview continued in a similar vein. I table the record of the interview and note again not only, most importantly, the total contradiction between what the Leader of the Opposition was saying less than three weeks ago and what his defence spokesman was saying last week but also the much less important contradiction between some pipsqueaks on the Opposition front bench here and the Leader of the Opposition.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[12]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is proposed that design documentation and construction will be carried out using consultants, building contractors and suppliers from the private sector. Tenders were invited for the project on 25 January and closed on 8 March this year.

88,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOLKUS","XE4","SA","ALP","N/A",2990,"—I have seen some reports alleging that some paper packaging products containing dioxin may in fact pose a risk. Generally the problem is that, even though dioxin is insoluble in water, in fat products such as milk it can leach and accordingly there is potential for a problem. However, I think it should be said that the amounts that are used in packaging are extremely small. They are slightly higher than the levels of dioxin found elsewhere in the environment and, as a consequence, the National Health and Medical Research Council has advised that, although it is currently examining the issue in general, there is no significant health hazard in the particular instances that have been reported. That report is also confirmed by studies in the United States of America (USA) and New Zealand, where the authorities also indicated that the extremely low levels of dioxin in packaging in similar circumstances also present no hazard.The concern that Senator Devereux raises is one that has been reflected generally throughout the community, not only in respect of packaging but also in respect of the general question of the use of dioxin in paper products. Consumers are concerned that the use of such a chemical is purely for aesthetic value and to enhance appearance. The concern extends also to the fact that, as we all know, the impact on the environment of such items as waste by-products in the manufacturing process is also of concern. Indeed, the concern extends overseas, to the extent that there have been consumer boycotts in the United Kingdom, Sweden and the United States of America. The Governments of Sweden and the USA have moved to eliminate the process from pulp mills. This concern is felt also by industry, to the extent that, for instance, Tetra Pak (Aust.) Pty Ltd in Australia has now embarked upon a contract for the use of paperboard from Scandinavia-board that is not subject to chlorine bleaching. The company is doing that not particularly for health reasons but because of environmental concerns.Getting back to the question of bleaching, I think it is fair to say, on the advice of the National Health and Medical Research Council, that there is no significant health hazard, but that Council will keep this issue under active consideration.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[17]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But the report goes on to say-and this is what I want to correct:He predicted official March quarter figures due out Wednesday-that is, tomorrow-would show gross foreign debt had risen to around $140 billion from $121.17 billion at the end of 1988, while net foreign debt would probably top the $100 billion mark . . .The reference to net foreign debt is accurate, but I want to correct the reference to gross foreign debt.

107,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TAMBLING","6E4","(Northern Territory)","NP","N/A",2992,"—I move:That the Senate take note of the paper.This report is important for what it does not say, not for what it does say. Initially, I would like to commend the very hard working staff of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) throughout Australia, which in the past year or so has laboured under extreme conditions of hardship and scrutiny and has got on with the work of fulfilling many great projects and targets for Aboriginal people. But the political agenda is far different, and that is the issue that I would want to be critical of. For example, this report that has been tabled is the first report in six financial years that does not have a chairmans introductory comments or remarks. The fact that tomorrow sees the resignation of the Chairman of the ADC, Mrs Shirley McPherson, should be put into its proper context. Maybe there is a straight parallel to that. Obviously, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) has in some way edited this report.If one looks at the introductory comments to the report, there is a statement by the Minister, naturally. As I have said, there is no statement by the Chairman. There is a list of the routine functions of the Commission, and then a list of the commissioners. Who are the commissioners with their names and photographs listed? Other than Mrs McPherson, who has been there since 1984 and Chairman since 1986, and Commissioner Zona Martin, who was appointed in 1986, the other commissioners listed are those commissioners who were handpicked by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, on 13 May 1988, six weeks before the financial year, the subject of this report, ended. Nowhere else in this report is there any commendation of the work of the former commissioners. What an insult to the great work of these previous commissioners who have gone unnoticed and who have obviously been pulled out in this respect. It is also interesting to note that missing from the list of commissioners as at 30 June 1988 is Mr Charles Perkins, the Secretary to the Department, who was sacked by the Minister in November 1988 but who was in fact a commissioner as at June 1988. His credits do not even appear in the report. To give Charles Perkins his due, there were many issues on which he was a leader in many of these particular areas.As I have said, this report is notable for what it does not say. There is no mention made of the fact that the former commissioners, who were there for some 11 months of the financial year, had called into question the Ministers proposals to establish a new Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). There is no mention anywhere in the entire overview of the considerable work done by the former board and commission and the contribution it was seeking to make on behalf of many other Aboriginal people throughout Australia. There is no mention of the very significant impact that ATSIC is to have on the operations of the Aboriginal Development Commission if it is ever to be instituted. There is no comment at the front of the report with regard to the qualifications that exist in the book sections of the report by the Australian Audit Office of the ADC itself or of the various subsidiary companies, including Baruwei Enterprises Pty Ltd, a company which has subsequently gone into liquidation. There is no mention in the early part of the report of the serious political problems for the Government. Once again, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, has chosen to fiddle around, to muck about, and to withhold important information from this Parliament. As I said in my opening remarks, much good work has been done by the staff and the commissioners of the ADC-that is listed in the back part of the report, which relates to the projects-but the political agenda has been falsely and deceitfully misrepresented by the Minister.","N/A","ABORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I remind honourable senators that this organisation was established while Senator Chaney was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs; that the second reading speech on the Bill establishing the Commission was given by the only Aboriginal senator ever to serve in this place, Neville Bonner; that it has been an entirely Aboriginal organisation in terms of its directors; and that it has done the job which was given to it. I also point out that it is the intention of this Government, having weakened and emasculated the Aboriginal Development Commission, now to abolish it for no reason other than to centralise administration and organisation within the portfolio area. My colleague Senator Tambling spoke about the report. It is necessary that I too say something about the work of Shirley McPherson, who has been the chairperson of the Commission for some years. She was appointed in 1982 by, I believe, the then Minister, Mr Wilson. She became chairperson in 1984 and she has remained in that position ever since. She has presided over an ADC which has tightened its procedures and which has taken control of its destiny. It is an organisation which has moved more of its work from grants to loans and so generated continuing income by way of loan repayments. Those repayments themselves have provided more capital to help Aboriginal people.Shirley McPherson is an accountant from Western Australia who has had a distinguished career in Aboriginal affairs, and her contribution to the ADC, especially as its chairperson, has probably been one of her most distinguished achievements in her life.

Their work has never been acknowledged. They were cruelly traduced by an article which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald soon after their dismissal. That story is patently untrue and has never been repudiated by the Minister, although it has been in his power to do so at any time. They had their reputations tarnished in their own communities. No-one has done anything to show care about these particular people. I refer honourable senators to the minority report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. We in the minority took some time and trouble to add to the majority view and said a little more about the cruel way in which those eight commissioners were treated.","N/A","ABORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

115,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator CHANEY","EF4","(Western Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)",2994,"—I do not wish to debate the full scope of the annual report of the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC). I suppose no subject has occupied more of the Senates time over this last year or two than the subject matter of Aboriginal affairs-the role of the Aboriginal Development Commission, the role of the various Ministers we have had, and so on. There have been many occasions when honourable senators from this side of the House in particular have expressed their deep concern about the way Aboriginal affairs have been administered by this Government.All I wish to do this afternoon is to pick up a matter which has been touched on by the two Opposition senators who have already spoken, Senator Tambling and Senator Peter Baume. It is a fact that the report coming down this week is significant in that it coincides, as I understand it, with the end of the period of service of Mrs Shirley McPherson. Mrs McPherson is a Western Australian Aboriginal person whom I did not know before she was appointed to her position with the Commission. She is not a person who came out of the professional Aboriginal affairs stream. She is a woman who qualified in her profession as an accountant. She spent her life as a married woman, a practising accountant and a business proprietor. She brought to the Aboriginal Development Commission, to which she was appointed, a wealth of practical experience and knowledge which I think was most impressive. She has worked long and hard in her post as an ADC commissioner and as Chairman of the ADC. It is a matter of very great regret that her long and faithful and, I believe, very effective service has been in a sense put at naught by the actions of the present Government and its maladministration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs.The shameful treatment of Mrs McPhersons fellow commissioners is evidenced by the fact that they were sacked by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) on the basis of their opposition to his stupid approach to Aboriginal affairs. This is something quite without precedent. Despite all the Aboriginal people who have been, if you like, difficult for succeeding governments and succeeding Ministers, it is unprecedented in my experience for a group of people to be treated in the shabby way that those commissioners were treated in being dismissed and, in their terms, put in a situation of very great disadvantage among the Aboriginal community. Many people assumed that they were sacked for cause, when in fact they were sacked out of pique by a Minister who simply could not tolerate Aboriginal people opposing his plans.The fact that Mrs McPherson was preserved relates to the strength of the statute which gave her statutory protection that was not available to her colleagues. I am pleased that when we put that legislation together we at least guaranteed that there was some protection for people against vindictive political acts. Mrs McPherson must have gone through a most difficult period. For her to have faced these sorts of thankless responses of the present Government, the hostility, the obstruction and the absolute small-mindedness and pettiness which have been a feature of Aboriginal affairs over recent years must have been almost beyond her tolerance.I would like publicly to express my thanks to her, and I am sure I do so on behalf of all Opposition senators, although a number of Opposition senators have already put their personal views on record. I express my personal thanks for her strength of character, her courage and her dedication, and for the contribution she has made over a long period to all the Aboriginal people of Australia. That, in turn, in my view, translates to a contribution to all of us. I simply wish to record my respect for her. I trust that she will not find her memories of the last few years totally soured by the futility of the last couple.","N/A","ABORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

However, as I came into the chamber-this was confirmed in a private conversation with Senator Tambling-he effectively accused the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) of editing the Aboriginal Development Commission report in so far as certain omissions of material which Senator Tambling thought ought to be in the report were found by him in a reading of it. The Minister absolutely refutes any suggestion that he has had any influence on the compiling of this report. Specifically, he has had nothing to do with omitting any material that might otherwise appear. He has not had any part to play in any supposed editing of the report. I would imagine-I have not had a chance to check this-that that would be illegal. It is a charge possibly of illegality but certainly of improper interference by the Minister in the preparation of this report. I would ask Senator Tambling to reconsider that accusation. Although I realise I am later than a contemporaneous challenge to him, I ask him to withdraw those charges.","N/A","ABORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

It has been tabled in the Senate today and relates to the year ending 30 June last year. That is indicative of some of the very considerable problems that have existed within the administration of Aboriginal affairs in this country over recent times, problems that have been caused through the deliberate and wanton actions of the Hawke Government, in particular, of the last two Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs-Mr Hand and his predecessor, Mr Holding.At the outset I wish to add my words to those of others from this side of the chamber in relation to Mrs Shirley McPherson, the outgoing Chairman of the Aboriginal Development Commission Board. I spoke of her last week in the debate on the Appropriation Bills. My remarks are recorded on page 2832 of Hansard of last Friday, 26 May. I will not go over them again, other than to say that I believe Mrs McPherson has made a fantastic contribution to Aboriginal affairs administration and policy in this country over a period. I am very sad to see her go. We are all going to be the poorer for her going, particularly her constituents, the Aboriginal people.The other couple of things I wanted to mention relate to the point Senator Tambling made in the sense of no recognition having been given in this 1987-88 annual report to the commissioners of the Board other than Mrs McPherson and Commissioner Zona Martin, who were there prior to the start of 1987-88. All the other commissioners were appointed on 13 May 1988, six weeks prior to the end of the period to which this report relates. I find it quite extraordinary that an official body such as the ADC could report to the Parliament without mentioning the names or the contributions of the Board of Commissioners who directed the affairs of the Commission for all but six weeks of the reporting period. It is all the more extraordinary that no recognition is made of the work of those commissioners when one reads the General Managers overview. I point out that it is an overview by Mr Mick OBrien, who has not been General Manager for some considerable time now, but that is not acknowledged in this report either. In his very comprehensive, though brief, overview at the start of the report, amongst other things he says:The Commissions achievements-it was a year of considerable achievement in 1987-88, despite extraordinarily difficult circumstances occasioned by the actions of the Minister, Gerry Hand-could not have been realised without the clear directions and guidance set by a very committed Board of Commissioners . . .Later in his overview he said:Communication with Aboriginal people has been very successfully maintained through the efforts of the full-time Chairman-Mrs Shirley McPherson-part-time Commissioners, and Regional and Branch staff . . .There is a glowing tribute from the General Manager, who in turn was persecuted by this Minister and this Government. It is a very glowing tribute to the work of the commissioners of the Board, who were sacked by the Minister for having the temerity to question the direction of Aboriginal policy and organisational administration in this country, a concern which they quite rightly expressed and which was entirely within their field of responsibility. Indeed, they would have been irresponsible had they not done so.As a member of Senate Estimates Committee E, I have been appalled by the overwhelming evidence of the widespread lack of professionalism and accountability in many sections of Aboriginal affairs administration. Waste and inefficiency have become a feature of the Hawke Governments period in office, particularly under Clyde Holding and Gerry Hand. The victims of this maladministration and inefficiency have been those Aborigines most in need. It is time this Government stepped back and took a long hard look at where it is going in the area of Aboriginal affairs policy and administration. It is leading us down a very disastrous path at the moment, at great cost to the most needy in our community, namely, the Aboriginal people.","N/A","ABORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
133,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOSWELL","YE4","(Queensland)","NP","N/A",2997,"—I would like to make a few remarks on the Aboriginal Development Commission report because it gives me an opportunity to recognise the contribution that the previous Chairman of the ADC, Shirley McPherson, made not only to the ADC but also to the Aboriginal community as a whole. Shirley McPherson came from private enterprise. She was a successful person in her own right who had obtained accounting and auditing degrees. She could have been held up as a role model for all Aboriginals to follow. Unfortunately, she was hounded-I use the word advisedly-out of the position of Chairman of the ADC. She stuck in there as long as she possibly could. She fought hard against what she saw as something that would be detrimental to the Aboriginal community. I refer to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill, which is not coming up before the Senate--","N/A","ABORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

135,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BOSWELL","YE4","(Queensland)","NP","N/A",2997,"—It may be, and we will debate it when it does come up. Shirley McPherson realised that that Bill would hurt the Aboriginal people and divide them, so she fought against it, and she paid the penalty for standing up for the Aboriginal people. Despite her having the right to do so, the right to offer the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) advice and the right to offer an alternative solution, she was, for her sins, for doing that and for doing what was required of her under the Act, hounded from office as the chairperson of the Aboriginal Development Commission by the Minister and his staff.It is a very sad loss to the Aboriginal community that she will not be involved in uplifting that community. I wish her all the best and hope that she will find some contentment, certainly more than she enjoyed in the last 12 months in the ADC. It would have been an appropriate time for the Minister to recognise the contribution made by Mrs McPherson and the other Aboriginal commissioners, who were sent back to their communities in disgrace. They went back under a cloud after the Minister had sacked them with only six weeks of their term to run. Any compassionate Minister would have waited out the six weeks and set up a new ADC Board, but the present Minister could not wait six weeks. Because these people would not agree with his proposals on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, he sent them back into the bush under a cloud and in disgrace. They did not really know why they were sacked and disgraced.The most reprehensible thing was when the story was given to the Sydney Morning Herald that $670,000 was missing from ADC funds. No member of the Senate, be he National, Labor or Democrat, would support that action.

Some of my colleagues go so far as to say that it is absolutely deliberate, that the Liberal Party sets out to achieve that objective. I hope that is not true.I forgive Senator Short and Senator Boswell their outrageous remarks on the grounds of ignorance, but Senator Tambling and Senator Chaney should know better. I did not hear much of what Senator Tambling said today so I will not do him the discourtesy of commenting on things that I did not hear. I will leave that to others who did hear and wish to respond. Senator Chaney outrageously tried to rewrite the history. He was once the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, when, I might say, the percentage of Aboriginal expenditure on administration rather than on services was much higher than it is now, and he should have known.

155,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ALSTON","LD4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",2998,"—I shall be brief in concluding my remarks in the second reading debate on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 and the Migration Amendment Bill 1989, which are very important Bills. Several matters are worthy of further consideration. One which has been brought to my attention since I spoke yesterday evening relates to a particularly grubby and shoddy press release by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, when it was first indicated that the Opposition and the Australian Democrats had serious reservations about the form and content of the original legislation and sought to discuss the matter with the Government. Instead of adopting the statesmanlike position that has been adopted in recent days, when the Minister has been prepared to negotiate what we think is ultimately a sensible conclusion, the Minister simply resorted to cheap criticism and abuse and said, for instance:The Opposition and the Democrats have placed political expediency ahead of logic and principle in their decision to oppose the . . . Bill.He accused us of having rejected the chance to bring greater logic and justice to the administration of the immigration program. He claimed that we had either not understood the issues involved or had become the unwitting puppets of a small group of vested legal interests, or a combination of the two. He decided to defame the legal profession for good measure when he said of the Bill:A campaign against it had been orchestrated by a small group of people from the legal fraternity, who had a vested interest.Finally, after accusing us of opportunism, he said:Any discussion though-that was an invitation to the parties to consider the form of the Bill-will be based on the clear understanding that the Bills fundamental principles will remain intact.Ultimately, what happened was that the Government saw the merit of the arguments that it simply was not good enough for the Minister to wash his hands of a number of the hard cases that inevitably present themselves for decision. He was not prepared to acknowledge that it is not a matter for bureaucrats to be forced to make those sorts of judgments; it is a matter for a Minister exercising political power to withstand the vested interests, to not cave in to any unfair or unwarranted interference, but to make the right and sometimes courageous decisions. I would have thought that this Minister would have had the political capacity and the intestinal fortitude to have withstood those sorts of pressures, but the sort of language he used was that the situation as it currently stands is open to political interference and to petty favouritism of the worst kind. He has now entirely accepted our argument that it is not appropriate to devolve discretion or responsibility to the bureaucracy; indeed, that it is proper that the Minister retain discretion. He says that, presumably, against the background that the discussions that would take place would not compromise the legislations fundamental principles. If this is not a fundamental principle, it is hard to understand why he had to resort to that sort of violent language in the first instance.The joint select committee that will be established, as I understand it, has one additional element-that is, to include a Democrat member. It is our expectation that the provisions of the Bill will be reviewed by that committee after a period of two years. We would certainly not object if there were to be an independent review which would then report to parliament on the operation of the Bill or, indeed, if there were an assessment of it by the Administrative Review Council.I understand there is also a provision in relation to the limits that will apply under the floating pass mark arrangement that would apply a cap to the concessional family quota, but would leave uncapped the priority area. I would not like there to be any misunderstanding of our understanding of the position. I think it is an important matter of principle. We were determined-I think the Government has accepted the validity of the argument-that there should not be a compromise or an arbitrary limit imposed on the entry of those in the priority category and, if necessary, restraint would have to be imposed in the concessional category in order to enable the numbers to continue to come in under the priority area. We welcome the proposed restructuring of interline arrangements to prevent abuse of embarkation cards and to halt what has apparently happened in the past-when people have swapped cards and used boarding passes which were not their own. We also welcome the easier arrangements which will now apply for the prosecution of those engaged in illegal fishing activities.I conclude by saying that the Opposition regards the final outcome as satisfactory. We take great pride in and credit for the fact that, despite all its bluster and bravado, the Government was prepared to stand the matter down, to give some serious consideration to the arguments advanced by the Opposition and, ultimately, to accept all of those recommendations which we regarded as fundamental. I think the outcome is a great tribute to the persistence and determination of those on this side of the chamber who saw the need to ensure that when we have a new and updated Migration Act, it will be one that is very much in the interests of all those parties to migration proceedings. It is a very difficult area of human relations and one that must be handled very sensitively. We think there has been a vast improvement in the approach that the Government originally had in mind. The nation will be stronger as a result of the amendments.We look forward to an indication from the Minister during this debate that undertakings will be given to fund some specialised support agencies. On the basis that the Minister will outline the amendments which have been provided to me, I do not see the need to go into any greater detail at this stage.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
156,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator JENKINS","IH4","(Western Australia)","AD","N/A",3000,"—We are debating two migration Bills-the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 and the Migration Amendment Bill 1989. These are two vastly different Bills. The first Bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill, contains an enormous number of amendments and comprises 93 pages, whereas the second Bill comprises only two half-pages, in order to correct an amendment Bill which we passed last year which cannot be proclaimed until this Bill is passed.Senator Alston has given us some of the history of these Bills. Indeed, I shall elaborate on that. It has been apparent to us all for a very long time that the Migration Act 1958, which is the principal Act which we are amending, is very unsatisfactory and is in need of a complete rewrite. The FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australias Immigration Policies, which produced the report known as the FitzGerald report, criticised the Migration Act in very forthright terms, characterising it as outmoded, non-specific and lacking in direction. FitzGerald pointed out that the 1958 Act preserves the mood and flavour of the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act. The mood and flavour of that earlier Act reflected the value systems of Australias dominant class of 1901. That value system included a belief in the absolute superiority of white people over Aboriginal people, Asians and other non-Europeans. Provisions of the 1901 Act were most concerned with how to keep people out of Australia and, if they had managed to get in uninvited, how to get rid of them.FitzGerald described the 1958 Act as more neutral, but pointed out that it pre-dates the final demise of the white Australia policy by 15 years. FitzGerald produced one volume dealing with model legislation. In the introduction to that volume he stated:One of the Committees terms of reference was to address the relationship between immigration policies and legislative processes. The Committee decided that a fundamental aspect of immigration reform was the updating of the Migration Act 1958 to provide a more positive foundation to immigration policy and administration.Part of the FitzGerald report reads:The mood and flavour of the 1901 Act prevail today.The influence of the Migration Act on immigration policy makers, administrators and the wider Australian community is immeasurable. Its tone permeates each layer.. . . .Since the present Migration Act was drafted, in the Fifties, there have been considerable changes in Australias approach to immigration, and in administrative law. Amendments to the legislation have provided band-aid solutions to pressing problems, and have compounded confusion in the interpretation and administration of the Act.If we turn to the final pages of the 1958 Act we can see how many times it has been amended. Many amendments have not even been included in the Act. The FitzGerald Committee recommended that a draft Bill drawing on the Committees model be introduced into Parliament as soon as possible to replace the existing Migration Act. That recommendation should have been followed but it has not been followed. What we are left with is yet another set of amendments which are extremely hard to follow. It is very complex to amend amendments that have been amended a great number of times. I hope that during the committee stage, when we look at the approximately 130 amendments from both the Government and ourselves, we can address those amendments properly.When we discuss immigration programs we must realise that we are talking about people. We are not talking about economic units; we are not talking about numbers that come in each year; we are talking about human beings. We must think: What makes the best Australian? Of course, it would be the person who has a commitment to stay and who wants to make his or her life here. As well as encouraging family reunion on a humanitarian basis, it often makes very good sense to encourage it on a commonsense basis. If a whole family is here, it is a stable family; therefore, we can work towards a stable society. We also need to ask ourselves why so many people leave Australia each year, which is wasteful in terms of the funds spent on our immigration program. We need to look at the sorts of people who leave and the reasons for their leaving. I suggest that that aspect should be considered very carefully.Having listened to Senator Alston speak last night, I make it plain that the Australian Democrats view on immigration is very different, obviously, from the coalitions view. We believe that humanitarian and compassionate grounds for immigration should be the whole basis of our policy. As I said before, that is a way of bringing stability to Australian society. Of course, we have a moral requirement to fulfil our obligations under refugee convocations and conventions to which we are a signatory.We must not forget that those who come to Australia on a family reunion or refugee basis bring skills with them and they can contribute very well to Australian society. In fact, we have been importing skills since the late 1940s. If we still need to import people deliberately on a skills needs basis, it has taken us a long time not to get it right. There is a problem with the skills category of migration. People coming in on a skills basis believe they will get a job which will fit in with their skills but that does not necessarily happen. People who have visited my office were assured that they would obtain work in Australia but they have been out of work for a year, even two years in one case. Another aspect that must be addressed is whether we should deliberately solicit migrants on a skills basis when we have such a high level of unemployment. Indeed, we must ask whether, at present, they would be able to pay for their homes. It is time for the Government to look beyond the short term economic issues concerning immigration.An unfortunate lesson that we have learnt from our immigration policies is that in Australia we continue to cluster around our coastline. A combination of land degradation and other factors has seen our population decline in rural areas of central Australia. These very complex matters and problems should be addressed openly and honestly.As Senator Alston said, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 was introduced some weeks ago. It came under immediate criticism from a whole section of our community. I will mention the names of some of the groups who were very opposed to the legislation: the Association of Non-English Speaking Background Women of Australia, the Australian Council of Churches, the Australian Council of Social Service, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, the Immigration Rights and Advice Centre, the Indo-China Refugee Association, the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, the Refugee Council of Australia and the Law Council of Australia. In addition, there were various groups of lawyers, particularly those working in legal aid areas, individual ethnic groups, individuals and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.The Government has come forward with some 82 amendments. In response to that, and matters that we believe have not been addressed, the Democrats have come forward with 43 amendments to the Bill and two amendments to the Governments amendments. I commend the Government-despite Senator Rays words in his press release-for coming forward with amendments. As I said before, not all of the issues have been addressed. Some have and it is to be hoped that at the committee stage we can work through the legislation and come forward, finally, with a Bill of which we can be proud.Clearly, we are presented with an opportunity here to bring forward better migration legislation than we have had for some time. The Act which we need now should be clear and unambiguous. It should set out in plain language who is eligible to apply for entry to Australia for permanent residence and what selection criteria should operate. It should recognise the reality that many more people wish to live in Australia permanently than we can accommodate and that applications exceed acceptances by a factor of more than 10:1. Setting out very clear selection criteria and providing for wide dissemination of those criteria to intending applicants would create a situation in which a large number would exclude themselves from the application process and, thus, reduce the enormous log jam of applications waiting to be processed. That is one of the problems that we have with our selection system. On many occasions, when people front up to an Australian embassy or the point of contact overseas, they are not given the right sort of advice. If they are accepted and come to Australia, they do not have the full facts of the situation in which they find themselves. I hope that we have improved from the days when we brought all those unfortunate migrants to Wittenoom in Western Australia. They were used as economic units and sent to work in the most appalling conditions. Currently a number are dying from mesothelioma and asbestosis.FitzGerald went so far as to draft what was represented as a model for a new Migration Act. It is disappointing that the Governments Bill perpetuates some of the faults of the old Migration Act, especially in its original form, and adds a few more problems to it. An important element of the present Bill is that it confers considerable responsibilities and powers on non-elected bureaucrats. To a certain extent that has been changed by some of the Governments amendments, but my first reaction on reading the legislation was that it was legislation created by bureaucrats for bureaucrats. It was a bureaucrats dream. Everything was laid out by line and number. Decisions could have been made behind closed doors without any reason being given for those decisions. That has changed.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

158,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator JENKINS","IH4","(Western Australia)","AD","N/A",3000,"—The legislation has changed to some degree, as I have said, but not completely. That is why the Democrats have drawn up a further 43 amendments. A classic example is the wording in proposed section 61 (1):The regulations may provide for prescribed decisions of the Secretary to be reviewed by prescribed review officers on application, as prescribed, by prescribed persons.I am happy to say that the Government has removed that proposed section and substituted another. If we were to pass legislation expressed in such terms, we would essentially be handing the powers of the Parliament over to the Executive and the bureaucracy. One might be able to advance arguments to support some delegation of responsibility if one were dealing with a department with a high reputation for efficiency and concern for the protection of the rights of its clients. However, as the FitzGerald report comments, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs is a department which has an image problem. I quote from the report:The image of bureaucracy. A labyrinth of rules and requirements that confuse and bewilder. A creator of uncertainty, dependence, frustration and anger. A mass of ill-fitting, unintegrated parts that resent change, that react rather than anticipate, that sink inexorably into inertia.Right or wrong, this is largely how government administration is viewed by its clients and the broader community. The immigration administration is not immune from this perception. It is accused of being conservative, slow, insensitive, secretive, inefficient, and unfair in its application of policy.Bearing those remarks in mind, we should indeed be thankful that we have a number of amendments addressing the original legislation.One of the most significant areas in the legislation is the issue of independent review of migration decisions. This was one particular section that gave rise to concern to many people. It has been a highly unsatisfactory aspect of the administration of immigration policy for many years. Several reports and inquiries, which I have spoken about previously, have strongly pressed the need for a genuinely independent system of reviews in which justice would not only be done but would also be seen to be done. In recent months we have experienced the long running charade of the $240 fee charged illegally by this Government for the review of migration decisions. Eventually we had the tabling of documents under the freedom of information legislation. Nevertheless, the fee had been collected since September 1987 even though, as from November 1987, it was deemed to be not completely legal. It will be refunded to people who paid after December of last year. But we are left with a situation in which there is no review of migration decisions. People are invited to make second applications, which of course is not the same thing at all.The Australian Democrats objection to the $240 fee, when the legislation came before the Senate in December 1987, related to its being a charge for a satisfactory review process, which I described at the time as a Claytons review process. We did not believe, and we do not believe, that there should be a charge for an internal review of an administrative decision. That is what we could now find ourselves with, where the first level of review will be by an officer in the Department. That should be standard; all decisions should be reviewed, especially if a negative decision is made. We could have stomached a fee for a strong, just, independent and effective review process but the process provided by the immigration review panels-IRPs, as they are known-offered no guarantee of justice, independence and effectiveness. The decision was made on the papers, with the case presented to the IRP by the Department. There was no opportunity for the applicant to present his or her case in person. There was no right for the applicant to be present to observe the hearing of the case. There was no right to call or examine witnesses. There was no right to legal representation.Although the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) indicated that the new review process would be genuinely independent, the legislation we are being asked to approve does not provide such a process. Frankly, I find this very hard to understand. Tribunals for the independent review of administrative decisions are an established aspect of our system of government. We have the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The FitzGerald Commission recommended that this tribunal be the appropriate one to review immigration decisions. It was specifically set up to provide a mainstream avenue for the review of administrative decisions to avoid proliferation of review mechanism, all operating at considerable expense in various jurisdictions.In a letter which the Minister sent to all honourable senators he stated that the Government wanted to avoid an adversarial type of review process providing for gladiatorial contests between lawyers, which would not necessarily produce the most just outcome for either the applicant or the Australian community. The Democrats accept that the adversarial model is not necessarily the best one for the review of decisions in the migration area. But there are other operating models on which the Government could have relied in drafting the present legislation. One such tribunal deals with appeals in the veterans affairs area. Another is the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT). The latter is a non-adversarial tribunal, which gives the appellant clear rights. It functions informally; it is regarded as fair; it is speedy and efficient; and it protects the rights of individuals. Indeed, it is interesting that in part the proposed amendments are based on the SSAT model. Proposed section 64e on page 54 of the Bill, which sets out the objectives of the proposed migration appeals tribunal, is identical to section 176 of the Social Security Act.It seems ridiculous that, having followed the SSAT model in establishing the objective of the migration tribunal, this legislation does not institute the same rights and procedures in respect of the handling of the appeals but rather institutes vastly inferior ones. Legal interpretation of the clauses of the legislation before us is that the appellant has no guarantee of the rights to an oral hearing, to be present at a hearing, to present argument, to call or to challenge witnesses or to representation.The Migration Act 1958 has rightly been criticised because it confers an enormous range of discretion on the Minister. The fact that so little has been codified and so much left to discretion and interpretation has caused enormous difficulties and has led to significant inconsistency in decision-making. To a certain extent that has been corrected, but not totally. An avowed intention of the present Bill is to reduce the exercise of discretion and to provide rules which would lead to more or less automatic decisions in the vast majority of cases. The Democrats applaud the intention to provide more consistency and predictability in migration decision-making. But in the legislation the Government has gone overboard; in many crucial areas all discretion has been removed. This will inevitably result in some severe injustices. Immigration decisions deal with human beings. Unfortunately for the Government and for the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, human beings do not fit neatly into boxes and categories. There will always be cases at the margin where flexibility will be needed because regulations cannot fit in with every decision to be made.In fact, I would like to draw the Senates attention to the decision which needs to be made about the Orionia people, who are currently in Albany in the south of Western Australia. Two of their community are shortly to rejoin them after they were extradited to Israel. These people cannot fit into any category because they did not choose to enter the country. They were here simply because their ship stopped in the port of Albany for provisions. For honourable senators who know the history, they were subsequently taken off their ship. Their boat is no longer in the country.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

160,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator JENKINS","IH4","(Western Australia)","AD","N/A",3000,"—We cannot legislate or regulate for all categories. It is simply not possible. Discretion is necessary for cases such as the one I have just quoted.In other areas extraordinary levels of discretion are reserved to the Secretary and the Minister. The Secretary and the Minister may, for example, revoke a valid visa or a valid entry permit. Although those aspects have also been addressed to some extent, the Democrats have further amendments.The question of the determination of refugee status is left to discretion. Cases will be investigated by departmental officers in secrecy. Recommendations will be made to the Minister, who will make the decision. The applicant has no right to be present nor to put a case. The decisions are basically unreviewable. That is not in accordance with the conventions to which we are a signatory.The Bill also takes an extremely harsh position on illegal entrants. Estimates of illegals in Australia range from 50,000 to well over 100,000. Obviously, no one knows the true number. Some have been here for very many years. Some are married to Australians and have Australian children. We need to ask ourselves why there are so many illegals in Australia. How do they get in? Even departmental officers are not beyond advising people to break the rules. Only the other week my own office heard of a case in which a citizen was experiencing lengthy delays in an attempt to nominate for permanent residence a spouse who was currently overseas. On contacting the Department, the applicant was advised to bring the spouse in on a tourist visa and then have her apply for a change of status. Essentially, here was a departmental officer advising an applicant to breach the Departments own rules. I certainly do not condone cheating and I do not condone illegal immigration. But we are at best very foolish if for years we leave the front door open, expect that no one will take advantage of our casual attitude to security, and then suddenly, in legislation, give these people only 28 days to regularise their status or be subject to deportation from this country without warning and without a review of the situation. Another aspect of the Bill that worries the Australian Democrats a great deal is that of the fluctuating points system. We are also concerned about the clause which relates to the Christmas Island people who are currently in Australia.I wish to make a few remarks about the Migration Amendment Bill, which is a small measure. If it passes without amendment it will empower the Minister to create classes of visas and entry permits. It will empower the Minister to determine arbitrarily which persons visa has single document entry privilege and which persons does not. It does not necessarily exclude the application of an `instrument in writing to give authority for departmental charge for granting a visa `in a specified manner and form-that is, establishing a tax for which no legislative warrant may exist. It generally provides the Minister with wide arbitrary powers which are inconsistent with the professed spirit of the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill-the other Bill that we are now debating. That Bill aims to minimise arbitrary decision making and provide certainty where uncertainty previously existed. Presumably, the provisions of this Bill would enable the Department to bring in selected visitors who are not registered in a notified database, pending full implementation of the computer system. I have some amendments to bring forward to the Migration Amendment Bill, which I will address at the right moment.In conclusion, the Australian Democrats would have preferred to see new legislation as recommended by FitzGerald. Instead, we have further amendments to a Bill which has been amended many times since 1958. The draconian measures originally in the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill have now been softened somewhat by the amendments put forward by the Government and certainly we will support many of those amendments. We have our own amendments to put forward which will address areas the Government has not addressed in its amendments. The Democrats are looking also to improving the review system so that reviews are heard at different levels and fairly and justly so that the decisions made can be seen to be just.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/speech[2]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
161,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TEAGUE","PJ4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",3005,"—The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 is very important legislation because it addresses a number of major deficiencies in immigration decision-making in this country. It also brings in a dozen other specific, more minor reforms. When the Opposition was first faced with the Bill in its original form on 2 May it decided that despite its many advantages the legislation was not acceptable because of three or four deficiencies which I will address in a few moments. After withdrawing the Bill from further consideration in the Senate the next day, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray) very rationally and sensibly entered into informal and eventually formal negotiations with the Opposition so that the three or four major remedies that we wanted in the Bill were incorporated. We now have the Ministers tabled amendments-some 82 of them-as a consequence of those sensible negotiations. On the new basis this legislation is approved by the Opposition and, in a true bipartisan way, we will, through this measure, go a long way to restoring the basis for public confidence in immigration decisions in this country.Whilst I speak in such glowing terms about this outcome, let honourable senators not forget that we have seen six years of deterioration in immigration matters under this Labor Government. Immigration has become a disaster area and there has been a lamentable failure of public confidence in immigration decisions. The beginnings of the repair of this disaster were seen in the appointment of the Committee to Advise on Australias Immigration Policies chaired by Dr Stephen FitzGerald. In earlier speeches I have commended the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the FitzGerald inquiry. The Government, which was so severely criticised by many aspects of the FitzGerald Committee findings, has not been so generous towards that important review of immigration and has accepted only some of its recommendations, some of which are involved in this legislation. Let the Senate not forget that, by failing to accept the further recommendations of that most important inquiry, the Government is leaving this country still in disarray on immigration, still with a want of public confidence that will be restored only by the election of the coalition to government. The most urgent question in immigration matters is the restoration of public confidence. At present any sampling of public opinion in any part of Australia would, I believe, result in most Australians saying that they do not want any immigration at all because they do not have confidence that this Government has a sufficiently firm decision-making process or good principles of fairness, stability and justice. More than that, Australians do not believe that this Government takes decisions based on the best interests of Australia-decisions that emphasise the acquisition of skills and the encouragement of young migrants, not only for their own good but also for the clear advantage of this country.I wish to say how much I welcomed the statement by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) in his first press conference on 9 May, following his election as Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia. At that press conference he said most clearly and with total conviction that has made the situation abundantly clear to the whole nation that the Opposition stands firmly in favour of non-discriminatory immigration and that we will proceed with a bipartisan policy for the good of all Australians. Later that week a debate on a motion on immigration introduced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) also gave Mr Peacock a clear opportunity, of which he took full advantage-and that was a debate he won-of confirming those commitments. The unfortunate immigration debate of August 1988 is behind us all in this chamber; it is behind the Parliament and it has been put behind the Opposition. Thankfully, those extraneous elements of debate have now been relegated to history. So in this chamber we can forthrightly concentrate on seeing this Bill enacted in a genuine bipartisan spirit, and we can then concentrate in subsequent debates on those further deficiencies which this Government has not yet addressed and which I fear, through its populist and Australian Labor Party dominated policy approach to immigration and ethnic affairs, it will not address, and hence the remedy can be found only in the election of this coalition to government.Let me focus directly on the Bill. There are three broad features of this Bill which, as amended by this package of amendments negotiated with the Opposition, are to be commended to this chamber. The first feature is that all administrative decisions are now placed in a legislative framework. It should be understood that up until now immigration decisions in this country have proceeded on the basis that the Minister for this portfolio has decision-making discretions which are totally unfettered. Whatever the Minister decides, stands. The present migration law gives that power to the Minister. Whilst the Government chooses to publish statements of policy and the Minister chooses to give administrative orders to his Department, on the basis of which decisions are to be made, nevertheless any of those decisions can be appealed to the Minister, and the Minister can, without any affront to the views of this Parliament or without any affront to any regulation or law in this country, reverse the decision. There have been thousands of cases in all of these years referred to Ministers for immigration with a view that the Minister might review the administrative decisions. Even then, there have been appeals to courts.We have found the deplorable situation of a lack of firmness in decision making; hence this Bill is put forward as a just and competent beginning of a remedy. What is required is a distinct legislative framework which sets out the basis for any application for immigration to this country being approved or not approved. Then the members of the Department, in drafting those decisions, will be required to act according to the law and the regulations under that law. The Ministers discretions are, to that extent, confined by this law. In the form in which this Bill was first drafted, the movement in this direction was excessive, in that there was not in all cases an ability for the Minister to show sensible flexibility or sensible compassion, or indeed, to have the right of review. These matters were limited to refugees and similar areas of decision. But now, because of the Oppositions insistence, the Minister is answerable for all of the decisions in the Department. It is not a question of a computer working upon the law as it was originally drafted, determining immigration decisions, nor is the Minister able to say that he is not responsible for the decisions that his Department has made, or able to put himself at some distance from those decisions. The legislative framework has now been achieved, yet the Minister is totally responsible and accountable to this Parliament.The problem being addressed is not just the question of illegal immigrants, of which there are now estimated to be some 70,000 living in this country. That is a disgraceful situation and clearly the whole of this Parliament wants to see that number greatly reduced and, if possible, even eliminated. We do not want to see a backdoor advantage being gained by these queue jumpers over the 1.3 million persons who apply each year to come to live in this country. We need to have a fair and sound system for making these decisions.Another problem area that is being addressed is the ordinary administration of immigration decisions. There is a need for consistency and a need to ensure that once a decision has been taken, it cannot be evaded, undercut or chased about either with many appeals through the process to the Minister or to the courts. Meanwhile, the whole process bleeds to death and the public does not have confidence that the Government is in fact governing. We believe that this is the major reform in this legislation, and we support it.A second major feature of the Bill is that it gives a more definite review process, and the two-tier determinative review process is one which we support. A third major feature of the Bill is that it gives a framework for simplifying into two broad categories migrant applications: those who are concessional migrants, that is, family reunion applicants; and those who are independent migrants, that is, skilled migrants. I have already said in the past how this will come under considerable scrutiny when we actually have the regulations for these two categories before us. But it is a welcome feature of this legislation. The floating pass mark is a practical and fair method for determining the actual numbers of persons who in any period will be coming to Australia under either of the two categories. The right to stay will become the critical factor in determining deportation and compliance with the Migration Act. A 28-day period has been defined in the legislation whereby a person here illegally will not forever-as it would seem now-be able to evade a firm decision on the necessity to comply with the Governments decisions.Other specific reforms that are to be commended in this legislation are the collection of costs from deportees and consumer protection for clients of immigration agents. Another feature regards the balance of family test. This matter has gained some further review as a result of discussions with the Opposition in the last few weeks. I support not only the flexibility here-despite the objectives that are set out by the Government in this area-but the flexibility generally to do what is sensible and compassionate, even if the main structure is as was originally set out in the Bill. There is also a tightening of the assurance of support which a sponsor gives towards an applicant coming as a sponsored immigrant to this country.Another good reform is the ability through this legislation to allow the release of illegal migrants on bond rather than their having to be retained in State prisons after their detention. Another reform is the tightening of the change of status procedure, which is currently an area of great abuse in this country. There is also provision for the search and entry of premises without a magistrates certificate for departmental officers who are following up immigration matters.Let me say very briefly-I am imposing upon myself the discipline of speaking for only half the allotted time so that others may be able to take part in this debate-that the three documents that are before us represent very welcome contributions by the Minister alongside the legislation. I refer to a letter, which the Minister addressed to a number of honourable senators and maybe some honourable members of the House of Representatives on 28 April, dealing with certain gossiped criticisms of the Bill at that time. To the letter is attached a paper addressing the supposed criticisms and giving clear answers. This was a most welcome action by the Minister. It played a considerable role in setting the stage for the discussions of the last few weeks.I have referred already to the 82 amendments that have been circulated by the Government as a result of discussions with the Opposition. I note the sunset clause of two years on the main regulations under the Act, which will enable the Government of the day to keep the initiative and avoid being chased about by a haphazard majority in one or other chamber. I refer also to the notice of motion given by the Minister today, setting out the description of a select committee to review the regulations before their introduction in the next session of parliament. Having examined that notice of motion, I believe it is in good faith that the discussions have taken place with the Opposition. I believe that it can be adopted and that the spirit of this debate can continue in the select committee. Indeed, afterwards there may well be a standing committee on immigration. It may have a longer life and may be charged with undertaking a continuing review not only of the regulations but also of policy.On the question of ministerial discretion, it is very important that there should not be any inequity in that only some applicants are able to appeal to the Minister for a review of decisions. There is considerable inequity at the moment, as there has been for many years. There is unfairness if 10,000 people can have their applications reviewed by the Minister because they have access to him, even if through us as senators, whereas one million, or more, people do not have that opportunity. In this respect there should be fairness. I welcome the provision that will enable the Minister to distance himself more from the day-to-day review of cases. It will also allow him properly to govern policy and to see to the management of the Department and the immigration decision process, and not to be so bogged down with 1,000 new files a month that he loses sight of the overall role that we expect of the Government. Indeed, the more legally defined basis for these decisions will achieve greater consistency. It is against the background of these advantages that, nevertheless, the Opposition insists that the Minister, and not the Secretary to the Department, or some other part of the Department, be responsible for all immigration decisions. So, we have seen the amendments to which I have referred.The Minister, in his notice of motion today, as well as in statements in April and December of last year, said that the regulations under this Act will not vary from current government policy. That is a matter for the select committee to review, but I note those undertakings by the Minister, and we shall examine them in the select committee. We shall also see that the regulations make it possible for the Minister to bring compassion and some flexible discretion to bear, for reasons that he can subsequently declare to Parliament.My final point is that the new two-tier review process needs to be fair and sound. We think that it will be, but we note the Ministers agreement to our request that there be an evaluation within two years of the operation of the review process beginning, and that the results of that evaluation be reported to this Parliament so that the Government of the day may vary the process, after consultation with all interested parties in Australia, to ensure that it is no less effective than is envisaged in the legislation.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
162,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SHORT","DJ4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",3008,"—The Senate is debating the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 and the Migration Amendment Bill 1989. I am glad that we are doing so because relatively recently it looked as though we would not. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Robert Ray), whom I am glad to see now in the chamber, was foolish initially to react so negatively when the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Democrats, plus a wide range of the ethnic communities, expressed opposition to important parts of the legislation on its introduction. I think it was uncharacteristic of the Minister to spit the dummy in the way that he did. I am glad that, subsequently, he has adopted a much more commonsense approach.The purpose of the Bills is to introduce new measures relating to the issue of visas and entry permits, to allow those rules to be contained in regulations, and to provide for a review of immigration decisions. The Bills reflect the Governments response to the report of the FitzGerald Committee to Advise on Australias Immigration Policies, which was produced in the course of 1987-88 and was tabled in Parliament on 3 June last year. That was an extremely important report, and probably the most wide-ranging examination of immigration in our history. Indeed, it was an excellent report, which provoked a great deal of community debate. By no means was everyone in full agreement with every aspect of it. Indeed, I disagreed strongly with parts of it-for example, the proposal to wind down the Indo-Chinese refugee program, which I feel is very important to us as a nation. However, overall, there was an enormous number of recommendations that indicated an excellent examination.One of my criticisms of the legislation before the House is that I doubt whether, in its proposals for legislative change, it does full justice to the recommendations of the FitzGerald report. Nevertheless, it is important legislation, as the FitzGerald report was an important report. Regrettably, the tabling of that report last June was followed by a disgraceful and scurrilous campaign of divisiveness and misinformation by the Government as to the coalitions attitude to migration. For example, speaking at the Australian Institute of International Affairs on 14 November of last year, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), following the public debate on immigration of the preceding three months, said:. . . one of the first effects of the immigration debate was a reduction in applications from potential business migrants . . . by possibly more than 30 per cent. Such damage to Business Migration Program could slash capital inflow from Asia into Australia from $1.1 billion to about $750m with the potential long term cost much higher . . .Other Government Ministers had already jumped on this band wagon, notably Senator Gareth Evans and Mr Michael Duffy. Fortunately, the present Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, displayed a little more intelligence and honesty. In doing so, of course, he blew the claims of the Prime Minister and his acolytes right out of the water. On 2 February this year, in a statement to journalists in Hong Kong, Senator Ray admitted that there had been no effect on business migration created by the immigration debate in Australia. I quote him as reported:Nothing major has shown up in the Government statistics . . . Even if there was some dropoff its not essential to assume its to do with some debate in Australia.On 1 March this year the Minister said in the Senate:It is quite clear that the business migration program this year is going to run 2,000 under target. Of those, 700 would have been business migrants, the rest their families.. . .The program does have difficulties, but I want to stress too in fairness that the Asian migration debate is only one of the factors operating in the business migration area. A second factor is competition from New Zealand and Canada, which have far less rigorous requirements, not only in monetary amounts but in character checks, et cetera. A third factor . . . was the fact that an appreciating dollar in Australia made it harder for people to meet the requirements.Senator Ray continued:I also went on to say in Hong Kong . . . that the gap between the first approach and development of business migration applications by business migration agents and their lodging in our office is quite often 10 to 12 months. So we still have not seen the evidence as to whether, in fact, we are going to go into a decline, let alone a failure to increase.The Australian Labor Party, since mid-1988, has been trying desperately to poison the Liberal Partys traditional close relationship with the ethnic communities in Australia. In some instances, I must say, it nearly succeeded. Fortunately, however, most ethnic communities have seen through this quite dishonest, poisonous plot. My own personal experience is a clear indication of that. As I have gone about my duties as a senator-which, of my own volition, involve a very heavy emphasis on meeting with the leaders of many ethnic communities and joining in many ethnic celebrations, commemorations and festivals-I have found that Labors attempts to misrepresent the Liberal Party have failed and, indeed, have backfired.The relationship between the Liberal Party and the ethnic communities has been strengthened over recent months. I have been welcomed both as a member of the Liberal Party and as a friend. When I have spoken with migrants and their families from Vietnam, Greece, Turkey, Italy, Scotland, Ireland, England, Lebanon, Cambodia, China, the Ukraine and the Baltic states their response has always been the same. They say to me, `We understand you; we know what you are on about and we support you. We always have, because we have always had this close relationship. The Liberal Party was the party which basically founded the immigration program in the postwar period which has been so enormously beneficial to this country. They say to me that they are aware of the nine principles in our policy and that they agree with them. They also say that they support the wording of the Liberal and National parties policy document on immigration and ethnic affairs released last August.Whether it has been at a vigil for peace in the Lebanon, at a seminar on the Middle East, at a commemoration of the independence days of Vietnam, the Baltic states or the Ukraine or at a Greek or Italian ball, the story is the same: `We like it in Australia. We have a commitment to Australia and to its democratic and legal traditions. We are proud to be Australian. We enjoy the vast opportunities that this country has to offer for us and our children.They tell me of their concern with the way that the economy is going and their fear of the burden that their children will face as a result of the massive national debt that is being accumulated as a result of the complete economic mismanagement of the Hawke Government. They also tell me of their concern at the breakdown of the traditional concept and role of the family in our society and their concern at the declining quality of life.Many of them also tell me of their concern about those policies of the Hawke Government which divide communities within themselves and from other communities. Of course, this is a concern which was also heavily reflected in the findings of the FitzGerald Commission. This is an issue of fundamental importance for the future of this country. It ought to transcend party political lines. Instead, to its eternal shame, the Hawke Government has attempted to play cheap party politics on these matters and to gag rational debate on them by painting those who point to its divisive policies as somehow racist or opposed to continuing immigration into Australia.Of course, nothing could be further from the truth; therefore, all the more reason for bringing to public attention some of the facts. These clearly show that, despite the Hawke Governments attempts to emphasise the differences between ethnic groups in Australia rather than their common interests, and whilst recognising at the same time their rich cultural diversity, Australia is fast becoming a nation populated by people not of any single ethnic origin but a mixture of ethnic origins.The distinguished Australian demographer Charles Price recently produced data on inter-ethnic marriages in Australia. That data is quite startling. It shows that over two-thirds of the Australian population have at least two ethnic origins. This ethnic mix has occurred at a rapid pace. Of the 712,000 second and third generation Australians born to parents originating in the same country in the postwar period up to 1981, some 627,000 married persons whose parents did not originate in the same country as their own parents. Only 85,000 married persons with the same parental country as themselves. Present marriage trends show that the mixing is continuing. Of single immigrants arriving and marrying in Australia between 1981 and 1987, only 27 per cent married persons born in the same country. For second generation persons, the figure is even less.There are enormous implications here for the Australian national identity. The 1986 census data shows that one-fifth of respondents-that is, some three million Australians-when asked about their ancestry, simply responded `Australian. The rapid inter-mixing that is occurring suggests that by the next census there will be many more who think of themselves as simply Australian, by ethnic origin and ancestry as well as by birth, upbringing and culture. The continued creation of unity through diversity has been a hallmark of Australians development throughout our history. We have always been a multi-racial society. We have also been one of the most racially tolerant societies on earth. It is of the most crucial importance that the divisive policies of this Labor Government, policies which are based essentially on patronage and attempted populist buying of ethnic votes, not be allowed to damage or destroy this precious jewel of our social fabric.In leading for the Opposition in this debate, Senator Alston has made most of the points of detail in relation to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill and the Migration Amendment Bill that I would have wished to make, so I will not go over all the ground again in this second reading debate. Of course, there will be further consideration in committee as we move to amendments. However, there are a few additional things that should be said.Honourable senators will be aware that the original legislation introduced into the Senate in early May contained three major features and quite a few matters of somewhat lesser significance, although they too were important. The three key features were, to paraphrase the Minister, firstly, a radically revised approach to immigration decision making based on a near complete abolition of the ministerial discretions which have been a longstanding component of our immigration policy and administration; secondly, the introduction of a new two-tier review system, the first tier of review being departmental, the second a new immigration review tribunal; and, thirdly, the spelling out of mechanisms for ensuring that the planned immigration program intake are not exceeded.Another key feature overlying all these others was that the Act would contain very little detail of Australias immigration policy. The detail was to be contained in Government regulations which were to be introduced progressively over a lengthy period of time and only after these Bills had gone through the Parliament and the Acts had been proclaimed. The Minister made great play of the need to treat the Bills as an integrated package. He concluded his second reading speech by saying:The Bill is a package and its constituent elements are closely integrated. If this total package is not adopted, then the Government would be faced with the piecemeal introduction of some of its provisions. The end result would be that the current situation would simply continue. This is unsatisfactory from the point of view of those affected directly by the operations of the Act, and from the point of view of determining policy and protecting the wider public interest.The Minister should not have been surprised at the negative reaction of the coalition and of the many ethnic organisations to parts of the so-called integrated package. He was surprised and obviously he had not done his homework amongst the communities concerned.The Liberal and National parties endorsed many of the objectives of the legislation and, of course, still do, In particular, we endorsed a better defined and genuinely independent review process, a clear policy to reduce the number of illegal immigrants in Australia and recover the costs of deportation proceedings from illegal immigrants, the protection of clients from unscrupulous immigration agents and their operations, tightening of assurances of support, and tightening of change of status provisions. However, we pointed to several major weaknesses in the legislation and said that it should be redrafted to remove those weaknesses.The original legislation was deficient in several respects. The Government was proposing an undue reliance on regulations of which at the moment the Parliament has no knowledge and in some cases, as I said, would not be available for parliamentary scrutiny for up to the next 18 months. There was no mechanism put in there for parliamentary involvement in the interim period. We were also concerned at the denial by the Government of its role and the Ministers responsibility in administering and controlling Australias immigration and the placing of complete authority with non-elected public servants, a point about which much has been made in the debate so far. We were concerned about the withdrawal from effective parliamentary scrutiny of the administration of immigration. We were concerned about the deficiencies in the legislation in relation to the expensive and lengthy legal procedures which will follow the introduction of the legislation, making much of the legislation, in effect, unenforceable. At the time, we reaffirmed that it is the role of the elected government to make the final and absolute decisions in regard to who enters Australia for any reason. It is not the responsibility of the bureaucracy.As I said at the outset, after an initial fit of pique when he said he would not proceed to have the Bill debated, in the light of these responses common sense fortunately prevailed and Senator Ray sat down with the Opposition and the ethnic organisations to negotiate ways of meeting the widely held objections. I pay particular tribute in this context to the then coalition shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, Alan Cadman, for the constructive role he played in helping to initiate these negotiations. Admirably, the new shadow Minister, Philip Ruddock, took up where Alan Cadman left off. I pay tribute to the constructive role played by the Federation of Ethnic Communities Council and other ethnic organisations involved in the negotiations. I also pay tribute to the Chairman of the Council, Mr Carl Harbaum, and his Deputy Chairman, George Wojak. I congratulate them on the role they have played.The result of the negotiations is that the Government is proposing several major amendments to the legislation. The Minister has agreed to reinstate himself for the Secretary to his Department where the issue of discretion is relevant. Discretion will be incorporated in the decision-making process so far as the regulations are proposed. Instructions for drafting regulations will require that they be prepared in accordance with the Governments announced reforms to establish entry criteria. There are many others as well of a complicated nature. It is understood by all concerned that the drafting will take at least a year or more to complete. Although it is not part of the Bill, the Minister has agreed, in order that parliamentary scrutiny may be undertaken-a fundamental point from the Oppositions point of view-that a select committee be established for a period of two years to review regulations in advance of their promulgation. The Committees task would be to ensure that regulations accurately reflect announced policy and that discretions for compassionate consideration are properly incorporated.Other amendments are proposed. We propose the inclusion of sunset clauses in the regulations. The Minister has given an undertaking that, whilst not being prepared to change the inquisitorial role of his review process, to evaluate the review process after two years, either independently with a report to Parliament or by the parliamentary committee. Another very welcome amendment is that, whilst enabling closure of all or any part of the program, if numbers exceed annual program targets the Bill will exclude the immediate family category from this. We also welcome an undertaking by the Minister to table in Parliament relevant statistics to demonstrate the need to cut off all or any part of the remainder of the program. Other changes are proposed in the amendments. One proposal relates to the 28-day rule, and so on. They are all very desirable and welcome changes.There are one or two points about which I have some concern on the question of ministerial discretion. I can personally understand the Ministers original view. I think he went too far in removing his discretions and he was rightly criticised for that. Many of those discretions, as I understand it, have now been reinstated. Perhaps we might have gone too far back the other way-I do not know. The matter, I would think, is one that should be kept under review. I also have some doubts about the precise application of the floating pass mark system. I have a feeling that it could lead to inconsistencies, anomalies and unfairness. I understand what the Minister is getting at. The floating pass mark system that is proposed in the legislation is very close in concept to that proposed by the FitzGerald Commission to Advise on Australias Immigration Policies. But it is a new and novel concept and it also should be kept under review.Finally, I regret that the Government has decided to keep the total immigration intake at 140,000 for each of the next two to three years. I believe, as does the coalition, that 150,000 would have been a more appropriate level with the increase from 140,000 to 150,000 being concentrated particularly in the area of the entry of skilled migrants. With those qualifications, I support the Bill with the amendments that are to be made. I note that the Bill, as amended, will look significantly different from the Bill that was introduced originally and which the Minister said needed to be considered as an integrated package. He said that if parts of it were changed or deleted, we would have a less than satisfactory situation. I would hope that he would now agree that that is not the case. The flexibility in approach to this Bill adopted on all sides has been a very worthwhile and important experience. We now have a better Bill than we had at the start. It is an important piece of legislation. I, along with other members of the coalition, am very pleased to support it.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
163,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs)",3012,"—in reply-I should make it clear at the outset, to clear up one misconception, that the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill 1989 and the Migration Amendment Bill 1989 were never withdrawn. They were merely relegated to the bottom of the Notice Paper. I said at the time in press interviews that they would only be promoted back onto the Notice Paper if they could secure a second reading in this particular debate. A lot has been said by other senators about my spitting the dummy in a fit of pique, and so on. Senator Hamer would realise the value of strategic withdrawal in military matters until ones reserve regiments are ready to come up. If that degree of censure or humiliation for me is necessary to get the Bills through, I will happily accommodate those charges. It would have been churlish not to negotiate on the Bills.I would like to put on the public record my thanks to the Liberal spokesman, Alan Cadman, for his discussions on this matter; to Mr Phil Ruddock, for his subsequent discussions on the matter; and to Senators Puplick and Alston for their discussion on the clauses of the Bills. I would also like to publicly thank Senator Baden Teague. It was a casual conversation with him that acted as a circuit breaker to getting discussions going. Whilst I will not be responding to his speech in the chamber today, I must say that I thought it was an excellent speech showing a great grasp of the issues. I would also like to thank Senator Jenkins for her correspondence on this immigration matter, in which she detailed her concerns for the Bills. Some of those concerns will be met; some will not. I just say to her that the difference between the idealistic clause and the running of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs happens to be fairly wide. I hope she will appreciate that.There will be a number of Government sponsored amendments in the committee stage. We have tried to meet the concerns of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. Where possible I have met those concerns in nearly all cases. I have also tried to meet those concerns raised by the coalition and by the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils. I have met some of the objections of the Australian Democrats, but not all. I will give an example of some of the smaller amendments that we have agreed to. One amendment relates to 70 days for appeal for people overseas. I still stick by the 28 days for those in Australia because they have the benefit of what is in Australia. But I clearly saw that with postage problems in places such as Lebanon and Vietnam and other communication problems with eastern Europe, a 70-day rule would be far more appropriate. On the question of the right to have an interpreter at the Immigration Review Tribunal, it was a view of my Department and me that this is covered by other law and administrative law in this country. Having raised this issue that it may be a problem because it was not a right that was so asserted, we have included that in the Bill to make it absolutely unambiguous as a right.In relation to the question of split decisions by the Immigration Review Tribunal, we have amended the legislation so that if there is a split position, the more senior member will have the determination in his hands. Another example is that we have inserted a 28-day clock in terms of deportations. I always accepted-because of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act-that the clock would stop if there was an appeal to the Federal Government. People were worried about that and the Bill has accordingly been amended.I wish to spend a little more time on the more principal amendments to the Act. The first question is that of ministerial responsibility-discretion. I have compromised on this issue in order to get this Bill through. I want to put on the public record-even though it has been in the press and asserted by spokesmen who should know better; I do not say it is anyone in this Parliament-that the accusation that this decision was made to remove a workload on a Minister is absolutely baseless. I point out to visitors to my office that I am up to date on case work. I do not resent it. It is done. It was never conceived as a way of shifting workloads from a Minister to a bureaucrat. I have only one objection to ministerial discretion. It is a remaining objection and one I will probably always have. What I do not like about it is access. Who has access to a Minister? Can a Minister personally decide every immigration case? The answer is always no. Those who tend to get access to a Minister are members of parliament and other prominent people around the country. I worry for those who do not have access and whether they are being treated equally by not having access to a Minister. That has been my sole concern in regard to this matter.There is another side to the coin. I always believe that a Minister should be responsible for the decisions, whether he or his department makes them. Even under the original Act it was never intended that the Minister would no longer have responsibility for decisions made by his department. I am quite proud of the fact that in spite of a long discussion in my Party, my Party came down on the side of equity and fairness on this issue. We debated it. There were all sorts of points of view made. In the end the Labor Party, in its deliberations on this matter, came down on the side of principle. I am very proud of the fact that it did. That is not to imply that the Opposition is not arguing a principle case in this particular matter. But there are different views on the way ministerial discretion has been exercised in the past. I do not make accusations. Under the old system it is open to abuse in terms of political patronage and favouritism, but, more importantly, who has access to a Minister is the critical issue. That has always been the critical issue in considering these migration matters.The second large issue relates to the question of regulations. Quite properly, an objection has been raised that a lot of the content of immigration will be done under regulations. I remind this chamber of how immigration has been run in the past. It has been run not by regulation or legislation but purely by ministerial directive, subject to no scrutiny in this Parliament and subject to no control by anyone. The great revolution in this particular piece of legislation is that it requires policy in the future to be put in regulations. Those regulations can be disallowed by this Parliament. Those regulations will now be a fixed body of law. The decision makers will be controlled not by an arbitrary whim of the Minister to change his decision or directive but by regulations which become law. That is a large step towards improvement.To overcome this problem we have set up a joint select committee-I am anticipating that it will go through both Houses-to oversee those regulations. It will be looking at those regulations to make sure they fit Government policy and that they have sufficient flexibility to make decisions as good as possible. That is not to say that the Government will not continue to change its immigration policy in the more minor areas to catch up with different developments in immigration. For instance, I do not think anyone in this chamber would deny that, if a new scam was discovered by which illegal immigrants could gain entry to this country, the Government would close them off. For the most part, regulations will reflect announced policy.In addition, the suggestion from the coalition, and an excellent one at that, was to apply a sunset clause to the regulations governing the criteria for entry. What the coalition did not want was to be locked in forever on regulations. That is a philosophy that I support. I do not believe that the Government of the day should lock future governments into an immigration policy forever, nor do I believe that the Government wants to be locked in forever. By having a sunset clause, two years down the track after the regulations are promulgated, a government will want them reviewed. It may want to reissue the regulations. It may want to change them. Having a sunset clause means that an immigration policy is not locked in forever as holy writ.The third area I want to move into is the review of the Immigration Review Tribunal. I have made a commitment and I am about to make it here, that two years into the operation, that is at the end of two years of operation of the Tribunal, the Government will review the operations of the Tribunal. I understand that, in another place, Mr Ruddock will make a similar commitment. It is a very welcome commitment. Two years down the track the Immigration Review Tribunal will be reviewed by an independent body. It may well be a parliamentary committee appointed by the parliament or an independent inquiry appointed by the Minister. It is essential that that commitment be made so that everyone knows that, down the track, the Immigration Review Tribunal will be reviewed. Things such as natural justice, efficiency, speed of operation and fairness can be canvassed to make sure that the Tribunal is operating according to the intention of the Parliament.The final matter I want to mention is that, under the Act, the Minister and the Secretary have the ability to close off a specific category of entry. Immediately, this was blown up by the various advocates around the place to mean that this Government, the Minister or the Department could close off preferential family reunion. That was never the intention, for a variety of reasons. To make it absolutely clear, the Government will amend the Act to exclude that category. Would any rational government, Labor or Liberal, wanting to be re-elected, close off that area? Absolutely not. To make it absolutely clear the Government will exclude preferential family from an area of closure.A variety of matters were raised during the debate on the second reading. I cannot go through them all but I will deal with some of the issues raised. Senator Alston, in his opening remarks, went back to the report of the FitzGerald Commission to Advise on Australias Immigration Polices (CAAIP). Basically, as I read it, some people believed that we made a mistake with regard to citizenship where he advocates what are really punitive measures to force people to become citizens, that is, preventing them from getting social security and other benefits.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/speech[5]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

165,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs)",3012,"—Senator Alston regards it as incentives. I do not regard taking away unemployment benefits and other benefits to be incentives. To me, good citizenship comes from a commitment from the heart. It does not come from a gun being held at the head or from other threats. A commitment from people to become good citizens will come from them when they give it positively. That is my view on it. There are certain circumstances in which people find difficulty in becoming citizens; for instance, property laws. It is a lessening problem, but under the property laws in some countries a person who becomes a citizen in this country forfeits his rights in another country and that could affect his relatives in the other country. There is another large category that refuses to take the oath to the Queen and to Australia. It is no secret that many Irishmen do not like taking that oath. The Parliament has twice considered that matter and rejected it.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/speech[5]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

167,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs)",3012,"—Yes, Americans, and there are others. I might be more sympathetic to the point of view of the Opposition if we could free up these parts of the citizenship legislation to give a much greater incentive to people to take out citizenship. I do not think the punitive path works. What happens when a person does not take out citizenship, for whatever reason, and is unemployed with several children? Should the children be punished or should the person be told that he can get certain benefits if he takes out citizenship? Is that the sort of commitment we want to Australia? I do not.The second matter referred to by Senator Alston was the English language test. Words such as `pandering to different groups were mentioned in this context. The Government put a good deal of thought into whether an English language test should apply to the extended family, and rejected it. It was rejected mainly not for economic reasons, because the economic advantages are clear, but it was considered that an equal playing field in the family area was wanted. If there were an English test, it would apply dramatically to different regions of the world. The automatic assumption by some people-not those opposite-was that whacking in an English language test would reduce the number of immigrants coming from Asia. Nothing could be further from the truth because English is more a second language there than anywhere else in the world. It would have greatly affected potential immigrants from non-Commonwealth countries such as the Middle East, so a good deal of consideration was given to whether an English language test should be applied for extended families and the Government rejected that proposal. However, it was considered, to be totally fair, to have a language test for the independents, not based simply on English but on their language proficiency. That is very much the dog eat dog world of independence. May the best 23,000 win. So it applies in that area.The third point made by Senator Alston was that we should go back to FitzGerald, which was not really relevant to this Bill, and a couple of the things he said. Mr FitzGerald was fairly complimentary about the package that we came up with after the CAAIP report. He was not happy with every aspect of it but he was complimentary about the package.The fourth point raised by Senator Alston is one that I must contest. He said that the Government has been mean, that it should have made the immigration program 150,000. There is a variety of reasons not to go to 150,000, not the least of which was a point made by the Premier of New South Wales about some of the infrastructure problems. An increase from 140,000 to 150,000, taken out of context, might have some relevance to the debate but the figures that are not counted are the 27,000 New Zealanders who are settling in Australia. That number is increasing enormously this financial year. When we are talking about infrastructure, it is not simply a case of 140,000 or 150,000; it is starting off with a base of 167,000 and considering an increase to 177,000.I think that the point Senator Alston made is that if the figure were increased by 10,000 we could get more skilled people into the country. That is one point of view and it is a legitimate point of view. Other people in the community could argue that, if there is a spare 10,000, consideration should be given to the millions of brothers and sisters of people in Australia. There is no correct balance and there is no correct figure. The Government has said the mix should be 50 per cent families, 40 per cent economic and 10 per cent compassionate. I would not argue with anybody about the correct balance. It is a matter of judgment. I hope that, when the Bureau of Immigration Research is well and truly under way, we will have better data on which to base our decisions on whether the figure should be 140,000 or whatever so that, in the future, we can establish a more rational immigration policy based on firm data.Senator Alston accused me of publishing a grubby press release. I have a file full of grubby press releases on immigration including some from the immediate past shadow Minister, accusing my head of Department of wanting to become a commissar and, worst of all, wanting to be a Trevor Boucher. I do not know that Trevor Boucher would necessarily be held in poor esteem by any court because of the good job that he has done. There is always a good deal of head butting at the beginning of these affairs. It is how they come out at the other end that is important.Senator Alston asked whether we would fund specialised agencies to give advice in these particular areas. That will be a matter for the Budget process but I can say that I am looking at it fairly closely.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/speech[5]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

Immigration is different from any other area. There is an 8 per cent leakage in Social Security and 10 per cent in Veterans. Here the leakage is at least 40 per cent from one tier of review to another, because we are dealing with a different human dimension.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/speech[5]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

171,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs)",3012,"—I mean people who do not succeed under the first tier going on to the second tier. It is much greater in immigration than in any other area because people feel obligated. As they have sponsored a relative to come to Australia, they feel they must go through every possible step to prove to them their bona fides and that they have tried to assist. I think that is all I have to say on Senator Alstons point. Obviously, I have not commended Senator Alston for the positive points he has made; that is not the nature of these debates in the Parliament.Senator Jenkins made a number of points. I cannot respond to them all, but she did make the point about people leaving Australia. The one point I make about that is that the leaving rate now is as low as it has ever been. It is nothing like it was in the fifties, sixties or seventies. Another point she made was that she was not too happy about skills being taken into account. Every bit of research and data that we have relates skills to employability. I know there will always be an exception, but the more skilled a migrant is, the more employable he is and the lower the unemployment rate will be. That must always be a consideration. The last thing we want to do-and, I am sure, the last thing that Senator Jenkins would want to do-is bring people to this country merely to be placed on the unemployment line. There will always be an exception of someone who is skilled in a certain area not being able to find a job, but on the whole there is this relationship.Senator Jenkins looked at environmental factors as they affect immigration. I hope that she notes my record on this matter. I have never dismissed those factors; I have always said that they should be debated seriously. I do not know what our optimum population is. There must be an optimum population level for this country, that will enable it to remain a major net exporter of food and energy. It could well be argued that we should not continue to increase our population forever because we badly affect the rest of the world by no longer being such a net exporter of food. I do not know where that level lies at the moment. I suspect we are nowhere near that critical level yet.Senator Jenkins, I thought rather unkindly, quoted the view of FitzGerald on the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. Basically, he was talking about the situation that existed two or three years ago, not today. There was no recognition of the Departments use of computers for the benefit of the client or the decentralising of its operations in the two big cities. It should be remembered that we do not have an easy task in the area of immigration. There will be delays. What we are doing is saying no to 80 per cent of people and that is never easy for any government department to do. We are issuing two million visitor visas a year, as well as undertaking a range of other activities, on a total budget of about $225m. We have 125 A-based staff overseas, which is half the number that Canada has, yet even Canada argues that we deliver a far better program with more efficiency than it does. So some of those remarks made by FitzGerald about the operations of the Department concern the past.This Bill seeks to remove the rest of the criticisms by making all future decisions subject to regulations and the law, to do away with secrecy, to put in a decent appeal system, and to reinvigorate the Department. I believe that process is under way. I hope Senator Jenkins will come to see that that process is under way. She asked why we did not use the model of the veterans appeals body or the social security appeals body. We did not do so because they involved the first tier review process. We are talking about a second tier process, and that is why we did not slavishly follow those models. That system involves a first tier review, with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal at the other end of the line. We are dealing with second tier appeals.Senator Jenkins asked, I think quite properly, to what extent flexibility will be done away with. There is flexibility in the current Act. There will be flexibility under the new Act and via the regulations. The trouble is that at the moment one could drive a truck through the flexibility. `Yes, Ministers and departments will always say, as in the case of the Orionia family that Senator Jenkins referred to, that there will be exceptions that are made outside policy. There was provision in the old Act and there will be provision in the new Act to do exactly that. There must be that sort of flexibility. What people sometimes want is the flexibility to grant every case. Tragically, that is not possible. For every compassionate case that we grant outside the guidelines, someone else queued up somewhere in the world misses out.I now refer to some remarks made by both Senator Jenkins and Senator Teague. I acknowledged earlier the very positive contribution to the debate made by Senator Teague; I thank him for that. The question of illegals was raised. People say, `Why are there so many illegals?. Having regard to most comparative countries, they ought to ask, `Why are there so few?. It should be remembered that two million visitors enter this country every year. We are an immigration country, so people tend to do a runner and decide to stay here. It is interesting that the virtually unanimous view around this chamber and in newspaper editorials is, `We do not support illegals; that is in the macro sense. But every time there is a micro case, nearly every newspaper and nearly every television program runs a tear-jerker segment, saying, `How can this heartless Minister possibly deport this individual?. This can occur thousands of times. We have the tough job of balancing the macro and the micro in these cases. At least under the new Bill it will be much easier, with multiple decision making at the one time, to make deportation more feasible and quicker than it has been in the past.I think that covers the contributions made to the debate on this legislation. On the question of the general criticisms of the Bill, it is interesting that I have not had many criticisms from ethnic groups. I have had criticism from the peak body, but not from individual groups. It could have to do with the complexity of the Bill; I am not sure. Of course, the one word used constantly by the advocacy groups in respect of the Bill was `draconian. They rarely illustrated how the Bill was draconian, but that word was picked up by everyone-by newspaper editors, by spokesmen, et cetera. I deny that. This Bill is about fairness and equity. It is not a draconian Bill. It will put fairness and equity into our immigration system. It is, however, tough on illegals; and it is tough on them because we have an organised immigration system.I have compassion for those who obey the law, for those who come out of East Beirut, travel through West Beirut and past the Chouf Mountains, get shaken down by the border guards, wait three days in a queue in Damascus, are numb from travelling on public transport and by taxi, and then find out that because they do not have their birth certificate with them they have to make the journey again, being shot at all the way. Our compassion must lie with those people, not with the first person who jumps off QF2, bypasses our immigration system and does a runner. My compassion lies with those who obey the law, who fill out their 40-page form, work out their sponsorship and do all the right things. When I have to grant a change of status, I sometimes betray those people who line up in the queue and who are delayed or who never come here because we have been weak, because it is a lot easier to give in when someone is here. Of course, it is easy; a parliamentarian comes up to me and says, `Please let so and sos brother stay, he has a lot of votes. It is a lot easier to make those decisions but they should never be made while someone else who is entitled to come here gets pushed out of the queue because some Minister makes a weak decision.I understand that illegals in this country are terribly exploited. I think that in the long term we must do something about employers who exploit them and who knowingly hire illegals. Although I want barriers to illegals, we must at all times leave some chink in the armour so that genuine refugees cannot be turned away at our borders. We must always have within our Migration Act provision so that when someone lands in Australia as a genuine refugee he is not turned away but is given due process, so that each of his claims is listened to until the case is finally determined. If we did not do so, we would become a very barbaric country.In conclusion, I say that this is a complex Bill. It is not a Bill that has been easy to understand. Its very complexity arises because everyone is looking for a loophole in immigration. Any loophole that is left will be exploited. Therefore, at times the language is convoluted. Quite often it is a defensive mechanism. I make no apology for that. Someone drew an analogy-it may have been Senator Alston-between this Bill and a tax Bill: everyone is looking for a way through, for the soft underbelly of the scheme.

182,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs)",3021,"—At present, section 37 of the Migration Act permits an officer, firstly, to board and search a vessel where there is reason to suspect that there are stowaways or persons seeking to enter illegally; secondly, to stop a vessel or a vehicle in the exercise of his powers-after a later amendment that will read `his or her-above; and, thirdly, with a search warrant issued by an authorised officer, to enter and search any building, vehicle or place for prohibited non-citizens or for persons working illegally and seize papers, passports and documents of identity. This means that under the present powers an officer may enter, search and detain an illegal entrant but he cannot frisk him for weapons or documents nor search his property.The Bill seeks to give two additional powers: first, to search the person and any property of the person reasonably supposed to be an illegal immigrant for documents and, secondly, with a search warrant issued by the Secretary, to enter a building or vehicle in which there is reasonable cause to believe that valuables belonging to an illegal entrant may be found under section 21d (16). Of course, the Scrutiny of Bills Committee says that the power to enter and search for property should be exercised only under a warrant issued by a judge or magistrate.We have here an unusual situation where an illegal entrant may be detained without warrant by an officer pending judicial examination within 48 hours, but his property that can be secreted quickly should not, the Committee says, be searched for with a warrant unless the warrant is issued by a judge or magistrate. Of course, by the time the authority of a judge or magistrate asserts a property can be obtained, even by phone, the property would have gone. That is despite the provision in the Bill that the detention of any property must be subject to judicial examination within three working days.The power of search of buildings, vehicles and places sought in relation to illegal entry of persons in subsections 21d (16) and (18) is similar to, if not milder than, the power of search of buildings, vehicles and places in relation to illegal entry of goods under sections 59, 91, 184, 185, 187 and 197 of the Customs Act. The search warrant in that Act is, as is proposed in this Bill, exercisable by a senior officer. In relation to the illegal entry of both persons and goods, the search powers must be adequate to deal with the problems involved.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
183,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ALSTON","LD4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",3021,"—I think the point Senator Jenkins sought to make is that it is necessary to have a formal mechanism to guard against abuse. That is the principal reason why both the Government and the Opposition ultimately have taken the view that `an authorised officer was too low a grade of responsibility. We take the view that if the power is vested in the Secretary to the Department it is a formal responsibility. It is one that could be reviewed in due course if there were no good grounds for the issue of the warrant in the first instance.In view of the fact that time is often of the essence and in a situation such as is contemplated by the clause, it is often necessary to conduct a search at short notice. I think that there is sufficient flexibility in the proposal to make the Secretary the responsible person. As I understand it, the purpose of the search is not simply to detect goods that might have been brought in illegally, but also to enable access to the goods and property of an illegal immigrant which might then be available to meet the costs of deportation or of keeping that person in custody. I think there is good reason for this; it is not merely to boost public revenue. Assuming that there is power to review it ultimately, I would have thought that it strikes the necessary balance between flexibility and formality.

However, in the view of the Democrats, the provision is not strong enough. I will explain why. The Governments amendment reads:`` `(7) Where a person appearing before the Tribunal to give evidence is not proficient in English, the presiding member may direct that communication with that person during his or her appearance proceed through an interpreter..The legislation simply states `is not proficient in English. I can inform the Senate that I have viewed the process of such decisions being made. A magistrate or a judge in a court can make that decision by asking the person concerned, `What is your name?. The person will give his or her name. `What is your address is then asked and the person gives his or her address. The magistrate or the judge can then say that this persons English is quite proficient: he or she does not need an interpreter. Most people who have been here only for a short while or do not use the English language to a great extent can give their name and address. However, in a courtroom situation or in a situation such as this one where a tribunal is sitting, such a person would not necessarily be able to understand all the workings of the Tribunal without an interpreter to pass on that information to him or her. That is why I have moved this amendment, which is quite substantial and detailed, on behalf of the Democrats.Part of the amendment, to be inserted in place of the Governments, reads:`` `(7) A person whose native language is not English must be provided with an accredited interpreter during an appearance before the Tribunal to give evidence, provided that:(a) the person has requested an interpreter because he or she lacks proficiency in EnglishIn other words, very often the people themselves are the best judges as to whether they can communicate properly and can understand the proceedings. Paragraph (b) of the amendment states:(b) the Tribunal, after due inquiry, is satisfied that the person lacks proficiency in English and the provision of an interpreter would assist the person and thereby serve the interests of fairness in the proceedings; and`After due inquiry are the operative words. Sometimes it is felt that people ask for an interpreter for reasons other than their need. The amendment continues:(c) an accredited interpreter is available.To that we have added:`` `(8) Where an accredited interpreter is not available for the purposes of subsection (7), the Tribunal must:(a) obtain the services of a suitable interpreter recognized by the National Authority for the Accreditation of Translators and Interpreters; or(b) if a suitable recognized interpreter is not available, obtain the services of any other suitable interpreter; or(c) if any other suitable interpreter is not available either:(i) adjourn or postpone the taking of evidence until an accredited, recognized or otherwise suitable interpreter is available; or(ii) if an adjournment or postponement would cause prejudice or injustice to the applicant, take the evidence in such a way that communication between the person and the Tribunal is facilitated to the fullest possible extent . . .Then there is the definition of an accredited interpreter. We have chosen to go into these details because, having some knowledge of abuses by interpreters in a courtroom or where unaccredited or unrecognised interpreters are used, we feel that this detail is necessary. The tightening up of these clauses is necessary also. I must tell the Minister that I do not believe that there is such tight legislation anywhere else in Australia at present. However, as this is an immigration amendment Bill, I think this would be the place to start. Therefore, I canvass very strongly the Senates support for this Democrat amendment.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
185,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs)",3025,"—The Government opposes this amendment. I draw Senator Jenkinss attention to where the clause was drawn from, which is the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. In our inquiries, we have found that there has been no difficulty in the way this clause has operated with that Tribunal. We see no reason why it should be transferred over. We have a second problem and that is the use of the words `accredited interpreter. That would make the Act unworkable. Senator Jenkins must remember that many of our inquiries and interviews will be done overseas. If an accredited interpreter is simply someone qualified under the rules of the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters, those people will not be available to take evidence overseas. That clause is simply not workable.I think Senator Jenkinss implied suggestion was that it is a matter for the discretion of the head of the Tribunal. Let me assure her that the head of the Tribunal will not quibble over the use of an interpreter. One might face the prospect of a denial and then an appeal to the Federal Court. Again, it comes back to this conception that the Tribunal is not someone sitting up on high, antagonistic to the client. We want to imbue in the Tribunal a desire to assist the inquiries of a client-not go the other way. As such, what Senator Jenkins is suggesting could well become a bureaucratic nightmare. It would not only be unworkable with people overseas but also become a bureaucratic nightmare. This section of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal has worked well for it and it is dealing with the same clients.I also say for the record that most people applying before the Tribunal do not fit the sort of stereotype that we have of them that they cannot speak English; most of them can. It is on that ability that they are able to be employed and sponsor relatives. If what we are saying is that most of the clients will not be able to express themselves in English, I must have a much more thorough look at immigration than I ever have before.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
186,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ALSTON","LD4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",3026,"—I think we all share the concern of Senator Jenkins that persons appearing before a tribunal such as the Social Security Appeals Tribunal should not be unfairly deprived of the opportunity to convey their message in the best possible manner. Quite clearly, interpreters will be required in a number of instances. But I think there is a misconception in what Senator Jenkins was saying if she was intending to convey the notion that, as presently worded, this clause would require the Tribunal to make a judgment about a persons proficiency after having heard only the name and address of the witness. That clearly is not the case. As it reads, the presiding member would be under an obligation to make that judgment at any stage as to whether a person is not proficient in English. I am certainly very familiar with situations in which people can give evidence in a court of law and can quite often string together a series of yeses or noes. It only becomes apparent, perhaps during cross-examination, that the persons English is pretty limited and that the witness is not doing justice to himself or herself. In a situation such as that, it would still be open to the Tribunal to decide that it was necessary to obtain an interpreter.Despite the rather complex language put forward by the Australian Democrats, at the end of it all, there is still a requirement that the Tribunal be satisfied after due inquiry. So, I do not really see why that amendment takes the matter any further. To hinge it on the need for a person to request an interpreter because that persons native language is not English is almost a tautology. It is highly unlikely that an English speaking person would be seeking the assistance of an interpreter. Perhaps some of us speak the language better or worse than others; but it certainly would not be appropriate to seek an interpreter in situations such as that.The second leg of that qualification occurs where the person has requested an interpreter because that person is not proficient in English. If that is a matter of subjective assessment on the part of a witness, it is clearly open to abuse. If it is an objective assessment to be made by the Tribunal, one is back where one started. At the end of the day, the Tribunal has to be satisfied that the person is not proficient in English. The only concern that I have-and I address this to the Minister-is the fact that there is still a discretion. If the Tribunal is satisfied that a person is not proficient in English, in what circumstances would the presiding member not direct that communication proceed through an interpreter? We need assurances on that matter rather than on the basis that seems to concern the Democrats. I would have thought that implicit in the whole proposal to provide an interpreter is the assumption that an interpreter will be made available where necessary. Because of the discretionary rather than mandatory nature of the clause, on the face of it, it is still open to the Tribunal to decline to provide those services, even where necessary.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is very easy to presume a facility in English because people can manage their day to day affairs very well-they can carry out their work, do the shopping and manage their household duties and so on. However, when people find themselves in a more formalised situation it is very often a different state of affairs. In fact, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has backed up what I said initially-that is, that it is presumed that because a person can carry out necessary daily duties comprehensively, he or she can both communicate and comprehend in a situation which is very different and in which very different language is used. Although Senator Ray has stated that he is not looking at an adversarial situation in such tribunals, nonetheless much will hinge on the result of the decision by the Tribunal. Because of that I suggest that where these tribunals take place in Australia-or indeed elsewhere-I was previously not aware that they would sit outside Australia--","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[12]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Nonetheless, although the National Authority for the Accreditation of Translators and Interpreters is quoted as the authority, that national authority, which has its headquarters here in Canberra, gives accreditation to people who have overseas qualifications. In any case, that authority could cope with overseas qualifications, but as I see it, we are looking at a situation which deals with the Tribunal within Australia.I believe that this is a very good opportunity for this more comprehensive sort of provision for an interpreter to be incorporated into legislation and the Migration Amendment Bill would be the best piece of legislation to start with. The Minister said that he had taken the wording from the Social Security Act with regard to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. One of the problems is that when the wording is loose-and the Minister has said that he is prepared to tighten up his own wording, and I appreciate that-there is a danger that proper proceedings will not take place. Although the Minister has said that he doubts very much that the Tribunal would not make a proper inquiry or decision, nonetheless if the legislation is there to make sure that a proper decision is made, surely that is the way that we, as responsible legislators, should go.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[12]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

In that situation the tribunal would be told in no uncertain terms that it was not to exercise a discretion arbitrarily or against the interests of a person not proficient in English. On that basis, and in view of the precedent of the Social Security Tribunal which does seem to work satisfactorily, we are prepared to leave that discretion there in case unforeseen situations arise in which it may be desirable that one not be simply compelled to order an interpreter. As I say, it is very difficult to spell out the precise circumstances in which such a situation might arise. But I know from my own experience in the courts that it is very desirable to have that discretion. As long as we assume that the tribunal is not going to act in bad faith, then I do not think we will come to too much harm.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is a good example of both sides of this chamber-indeed, potentially all honourable senators in this chamber, all members of parliament-serving the best interests of Australia. I do not want to be too sentimental and too self-congratulatory, but I believe that often when the elected government brings forward a major reform through an important Bill such as the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill it does not always get it entirely right. Instead of waiting until the committee stage of a Bill when various amendments are put forward and debated, it is sensible for representatives of opposition and government to talk to each other in the way that happened in this case between 2 May and today, 30 May. The 82 amendments which we are now about to see in place are the result of that genuinely sensibly spirited bipartisan approach.As a result, we have a Bill that will become law in this country. If there had not been such a sensible approach to meet the arguments being put forward by representatives in this chamber, there would be no Bill at all and there would not have been this reform. Some of the objectives that are before us in the Bill could certainly have been achieved by ministerial decision, but for the reasons we have all given in our speeches on the second reading and at various other times it is sounder, clearer and more publicly open that we have a Bill in this form.

These persons would almost certainly become subject to the mandatory deportation provisions before the Minister reopened their category of application for further processing.I propose two additional clauses under this amendment. The first of the two proposed clauses provides that the category of excluded days during which the 28-day clock is halted will include any period during which the Minister halts the processing of visas. The second paragraph, paragraph (d), provides that any period during which an appeal is being considered by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, foreshadowing an amendment I will be moving later, or the Federal Court-and any appeal can currently and under this legislation be put before the Federal Court on a point of law-will also count as a period during which the 28-day clock is halted. In other words, this amendment has been put forward by the Australian Democrats to ensure that any deportations that may be carried out will be carried out with the right amount of time for due consideration.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[24]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
208,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs)",3031,"—I will say this only once throughout the debate on the Australian Democrats amendments: one of the great problems I have with them-and I must say that I have looked at them only this afternoon-is that they tend to be almost a package within themselves. It takes us 180 degrees away from where the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill is heading. To adopt any one of them does not necessarily fit in with the previous package. But I will go to each clause as it is raised.I have two problems with the amendment. Firstly, it would defeat any capping of entry permit because it would permit illegal entrants a period of amnesty from deportation. Secondly, it would also allow a very well funded illegal entrant to buy an unlimited amnesty while every recourse is pursued. For those two reasons, I cannot support the amendment.Amendment negatived.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[25]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
209,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator JENKINS","IH4","(Western Australia)","AD","N/A",3031,"—I move:(2) Page 9, after clause 5, insert the following new clause:``5a. The Principal Act is amended by inserting the following new Part after Part I:`PART 1A-FAIRNESS IN DECISIONSAvoidance of injustice etc.`5A In spite of any other provision of this Act, a decision under this Act, by an officer, a review officer, the Secretary, the Minister, the Tribunal or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal must be in favour of the applicant if:(a) because of the special circumstances of the case it would be manifestly unfair, unjust and oppressive to decide otherwise; and(b) the decision is otherwise not inconsistent with the objects of this Act...I did hear the Ministers comments. Nonetheless, amendment No. 2 is crucial to the Australian Democrats. The Migration Act 1958 has been widely and justifiably criticised because it gives an enormous range of discretion to the Minister and the departmental decision-makers. As the Minister well knows, as a result, a very large number of requests on behalf of individual applicants are presented to him for consideration. The Minister thus becomes burdened with a large case load of individual decisions. In these circumstances, I am sure it is possible for the Minister to wilt under pressure when faced by a decision which has obvious political implications.The aim of the Government in this legislation is to correct the situation by removing the element of discretion. However, the Democrats are of the view that under the Bill before us the pendulum has swung from one highly undesirable extreme to the other equally undesirable extreme-that is, to a situation in which there is virtually no discretion left at all. In other words, the Government has thrown the baby out with the bath water. The immigration decisions have been compared with taxation decisions, but we are not making taxation decisions. We are not dealing with figures and numbers, and we are not dealing with the national accounts; we are talking about people, about human lives. We are making major decisions. We are talking about whether Australians will be permitted to live with their children, with the partners of their choice, or with their elderly parents. In refugee cases, for example, it is about whether people will be deported from Australia to their countries of origin in which they might face imprisonment for long periods, or face persecution or, as has happened in extreme cases, even execution. Human beings do not fit into convenient pigeonholes. There will always be the occasional special circumstance. There will always be difficult cases at the margin. The new part proposed in my amendment which is headed `Fairness in Decisions states:`5a In spite of any other provision of this Act, a decision under this Act, by an officer, a review officer, the Secretary, the Minister, the Tribunal or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal must be in favour of the applicant if:(a) because of the special circumstances of the case it would be manifestly unfair, unjust and oppressive to decide otherwise; and(b) the decision is otherwise not inconsistent with the objects of this Act...In other words, the objects of the Act may well be to be fair and just, et cetera, but we cannot legislate for every single case. This amendment provides a very suitable-I do not want to use the word `loophole because I do not mean loophole-part of the legislation for the Minister to use if he knew that the decision he was forced to make, because the terms of the Act were tight, would be unjust. I put it to honourable senators that this amendment would lead to a more just, a more equitable and, above all, a more efficient system. I do not believe that legislating for every single dot and comma is necessarily efficient. We are talking about human beings. We all know what happens to very efficient regimes, and I do not think we want to go in that direction. With this proposed amendment we can arrive at decisions which will be respected and will be even more cost-efficient. The Government has proposed a rigid system in which there is virtually no discretion at all. This, inevitably, will lead to a proliferation of appeals, since decision makers will have no choice but to refuse `special circumstances applications and the applicants will, therefore, be inclined to use the appeals process. So we need a system with enough flexibility to ensure that cases, which do not precisely fit the prescribed criteria, but which obviously have special merits, can be approved without having to be dragged through the full and expensive appeals process.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[26]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
210,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ALSTON","LD4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",3032,"—This sort of provision provides a field day for lawyers, but I do not think it does much for decision makers. It throws out all the other guidelines, provisions and requirements, and allows a catch-all discretion provision which, in a sense, is a classic invitation to hopeless cases to throw themselves on the mercy of the courts. Let me illustrate one example of where it would not be, presumably, the intention of the Australian Democrats. If we were to find that because of the special circumstances of a case it would be manifestly unfair, unjust and oppressive to decide otherwise but, in fact, the decision was inconsistent with the objects of the Act, we would fail on that test. That seems to be a ludicrous proposition because presumably what the Democrats have in mind is that the ultimate discretion should override everything else. It renders it a nonsense. I could perhaps understand it if they confined it to part (a) of the amendment, but to add in (b) as though it is a savings provision is an invitation to any litigant, no matter how hopeless the case might be otherwise, to seek to have those sorts of criteria taken into account despite overwhelming evidence of the necessity to make a firm decision. I think we are all acutely aware of the political and other pressures to which a Minister can be subject. The last thing we want is to find compassionate pleas being made to a whole range of decision makers which are, in effect, contrary to the bulk of the evidence. I simply cannot support the amendment.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[27]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
211,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs)",3033,"—This proposal opens up the area of discretion. In listening to Senator Jenkins tonight, firstly, one would think that that power in the Act, which gives the Minister the ultimate right to intervene in favour of the client, was not there. Secondly, it presumes that all regulations will be written without flexibility. But the point should be made that the subjective discretion relies on the objects of the Act, which appear nowhere in the Act. That is one of the problems we would face if this amendment were carried. It would mean that the Government, firstly, would lose control of its immigration program. Secondly, the selection criteria on regulations would be virtually redundant. Thirdly, it would be very hard to administer the legislation. Under this clause any decision maker can justify any decision, however unwise and uninformed, and indeed, however corrupt. Officers could be paid money to use this clause. There would be no comeback if they were paid money to let someone in. So, firstly, it knocks over straw persons who are not there, and, secondly, it would make the whole Act redundant because the amendment would insert overriding criteria. It makes the rest of the criteria a waste of time.One of the difficulties I always have in these matters is people saying to me, `You only do the compassionate cases. I must say that I have hardly dealt with an immigration case, out of the thousands I have dealt with, that has not had in it an element of compassion. That is part of the difficulty. So the Government strongly opposes this particular amendment.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[28]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

People do appeal on compassionate grounds. If the Minister were to look at the statistics he would find that by far the vast majority of cases involve people who seek to come to Australia on a family reunion basis. We must all realise that every time we bring in a migrant on a skills basis, or on a business migration basis, or whatever, we are setting up moral, ethical and extremely difficult decisions for ourselves. Once we accept people, they are here. To deny such people the right to stay in Australia, based on circumstances which, as I stated in my amendment, would be manifestly unfair, unjust and oppressive, is extraordinary. This country takes in migrants, and migrants are people. I realise that the Government and the Opposition are not in favour of this amendment, which is headed `Fairness in Decisions, but many Australians will be disappointed by that decision.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[29]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I would have thought that the fairest possible approach that one can take in setting the rules of the game is to have them written in such a way that they are understood in advance. To me, it is the height of inefficiency to have a system that depends ultimately upon the length of the chancellors foot. In other words, it is in the eye of the beholder as to what is manifestly unfair, unjust and oppressive. That is a system that invites everyone to say that his case is somehow special and compassionate. As a result of this sort of proposal we would never be able to make objective judgments; everything would be relative.In my experience everyone is able to come up with some element of sympathy and compassion when presenting a case. I have never come across a criminal case, for example, where something cannot be said in favour of the accused. If he is that bad he must be insane. That is an excuse in itself. It does not help at all to somehow suggest that fairness in decision-making has to involve subjective assessments. In our view fairness is best arrived at in the interests of the community and the speed of the justice delivered by having a set of rules that are clear, well understood and able to be objectively applied.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[30]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
214,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TEAGUE","PJ4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A",3033,"—Compassion! I do not wish to speak on any of the other Australian Democrats amendments unless I am really provoked. I rise, firstly, because Senator Jenkins said that this was a most significant amendment amongst those listed by her. Secondly, in her speech in the second reading debate she placed a great deal of emphasis upon the word `compassion. I happen to agree entirely with all that Senator Robert Ray and my colleague Senator Alston have said. I happen to hold the view that all of us in the chamber place great significance upon compassion and the relevance of compassion, as those preceding me have said, in most decisions relating to immigration. It would be entirely wrong for anyone to purport that, because this particular Democrat amendment is being opposed by the rest of us in this chamber, there is any want of compassion on our part.The analogy that comes to mind and illustrates why I disagree with the way Senator Jenkins put this principle as a foundation point of her speech on the second reading debate is the analogy that amongst the churches in Australia we occasionally get a warmhearted person saying, `Theology doesnt matter, only love. It is as if that kind of appeal to love-or in this case, appeal to compassion-were so pre-eminent and self-evident to everyone participating in any decision that we did not need any other kind of definition at all. That is not the experience of the churches in this country. It is found to be the case that in determining questions of decision in churches, or in any advice about ethical matters or moral advice, a whole series of matters ought to be defined and logically applied.Without carrying that analogy too far let it be made very clear that the Opposition supports the view that there needs to be defined policies by the elected government of the day and for those policies to be set forth from time to time in regulations under this Act. Every word of those regulations is important. It is superficial to think that we can, without the need of any of those particular regulations, just rely upon compassion, wisdom or fairness. Without making any more of a meal of it, without conceding one jot to anyone who would decry those not supporting this Democrat amendment, and whilst accepting that we all place a great weight upon sensible compassion, we should accept that there must be regulations and that the decision-making under the immigration legislation of this country should be on the basis of the whole of the regulations and policies of the elected government.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[31]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
215,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator HAINES","1H4","(South Australia-","AD","Leader of the Australian Democrats)",3034,"—I would like to put to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs a real life example and ask him how it would be dealt with under this legislation. In 1982 under the Fraser Government the immigration laws were fairly strictly controlled. From memory, Ian Macphee was the then Minister for Immigration. I was approached by an Iranian female who was out here under the overseas student scheme. She was requesting permanent residence here. She had been turned down by the Department and was quite distraught for a fairly simple reason-that is, she had come out here when the Shah was still in power. She was due to return to her country of origin after the Ayatollah took control of that country. She was therefore probably the worst type of person in the eyes of the new ruler of that country-a Western educated female. Her chances of survival if she had been returned to Iran were somewhere between Buckleys and none.Between the efforts of my office and her attempts, the Minister exercised whatever discretion he had under the Act as it stood in 1982 to grant her exemption from the normal requirement that applies to people who come here under that overseas student program; that is, the requirement that they return to their country of origin and put into effect for the benefit of that country the skills and education that they have developed in this country. It is a part of our overseas aid program. What would happen in a case like that under the legislation that the Minister has before him if there was no discretionary element on the grounds of fairness, justice and compassion when we have a situation caused not by a change in this country but by a change in another country that leaves somebody vulnerable under a scheme that to all intents and purposes should require them to return but which puts them in jeopardy if they do?","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[32]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The example the honourable senator raises concerns the eligibility to apply for a change of status given changed circumstances. The circumstances in this case would be under section 6a of the current Act which will transpose in the next Act under refugee status.

218,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs)",3035,"—A change of status for refugee cases takes three months. In the meantime there is no action taken to repatriate, or anything else. In terms of the events that have occurred in Sri Lanka on occasions and in Fiji and elsewhere in the world-and maybe in China-where there are changed circumstances back home which places that person in a refugee status, of course that overrides any other provision that the person has to be returned home. Each case is dealt with individually as in this case, not as a class of people.As I have said before, direct ministerial intervention depends on two matters. The first is the degree of flexibility written into regulations. It would only be a stupid department which would have no flexibility because that would up the appeal rate and the cost. The second is the residual power retained in the Act to say that if a person has an appeal, via the two-tier appeal mechanism, the Minister may intervene in that persons favour. If this were not a refugee matter, but another matter, Senator Haines may have advised her constituent to go through the appeal process and, if unsuccessful, bring the case to me and say, `Look, there are special circumstances. The only proviso to make sure Ministers actually look after the genuine cases is that I, or my successor as the Minister, has to put the reasons down in Parliament for that decision. He does not have to name the person. It is very much like Administrative Appeals Tribunal decisions in criminal deportation cases. He has to say why it was in the public interest to do so. So I would argue that there is ample provision in the new legislation and the proposed regulations to cover that case, but that is an easy one in which a result can almost be guaranteed. There are much more difficult cases to decide involving, for instance, illness, as the honourable senator would know from her electorate office work.It is a bit of a straw man to say that, under the new legislation, there will be absolute inflexibility in decision-making. Nobody is proposing that. There will be a degree of flexibility. If this amendment is adopted, every other criterion-points system included will go out the window, because it is up to an officer to decide what is unjust and what is oppressive. If that officer had been given $5,000 in his pocket, he would still be entitled to make that decision and could not be challenged under the amendment, even though he agreed corruptly to issue a migrant visa. This totally redefines. As I said before, if we leave a loophole in the legislation it will not be a case of a few individuals diving through it; it will be tens of thousands within a few weeks.Unfortunately, that is always a problem with immigration. An attempt is made to have one big, fair hurdle which people jump over to get into the country. If I may continue with the hurdle analogy, if the hurdle is lower at one end than at the other, some people get an advantage, and we do not seek to do that. It is very wrong to provide that the Minister or the Department cannot intervene. Many cases are fixed up in the Department and will be able to be fixed up under this new legislation, where commonsense prevails. The last thing the Department and the Minister want to do is to send people back to their deaths.Amendment negatived.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[33]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

They relate to the clause headed `Circumstances in which non-citizens may become illegal entrants. At the bottom of page 12 and on page 13 of the Bill, there appears:``(8) A reference in this section to a person producing, or causing to be produced, a bogus document . . . whether or not the person knew that the document was a bogus document.``(9) A reference to a person producing, or causing to be produced, a passenger card containing information that was false or misleading . . . whether or not the person knew that the information contained in it was false or misleading in a material particular.``(10) A reference . . . to a person making, or causing to be made, a statement that was false or misleading . . . whether or not the person knew that the statement was false or misleading in a material particular.Those additions about whether or not the person knew that the document or information was true or false go against the laws of intent in this country. The amendments add, after the `whether or not clauses, the words, `provided that a reasonable person in the same circumstances would have known or suspected that the document was a bogus document in the first amendment; `that the information was false or misleading in a material particular in the second case; and `that the information was false or misleading in a material particular in the third case.The amendments soften the strict liability element of the subclauses by providing that an applicant cannot be penalised for the production of a bogus document or false or misleading information if the applicant could not have reasonably been expected to be aware that the document or the information was false. Without these qualifications there is a possibility of a great injustice being done to individuals. While it is important to prevent fraud, it is plainly foolish, in doing so, to go to the extreme of penalising those unwittingly responsible for tendering documents which are known to be false. Of course, that can happen and I am sure that Minister Ray could give us examples of it. I do not propose to speak at length to these amendments. I have made my point.

The courts have long held that it is not necessary to provide that a person who entered Australia with a forged passport knew that the passport was forged, nor is it necessary to prove that a person who provided a false material statement in a passenger card knew that the statement was false. This was affirmed by the full Federal Court in Naumovska v. the Minister, 5 Australian Law Reports, 357. The provision in proposed subsection 11a (9) restates the position in relation to proof in the body of the legislation to avoid any doubt in relation to this critical fall-back provision. It is misleading, in our view, to suggest that the provision intends to catch unknowing innocents. Such unknowing innocents would have no difficulty in establishing their entitlement to an entry permit.As is the case with many other suggested amendments, we are moving from objectivity to subjectivity equals litigation equals long delays. Whenever there is a choice, objective criteria are much better than subjective criteria because not everyone has the same subjective approach to matters. In this case I would very strongly argue a subjective view of what is a reasonable person.

Under the provisions of the legislation as it stands, a person becomes an illegal entrant upon entering Australia illegally and, 28 days later, automatically becomes subject to the mandatory deportation provisions. A person who has gone beyond the 28-day period of grace is debarred from making a change of status application and deportation is automatic.Inevitably, some people will become illegal entrants through ignorance, misadventure or the actions of others. Some illegal entrants may well have experienced a significant change of personal circumstances subsequent to their illegal entry. Many of the currently estimated 100,000 illegal entrants fall into such categories. Some of them have been here for many years and may well be admired members of the community. Under the Government provisions, all such people, whether they have children or grandchildren here, or whatever, would be mandatorily deported at great cost to themselves or to the taxpayer and at the cost of great dislocation in some cases to their relatives here. This amendment provides for the 28-day clock to start ticking, not on the date of entry but only when such persons are notified that they are illegal entrants and subject to deportation, and are further notified that they have a right of appeal.

In that situation presumably a notice cannot be given to the person and the stay of execution would be delayed indefinitely. I also wonder what the purpose of the exercise is. If a person is given a section 11a notice in the first instance, it would not seem to be asking too much for that person to be made aware of his or her rights to seek a review of any ultimate decision. Indeed, one would expect such a person to be acutely aware that time is limited and that deportation is imminent. In those circumstances it seems odd that the intention is to somehow freeze the process before formally advising the person of his or her rights. If those rights are made known to the person at the outset-one could almost assume that the person will be made aware of them-I do not see why one would want to hold up the process beyond the 28-day period.Amendment negatived.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[39]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The legislation gives the Minister absolute discretion to cancel a valid visa. This appears to be counter to the Governments declared intention and opens the way for a Minister to make a decision on political considerations. It is also possibly legally, and definitely morally, questionable because the days when Ministers were empowered to exercise absolute discretion without challenge or scrutiny by the Parliament, have passed. This amendment provides that the Minister must have grounds for cancelling a valid visa and such a decision would become subject to challenge. If the reason that the Minister must give for cancelling a visa is in the public interest, it can be a challengeable matter. I suggest that in those circumstances it should be challengeable. The amendment adds the following words to the legislation:Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the Minister may cancel a valid visa if to do so would be in the public interest.I believe that would take away some of the untrammelled discretionary possibilities that the Minister has at present. Amendments 10 and 13 are very similar. Amendment No. 10 adds the proposed subsection:and such notice must specify the reasons, including any relevant statistical data for the direction.So amendment No. 10 would require that, if the Minister proposes to stop the processing of applications for any particular class of visas, he or she must give reasons and provide any relevant statistical data to justify giving such a direction. Here again, without such provision, it remains open to a Minister to manipulate the composition of the migration intake, for political or other purposes, by opening or closing the various categories. There again, although our intentions are the same, perhaps we are simply looking at things from a different angle. As I said before, amendment Nos 12 and 13 are very similar to amendments Nos 9 and 10 and I would give similar reasons for their adoption. I will speak to Nos 9 and 10 initially.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[44]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
232,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ALSTON","LD4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A",3039,"—We have a fairly well defined administrative law mosaic in this country. I think one can say that the concerns of Senator Jenkins would have been well founded prior to the mid 1970s but nowadays to vest what, on the face of it, appears to be an untrammelled discretion in fact is one that is very much subject to review by the courts. I think the view would be taken that a secretary could not arbitrarily or without good reason cancel a visa. That is as it ought to be. One does not want to arrive at a situation in which a decision can be made corruptly or capriciously. But to simply add the criterion of the public interest, to my mind, does not advance the case; indeed, it probably confuses it. As we all know, what is in the public interest is a matter of constant debate at all levels of society. I cannot for a moment imagine that that would be of any assistance to a court or to a secretary in determining whether the exercise of discretion was valid in the circumstances.If the notice of reasons were a matter affecting an individual, I could understand it, although once again these days the rules of administrative law virtually require the provision of reasons. But where we are talking about a policy decision it is hard to imagine that a government could simply turn off the tap without explanation. I would have thought that the political process in this country would ensure that a Minister would have to give fairly persuasive and powerful reasons to the public at large in order to justify such a decision. Those reasons would undoubtedly involve the provision of any statistical data or numerical concern that the Minister might have. One would have thought that the Minister, in his own interests and those of the Government, would be fairly forthcoming before taking such a step. It just seems to me that to imagine that somehow a decision will be made and no reasons given is not a plausible situation. Although one can understand the basis for the concerns, I do not believe they are well founded.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[45]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

237,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs)",3040,"—Let us not speculate. Part of the other problem is the technical flaws in amendment No. 9. It makes the provision subject to the other provisions of the Act. It does not specify which provisions. That leaves enormous uncertainty. It also imports a test of public interest and Senator Alston has gone a long way into demolishing that. So I very strongly oppose amendment No. 9.Amendment No. 10 is almost a case of locking the stable door after the horse has bolted. The need for capping and closure of categories under the new system is far less than it ever would have been under the old system. If one goes back to the response to Cape and looks at the material we have produced one sees that for the most part we have an overall cap to begin with, with some demand driven areas and the rest residual. It will be only in rare cases, for a short period, mostly possibly caused by change of status blowouts, that we will ever need to invoke this particular section. But I think it is important that it is in the Act so that what happened in 1987-88 never happens again, when the immigration program blew out month by month. The Government believes that the public announcement of the capping and the notification in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette must have sufficient provisions which are consistent with the public administration of the Commonwealth. Where appropriate, a ministerial statement will be made in Parliament explaining the reasons for taking such a step and the circumstances that led to it.My comments on amendment No. 13 are really the same as those on amendment No. 9. In relation to amendment No. 14, we simply say that the Government believes that this is necessary to discourage people going underground. In relation to amendment No. 15, the Government wishes to put walls around the grant of resident status in Australia. The expansion of this program obviously prejudice orderly migration. It is one of the fastest growing areas of immigration. Amendment No. 16 seeks to expand a provision that is now in section 6a (1) (c). This provision has worked well. No person who obtained refugee status in Australia was disadvantaged by its current operation. Hence the need for it has not been established. Again, amendment No. 17 relates to replacing objectivity with subjectivity. I will not reiterate all the arguments as to why I prefer objective assessment rather than subjective assessment.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[46]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

This particular addition has been requested in representations from very many ethnic communities. This amendment would extend the family reunion category to include brothers and sisters. Given that there are people who do not have any relatives in any other family reunion categories, it is appropriate that categories be extended in this way. As I said when I spoke earlier, it is widely recognised that migrants who already have a close relative resident in Australia are more likely to settle successfully and are less likely to become dependent on welfare and less likely to leave Australia, as some skilled and independent migrants do after a relatively short time here. So in fact this will help reunite many families without opening the door to a flood of dependent persons.Similarly, amendment No. 16 provides that persons who have the status of a refugee cannot be deported on a technicality. I would be interested in hearing the Ministers comments on those two amendments.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[47]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Before making a deportation order under section 17a or 18, the Minister must accede to a written request from the illegal entrant that he or she not be deported but be permitted to leave Australia voluntarily, under the supervision of the Minister, for an agreed destination...It is a simple fact of life that mistakes are made-even by Ministers on occasions. I am sure that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs does not need to be reminded of the $5 arrival fee and the $240 impost for migration appeals. On both occasions the Australian Democrats put up amendments against both those provisions. I would also suggest that it is ludicrous to create a situation in which an obvious mistake cannot be corrected by providing that orders for deportation cannot be revoked-not by the Minister, the Appeals Tribunal or the courts. My amendment No. 18 provides for the sensible option of revoking decisions which may be found, after the event, to be incorrect. Amendment No. 18 proposes the insertion of the following subsection:. . . A deportation made under this section may be revoked.As the Bill stands at the moment, there is no possibility of the revocation of deportation orders because they are mandatory. It could well be that a mistake could be made.Amendment No. 19 provides protection to ensure that bona fide refugees cannot be deported. In that amendment I propose to add a new subsection which says:. . . Nothing in this section authorizes the deportation of a person who has the status of a refugee within the meaning of:(a) the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees that was done at Geneva on 28 July 1951; or(b) the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees that was done at New York on 31 January 1967.Of course, Australia is a signatory to both the convention and the protocol.Amendment No. 20 relates to the voluntary departure of illegal entrants. As the Government has drafted its amendments, illegal entrants in Australia have to be deported; they do not have the option of leaving voluntarily. This is plainly unnecessarily aggressive and liable to be unnecessarily expensive. Amendment No. 20 would make it possible for illegals to leave voluntarily and of their own free will under the supervision of the Minister. The new subsection reads:. . . Before making a deportation order under section 17a or 18, the Minister must accede to a written request from the illegal entrant that he or she not be deported but be permitted to leave Australia voluntarily, under the supervision of the Minister, for an agreed destination.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[49]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
243,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs)",3042,"—Section 17a is planned to be the end of the road. There must be finality to the processes of selection. To add a discretionary power to revoke a mandatory order is, in my view, simply a nonsense. It defeats the purpose of the whole provision. A deportation order under section 18 can be revoked and is an auxiliary to section 17a. Of course 17a can be quashed by the Federal Court in an error of law. If an officer has signed an order based on a defective decision, it is open to the Federal Court to remit the case back for a fresh decision.In relation to amendment No. 20, the distinction must be made here between a right to go voluntarily and a practice. Quite clearly, if we have apprehended someone and that person says, `Look, I am leaving on tomorrows plane, here is my ticket, we are not about to deport him. He can go voluntarily. If a person says, `I have $20,000 in my pocket. If you take me to the Qantas office I will buy a ticket and you can see me off tomorrow, there is no reason for us to deport him. Why should we pay for his air fare if he wants to leave? There is always that sort of flexibility. I suppose that these days if we deported all these people we would take part of that $20,000 to pay for their air tickets-and we would probably send them first class just to make sure they went home happily! In regard to amendment No. 20, I would not like to make it a right for a person to be able to volunteer to go because this would have all sorts of other consequences. But it is certainly a practical administrative matter. If a person volunteers to go, proves that he is going and we can arrange for him to leave, that person would always be allowed to go voluntarily rather than be deported. That is just common sense.I have a note on amendment No. 19 which I wish to put on the record. It should be borne in mind that the protection of the convention and the authority to remain pursuant to the Migration Act are two distinct streams. While the two streams are joined at various places for the sake of administrative convenience, they are nonetheless separate and apart. There can be protection and asylum in Australia without the benefit of an entry permit. There are two provisions of the convention relating to the status of refugees which are relevant. The first is paragraph 1 of article 31, which reads:The contracting States shall not impose penalties on account of their illegal entry or presence on refugees who, coming directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened in the sense of article 1, enter or are present in their territory without authorisation, provided that they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.The second is article 33, which reads:1. No contracting State shall expel or return a refugee in any manner whatsoever to frontiers or territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.2. The benefit of the present provision may not, however, be claimed by a refugee whom there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he is or who, having been convicted by final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of that country.The Bill allows a period of grace for a refugee claimant if he or she presents himself or herself without delay as required by article 31.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[50]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The effect is that the right to seek entry on humanitarian grounds will continue to be unavailable to persons who make unsuccessful frontier applications for refugee status. Yet many people who fail to meet the onerous individual-persecution standard for refugee status can meet the still rigorous level of proof required for grant of residency on humanitarian grounds.

Some improvements have been made in the legislation. The Government, by its own amendments, has made certain substitutions in proposed section 61. However, the Democrats have sought, all along the line, a further review of decisions. This amendment would leave the present two levels of review as proposed by the Government. The first level of review would be carried out by a review officer. We regard that as something that should be automatic after a decision within the Department. If the person comes back and says that the adding up has been done wrongly, or that a certain circumstance has not been taken into consideration, that review should automatically be reviewed internally.The next level of review is that by the Immigration Review Tribunal. Although it is not what the Democrats recommended, as it has been proposed by the Government and agreed to by the Opposition we would be happy to leave that level of review in place. However, the Democrats are proposing a third level where there is a need for a further review. This review could be carried out by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It has been our proposition all along the line that if an initial application is made before staff who give full information to the prospective migrant about the likely number of points, and so on, and if there is then a proper review by a review officer, very often matters will not be taken any further. As I said before, it is really only the family reunion categories that proceed further. If people know where they stand-and here I agree with the Minister and with Senator Alston-it makes things easier for them. But if the procedures are so tight that people feel genuinely that they are disadvantaged, they will seek reviews, and the matter will go on and on. The proposal in amendment No. 27 is to leave out the Governments clause 61 and insert new clauses 61, 61a and 61b.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[58]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is pointless setting up and immediately enacting our internal review without the regulations. However, I do assure everyone that not only the second application review but the normal internal review will proceed until we can meld the two systems together. If the second suggestion of having a third tier appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) was to be carried I would sink the Bill. It would cost us $15m, by our estimation, maybe up to $18m. It is a terribly expensive process, especially given, as I indicated before, the leakage rate that occurs in the immigration area. That would make that untenable.Even worse, it would mean that all decisions under the act would be appealable, including the two excluded categories of refugees and criminal deportations. This Government has a view that it is the ultimate arbiter on criminal deportations, subject to advice from the AAT but it is only advice. In regard to refugees, we have made it quite clear as Government policy that we will not allow the courts to reinterpret the 1951 convention or the 1967 protocols. If the courts did reinterpret the definition of `refugee, it may imperil the whole refugee program to Australia. It is a program that we can be proud of. We take eight per thousand of our population in refugees, which is the highest per capita intake of any Western country. To throw all that out on the whim of some ruling from a court is not really worth it.Amendment negatived.","N/A","MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[59]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

287,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator JENKINS","IH4","(Western Australia)","AD","N/A",3049,"—The Australian Democrats have one amendment to the Migration Amendment Bill 1989 and a contingent amendment if that amendment is not passed. The ostensible purpose of the slim Bill we have before us is to rescue the 1988 legislation from the specific flaw which has deterred the proclamation of that legislation and to enable the implementation of elements of the Governments master plan for passenger processing. It is a lightweight package. It rescues the tourist pre-clearance plan from postponement, pending full implementation of the database system on which it is supposed to be dependent. The Democrats agreed to accept the 1988 Bill when it was introduced. We accepted the Governments assurances that all was well. We said we would monitor the results of it over the first year or two of its operation. Now we have the Government admitting that its legislation was flawed and it cannot be proclaimed. In the circumstances we could be forgiven for thinking that a very tight amendment would be drafted or that there would be a very thorough explanation of the precise nature of the problem in order to persuade the Committee that the Department was quite genuine about its sponsorship of the present legislation.The Democrats have moved amendments to the legislation because we believe the current Migration Amendment Bill 1989 is too wide in scope and it would provide unnecessary discretionary power to be exercised in a potentially non-accountable manner by instrument in writing. There is no limitation of the new power to the temporary circumstances for which it is claimed they are required. Our amendments would have two advantages. Firstly, they will cease to have effect when all the overseas posts are equipped with database access. Secondly, they will have fewer unforeseen consequences because they are more exactly tailored to the Governments manifest purposes. They do not create any new discretionary power that may be capable of abuse or lingering effects unforeseen by the Senate. I move:(1) Pages 1 and 2, clause 3, line 9 (page 1) to line 11 (page 2), leave out the clause, insert the following clauses:Entry permitted by visa``3. Section 6aa of the Principal Act is amended by omitting from subsection (1), ``The holder of a visa, and substituting, ``Except as otherwise provided by section 11, the holder of a visa.Visa etc not to entitle persons to enter Australia``4. Section 11 of the Principal Act is amended by adding the following paragraph after paragraph 2 (b):; or (c) a visa or similar notation, or a form of provisional authority to enter Australia, issued, after the commencement of section 6aa, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to a person in respect of whom movement records and other information required for the purposes of this Act are not recorded in a notified data base under section 65ab...","N/A","MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
288,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator ROBERT RAY","UI4","(Victoria-","ALP","Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs)",3050,"—I have a few general observations to make. The legislation introduced in 1988 dealt with two principal issues: visas that may operate as entry permits in certain defined circumstances, that is, entry visas; and preclearance of passengers overseas boarding certain direct flights to Australia. Entry visas as such are not related to precleared flights. Most passengers carrying entry visas will not travel on precleared flights though preclearance of flights cannot be implemented without entry visas.The 1988 legislation cannot validly be said to have failed. Owing to the necessary administrative preparations, it is yet to commence. The need for amendments arose out of technical difficulties in introducing a worldwide network and the obvious need to provide for ongoing contingency plans in the case of computer equipment failure or data communication breakdown. If the Bill is enacted, both the 1988 Act and this Bill will commence on 1 July 1989, thus the Bill is separated from the major Bill we have been considering. Senator Jenkins said last year that the Australian Democrats intended to monitor the results closely over the first year or two of its operation. If that is so, there is a rush to judgment in calling the 1988 Act a failed measure ahead of its commencement.I now turn to the first amendment. The concept of an entry visa operating as an entry permit on entry to Australia at the proclaimed airport is premised on data relating to the issue of a visa being available at the entry point at the time the holder seeks to enter Australia. It is also essential that the entry visa document be readily identifiable by all persons as one which is capable of operating as an entry permit. Our original legislation formulation anticipated the installation of necessary equipment to permit widespread application of the concept from the date the Act was proclaimed.While equipment is in place at overseas missions which now enables some 90 per cent of visas to be machine issued, and we are progressively installing equipment to transfer the visa data to Australia and to facilitate entry processes, it will be some time before 100 per cent coverage is achieved. The Government does not want to delay the benefits to productivity and passenger facilitation which are achievable from those systems which are already in place and has decided to provide the legislative amendments to permit this. Hence the provision for the Minister to determine by instrument that the visa entry permit concept will apply only to those visas granted in a specific manner or form, that is, where computer based visa issue equipment is installed overseas and data links established to Australia.The amendment proposed by the Democrats seeks simply to focus on a prerequisite for a persons visa record being held in a notified database. The amendment contains no provision to link that record to a specific form of visa so that the passenger, the carrier or an officer at the airport can recognise that visa as being an entry visa. It would thus be most difficult for persons to differentiate between what is an entry visa and what is not.While the proposal may be seen to be consistent with our broad approach, it will be extremely complicated to administer and prone to confusion. We seek to ensure that the procedures to apply to the visa entry permit system are as uncomplicated as possible, especially at entry points in Australia, whilst maintaining the necessary disciplines. The legislation and the Governments Bill meet those requirements. The amendment proposed by the Democrats would deny the Government the opportunity progressively to achieve the benefits flowing from the new visa issue and entry processes I have outlined. It would also place the Government at a disadvantage in facilitating the burgeoning tourist growth to Australia. I am therefore not able to accept the amendment.","N/A","MIGRATION AMENDMENT BILL 1989","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

300,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BISHOP","SE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3051,"—In beginning the debate on this package of Bills which were introduced into the chamber on 23 May and which are being taken together, I notice that the only Government speaker listed to debate this important issue is the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), who is at the bottom of the list and presumably will summarise for the Government. That indicates the lack of care and attention that the Government is giving to the question of superannuation and indeed the important question of the need to encourage savings, particularly with the figures that have come out this week.This debate is also quite belated. It follows a press release which is some 12 months old, and we have reached the stage where perhaps we ought to be asking for sunset clauses to be built into press releases so that if legislation is not brought in within a reasonable time the whole thing lapses because of the confusion that is introduced into the community at large and also because legislation, when it finally comes before the Parliament, can often be introduced in a totally different climate and something that may have been relevant 12 months ago may no longer be so.There never has been a more appalling example of Labors arrogant record of legislation by press release than this package. The Government having finally tabled the complete package following three Bills in November 1988, this is one of the most complex packages of Bills on record, yet the Government has allowed totally inadequate time for scrutiny of the Bills either by the industry or by the poor superannuant, the person who is most affected. Because of the inordinate delays and confusion, some in the industry will be inclined to panic and accept anything while other cooler heads will have only a few days to assess the proposed legislation which the great minds of Treasury took a year to complete.A good example of how that has occurred is the press release of LIFA, the Life Insurance Federation of Australia Inc., which was published on 5 May:Although LIFA remains opposed to the taxation of superannuation, it is critically important that the legislation now proceeds to finality as soon as possible.. . .Whilst the life insurance industry, therefore, welcomes the introduction of the legislation into Parliament, and urges its speedy passage, we, nevertheless, need an opportunity to comment to ensure that the legislation resolves the uncertainties and does not produce unintended consequences.That is in contradistinction to the expressions of concern that have come from the rest of the industry somewhat later than 5 May. For instance, on 23 May, the Life Underwriters Association of Australia Ltd wrote that it remained:. . . deeply concerned over the potential impact of the proposed taxation arrangements, outlined in this Bill, on the attractiveness of superannuation as an investment option.A most important paragraph in this letter written to me on 23 May reads:We urge you to disregard calls from some sections of the life insurance industry, for the immediate passage of this Bill, regardless of its faults, in order to avoid administrative inconvenience.That is quite an important aspect. People who have issued press releases commenting upon the unacceptable nature of this legislation include the Chairman of Trustees of the superannuation funds sponsored by the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. Mr Rogers, the Chairman, speaking on behalf of 42,000 members of the company-sponsored scheme, referring to the legislation said:. . . administratively very complex and unnecessarily burdensome . . .. . . impacts harshly on Private Sector sponsored superannuation funds in comparison with Public Sector . . .On all these grounds, the Government is urged to withdraw its present tax proposals on superannuation funds and revisit the issue, if necessary, only when it has established an appropriate retirement income policy which will serve this country well into the 21st century.A letter from another outspoken and concerned superannuation group, the Coles Myer Superannuation Funds, simply states:The Treasurer has, on a number of occasions, commented that superannuation funds will be able to reduce the actual tax liability by increasing their exposure to Australian equity shares paying fully franked dividends. This simplistic approach fails to recognise that:many superannuation funds invest in `capital guaranteed funds which have a very high fixed interest component (for which there is no imputation tax relief). The majority of retirees below age 65 `roll over their retirement benefit into a capital guaranteed or fixed interest Approved Deposit Fund.Clearly those employees and retirees for whom security of capital is paramount will be adversely affected by the proposed tax on fund ADF earnings.It concludes:I believe that the proposed tax on super fund investment income has adverse consequences that far outweigh the revenue that will be received. I urge you to press the Government for the withdrawal of the tax on investment income. At the very least the passage of this part of the legislation should be deferred pending the release, and consideration of, the Governments statement on retirement incomes which is due to be made next month.Clearly the industry is concerned at the effects of this package of Bills. When we reach the committee stage I will move amendments which will seek to excise the 15 per cent tax on investment income payable in the hands of the funds. I think it is most important that we look at the taxation points that this Government has now imposed on superannuation and on superannuants and realise that since this Government came to office the tax take from the superannuation industry-and that is out of the pockets of people who have invested in it as a savings method for their old age-has increased by 1,000 per cent.Let us look at the four tax points to which superannuation is subject via this package. There is a 15 per cent tax on employer contributions to public and private sector superannuation funds. There is a 15 per cent tax on superannuation fund income, and this is the major concern that we have. There is the 16.25 per cent tax, which includes the Medicare levy, on lump sums over $60,000. In this instance we will seek, by amendment in the committee stage, to raise that sum to $125,000. There is the capital gains tax on assets bought and sold by superannuation funds after 1 July 1988. This package, after six years of constant change, has resulted in 20 major changes to superannuation law in six years. I refer to the raising of the 1983 lump sum tax to 31.25 per cent from the previous figure of 5 per cent and the bringing forward of the three super taxes in the 1988 May statement.","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1989 TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) BILL 1989 INCOME TAX AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1988 INCOME TAX (FUND CONTRIBUTIONS) BILL 1988 INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1989 INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1988","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

302,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator BISHOP","SE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3051,"—While we have had these tremendous alterations to the superannuation industry, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has sought to mislead the public and, indeed, prefers to enjoy the fleshpots of Europe and to look at the interesting architecture of Moscow instead of being here to deal with this countrys economic plight which the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh), as well as Senator Button, have admitted to. The Ministers embarrassment cannot be done away with simply by interjecting. At the time of the 1988 press release, of which this legislation is the embodiment, the Treasurer said that three things were important:The taxation of superannuation benefits is to be radically yet sympathetically changed, putting it on a more logical long-term basis without reducing lump sum and pension entitlements.He then said:Together these changes complete the Governments review of superannuation tax arrangements. People can now plan their retirement with complete certainty and confidence.He said that this would allow the Government to bring forward nearly $1 billion of its own tax money. The theory was that the money would be payable at the end when somebody actually got a benefit from the superannuation savings plan, but the Government claims that that is its money and it is entitled to have it up front, long before the benefit is enjoyed. It was stated that that money is now lying in superannuation funds. He said, further, that he would make these changes without diminishing any personal end benefit by one cent.Let me give one very specific factual example of how people who had been looking forward to enjoying superannuation payments can be disadvantaged. A longstanding employee was recently paid in the vicinity of $100,000 by his employer on termination of his employment in consideration of his past service. He is aged in his mid-40s. Under the existing tax regime that would be an eligible termination payment on which the tax rate would have been 30 per cent. On the advice of his accountant he rolled over the payment to an approved deposit fund (ADF). The trustee of the fund, in anticipation of the passage of the proposed legislation, deducted 15 per cent tax from the amount paid into the approved deposit fund. As such, an unfunded benefit, when paid into an ADF, is a taxable contribution as proposed by new section 274 (1) (a). If he now called for the benefit remaining to be paid to him, the tax rate and the resulting eligible termination payment would be 27 per cent under the proposed legislation, with a total tax take of 42 per cent. Under the existing tax regime the tax payable would have been 30 per cent only on the eligible termination payment when payment of the roll-over benefit was paid to him from the approved deposit fund. It is quite clearly not true that nobody will be worse off under this legislation. At the very minimum the anti-detriment provision in proposed section 270ca should apply to persons of all ages.Another important aspect of this package deals with the public administration implications. There had been a move by a majority of States to make their superannuation schemes funded-that is, to make this generation fund the superannuation schemes and not leave it to the next generation. That is sensible, good management and planning, but it has been well and truly killed off by the Treasurers 15 per cent tax package. Queensland announced on the 25th of this month that it had moved quietly to change the arrangements to fund its superannuation scheme. At the end of the last session of the Queensland Parliament the Government passed retrospective legislation abolishing the States separate super funds, making all contributions in and out from Consolidated Revenue; that is, Queenslands super schemes are now unfunded. The 15 per cent tax on contributions and earnings applies only to funded schemes. The change also removes the parliamentary superannuation schemes for members of parliament from any potential exposure to the same 15 per cent tax.At the recent Premiers Conference the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) undertook to write to all States concerning the application of the new income tax provisions to State Public Service superannuation schemes and, as a result, other States which had expressed interest, such as South Australia, the Northern Territory and others, have opted out from funding those superannuation schemes. It is well to remember that it can occur: schemes can fail, as happened in New York when it came close to bankruptcy. What would happen if the private sector suddenly decided that it would be more interested in looking at unfunded schemes. It is undermining the solidarity and the acceptability of a concept of something that has been regarded as a very safe investment.The coalition has constantly stated that our attitude is that all legislation in this area should be predicated on two things: first, the need for the Treasurers promise that no individual would be disadvantaged by 1c to be met; and, secondly, the need to ensure that the level of tax will not become a disincentive to superannuation savings. At this very moment we are seeing the effect of the rundown in savings of this country. We have these problems because we do not have a good savings ratio. Yet this package of Bills is designed as a disincentive to savings. Quite clearly, as our population ages, as more and more people are required to be supported in a period of their lives when they will not be in the paid work force, if we are to have a satisfactory situation we need to attract more people into the scheme.Quite simply, the people who need to be attracted into superannuation are the people on the lower marginal rates. Accordingly, with the Governments personal tax cuts in the April statement, it is clear that the comparative attractiveness of superannuation under Labors new tax regime has been diminished for those people on lower marginal rates. It is particularly interesting to observe and to note that only 39 per cent of people in the private sector are in superannuation schemes. In the public sector-I remind honourable senators that those are the schemes which are unfunded-some 67 per cent of people are covered by superannuation. Of course, there are another million people who are covered by the 3 per cent productivity funds. Those funds are largely invested in fixed interest fund investments.It is interesting to note that two people of tremendously diverse political leanings have come to a similar conclusion. I will quote Mr Gary Weaven, the Assistant Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), and Professor Michael Porter, both of whom spoke, on 15 May, at a seminar dealing with superannuation and incomes policy. Professor Michael Porter said:Further, the present taxation of superannuation and means testing of the government pension significantly penalises many Australians saving for their own retirement relative to spending income today.Mr Weaven said:The fact is that to get people to prefer a lump sum or income stream to current cash in hand requires a very major incentive.Speculation and uncertainty about future government policy in the area only increase the preference for current cash rather than preserved savings.Mr Weaven, the Assistant Secretary of the ACTU, also said:. . . ultimately, pay as you go . . . superannuation will inevitably apply universally at a significant level.That argument he rejects. He continued:We must ask ourselves what would bring about the substantial future development of superannuation. After all, even after the successful completion of the ACTUs campaign the majority of workers will only have coverage at the level of 3% of ordinary-time earnings-in many cases as little as $9 or $10 per week.As I said earlier, our main concern is on the 15 per cent tax on investment income. The two amendments that we will move to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1989 will relate to this. The critical element in the Governments taxation policy package is the allowance of imputed tax credits to offset the nominal 15 per cent tax on fund earnings. According to the Treasurer, the superannuation funds can bring the 15 per cent nominal tax on earnings down to a lower effective rate of 4 per cent only by pushing more of its investments into the stock market shares in Australian companies which return fully franked dividends. The interesting thing is that approximately only 25 per cent of investment in roll-over funds and in approved deposit funds (ADFs) will have any connection to the market. The size of that investment is now in the vicinity of $12 billion.There is a wide variety of reasons why superannuation funds, with the exception of large funds such as the Australian Mutual Provident Society, do not hold a greater proportion of their assets in equities. Principal among that is that the value of shares is subject to wide and unpredictable fluctuation over time. Those funds holding roll-over funds and approved deposit funds are the ones where a more conservative investment line is taken and investment in the stockmarket is not sought. That similarly applies to the union based superannuation funds or the 3 per cent productivity funds, where the contributions come mainly from employers and of course are usually capital guaranteed. Therefore, the funds that will have to pay the 15 per cent tax on employer contributions across a wider base than other funds will be severely disadvantaged by their lack of access to the offsetting imputation credits. In other words, we have fish and fowl. Those people in the more conservative investment funds will be disadvantaged because of the 15 per cent tax on those investment earnings in the hands of the fund.The coalition believes that the imposition of the 15 per cent fund income does reduce peoples end benefit, not only in ADFs and roll-over funds but also in normal superannuation funds. Mr Connolly, in his speech in the House of Representatives, dealt very adequately with examples of classes of people in various age groups who are disadvantaged and who will continue to be disadvantaged by this package of Bills. Thus, there is a high incidence of losers, which demonstrates that the promise that the Treasurer made in his statement in May 1988 simply cannot be met. The tax is a clear disincentive to savings and will simply discourage people from entering superannuation which, as I said earlier, is desperately needed if this country is to have a proper and planned retirement package for people as our population steadily starts to age. Far from seeking to encourage more people into superannuation, the Government has reduced the incentive for self-provision even further with the income tax reductions announced on 12 April.In speaking to this package of Bills during the second reading debate, I have outlined why the Opposition is taking a strong and a firm line and why the Opposition is seeking to excise the 15 per cent tax on superannuation income investment. Put simply, this is because people will be disadvantaged. It is not a good enough reason to say, `Because the Government has been negligent, has not been diligent in getting this package of Bills into the Parliament so that there could be more accurate and reliable planning by the industry, ordinary Australians will suffer by the enactment of this package of Bills. This is the reason that the Opposition is taking such a strong stand and wishes to see that 15 per cent tax excised.Debate interrupted.","N/A","TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1989 TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (SUPERANNUATION) BILL 1989 INCOME TAX AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1988 INCOME TAX (FUND CONTRIBUTIONS) BILL 1988 INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1989 INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1988","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/debate.sub1/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

306,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator SCHACHT","4J4","(South Australia)","ALP","N/A",3055,"—I make this statement in reference to remarks made in the Senate earlier today by the President of the Senate, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Chaney, and Senator Harradine. With regard to the issue of material I quoted from, the material gave details of a meeting of the Pro-Life Group which I understood took place last week. Honourable senators would be aware that at the end of my speech during the adjournment debate last night, Senator Tambling moved that I table notes from which he claimed I had quoted. That motion was defeated.After the adjournment I had a meeting with the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Robert Ray, about the status of the material from which it was claimed I had quoted. In particular, my primary concern was that if the material was circulated, it would jeopardise the confidentiality of my sources and it was on this basis that I sought Senator Rays advice as to what I should do with the material. Senator Ray advised that as the Senate had rejected the resolution that the material be tabled, I was free to do what I liked with it; therefore, to ensure the protection of my sources, the material was destroyed late last night in Senator Rays office.It has been requested that I make a statement on how I obtained any documents from which I quoted. I cannot make a statement giving details of how I obtained any documents as this could lead to my revealing my confidential sources, and like other politicians I will not disclose my sources; but, I can state unequivocally that I did not tape the meeting of the Pro-Life Group which took place last week.In view of the Presidents statement today that he is investigating ways in which committee rooms in Parliament House can be made more secure with regard to their audio facilities, I will be more than willing to offer any assistance regarding this matter. In doing so, I again emphasise that I was not involved in the recording or taping of the meeting in question.In his remarks in the Senate today, Senator Harradine made the point that he was disappointed that I did not have the courtesy to inform him beforehand that I was going to make some remarks about the Pro-Life Group and its meetings. I accept that I erred in not informing Senator Harradine and I apologise to him for that lack of courtesy. Although some honourable senators opposite believe it was improper for me to quote from sources about the details of the Pro-Life meeting, I note that in my short period in the Senate, Opposition members have never felt constrained from quoting in Parliament from documents which are clearly obtained by them in a clandestine manner. I have always accepted that an integral element of our democratic tradition is that when members of parliament obtain such information they will use it to their advantage. For example, during the Estimates debate last year Senator Tambling quoted extensively from leaked government documents. It is clear that he did not obtain those documents with the approval or consent of the appropriate authorities.I reiterate my apology to Senator Harradine for not informing him beforehand. But I am not in a position, for reasons stated previously, to table any documents on this matter in the Senate and I am not able to detail how I received such documents because that may lead to the revealing of my sources. I do not believe that it is the Australian way to escape ones responsibility by dobbing in a confidential source.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
307,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3056,"—As we are not to have any more general business Thursdays, I wish to raise some matters relating to annual reports which I think are important. Before I do so, may I say that Senator Schacht is not as attractive as Fawn Hall, but he certainly appears to have many similarities to Colonel Oliver North. On the matter of annual reports, I wish to deal first of all with the Aboriginal Development Commission and its annual report for the year ended 30 June 1988 but which was presented to this Parliament only this month. It is accompanied by a letter from Shirley McPherson, dated May 1988 which, I assume, means May 1989. This is yet another example of the disastrously incompetent annual reporting that comes from this Government.I also draw the attention of the Senate to the Australian Audit Offices audit covering this report dated 18 April 1989, which is very critical indeed and which is, naturally, a qualified report. Many of these matters have been covered in Senate Estimates committees and it was certainly most unfortunate that this kind of report was not available at the time when we had Estimates inquiries into governmental institutions.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

309,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3056,"—As Senator Short said, we complained about it at the time but we got nowhere with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, or the Minister, in particular. Apparently this Government has no interest in the sort of honest reporting which is required for the Senate Estimates system to be effective.The Auditors report says that the receipt, expenditure and investment of money and the acquisition and disposal of assets by the Aboriginal Development Commission during the year had been in accordance with the Act with the exception of various matters. It says:the commission provided capital for Yeperenye Pty Ltd for the future benefit of Aboriginals and not for the purpose of enabling particular Aboriginals to engage in business enterprise as required by sub-section 24 (1) of the Act. The amount provided-in other words, improperly provided-in 1987-88 was $1.5 million . . .The report went on to say:the Commission in some cases, when providing funds for enabling Aboriginals to engage in business enterprise, had left no specific evidence that it had complied with the requirement in sub-section 24 (3) of the Act, that it was satisfied that the Aboriginals were capable of engaging in that enterprise.It continued:The auditors report on Baruwei Enterprises Pty Ltd and Baruwei Enterprises Unit Trust, dated 16 November 1988, were qualified because, in the opinion of the auditors, the valuation of the assets of the company and the unit trusts on a going concern basis was dependent on the continued support of unit holders.The fact is that a provisional liquidator of Baruwei Enterprises Pty Ltd was appointed by order of the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory on 16 March 1989. The Auditor went on:The auditors report on Morr Morr Pastoral Company Pty Ltd was qualified because the companys valuation of cattle inventories at net realisable value represented a departure from Australian Accounting Standard AAS2.The significance of that is that if normal accounting practices had been proceeded with, there would have been a substantial loss for the year, not the phoney profit claimed in this most unsatisfactory annual report.It is interesting to note that the balance of the provision for doubtful debts for both housing and enterprise loans has been based on the assessment of Commission officers. I must say that I do not have massive confidence in that assessment of `bad and doubtful debts and I will come to those in a minute. In the meantime, it would be nice if the annual report revealed why $529,000 was spent on consultants compared with only $28,000 the previous year.The report is extraordinary in some respects. We see that enterprise loans have been made to a number of subsidiary and associated companies including Baruwei Enterprises Unit Trust, which received $2.37m, an increase from $1.78m the previous year. That company is now in receivership. Smiths General Contracting Pty Ltd received loans of $530,585. That company is not only in receivership but had its shareholding written off in 1979. The loans were not written off; they are still appearing in the balance sheet. Heaven knows why! Bad debts charged to the provision during the year totalled $2.2m, and I cannot find here a satisfactory explanation for those write-offs.The annual report continues to be a saga of extraordinary and incompetent management. I am not saying who is responsible but I make this point about Morr Morr Pastoral Company. The auditors report for that company, as disclosed in Note 1, says:The company values cattle inventories at net realisable value. This method of valuation represents a departure from Australian Accounting Standard AAS2-`Valuation and Presentation of Inventories in the Context of the Historical Cost System. Had the companys opening and closing inventories been valued at cost, the operating profit after income tax would have been decreased by $764,486, with consequent adjustments to current assets--That is for the last two years. When we recognise that the claimed operating profit for 1988 was $56,215, such a decrease in the operating profit would have brought about a loss of almost three-quarters of a million dollars. Here we have this annual report pretending that the company has made a profit when, if we make the adjustment that is required by normal accounting standards, we see that it has in fact made a loss. The whole of the report raises serious questions about this kind of organisation. When we get to Yeperenye, we see an operating loss of $1.18m, which is almost double the total gross revenue of about $1.2m. We have interest charges on the bill facility of $1.07m. We have this extraordinary situation where it now seems impossible that these bodies can make a profit, or ever would have made a profit. Not even the doctoring of the accounts, by not adopting normal accounting standards, can hide this from any kind of reasonable examination.According to the financial report Baruwei Enterprises Pty Ltd incurred an extraordinary loss amounting to $763,311. This amount represents a provision in respect of a shortfall of assets available to meet the liabilities of the company as trustee on behalf of the Baruwei Enterprises Unit Trust. It is no wonder that this annual report is so late, it is such a sorry saga.I now turn to the annual report of the Australian Institute of Health for the year to 30 June 1988, which has been presented in this chamber towards the end of May, but which is dated April 1989. Surely this Government can do better than this. In passing, I mention some problems in the annual report. According to the reports `Achievements:Perhaps the most serious problems have been concerns on the part of some State governments about the adequacy of the confidentiality provisions of the AIH Act. The Queensland Government, for example, has been concerned that the Act would appear to allow data provided to the Institute to be released to third parties, and has urged the Commonwealth Minister to amend the legislation.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

311,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A",3056,"—I thank the Minister for his advice. I know he does not want these annual reports and the detail in them to be revealed to the Parliament. That is why they are rushed in so late in the session when we are given no time to deal with them on General Business Thursday, which has been wiped out. So I understand his concern. I am also concerned in this matter that a very large amount of money has been spent on consultants with basically no explanation about who they are. I understand that is one of the requirements of reporting-that the consultants and the amounts being paid to them should be made available. Yet they seem to have been used very substantially.There are a couple more points I want to make very briefly about this. There is a quarter of a million dollars worth of travel in the $937,000 worth of administrative expenses. No doubt someone at the Australian Institute of Health is travelling for the good of his health. This is yet another of those annual reports that are qualified by the Auditor-General. Do we have to have qualified reports every time? Cannot this Government smarten up its capacity to produce annual reports that are accurate and that do not have to have auditors qualifications? For example, on capital expenditure commitments the annual report states:This amount represents the value of a contract placed in 1987/88 for the upgrading of the Institutes computer system during the 1988/89 financial year. Under sub-section 23 (a) of the Australian Institute of Health Act 1987, the Institute is required to seek written approval from the Minister for Community Services and Health to enter into contracts exceeding $200,000. As the Ministers approval for the contract was not obtained until 3 November 1988 the Institute breached this sub-section of the Act during 1987/88.Perhaps we can explain to the Institute of Health that $440,000 is more than the $200,000 limit for its activities, and that this kind of improper behaviour really should cease. The important thing is that this Government has got to smarten up its reporting act. No wonder Senator Walsh wants people to keep quiet, because obviously they have got a hell of a lot to hide.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

But at the time I was expressing concern about the fact that the debate on Aboriginal affairs in this Parliament is sadly distorted by the fact that every time there is an attempt to talk about Aboriginal affairs, all that is discussed is sensationalist allegations by the Opposition, often without any foundation, like the outrageous black Mafia allegation which everybody knew was untrue.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

316,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator McMULLAN","5I4","(Australian Capital Territory)","ALP","N/A",3058,"—No, I am not accusing the honourable senator of discrimination, I am simply saying that he failed to notice that the 12 months service on which he was attacking this Commission, was the 12 months in which it was run by the commissioners so strongly defended and advocated by all his colleagues, and the organisation about which he was making those allegations is the organisation which his colleagues had so spiritedly defended. By saying that, I do not want to reflect upon the people who did run the Aboriginal Development Commission, neither Shirley McPherson, the Chairman as she called herself, nor those eight commissioners who were dismissed. I will not reiterate the discussion. My views about the eight commissioners are stated in the majority report. I did not criticise them then, other than on some errors of judgment that they made, but not as individuals, and I do not do so now.I do want to take this opportunity to say that in my experience in dealing with Shirley McPherson I received nothing but cooperation from her. I found her to be a competent and responsible individual. I certainly dis- agreed with some of the things that she did in chairing the ADC but that is not unusual. One disagrees with a lot with people of goodwill and merit. I think she made some significant errors of judgment and I told her so. I would not say so in here without having said it to her. But I certainly acknowledge the comments that were made that she is a person of goodwill trying very hard to do a good job for Aboriginal people and I wish her well in the future. However, I think the goodwill which I feel and I hope I have expressed towards Shirley McPherson, and which I, with my colleagues, reflected in the majority report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs to those dismissed commissioners, has certainly not been extended to the seven commissioners who were appointed in their place, who were also honest people trying very hard to do a good job on behalf of Aboriginal affairs. I have not agreed with everything that they have done either, but the accusations that have been made about them and the way in which their reputations have been dragged through the mud have done the Senate, in which most of the allegations have been made, no credit at all. I have found it very sad that such circumstances should have taken place; not that those people should be exempt from criticism. When they make mistakes, they ought to be criticised, although of course it was not them who made the Woden Town Club decision. It is quite clear in here who made it. Nevertheless, they took the rap.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

It does him no credit and it does this chamber no credit. Fortunately it does not win him any votes. I want to say some positive things about Aboriginal affairs. That will give everybody a bit of a shock, because nothing positive has been said in the Senate for quite a long time because it has all been cheap stuff. We ignore too often the positive achievements that have been made in Aboriginal affairs. To the credit of former commissioners, including Shirley McPherson, and of current commissioners and current staff, a lot of those positive achievements are recorded here. Sadly, none of them were referred to in todays discussion of the report, despite the fact that there is a large number of them. I will not try to detail them-that would be an abuse of the adjournment debate.I want to refer to a couple of significant things about forthcoming debates. One of them-a positive matter to which I want to refer in order to project into the future-is the fact that the Commission provided capital for Yeperenye Pty Ltd for the future benefit of Aboriginals. The Auditor-General expressed a concern not that it was a bad investment but that it may have been outside the terms of reference of the ADC. No-one says that the investment was made other than with propriety and, in this instance, proper auditing; the point that is made is that the Commission may have been entitled to make decisions not purely for the future benefit of Aboriginals, but rather for Aboriginals to engage in business enterprise. If that interpretation is correct-and the Auditor-General probably is correct-it is certainly a shortcoming in the ADC legislation which will be overcome when the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation is passed. The new corporations body within ATSIC will be able to make loans such as that, which will be successful and which, as the Auditor-General says, will be for the future benefit of Aboriginal people.Now that the ADC has made a substantial contribution for quite a substantial period, it is time we moved on from appointed commissioners to elected commissioners. I welcome the fact that that reform is in the pipeline. It seems to me that the ADC annual report provides a record of some very substantial pluses, and also some minuses-some areas where it should be complimented, and some areas where it should be criticised. I simply want to take this opportunity to try to balance the ship a little because it has a tremendous list to the right. Everybody is leaping on every possible criticism of well-meaning people-whether former commissioners or current commissioners-trying to do the right thing on behalf of Australia and on behalf of their fellow Aboriginal people. I want to put on record the fact that I accept that they are all trying very hard honestly to do a good job, and in the main they are succeeding.The Aboriginal people at Wreck Bay, which is in my constituency, have been advantaged substantially by the good work being done by the ADC. I want that to be on the record. There are continuing positive achievements in Aboriginal affairs. There is so far to go that it is somewhat premature to say how pleased we are with positive achievements, but the comment that a lot of people have done a lot of very good work on behalf of the Aboriginal people is overdue. Those people are not well served by the continuing sniping and mud slinging that goes on in this place.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

He has got his bit of cheap publicity with a statement which is utterly false. He got to his feet in the Senate and accused the Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) of having politically edited the ADCs annual report.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

That, of course, is reminiscent of the loose accusations that Senator Tambling has fallen into the habit of making. I refer, for instance, to his `black Mafia accusations. On the very day on which he had made those accusations he retracted them in an interview on the 7.30 Report, saying, `I had to say something as sensational as that to attract the attention of the press.As we said at the time, and as Senator McMullan has just repeated, in the sensitive area of Aboriginal affairs there is endless room for criticism. There is no shortage of issues to criticise. It takes no talent or wit to criticise in the area of Aboriginal affairs. There is endless opportunity to do so. All previous Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs, from whichever side of the Parliament, know full well that it takes no great talent to drop buckets on Aboriginal affairs. In my view, where such buckets deserve to be dropped, in most cases they should be dropped. Indeed, I have run foul of Aboriginal organisations in the past by criticising them publicly. At times I have been criticised in some interesting joint acts. I still have on tape a joint press conference that was conducted by a Federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Ian Viner, and a Chairman of the Northern Land Council, Galarrwuy Yunupingu. Some years ago, because of criticisms of the Land Council that I had issued, they, in a press release, confidently predicted my downfall in my Aboriginal seat of Arnhem at the next election. In fact, my vote went up from 69 per cent to 79 per cent. But never mind-I go back a long way in this business.It is so easy to make those criticisms. Where they deserve to be made, they should be made. But where they do not deserve to be made, they should not be made. Unfortunately Senator Tambling has developed the habit-it is now almost like a nervous twitch-of making broad, sweeping statements, in some cases slanderous, and subsequently having to admit that they were not true at all. He has just done the same thing again tonight in an interjection. He does it simply to attract attention, to get a bit of publicity. I regret to say that in most cases he succeeds. People in public life should be a bit more responsible.I know why Senator Tambling does it. As Senator McMullan said a few moments ago, the conservatives have not got a vote out of it. Nationally, in my view, Senator McMullan is perfectly correct. But I have no doubt that Senator Tambling has picked up a few votes out of in in the Northern Territory-and, by God, he would need to. Senator Tambling created history at the last Senate elections in the Northern Territory: he was the first conservative candidate in history not to get a quota-unheard of in the Northern Territory. However, it is not surprising that he could not get a quota, could not scrape 33 per cent.I might add that in a front page story in the Northern Territory News, prior to the ballot, the former Chief Minister of the Territory, Paul Everingham, who was also the member for the Northern Territory in the House of Representatives, predicted it. He was right. He went further. These are Paul Everinghams words, taken from the front page of the Northern Territory News as he left the Territory to go to Brisbane. Not only did he predict that Senator Tambling would do worse than any other candidate in the Federal election; he said that when Senator Tambling got to Canberra the only thing he would do about anything would be to talk about it. That is from one of the honourable senators own Country Liberal Party colleagues.Senator Tambling has fallen back on the cheapest and easiest solution for any conservative politician in trouble in the Northern Territory: when in strife and in need of a few cheap votes, bash blacks. He has been doing it consistently for two years, in the absence-and this is my chief objection-of doing anything else. Speaking today about the ADC report, Senator Tambling said that it was important for what it did not say. If ever there is tabled in this Parliament a report on Senator Tamblings lasting contribution to public life, it had better be important for what it does not say because it will not be important for anything else. Not only do I not criticise Senator Tambling for making public criticisms of faults and failings in Aboriginal affairs; I have also joined him on a number of occasions, and he knows it. It is about time he stopped making these sweeping assertions on the basis of no evidence whatsoever.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

There is endless material available to him that will get him legitimate press coverage for bucketing blacks any time he wants to do it. He does not have to manufacture it. He does not need to do it. It is not necessary to do it. So he should stop doing it.There is no question at all that Senator Tamblings continual attacks have won him a few votes. It is true that he has developed a small and loyal group of people around him in the Northern Territory who constantly come up to him and say, `Thats great work youre doing. The Northern Territory News has said in editorials what a marvellous job Senator Tambling has done in uncovering all this graft and corruption. What did Senator Tambling do? What he did was to rip pieces of paper off his fax machine. I mention that because of what we are debating tonight in respect of Senator Schacht. Senator Tambling has been taking pieces of paper off his fax machine. They have dried up since the first onslaught. There is a small group of disaffected officers in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs who had to have someone to leak to, and he was the best leakee. He had a fax machine, so they sent him the pieces of paper. It does not take a lot of effort, wit or talent to pull pieces of paper off a fax machine and then run them in front of an Estimates committee. Anybody can do that. Of course, at the second Estimates committee, he fell on stony ground; the leaks had dried up. Despite a huge fishing expedition, with 400 questions he caught a minnow. That is all we have heard about since. When his leaks dry up completely, so will his so-called successful campaign on uncovering graft and corruption in Aboriginal affairs.Once again today we have had the same performance from Senator Tambling. In the Parliament today, he accused the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs of politically editing the annual report of the Aboriginal Development Commission. That assertion is totally untrue, and in fact has been denied on behalf of the Government and the Minister by his representative in this chamber, Senator Tate. What was Senator Tamblings reaction to that being laid in front of him, after he had made the statement, not before? By way of interjection across the chamber, he said, `Well, somebody did. If any proof positive was needed that there was no evidence there for him to make that statement, honourable senators have just got it. It is very easy in this business to make public slanders and then fix them up with what amount to private apologies. Once one gets ones headline, one is right, one is home. When it is revealed afterwards that the outrageous assertions and claims that were made are false and untrue, that does not rate a mention. The story is stale when it is old and gone and one has got ones bit of press. It is not up to me to offer Senator Tambling gratuitous political advice, but the worm in the Northern Territory, as well as here, is starting to turn.I want to conclude by placing on public record here today my personal appreciation for the work of Shirley McPherson.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

325,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator COLLINS","OF4","(Northern Territory)","ALP","N/A",3060,"—Again, in relation to the interjection, if Senator Brownhill wants to provoke me, I will speak for the rest of the 20 minutes. Senator Tambling has been one of the chief bucketers of the ADC in this Parliament. There was another great bucket from Senator Michael Baume tonight. Again, I am not suggesting that some of those criticisms are not deserved. But the trouble with the Opposition in the area of Aboriginal affairs is that it does not know what it wants. It wants two bob each way and as much cheap publicity as it can pick up on the way through. That is its policy on Aboriginal affairs. The Opposition is quite happy to bucket the ADC-not just the existing commissioners chosen by the Minister but the previous commissioners-for what they did and decisions they made. It says at the same time, `This is the body that has to be preserved. This is the status quo that has got to be kept. It should be preserved and nothing should take its place. Yet at the same time it buckets the daylights out of the Commission. That is the problem with the performance of the Opposition. It has as many policies and as much principle in respect of Aboriginal affairs as it has with every other portfolio area of good government.Shirley McPherson was the Chairman of the ADC from 1984. I have had the privilege and pleasure of knowing her for all that time and of knowing and respecting the tremendous job she did with that organisation. To correct the record, because of what some honourable senators opposite said today, I have made public statements to that effect previously. I am not simply saying that in this Parliament today because it is convenient or proper to do so. In my view, in consideration of the fact, and it is a fact, that the tabling of this annual report coincides with the cessation of Shirley McPhersons tenure as Chairman of the ADC, it is appropriate that honourable senators on both sides of this House express appreciation-and I thank all honourable senators who have done so-for the work she has done. There are not very many Aboriginal women in Australia at this time who have the depth of experience, the tertiary education qualifications and the competence that Shirley McPherson has shown in that position. I regret to say that there are far too few. She is an exceptional person. She did an exceptional job as Chairman of the Aboriginal Development Commission. I regret the fact that she is no longer working in that area. I wish her well in her future endeavours. I have no doubt whatsoever, knowing Shirley McPherson as I do, that her absence from the area of Aboriginal affairs will be a temporary one and that she will return to make a further valuable contribution.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"
326,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator DUNN","3K4","(New South Wales)","IND","N/A",3063,"—I rise tonight to speak in the adjournment debate about a friend of mine who was today arrested and charged with a very serious crime, the matter of the Hilton bombing which occurred 11 years ago. I do not propose to canvass matters of evidence which are presently before the courts or the details of the conviction of Tim Anderson beyond what I raised in a notice of motion this morning. What I want to put on record is something of the history of my association with Tim Anderson and some of the difficulties he has already had in the Australian court system. I first met Tim Anderson in 1979 when I was working in the New South Wales gaol as a project officer. I was a sort of education officer concerned with the literacy of prisoners. I met Tim Anderson and his two colleagues, Ross Dunn and Paul Alister. At that time it was very clear to me from their appearance and manner in the gaol that they were quite different from other prisoners. From their manner, I could tell that they were truthful and sensitive people and that they had managed to make the best of a bad lot in prison.I met them shortly after their second trial. Indeed, they have certainly got to see a lot of the court system during the last 10 years. They had one trial which resulted in a hung jury. They then faced a second trial, at which they were convicted. They were not convicted of the Hilton bombing but of conspiracy to murder Robert Cameron, the National Front leader. Ross Dunn and Paul Alister were convicted of attempting to murder the arresting police. I put this on the record because the media continue to make mistakes. Even today, I heard some media say that Tim Anderson was being arrested and charged for the second time for the Hilton bombing, which is absolutely not true.I became interested in the case and read the transcripts. After reading the transcripts of those two trials, I was persuaded that they should not have been convicted on the basis of the evidence in the transcripts; so I decided to do something about it. I began to work on their campaign, along with Sydney lawyer-journalist Tom Molomby and New South Wales Labor parliamentarian George Petersen. In 1983 I decided to make a film about the case called Frame Up. Who bombed the Hilton? Who didnt?. I was not able in that film to answer the question of who had bombed the Hilton but I was able to answer the question of who did not bomb it. It was interesting that when Richard Seary, who was the police informer in the case, mentioned that he had been told in an alleged conversation by Ross Dunn and Paul Alister that they had confessed to the Hilton bombing, the foreman of the jury in the first trial said that he did not believe it. This was repeated by another juror in the second trial. The foreman of the jury in the first trial was, in fact, responsible for the outcome of the first trial. Then, in 1983, there was an inquest into the Hilton bombing incident at which much evidence was paraded before the Coroners Court in Glebe in Sydney, including what I would call a lot of shonky evidence. This included the evidence of one man who claimed to have seen Tim Anderson outside the--","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

I appreciate the personal concerns that Senator Dunn has in this matter, but I believe that canvassing evidence and the character of persons who may have given evidence, and making reflections upon those people, may be quite material to matters which are now pending before the court system in New South Wales. To use the forum of the Parliament and the privilege of the Parliament to make reflections upon the perception of the alleged truthfulness or otherwise of persons whose evidence is likely to play some role in determining future outcomes of judicial process is, in fact, getting very close to trespassing upon the understanding of the sub judice rule in this place. To that extent, I think some direction is needed from you, Mr President, as to the appropriate limits of what is permissible within the Standing Orders.

It is quite clear that she is moving into a very delicate area. I must say to the Senate that it seems to me that in her last few sentences Senator Dunn was canvassing possible evidence. Senator Dunn says that it is not evidence relating to the matters under which the accused is presently charged, but, with all due respect, I suggest to the Senate that Senator Dunn does not know what evidence the Crown will call in relation to that matter, nor does she know, for that matter, what evidence the accused will call on his behalf. She is, I submit with all due respect, talking about evidence in relation to two former trials. How those former trials may relate to this charge I do not know, but I suggest that Senator Dunn does not know. It is, I suspect, very dangerous for her to be canvassing any of these matters. She did start off by saying that she would tell the Senate something of the history of her association with the accused. Of course, the Senate has no objection to that. If she wishes at some stage to give evidence in relation to the behaviour of the accused in some way for his benefit, that will be up to her. I suggest to you, Mr President, that in the last few sentences of her speech, Senator Dunn started to open up areas of evidence in such a way that she ought not be allowed to continue.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/interject[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
330,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,"Senator Tate","NJ4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—Mr President, you are faced with a very difficult situation, as indeed is the Senate. In all questions of sub judice you have to balance the absolute privilege of this place with the absolute privilege of the courts. It is a contest between the two. I think in this particular instance, the question of the Hilton bombing, the subsequent court actions and, indeed, the public inquiry, the pardon, the compensation, and the events surrounding the allegations are matters of very genuine public interest of a greater scope than attends normal trials to do with the killing of persons in our community. Unless this chamber were convinced that what Senator Dunn is speaking about could cause real prejudice to the trial in the sense of either creating an atmosphere where a jury would be unable to deal fairly with the evidence put before it, or would somehow perhaps affect a future witness in the giving of evidence, whether for the prosecution or the defence, and unless we thought that the matters Senator Dunn was trying to speak about were likely to cause real prejudice to the outcome of that committal proceeding or trial, I think, on balance, given the nature of the matters surrounding this whole incident over many years, that the public interest probably would allow her to continue.I think that she would agree that tremendous caution and prudence should be exercised. She must realise that some matters which she thinks are matters of history, in that they have been the subject of previous judicial proceedings or inquiries, could be very relevant to the future or foreshadowed committal proceedings or trial. It may be that she should refrain, if it is not pertinent to her real point, from discussing matters of evidence or giving her evaluation of the evidence. None of us really knows precisely-I have only seen media reports-what the police claim to be the new evidence which has allowed them to go to the magistrate. I think they opposed bail, but bail was granted. We ought to be fairly cautious but on balance, given the tremendous public interest in these matters over many years, I think the Senate is a forum in which these general matters can be discussed. I do not know whether that helps you, Mr President, in relation to the last two or three sentences about which Senator Lewis was speaking but I would not rush with a sub judice ruling to prevent a senator from raising a matter which is clearly of very great public interest.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/interject[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

332,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator DUNN","3K4","(New South Wales)","IND","N/A",3063,"—Thank you, Mr President. I certainly do not wish to prejudice the case at all, particularly when a friend of mine is concerned. My point was that there have been a number of legal forums-two trials, a Supreme Court appeal, a High Court appeal, a Hilton inquest and then a five to six month long inquiry into the charges against the three Ananda Marga people-in which much evidence has come out and which have canvassed what I would have thought was a fairly comprehensive range of evidence against them on all charges, relating not only to the Yagoona incident involving Robert Cameron but also to the Hilton bombing, which the police informer brought up at the trials.The outcome of the 1985 section 475 inquiry was that Mr Justice White pardoned the three Ananda Marga people. Tim Anderson was pardoned on his conviction of conspiracy to murder Robert Cameron, as were the other two, and Ross Dunn and Paul Alister were pardoned on their conviction of attempting to murder the arresting police. They were also subsequently compensated. Each was paid $100,000 for the seven years out of a 16-year sentence that he spent in gaol. In the 11 years since the Hilton bombing Terry Griffiths, a policeman who was very badly injured by the Hilton blast, has been trying to get some kind of royal commission or inquiry going, without much success. I can only question why that has not occurred. It seems to me that that would be a very appropriate forum for an examination of what was purported to be Australias first international terrorist incident.At the time a senior Army man, Brigadier McKenzie-Orr, said at a conference that when the evidence from the exploded truck could not be found it was almost as if little elves had come and taken it away. That is a matter of record. The forensic laboratories failed drastically to provide very critical evidence about the nature of the Hilton bombing. I am very concerned that 11 1/2 years later any charges have been raised at all, considering the number of political forums.I want to tell this chamber what Tim Anderson has done since he was released in May 1985. Since that time he has published one book and is about to publish another. I edited the first book, which was about the case he had been through. It was a very good book and was well received. The other book, which is about to be published, is about his gaol experiences. Tim Anderson is a highly intelligent, very articulate and very gentle person. He is very committed to social justice, as I mentioned in my notice of motion this morning. Since his release from gaol he has been particularly concerned to fight the practice known in New South Wales as police verbal. It is my contention that if innocence were restored to the three of them by pardon then we must conclude that at least 16 people were lying during the trial. Certainly there were unsigned records of interview. Mr Justice White chose not to comment on these particular matters. I accept that but it seems to me that this case is black and white and I have reached my own conclusions about it.Tim Anderson has been involved in the anti-verbal campaign as a leading activist. It is a campaign which I have also supported. He has been writing his doctor of philosophy thesis, which is almost completed. He has bought a flat with the compensation money and he has settled down in a steady relationship. I doubt whether he would have been given bail today had there been any serious doubt about his threat to the community. I think the amount of bail was a bit stiff; he was asked to put up $60,000. I can understand his sense of shock and outrage when the police came to his flat and broke down his door at 7 oclock this morning. On Australian Broadcasting Corporation television tonight he was so upset that he said that the witness who had come forward was a mark II Seary with a mark II frame-up. I sympathise with Mr Andersons outrage because I understand that he has been through so much over the last 10 years, not only in the courts but also inside the gaol system, which is not the most enriching life experience, as we can imagine.I do not want to say any more about this matter, except that if the charges are thrown out during the committal hearing or if a jury finds Tim Anderson not guilty after a trial then Mr Anderson will have been put through another awful ordeal which ought never have occurred.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
333,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TAMBLING","6E4","(Northern Territory)","NP","N/A",3066,"—I would like to remind the Senate that this afternoon when I spoke on the annual report of the Aboriginal Development Commission my opening remarks were:This report is important for what it does not say, not for what it does say.Initially I would like to commend the very hardworking staff throughout Australia of the Aboriginal Development Commission, which in the past year has laboured under extreme conditions of hardship and scrutiny and has got on with the work of fulfilling many great projects and targets for Aboriginal people. In any reviewing of the Aboriginal affairs portfolio I have attempted at all times to be constructive and to achieve major change that is significant for Aboriginal people. The two questions that I have repeatedly asked in the past year or so, either in this Parliament or outside, are: firstly, is the expenditure accountable; and, secondly, is the expenditure of that money on behalf of Aboriginal people efficient? The criteria I have used religiously are accountability and efficiency on behalf of increasing benefits for Aboriginal people.As a result of that activity over the past year we have seen reports made to the Senate by Estimates Committee E in October last year and more recently in May. I remind the Senate that the majority reports of those two Estimates Committee E reports were signed by the Labor members of this Senate as well as by Opposition members. Whilst the Opposition members also handed down dissenting reports or reservations attached to them it is the results that need to be looked at. As a result of those appraisals by the Senate and Estimates Committee E we have seen instituted the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, of which Senator Collins and Senator McMullan are important members. We have seen the review of the special report of the Auditor-General, the special report of the Public Service Commissioner, the report by Mr Menzies, the investigations by the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges, the investigations and report of the Department of Finance, and a number of departmental and ministerial advisory investigations. There has been much information in all of those reports that requires urgent attention by the Government. Senator Collins made the point that he believed that my motives had been to bash blacks and bucket blacks. I reject those statements outright and say that Senator Collins, by uttering them in such a way, is totally misrepresenting me.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

335,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Senator TAMBLING","6E4","(Northern Territory)","NP","N/A",3066,"—They are not accurate, if one reviews them against all the areas of performance. The only Aboriginal people that I have ever named in the Senate, or anywhere else, as a result of those inquiries are people who have been subsequently shown by the various reports instituted by the Government or by Parliament to have been involved in areas requiring major investigation and report. I have never on any other occasion in any way bashed blacks or bucketed blacks and I challenge Senator Collins or any other honourable senator to come into the chamber and name any individual Aboriginal person to whom I have caused major embarrassment as a result of my naming him in any of the work of the Senate Estimates committees or the activities of Parliament.I remind the Senate that the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, which was referred to tonight by Senator McMullan and Senator Collins, contains some 40 recommendations, and the dissenting report contains other significant recommendations. The principal recommendations have been rejected by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) and by the Government in the determination of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation that was recently tabled in the House of Representatives. The Minister and the Government have chosen to ignore the advice of Senator Collins and Senator McMullan. They have overridden or ignored them because they do not go along with those recommendations.Both Senator McMullan and Senator Collins pointed out that there were many areas of positive achievement in the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. If anyone should like to review the Hansard of Senate Estimates Committee E or my contributions in the Senate, they would see that there has been a recognition of those positive achievements. Certainly I accept that by far the greater weight of activity that I have been involved in has been in areas seeking to achieve change through either criticism or expose, particularly in the areas of accountability and efficiency.I was highly complimented in an article in the Northern Territory News last Saturday by Senator Collins. While it essentially related to a number of other issues that must have equally upset Senator Collins in a political sense, my press secretary passed me a note on Monday morning and asked whether I had a new press secretary, because in the space of some 20 paragraphs of Senator Collinss article he named me some 16 times. Obviously the activities that we carry on in this place and in the electorate are upsetting and hurting him. I do not get involved in making broad, sweeping statements across the area of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio.All of the comments on the areas that I address, in seeking to debate either the ATSIC legislation or the administration or expenditure of money, are based on hard facts. That is well demonstrated by all of the evidence that has been presented to Estimates Committee E and by the numerous inquiries and investigations.Minister Hand must accept responsibility for the report tabled in the Senate today. The Minister tabled it in the Parliament. As I said earlier today, the report is important for what it does not say. The document has a glaring layout, and Mrs McPherson-who even Senator Collins acknowledged has done a remarkable job for Aboriginal people-is given a three-line appraisal in the biographies shown against the names of the commissioners.The other potted biographies go into much more detail for the commissioners who were appointed by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in May 1988. They were much more genuine, even to the extent that the photographs showed them in a better light, whereas Mrs McPherson is shown with a glare. Why was the report of the Chairman of the Commission, Mrs McPherson, not included in this years report as it has been included for the past six years? Why in the list of commissioners is the name of Charles Perkins, who was a commissioner to 30 June 1988 along with the other people whose potted biographies and photographs were included, omitted? Obviously, in the eyes of the Government, he is the man who never was. The Government does not want to give him credit for the statutory appointment which he held.As I said earlier today, it is also important to recognise the other commissioners who were not acknowledged in the report at all for the 10 1/2 months of significant work that they carried out in that year.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

I am very mindful of moving a motion in due course to have the matter referred to the Public Accounts Committee, which is currently undertaking a major inquiry into the presentation of annual reports to this Parliament. It would be very interesting to see how this report measures up to the guidelines of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) with regard to the presentation of annual reports. It would be very interesting to know who deleted and why he deleted the particular reference to commissioners and the traditional introductory remarks of the Chairman.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"
