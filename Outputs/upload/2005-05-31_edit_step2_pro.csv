2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SPEAKER, The",10000,"PO","N/A","N/A",1,"—Yesterday I undertook to report to the House in the light of a number of points of order and questions about the identification of people in answers to questions without notice. There is a clear distinction between questions and answers in the standing orders and the practices of the House. There is no problem when a question commends a named or readily identifiable person. Similarly, a person can be named in a question when the identification is necessary to make the question intelligible. However, the standing orders provide that, if it is critical of the character or conduct of a private individual, the question must be submitted in writing, to be published in the Notice Paper.Relevance is the only requirement for answers in the standing orders. The chair has no authority to intervene when an individual is named in the House, either in answer to a question or in other proceedings—such as, for example, when a member is critical of the conduct of a private individual in the course of a speech in the House. It was suggested that an individual named in this way does not have any recourse. I remind the House that there are in place procedures for persons referred to in the House to request a right of reply in Hansard if they feel aggrieved. The action that I followed yesterday is in accordance with the practice adopted by my predecessors and I will continue to follow that course unless the House makes a decision to the contrary.","Question Time","QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Beazley, Kim, MP","PE4","Brand","ALP","N/A",1,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall launching the debt truck in September 1995, when foreign debt was $180 billion, and at that time stating: ‘If it weren’t for the level of foreign debt, interest rates in this country would be much lower. If it weren’t for the size of the foreign debt we would all be paying lower amounts on our mortgage. I can promise you that we will follow policies which will, over a period of time, bring down the foreign debt’? Is the Prime Minister aware of the latest foreign debt figure, released today, of $425 billion? Prime Minister, for how long will you let Australia sink further and further into unsustainable debt?","Economy","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Howard, John, MP","ZD4","Bennelong","LP","Prime Minister",1,"—The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is also yes. The answer to the third part of the question, which is the allegation of sustainability, is that the Leader of the Opposition has it wrong. A debt’s sustainability is, in most people’s experience, and most nations’ experience, measured by capacity to service. The net foreign debt servicing ratio, measured as net interest-free payments as a proportion of exports, remained below 10 per cent—indeed, at 9.7 per cent—in the March quarter 2005. This is below the peak of 20 per cent recorded in 1990 and below the 1990s average of 13 per cent.Importantly, the bulk of the foreign debt accumulated—96.8 per cent—belongs to the private sector. That is not surprising because we have paid off most of the public sector debt that the person who asked me the question left to this government. Australian net debt peaked at 19.1 per cent of GDP in 1995-96 and it is estimated to be just 1.9 per cent. From 19.1 to 1.9—and this is the measure of the debt that governments run up. It peaked at 19.1 per cent in the last financial year that Labor was in office and it is going to be just 1.9 per cent of GDP in the current financial year.","Economy","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Neville, Paul, MP","KV5","Hinkler","NATS","N/A",2,"—My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer inform the House of today’s retail trade and balance of payments releases? How does this data relate to Australia’s economic outlook?","Economy","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[2]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
7,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Costello, Peter, MP","CT4","Higgins","LP","Treasurer",2,"—I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. I can inform him that the retail trade figure for April was released this morning. It showed that retail trade had fallen by half a per cent. This was led by an 11 per cent decline in department store turnover. That could well be principally in the area of clothing sales, which apparently was affected by unusually warm conditions for the month of April. Nonetheless, although one would not draw too much from a month’s figure, it does appear that retail trade has softened, particularly from the peak of 2004. This is consistent with other evidence that Australian households are moderating consumption.In addition to that, the balance of payments figure was also released today for the March quarter of 2005. It showed that the current account deficit rose to $15.6 billion in the March quarter. This was because, although the trade deficit narrowed, the net income deficit increased. The March quarter does not take into account the increases in iron ore and coal contract prices that take effect in April. These prices will flow through to the June quarter and, as a consequence, the June quarter current account deficit is expected to narrow, as was forecast with the budget forecasts both for this and next year.Exports increased by one per cent in the March quarter, led by metal ores and minerals. But rural exports unfortunately fell 4.6 per cent. We are seeing the effects of drought biting into the rural sector and biting into Australia’s exports. Only rain can deliver rural Australia from that drought and from the consequent decline in rural production.Motor vehicles led a two per cent increase in imports in the March quarter. That is most probably the consequence of the fact that the tariff reduced quite considerably on 1 January. Australia’s net foreign debt rose from $421 billion to $424 billion, but the share of government debt, foreign debt, has fallen from 17.2 per cent to 4.5 per cent since this government was elected. The government is actually reducing its debt and reducing its foreign debt, with the private sector borrowing. If that borrowing were to go into good investment, that would add to the long-term capacity. The macro-economic conditions are much more stable now than they have been at times of other increases in the current account deficit to historical highs. Our budget is in surplus; government net debt is close to zero; unemployment is at 30-year lows; and inflation and interest rates are low by historical standards.Having said all that, we cannot afford to relax in relation to economic reform, and I particularly name two areas where we ought to focus to improve Australia’s economic performance. The first is in the area of infrastructure. We need to boost Australia’s ports. Our largest export is coal. Our largest exports go through Hay Point, Dalrymple Bay, where 40 ships continue to line up offshore at the Dalrymple Bay coal loading terminal. The Queensland Competition Authority, after 20 months, has finally brought down a decision. It will take two years after that 20-month delay for construction to boost production through Dalrymple Bay. I have already indicated to the House that, as far as the government is concerned, a national approach to competition authority with a national competition regulator giving timely decisions would be an enormous improvement.The second area is in relation to domestic production. There is no reform which could benefit the Australian economy more than industrial relations reform. It would boost productivity in every firm in the country and lead to higher productivity and higher wages. If the parliament can enact a new industrial relations system, that would be a great achievement for economic production in Australia.","Economy","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[2]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As we are talking about savings—the current account represents the difference between savings and investment and consumption—compared to a budget surplus of 1.1 per cent today, in March 1995 the budget was not balanced. It was not in surplus; there was a deficit of 2.8 per cent of GDP. Back in March 1995, the government was adding to foreign debt by having a deficit of 2.8 per cent of GDP. Today, the government is detracting from foreign debt by having a surplus of 1.1 per cent of GDP.","Economy","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[3]/answer/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

22,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Costello, Peter, MP","CT4","Higgins","LP","Treasurer",3,"—I am talking about Australia’s credit rating in relation to its debt position. In March 1995, Australia had had its credit rating downgraded twice under the Labor Party. Because the government now has essentially no net debt, its credit rating has been revised upwards twice to a AAA rating. The consequence is that Australia, now AAA rated for foreign currency bonds, no longer pays any premium in relation to its interest rates, which it was paying in March 1995. This puts back into context the Prime Minister’s statement: we were paying a premium for foreign debt in March 1995 because our credit had been downgraded on two occasions.Anybody on this side of the House will know this: if you have a AAA credit rating the premium on your interest rates is a lot lower than if you have been downgraded. The consequence over those years is that the premium on foreign currency bonds has been removed as a result of the government getting its budget back in balance, reducing its net debt and getting two upgradings to a AAA rating for the Australian economy.","Economy","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[3]/answer/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

24,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Downer, Alexander, MP","4G4","Mayo","LP","Minister for Foreign Affairs",4,"—I thank the honourable member for his question and for his interest. I think all members of this House will be appalled by the fact that in the last 18 months or so, according to the United Nations, around 180,000 people may have died in Darfur as a result, directly or indirectly, of the violence that has taken place there. Last year the Australian Defence Force offered airlift support to the African Union Mission in Sudan—an offer they did not take up. In any case, there are already around 2,600 African Union personnel in Sudan helping to achieve peace. That will be expanded to 7,700 by September this year.In addition, the United Nations Security Council agreed in March to establish a 10,000-strong United Nations Mission in Sudan and to take further action against the perpetrators of the atrocities in Darfur. The Australian government strongly supports the decision to refer crimes committed in Darfur to the International Criminal Court. The government, of course, has repeatedly called upon the Security Council to take these actions, along with a number of other countries.We will contribute 15 Defence Force personnel to the UN Mission in Sudan, including air movements and logistical support personnel and military observers. That deployment has already commenced. Honourable members might be pleased to know that the contingent commander, Squadron Leader Ruth Elsley, is the first female contingent commander of an Australian contingent of this kind.Last month I announced a further contribution of $10 million in humanitarian assistance to southern Sudan. That brings the total of Australia’s humanitarian assistance to Sudan over the last 12 months—most of which has gone to Darfur—to over $40 million. So the Australian government is making a contribution to trying to achieve peace in Darfur. It is very important that the international community as a whole really throws its weight behind the peace process there, because the loss of human life has been simply enormous.","Sudan","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

38,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Costello, Peter, MP","CT4","Higgins","LP","Treasurer",6,"—I thank the honourable member for Fairfax, and I can tell him that one side of Australian politics supports tax cuts for every Australian on 1 July. There is now only one month to go before every Australian can have an income tax cut, if only the Australian Labor Party will get out of the way and let people have those tax cuts. Is there support for such tax cuts? It appears there is from all sorts of quarters. Senator Minchin received a copy of an email which was sent to the member for Canberra on 24 May 2005. I believe it to be a legitimate email. I will not go to the name although I have here the name of the person who sent it. The constituent writes as follows:I am finally prompted to write to my representative in the parliament of Australia as a result of my increasing dissatisfaction with representation I receive from the Australian Labor Party.This constituent says that he has always voted for the party that ‘I felt had Australia’s best interests at heart’ and up until recently this was the ALP. But having listened to the debate in the House of Representatives regarding the coalition’s proposed tax measures:I find myself in complete disbelief and for the first time a sense of anger. This is entirely due to the manipulative language used to obfuscate the truth of the debate. I am tired of hearing I am amongst Australia’s wealthy and I do not deserve the tax cut being proposed by the government.Then he says this:A brief lesson in mathematics for the ALP: 10 per cent of some is some; 10 per cent of more is more. The proposed changes involved a tax cut of eight per cent for the 47 per cent bracket. The same budget proposes around 18 per cent for the lower brackets. Yes, this means more in dollar terms for me but it is a smaller relief of the total burden borne by me. I live in a moderate former government—guvvie—home in Duffy. I earn just under 90K.

Apparently he is not the only person that feels that way because there were certain things published in the Australian newspaper today which we will not refer to. But a journalist did ask the member for Lilley on his way in today:Are you ... concerned about the poll today that shows ... the popularity of the Labor Party has dropped since you opposed the Budget’s tax cuts?The member said:Well I’m not actually.Why is that? The journalist said:But they—the Liberal party—seem to have won over the public.The member for Lilley said he was not concerned about that. Why would he not be concerned about that? This was his answer:Well ... after the last Budget, ... the Labor Party primary vote dropped seven points.So they’re not nearly as bad as they were after last year’s budget! After last year’s budget there was a thing called an election. I advise the Labor Party: do not be concerned—after last year’s budget your popularity dropped by seven points. There is no need to worry. Your tactics are in the hands of the member for Lilley!Now there is the critical question that Australia asks today. The tax schedules are now in this House. No motion of disallowance has yet been moved. The tax schedules will go into the Senate on 14 June. If no motion of disallowance is moved, every Australian will get their tax cut. Where does the Labor Party stand on that motion of disallowance? It stands resolutely irresolute. It stands certain of its doubts. It stands certain of its indecision.

50,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Truss, Warren, MP","GT4","Wide Bay","NATS","Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry",8,"—I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. As I mentioned at this time yesterday, the federal government has announced a significantly enhanced drought assistance package to help Australian farmers through these difficult times. There will be more generous exceptional circumstances interest rate subsidies, with a revised and more generous assets test; an improved income test for the EC relief payment; additional counselling and support services; a second Envirofund round of grants to help preserve and protect the environment and our biodiversity through these dry times; and a range of other measures to support farmers as they face perhaps the worst drought in our nation’s history. This is all in addition to the three-quarters of a billion dollars that the federal government has already provided to Australian farmers since this drought began.I am pleased to say there has been a very positive response to this package from the rural sector and indeed around the nation. The National Farmers Federation, for instance, says the package will deliver important assistance to more farm businesses and families. Mal Peters from the New South Wales Farmers Association says it will help ease the strain for many farmers affected by the most crippling drought to hit Australia in 100 years. AgForce says the drought package gives farmers renewed hope. John Swain from the Rural Financial Counselling Service said, ‘As far as being money well spent, through my past 10 years of experience I can only see the good that comes out of it all.’Even the capital city newspapers responded positively. I was delighted to read the editorial in the Daily Telegraph which pointed out that the government’s decision to extend the interest rate subsidies to farmers rather than allowing for straight cash grants is sound. They also observed that few would begrudge this $250 million package of extra drought assistance.I welcome these positive responses. Of course, there have been a couple of negative responses. The honourable member for New England tried to talk down the importance of this package for farmers, and I think that does him no credit. The Leader of the Opposition was also trying to be critical. He observed that the interest subsidies would bring them back to the level of subsidy which applied when Labor was last in office. What he forgot to mention was that, in those days, the states paid 30 per cent of the cost of the interest subsidies, a position from which the states have significantly retreated. So it is beyond doubt that this is a package which will provide real and practical assistance to Australian farmers. I welcome the support that has been provided by industry organisations, and I am sure that the farmers of Australia are grateful for this additional support.","Drought","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

54,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Andrews, Kevin, MP","HK5","Menzies","LP","Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service",9,"—I thank the member for Forde for her question and I can indeed reveal to her and the House that there is support from some state leaders for a national workplace relations system. Mr Bracks, the Victorian Premier, said back in 1996 that the Victorian ALP supported the concept of a single national system of industrial relations and it always has. He said:It can deliver benefits to both employees and employers by creating a uniform national framework for dispute resolution and the application of the minimum employment standards that can be more easily complied with and enforced.We agree with Mr Bracks about that.Yesterday I noted a report in the Australian that attributed some comments to the New South Wales Premier, Mr Bob Carr, that he was not interested in keeping a ‘boutique’ state industrial relations commission. Mr Carr has, I understand, since denied these comments. This is interesting because I went back to a well-known source of comments and thought about Mr Carr—a book that has been described as ‘an in-depth insider’s account’. In this book I find this:He proposed that a future state Labor government should hand over to the Commonwealth state powers in business and consumer regulation, vehicle registration, distribution of freight—and, wait for it—industrial relations.Who would be doing this? None other than the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bob Carr. Indeed, it goes on to say in the book that Carr’s argument was that:By combining state and federal industrial relations bodies, wages policy could be dealt with at a national level and not have to be fought out in each state jurisdiction.We agree wholeheartedly with what Mr Carr said. The only thing that seems to have changed in relation to Mr Carr is the composition of the national government. There is other support for this as well. One of the ACTU’s vice presidents, Mr Richard Marles, asked this question recently:... how on earth does a small employer ... work their way through the myriad of laws and find out whether or not ... they are covered by state or federal law? It is perhaps impossible to imagine putting such employers and workers in a more complex legal situation.Mr Bracks was right; he is still right. Mr Carr was right in 1990. We believe that this is the appropriate way to go forward—to cut out the confusion, the cost and the complexity of overlapping and duplicated systems and to have one national system in place.","Workplace Relations","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[6]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

58,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Anderson, John, MP","4K4","Gwydir","NATS","Minister for Transport and Regional Services",10,"—I am asked ‘How?’ If you refer to what happened at the end of 2003 you will see that they were very substantially addressed in the $93 million enhanced aviation security package that was announced at that time.The report raises a number of issues concerning criminality at airports. Those matters are rightly the responsibility of the Customs Service and the police. I can confirm that the report was not made available to me or to my department but—and it is worth making this point—since research for that piece of material was conducted the government has instituted a very large number of measures and it is worth recapping them. We have had the comprehensive Aviation Transport Security Act go through this place; 180 airports regulated; 170 airlines regulated; 350 transport security programs approved; the regulation of over 900 cargo agents; greater controls over access to airport secure areas; and the broadening and tightening of criteria for the issue of the aviation security identification cards—the ASICs.Since the report was researched, all 65,000 of those ASIC cards in circulation have been reissued. I want to reassure the House that, where DIMIA, the Australian Federal Police or ASIO have identified reasons why those cards should not be reissued, they have not been reissued. There are a significant number of people who sought those cards who have not had them reissued. I think that is very important to note.We have, of course, had the introduction of background checking for pilots and of hardened cockpit doors on passenger aircraft with more than 30 seats—funded by the government. We have also had the introduction of 100 per cent check bag screening on international flights, an increase in the number of airports where passenger and carry-on screening takes place, the screening of goods and persons entering airport sterile areas and an increased AFP, APS and ASIO presence at our airports. We have had the deployment of our armed air security officers on selected domestic services and international routes and the introduction of the Australian Federal Police Protective Security Liaison Officer network, explosive trace detection at domestic and international passenger screening points and antitheft devices to powered aircraft—$48 million worth of measures to increase security at regional airports. Indeed, these measures, amounting to $162 million of Commonwealth outlays—around $300 million a year by Qantas alone—and several hundred million dollars worth of new equipment, paid for by the private sector at our airports, have been implemented since the time that the research referred to in the Australian this morning was undertaken. The point that I make, which would be well taken in the House, is that they constitute a very full and comprehensive response to the issues that our authorities have been alerting us to.I want to conclude by making this point: we have not had a terrorism incident in Australia. I cannot, and no-one can, guarantee that we will not one day be the subject of a terrorism incident. But I can say this: the government, its agencies and the private sector have been and remain vigilant, as the travelling public have every right to expect we would be.","Transport Security","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[7]/answer/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Today marks the second anniversary of what is called the Proliferation Security Initiative. This is a practical but informal arrangement among countries to work together to intercept and disrupt the illicit trade in weapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems and other related materials. We are proud to be a key driver of the Proliferation Security Initiative. We have hosted two PSI meetings. We led the first successful interdiction exercise in October 2003, which was called Operation Pacific Protector, and we plan to lead a second exercise in 2006.The PSI has rapidly built up operational strength. Over 60 countries are now supporting it. Fourteen exercises have been held in Europe, Asia and North America, each time led by a different country. Fourteen more exercises are scheduled between now and the end of 2006. The PSI has scored significant successes in stopping proliferators in their tracks. In October 2003, a group of nations worked together to stop an illegal cargo of centrifuge parts for uranium enrichment which was destined for Libya. Soon after, and importantly, the Libyans agreed to end their weapons of mass destruction programs. We will continue to work with others to ensure that the PSI is successful and that it sends a strong message in our efforts to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.I think from our point of view as a government we would have to say we were disappointed with the outcome of the recent Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in New York, which I attended but which ended inconclusively. It was a great disappointment that it was not able to draw together strong conclusions on where there would be international action to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Nevertheless, I think the Proliferation Security Initiative is working well. It has got strong international support and it is proving to be quite effective.","Global Security","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[8]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When it comes to reconciliation the right rhetoric is important, but it is not as important as the right result. Indigenous specific health spending has increased from just over $100 million in 1996 to $350 million in the coming financial year. That is a 150 per cent real increase. As a result, immunisation rates in remote Indigenous communities are now close to 100 per cent. There are still too few Indigenous doctors, but there are 50 per cent more than in 1996. There are still too few Indigenous nurses, but there are 30 per cent more than in 1996.In Townsville, Indigenous peri-natal mortality is down by over 50 per cent. In some Northern Territory communities, peri-natal mortality is down by over 400 per cent. Since the 1970s, Indigenous death rates in the Northern Territory from communicable diseases are down by over 60 per cent, and deaths from trauma are down over 30 per cent. Since 1997 there has been a 74 per cent increase in the number of healthcare episodes delivered by Aboriginal medical services. As well, as a result of the words and inspiration of people like Noel Pearson, more Indigenous communities are taking greater responsibility for their own health. There is still, I am afraid, a long way to go, there is no room for complacency on any measure, but we owe it to the Indigenous people of Australia to focus on good news as well as bad news as we work together to get even better outcomes in the years ahead.","Indigenous Health","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[10]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Perhaps we should move on to the pilots. Who else should we automatically assume is criminally inclined? I reiterate the point that I made earlier: 65,000 ASIC cards have been reissued following consideration by DIMIA, the AFP and ASIO of background investigations into anything that might suggest an inclination or tendency towards politically motivated violence. That is separate to the question of employers and police then applying for fit and proper person status for people to be employed—as the Minister for Justice and Customs this morning made plain. There are references here to people with criminal backgrounds. You have to consider the nature of those criminal backgrounds—whether people have paid their dues to society, whether it is a traffic offence or whether it is something more serious. But I want to assure the House that, wherever there has been any suggestion of a tendency towards politically motivated violence, they have not got their cards. They are not going anywhere near the airports. I think it is very important that we acknowledge that.In relation to Mr Palmer, as I have repeatedly said here, he is not the person who takes forward the management of our aviation and other transport security policies. He was put there as a belts and braces addition at my suggestion so that we would have a legitimate and instantly usable—if I can use that term—person to take up an investigation if, God forbid, we should have a terrorism incident in Australia. I make this observation: if I had not put forward the idea and if we had not done it, these questions would never have been asked—because, rightly, the Labor Party would have recognised that the Office of Transport Security is the body responsible for taking forward our very extensive transport security regime.","Inspector of Transport Security","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[11]/answer/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It was not provided to me. It was not provided to the Minister for Justice and Customs. It was an internal report, a speculative report, that was intended for Customs use and consideration. I reiterate the remarks that I made earlier that the claims that it makes go back quite a while. The issues raised in it are precisely the reason that we took the action that we took in the enhanced aviation security package, including—and I will reiterate the points made here—the reissuing of the ASIC cards. We wanted to make certain that we did not have people who might have been inclined to engage in politically motivated violence working in our airports. Let me spell it out more basically yet again: that is why we said that everyone who had an airport security identification card must subject themselves to a thorough background check again by the Australian Federal Police, by DIMIA and by ASIO. On that basis the cards have been reissued to those that we deemed do not pose a security risk. I do not think I can spell it out much more clearly than that.","Transport Security","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[13]/answer/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

79,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Hardgrave, Gary, MP","CK6","Moreton","LP","Minister for Vocational and Technical Education and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister",14,"—I thank the member for Casey. In fact, since 1996 there have been 2,270 new apprentices that have taken on the job in training. It is a 164 per cent increase since 1996. In the last 12 months we have just seen so many people taking up the opportunities. This government is backing workers. There is no doubt about it. The Tools for your Trade initiative is a $120.2 million initiative over four years. For new apprentices starting after 1 July next—a big day, 1 July—if they are in a skill-needs trade they will be eligible to receive an $800 tool kit. That is after their first three months. That will give them an enormous kick-start, along with some tax cuts in their particular chosen career. Employers will in fact receive the tool kits from the government appointed contractor. They will make that tool kit available to the new apprentice in time after they have completed a further six months. Some 34,000 new apprentices a year will benefit—people from the metal trades, the electrical trades, carpenters and so forth. We have started the request for tender process and are looking forward to that.In addition to the tool kits, we are providing the Commonwealth Trade Learning Scholarship. That is $106 million over the next four years. There will be two $500 payments—that is a total of $1,000—at the successful completion of each of the first and second years, and that will be assisting around 60,000 new apprentices each year, for new apprentices who have started after 1 July 2004. And of course some apprentices will be able to get both, which means some $1,800 worth of initiatives and incentives to assist apprentices in the first couple of years, coming from this government after 1 July.Why are the Australian Labor Party offering little or nothing in response? They have lost their way. We have done some research. We have found that the member for Hunter is the only member of the Australian Labor Party frontbench who has actually got a trade qualification—the only one. In fact, the last Labor leader who actually served an apprenticeship was almost a century ago. John Curtin was apprenticed as a printer.","New Apprentices","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[14]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Our $73 billion tourist industry employs more than half a million Australians and, significantly, more than 200,000 in regional Australia. Forty-eight cents out of every tourism dollar is spent in regional Australia. The government understands the importance of this. Through Tourism Australia, we support tourist events like the Great Outback Cattle Drive from Birdsville in Queensland to Marree in South Australia. The impact for small business in regional communities can be seen, for example, at the Birdsville Hotel, which 20 years ago employed three people. Today it employs 17 people and at high season it employs 30 people.Another example is the Bedourie Oasis caravan park. Fifteen years ago, the owner and his wife would open for three hours a day and for one hour on Sundays. Today they open seven days a week and they have seven full-time employees. That is very significant. I know that the member for Ballarat will be interested in this, because her region received $500,000 through the Australian Tourism Development Program to promote tourism. The member for Lingiari would also be supportive, because desert tourism has been promoted to the tune of $220,000.

This process will open on 1 June and businesses will be able to submit applications for 60 days.

116,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Beazley, Kim, MP","PE4","Brand","ALP","Leader of the Opposition",18,"—We have a genuine matter of urgency on our hands here and we need an explanation of considerably more detail than we managed to get out of the Deputy Prime Minister in question time, I am afraid to say. The Deputy Prime Minister raised as his defence against this report which apparently started to be circulated in around September of last year that somehow it referred to events of previous years and that they are more than adequately catered for by the decisions that were taken in the budget of the previous year on security for aviation and other forms of transport.There is a complete disjunction between the suggestions that are made in what to me looks very much like an operational report with current application and the political blah for which this government has become well known over time. When you have a problem, give yourselves a list. Don’t address the issue that needs to be addressed. Don’t address the fact that there is an operation going on out there that needs to be countered and defeated. Tell the public that you have done a million different things in terms of importing machines to do this, that and the other, appointing inspectors-general and getting various people around the place to write very good reports. Those are the sorts of things that this government has become so adept at doing over the years, as it covers 10 years worth of incompetence in just about every area you care to name. And we have another example of it here today.Understand what this document is. I do not have the document. All we have here is what the newspaper had, but the newspaper seems to have a very great deal. And from looking at the newspaper report I can tell you that this is not a historical document. I will lay you London to a brick that this is an operational document to advise other sections of the department of the dimensions of a problem that they have on their hands and what must be done or what things need to be countered in order for there to be security at the airports. It is not a document about a historical problem. It is not an essay by an academic on what once was. It is not the underpinning document of the various measures that were announced by the government in the budget of last year and repeated by the minister here today. It has nothing to do with those announcements, which were of a far more general character. The facts entailed in this would not have been in a position to surface into the hands of the minister—and evidently they still did not surface into the hands of the minister—until it had reached a relevant senior level in the customs department.In September of this year the customs department considered quite obviously that they had an operational document on their hands. That operational document said that there were widespread potential breaches of security at our main airport—the main airport through which peoples move and which would be the most likely locus of a terrorist attack. None of the issues raised here—not those issues related to smuggling drugs, not those issues related to inadequate security checks, not those issues related to terrorism—concern generics. They concern specifics. They are actual suggestions of practices that are proceeding at the moment. There are various gangs that are named. There are habits of those gangs which are described. There is a character of personnel which is analysed. There is a problem the dimensions of which, for an operational customs officer and a police officer, would become the basic document from which they subsequently operated their investigations. I can tell you something else. They are absolutely the documents which would be in the hands of a properly operating Inspector of Transport Security.Insofar as to whether or not these matters remain current, I suppose we can go further to the fact that in recent weeks we have revealed or have had revealed to us that the Federal Police are at this moment examining the sorts of events that are described in this document. It is not a past document. It is not a document which has been overcome by the government’s program of acquiring various X-ray machines to be in place by 2008. It is not a document whose problems have been overcome by the various suggestions made about particular new methods of checking. The circumstances which the document describes are a matter of continuing moment, because they are exactly the same types of propositions which have been revealed in the last two weeks. They are matters that are actively engaging the attention of the Federal Police as they try to deal, root and branch, with apparently a very large smuggling operation operating through Sydney airport.This is contemporary. And the complacency of the minister is extraordinary. Ministers in this government seek always to evade responsibility—always to evade the finger pointed at them, always to evade their obligations to their people and always to have an explanation to cover themselves. If the Minister for Justice and Customs, the Attorney-General and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services did not have operational briefing notes covering this particular activity at Sydney airport and—whether they had this report or not—if they did not have reports based on this report as briefing documents to themselves on the level of risk, they are derelict as ministers and their departments are derelict as advisers.Mr Deputy Prime Minister, you will have a chance to say to us whether or not you did, but if you did not have presented to you a set of documents after a study like this had been done which indicates a level of threat which includes a potential terrorist threat—if you or the Attorney-General or the minister for customs did not have that on your desks—what confidence can anybody in this country have that you are looking after their security interests? What confidence can they have that you would come into this chamber and say in answer to a question here: ‘Look, you don’t have to worry about the terrorist issue. This document was generic.’","Transport Security","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It was not a specific terrorist issue, is what you said. It was a generic threat of terrorism—that is what you said in answer to your question. Logically, if you can move drugs around an airport, if you can move things around an airport, then there must be the possibility that you could move Semtex around by the same show. We all know that. Any member of this parliament is capable of standing up and saying that. We all can use our commonsense in this sort of situation.You are not just any member of parliament, Deputy Prime Minister. You are the minister in charge. You are the fellow who knows not only the generic threats. You are there to know if there is a specific one. Here is what your operational report said. I cannot believe that, if this is so, you or one of your ministerial colleagues did not have a synopsis of this on your desk. The newspaper reports:The report said one security guard and his family were members of a “fanatical” religious group.The newspaper goes on to quote from the report.“Some of these persons have affiliations with radical ... groups—these are the people who are being supervised; these are the employees that they are talking about—and are seen as a possible security liability. Some have associations with gangs predominantly in Sydney’s southwest ...“The vulnerability of Sydney airport ... should not be under-evaluated in terms of counter-terrorism or other criminal activity.”This does not refer to generics, Minister. It does not refer to possibilities that are out there which a fertile mind sitting around a desk in Customs could conjure up as a possible scenario either for his superior officers or for a movie script. This is the product of Customs officers and police examining the practices that are in place at Sydney airport, understanding the character of some of the people that they are dealing with at Sydney airport and matching that to what they know in this community of people who have adopted extremist positions and have been, potentially at least, persons of interest to security officials. Then, having analysed their practices and all the things that they have been doing, the report says that all of these things constituted together add up to a situation where quite possibly a serious potential terrorist threat is emerging or could emerge from here. The report may say something different, in which case the minister could rock into this place, table the report and put all our minds at rest.But there is nothing here to say that in September of last year the department of customs considered all these threats obviated. There is nothing whatsoever to say that. There is nothing here to say that in September of that year the customs department considered that there was no longer a problem of screeners, there was no longer a problem of employees who were convicted of matters, there was no longer a problem of unauthorised duplicate keys and there was no longer a problem of black spots not under surveillance in the airport’s basement or corridors that are being used as drug drop-off points. There was not a suggestion—at least nothing in the newspaper account of this report—that there was any longer any theft by airport employees from baggage and aircraft duty-free trolleys.Indeed, logic would suggest that there is good reason for the September 2004 completion of this report for presentation to more senior officers, because what have we learnt since then? Since then, people have been emptying out baggage and running around with camel heads. People have been issuing reports to Qantas at the rate of 35 a week, I think it is, saying that their baggage has been tampered with. The Federal Police have announced that they are surveilling and they have shown us all these shock horror photos that have made their way through with appropriate pixilation to our television sets of people who are persons of interest and who they are examining. All of these things have occurred since September 2004, and there is nothing to indicate, anyway, that that report of September 2004 was a historical, as opposed to an operational, document.Nothing that the minister has said here does anything but evade his responsibilities. We are not talking any longer about the blah that the Howard government dumps on you whenever you raise a complaint with it. There is a billion dollar program out there that is the government’s answer to this issue and, like the billion dollar program, the government never develops a solution. But it develops a lie. It develops a proposition. It develops the defence. The wet-headed amongst those who analyse the affairs of politics in this country take it seriously, but the serious people start their investigation from that point, and we are the serious people who start our investigation from this point.But why did we all come at this, and why is this a subject now? The answer is that while all this has gone on, while these practices have developed and while these problems of potential terrorist threats are identified, one key element of transport security—part of the $93 million package, which was the $93 million blah dumped on this particular debate—has been that famous position: the Inspector of Transport Security.","Transport Security","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Inspector will investigate major incidents and systemic transport security weaknesses to ensure security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.He was appointed about a month after that and taken off duties to cover the government’s rear in the Rau case.

As I have said many times, we absorb all of the information as it becomes available to us about what is happening and we seek to act responsibly and in a timely way on it.I will work through how that happens in a moment, but I am disappointed that a matter as serious as this is being plainly sensationalised by the opposition. Let me say this: it is quite appropriate for the opposition to raise their concerns about security and transport but, if they were serious, the first thing that the Leader of the Opposition would do—because he has been a senior member in a government and he would know how important and how sensitive security matters are—would be to do something that he and his shadow spokesman have not done. Rather than going out and sensationalising this before you know the facts, you would have sought a briefing on any of these recent media reports concerning criminal activity at airports or on aviation security.","Transport Security","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not think there is any of that in there, because I think we have addressed all of the issues, as I said in the parliament. But I make this point: the Leader of the Opposition would know full well that, if he were being genuinely responsible on this, he would have sought a prior private briefing on it from my department. That is what he would have done and he knows that. He is yabbering away over there, as is his wont, but he knows full well that the right thing to have done here would have been to seek a proper briefing. If he did not want to sensationalise it, he would have sought a proper briefing. He would have got it without question; he will get it now without question, if he wants it, and so will his spokesman. But, until he does, he stands charged with this: he is more interested in sensationalising it than he is in making a responsible move to help us reinforce the bolts and braces, if you like, of Australia’s transport security arrangements.I want to run through what the government has done and what it is doing on aviation security, maritime security, land transport security and critical infrastructure protection. I do not want to do that in a smug or complacent way. If we are going to have this debate now, I welcome it, but again with this proviso: I urge the Leader of the Opposition or his spokesperson to seek a proper briefing from us. I would be only too happy to do that. I cannot be more transparent than to provide that. I ask in the court of public opinion: could anything be more reasonable than my making that offer? I am sincere about transport security; it matters. I do not want blood on my hands. The government do not want blood on their hands. And what could be more responsible than for the Leader of the Opposition or his spokesman to accept the offer of a briefing?It is extraordinary that the opposition leader accuses the government of simply responding to the transport security issues that confront us with ‘blah’. That is what he said: ‘Blah’. He would recognise blah. He is a consummate sort of blah-issuer of modern day politics in Australia.

I will pay him that compliment because it is true. He knows that I take aviation security seriously, and I pay him the compliment of saying that I knew he took it seriously as well. I do not run away from that. We engaged in some pretty serious and worthwhile dialogue in the interests of the Australian people. He nods. He knows that to describe our response to the security of the travelling public of Australia as ‘blah’ is irresponsible nonsense and that somebody who has been a senior member of government, indeed a Deputy Prime Minister of this nation, ought to know better—and, I tell you what, he does know better.The Leader of the Opposition does himself no credit whatsoever by describing our response—our massive response to improving the security of the travelling public in Australia since September 11, 2001—as ‘blah’. He acknowledged it. He said: ‘A billion dollars worth. They cover it in blah.’ Is a billion dollars worth ‘blah’? Does he think that Qantas take the safety of the travelling public lightly, that they would consider that ‘blah’, and that our great airports would say the same thing?To come to this report, the Leader of the Opposition says that he has not seen it but he insists that it was current in September of last year. I have to tell you that is not right. This was an internal report for Customs. I did not know about it.

That is where we are at.I said in question time that I cannot guarantee that there will not be an incident. I wish I could, but I cannot. I can say to you that there is no question that our aviation security arrangements are at world’s best practice. We understand them to be that at the moment. On a number of indicators, we are ahead of the international pack and of the requirements of ICAO. I do not say that with any sense of complacency or smugness but just to counteract the idea that our response has been ‘blah’.What I do want to say is important. People have the right to know this. Do I get regular reports from my department? Yes, I do. The Office of Transport Security give me weekly updates. They run to several pages and cover off every security related issue that has occurred. The Office of Transport Security want to alert me to emerging issues that might demand a further response and any security intelligence that is around the place. We regularly have ASIO update our aviation security analyses in this country. We are, as I speak, on medium alert in relation to aviation and the appropriate levels of alertness are in place for that level.","Transport Security","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The role of the Office of Transport Security is to put in place preventative security arrangements. It is there to ensure that acts of unlawful interference with aviation are prevented wherever possible. That is done through a very active program of policy setting, capacity building, auditing, compliance, working closely with industry and public awareness. I will say this: you go and ask industry. Does anybody think Qantas, Virgin or any other airline wants a security incident? You go and ask them what they think of my department’s relationship with them. They will tell you that it is a very good and very effective relationship and that they think it works well and are very glad of it. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, who is more interested in sensationalising this, they want the facts. It is worth pointing out that, since this act was passed, the OTS have undertaken 47 security audits, 70 aviation security inspections and 50 systems tests. They have conducted 345 visits to aviation industry participants and participated in 136 meetings with industry players.

159,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"McClelland, Robert, MP","JK6","Barton","ALP","N/A",26,"—Again applying the pub test, what Australians realise is that those who are most self-righteous frequently have the most to hide. That is very much the case when it comes to the government and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services—and, indeed, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is at the table. One looks at their language. Each and every time we raise a crucial national security issue, they stand up with self-righteous indignation and accuse us of scaremongering. In fact, the Australian travelling public are scared. All those Australians who are investing $8 to have their baggage wrapped because they have no faith in the security systems at our airports are, according to this minister, wasting their money. Apparently, since the end of December 2003 there have been no security problems. He was somehow infused with the contents of this Customs report and has addressed all those issues, I think he said.So there are no anxieties for the Australian public to worry about, despite the fact that since that time we have seen the Australian Federal Police conduct arrests with respect to the smuggling of cocaine worth some $15 million. I do not know how that happened, because apparently there were no security issues in existence after December 2003. They had all been addressed by the minister, by this miraculous scheme, by this legislation and by these regulations. There were no security concerns. The issues around the Schapelle Corby case motivated the government. I think the minister at the table may at least have had a role in the correspondence if not actually drafting it. He wrote to the Indonesian authorities and reported the serious allegations of the tampering with baggage that happened late last year.I am not going to address the merits or otherwise of the findings in that case but I think it is fair to say that the Australian travelling public would recognise the reality that if drugs can be placed in a person’s luggage, so can guns, ammunition and indeed explosives. But nothing of this has been admitted. We are getting somewhere near to an admission of that fact today by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services but it has taken us a good 10 days of trying, giving him a few whacks in the House so he would recognise the systems failures, as indicated by this systemic criminal conduct at our airports—clearly revealed security breaches that could be exploited by terrorists. The minister has been somewhere near admitting that today. Even if people have their own views about the merits of the Schapelle Corby case, all Australians would recognise that it was at least a possibility that her bags were tampered with, certainly given the context of seeing a baggage handler—it is a comic image, but it has very serious repercussions—driving around an airport wearing a camel suit. Again, supposedly these things should not happen. That footage must have been before the end of 2003 because, according to the minister, the government have addressed all these things and this magic wand—the $93,000 package—has resolved it all.I think the minister has an obligation and we are going to hold him to this obligation. We put to him this challenge: when he is satisfied that these issues have been addressed, he should tell the House and the Australian public what he has done to address the issues as identified in today’s Australian. He should let us know what they are doing to prevent passenger baggage containing large amounts of narcotics being diverted to domestic carousels to avoid Customs inspections. As it turned out in the Schapelle Corby case, some airports actually have video footage of at least some areas. The minister should assure us that all these black spots are actually now being videotaped, which, in my understanding, certainly is not the case. The minister should tell us for how long the video footage is kept. In the Schapelle Corby case, one airport kept it for 48 hours and another airport kept it for 28 days. There is no standardisation of the recording of these crucial security areas, hence there was nothing available to either prove or disprove at an official level the allegations that were made in that case—there should be. All areas should be under video surveillance, and with digital technology there is no reason why that video surveillance footage cannot be retained. The minister can explain why there are still these inconsistencies at our airports and what he is doing to address them.I refer to the report of 39 security screeners having serious criminal convictions. We could probably accept that with the re-issue of security cards those persons were not re-issued cards. But the government can still satisfy us that their system is right in the context of there being an absence of an official means of verifying and checking documentation. Despite the fanfare of the Attorney-General about this new protective system and a cabinet submission claiming that $300 million was necessary, we see this budget allocating $6 million. So if they are satisfied that the primary documentation provided by people is accurate, the minister can come and explain that. He can also explain whether engineers retain duplicate keys and what are the precautions there. He can inform us where the black spots were identified and what is being done to put them under surveillance. He can tell us what is being done to screen 100 per cent of cabin crew, given that, as the Australian indicates, they were identified in the report as an extremely high risk. He can tell us whether that is occurring and, if not, why it is not occurring—I can tell you it is not occurring. Given the reports, he can tell us the extent to which Qantas aircrew recruited from overseas have been implicated in the importation of narcotics. He can tell us what is being done, given that outsourcing is still occurring of Australian jobs to overseas crew who are working at substantially reduced wages. In those circumstances, one would expect them to perhaps be more open to an approach by criminal organisations, both from their country of origin and in the course of transit. He can tell us what he is doing to ensure that those contracting out arrangements are being properly screened. But that would interfere, one presumes, with the government’s philosophy of unrestricted contracting out. The minister can come in and explain to us what review has taken place of the employment practices that exist at the airport. As the Australian indicates, there is a propensity for stacking of friends, associates and family members of these various gangs. He can tell us how those issues have been addressed. He can tell us how there are appropriate security checks in the contracting out of security services and then the further contracting out of those individuals who are on our screens.The minister talks of best practice. There is absolutely no way that people—aircrew or otherwise—would go to the United States or Canada not being 100 per cent screened and there is absolutely no way that those countries, even with their so-called free enterprise philosophy—the United States in particular—would allow this ad hoc contracting out system that we allow in our airports. They have pulled those people under tight government control and authority. So for this minister to talk about us having world’s best practice when we see ‘camels’ driving around our airports is, quite frankly, fraudulent. But we are told that we have to trust people identified as drug smugglers, we have to trust people identified, if the newspaper article is correct, as religious fanatics involved in extremist organisations, we have to take them at face value, using these self-righteous values, and finally the minister wants us to put our trust in a ‘camel’ driving around an airport.This minister has ultimate responsibility for airport security. While he might want to claim the title, drive around in the cars and stand up on his self-righteous podium, the bottom line is that unless he is prepared to get in the ring and address terrorism—and indeed use competent people such as Mick Palmer to support him—then he has no credibility at all.

160,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",885,"Wentworth","LP","N/A",28,"—I have listened carefully to the arguments of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Barton as they seek to make their case that the government has failed to ensure the security of the Australian transport system. I was hoping we might hear why our Australian transport system is insecure—what particulars they could provide—but, other than a colourful incident with a camel, there seem to be no particulars at all. I would have thought that, in a matter of such immense importance for the confidence of the Australian travelling public and indeed all Australians, in such a vital issue as our national security, we would have heard from the opposition some constructive suggestions for reform—things that could be done, and things that were missing. There were absolutely none in the Leader of the Opposition’s speech. Indeed, I had trouble making any notes during his speech—not because I was mesmerised by his eloquence but simply because I was unable to identify any substantive content.As best as I could discern from the member for Barton’s speech—the second contribution from the opposition—his concerns relate to two issues. The first of them is the identity of certain staff working in our airports as claimed in this report of a report in the Australian. If that report had become known to the Australian on the day that it was completed, what would he have suggested should be done? I imagine he would have been very pleased if the government had required all people with access to security areas within security controlled airports to possess and display at all times an aviation security identification card, or hold a visitors card and be supervised by an ASIC holder. I would have thought he would have been pleased to learn that the granting of such a card to a person involves their undergoing a rigorous security assessment conducted by ASIO, a police criminal record check and, if relevant, an immigration status check.All of that has been done. What more would the member for Barton suggest the government should do to ensure the identity, security and reliability of the staff working at airports? We do not know, because he simply has not told us. He has provided no constructive suggestion at all. He has complained about a newspaper report of a report that appears from what we read in the newspaper to be at least 18 months old. We do not know whether its contents are accurately reported. We do not know whether the contents of the report itself—assuming they were accurately reported—are themselves accurate. I ask: what should the government be doing to ensure the security and reliability of people working in our airports? There is positive vetting by ASIO, a criminal record check and a check with immigration. That is the responsible course of action for a government to take, and it is the course of action this government has taken. That is why the Deputy Prime Minister was right to say that no government has done more to enhance our security than this government. The member for Barton could have suggested what more could be done. I was sitting here, pen in hand, waiting for a constructive suggestion. But nothing came of it—nothing at all.That was the first of the concerns I could distil from the member for Barton’s remarks. He also seems to have a concern about video cameras. Apparently, he believes there are places in airports where there should be more video cameras. I think everybody agrees that there should be surveillance of secure areas. The government is very committed to that, and no doubt the member for Barton could be of great assistance. He could, for example, use his good offices with the New South Wales government, his Labor colleagues in Macquarie Street, because there are some legislative barriers to installing covert camera surveillance throughout these areas. He could have offered to help there. I am sure that that assistance would have been gratefully received. He could also have offered to use his no doubt considerable influence with the industrial wing of the Labor movement, which itself has some concerns about its members being subjected to video camera surveillance at their workplaces. But he did not offer to do that at all.So, as far as surveillance is concerned, what we have had is, if you like, a penetrating glimpse of the obvious: if there are any black spots then it would be good for them to be covered by video camera surveillance. The member for Barton knows from what has been said in this House and what has been said in the media as recently as this morning by Senator Ellison that the government is committed to doing that. He knows there are issues with the New South Wales Labor government and its legislation, and with the unions. He has offered nothing constructive to address those issues at all.So what we really have is an MPI which is no more than an attempt to sensationalise a newspaper report on a matter as serious as national security as we go into these challenging and difficult years. The world did change in 2001; we all understand that. We face new challenges every day. We all understand the great challenge of terrorism. We know that the terrorist has to be successful only once, but the police, ASIO and law enforcement agencies that are there to protect us have to be right 100 per cent of the time. The government would no doubt appreciate an offer of help from somebody like the Leader of the Opposition with his great experience and penchant for driving around in tanks. But, the Leader of the Opposition, not wanting the facts to corrode his vivid imagination, is not even prepared to sit down with the Deputy Prime Minister and get a briefing to find out the facts before bringing his apparently considerable experience to bear.We do have a great challenge with security, and we always will have. There is an old motto, ‘The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.’ The price of security is eternal vigilance too. As every new incident and experience emerges, lessons are learnt. We heard a moment ago from the Deputy Prime Minister, from a minister who undertakes his responsibilities with the most important quality for an office as important as this: an open and constructive mind looking to learn from every change and from every incident how our systems can be improved and how our measures can be made more secure.We have in Australia, as the Deputy Prime Minister said, equal to the world’s best airport security. None of us can guarantee that our airports will not suffer a terrorist incident. All we can do is our very best to ensure that that does not occur. But part of that exercise is a responsible approach to security. Part of the burden and responsibility incumbent on all Australians, and particularly those that sit in this House, is to approach these issues responsibly and constructively: when there are concerns, to find out what the factual basis for those concerns is, and having found out to bring their experience, their intellect and their imagination to bear with suggestions, solutions and constructive ideas. We have had none of those today. It is a great pity that we did not. It says a great deal about the opposition and the attitude the Labor Party has to ensuring the safety of our airports that we have had such a miserable, sensational contribution from them today.

168,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP","8K6","Hunter","ALP","N/A",30,"—I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs for making way for me to discuss this important Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005 and I move:That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:failing to pursue meaningful tax reform;failing to seriously address the problem of effective marginal tax rates in its 2005-2006 Budget; andcontinuing to introduce tax bills with significant errors and anomalies requiring costly and cumbersome legislative correction.”While this is a relatively straightforward bill it contains a number of important provisions which deserve close examination. The bill contains a number of essentially straightforward housekeeping amendments: some new agencies are listed as tax deductible gift recipients and there is yet another correction to a legislative mistake by this government.As I have, unfortunately, had to identify in this House on a number of other occasions, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Mr Brough, is establishing a reputation as somewhat of a serial offender when it comes to taxation law amendment mistakes in this place. There have been a number of examples of significant errors since Mr Brough has held this position. A couple spring to mind and I use these as examples of the government expecting the opposition to consider and indeed give passage to bills with the minimum amount of notice and minimal opportunity to consult those who may have been affected by the changes.The first example related to long-term non-renewable contracts and the application of those contracts and the GST. On that occasion the government expected the opposition to consider and give passage to the bill in just one day as we all rushed into the lead-up to Christmas. It is a matter of history now that the opposition rejected the call from the government that we consider the bill in that very short period and that the government was forced to amend its own bill after Christmas—an amendment only made possible by the opposition’s insistence that we would not be rushed on that very important issue. We are not going to have hundreds of small business people, and people with interest in property generally, adversely affected by faulty amendments that we were expected to consider in just one day.There was another error, and again the opposition was expected to deal with the bill in a very short period. That was the amendment to the application of the GST on foreign tour operators. On that occasion we were again expected to handle the bill in a very short time even though many in the tourism sector were expressing some very real concerns about unintended consequences associated with that bill. Labor consequently sent that bill to a Senate committee where, extraordinarily—something I have not seen before—Treasury admitted there were errors in the bill and the bill had to go back for drafting. This is becoming an all too regular occurrence. I give the government notice that we will not be rushed into ramming tax legislation or tax amendments through this House without being given the opportunity to properly consider them and to consult with the relevant potentially affected parties.Tomorrow we will be expected to debate schedule 6 of Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 2) Bill 2005 which, I can say now, looks like another example of a botched approach to legislation. Again, we will be expected to do the same: to consider it in great haste, regardless of the consequences it may bring for those affected in various industries. The bill before us today provides another example of that, and I will come to that later.I will go through the schedules one by one. Schedule 2 is a measure to correct a major legislative error. Last year the parliament passed the New International Tax Arrangements (Participation Exemption and Other Measures) Bill 2004. The bill extended tax exemptions for foreign branch profits and non-portfolio dividends where Australia has a tax treaty with the country in which the foreign branch operates. Prior to this bill, international shipping and airline profits were taxed under foreign treaties. However, the government has now realised that this creates a situation whereby income and capital gains from ships or aircraft of Australian companies may not be taxed anywhere, either in Australia or in the country in which the company’s foreign branch operates. I have been advised that Treasury still does not know with any great certainty whether there has been a revenue leakage as a result of this substantial error.This bill now carves out these sectors from the change introduced in the 2004 legislation so that they are now taxed under the provisions applying in a particular tax treaty. So this bill is returning to the situation that applied prior to the act enacted last year in respect of international shipping and aviation profits. So after 12 or more months the government is bringing in a bill to repeal it. Great stuff again from the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer—another faulty approach to important tax legislation. I call upon the minister when he sums up today on this bill to concede this error, and I put him on notice that the opposition will continue to pursue him on these mistakes. As I said earlier, we will continue to refuse to be held to ransom when considering these bills in the House.Schedule 1 provides tax concessions for philanthropy and provides greater flexibility to charitable funds. These amendments are welcomed by those of us who sit on this side of the House. This schedule expands concessions associated with making donations, especially testamentary gifts—that is, gifts made under a will—and makes it easier for gift funds to obtain a tax exemption on income the gift fund earns. The changes are not controversial and the opposition supports them. Currently a testamentary gift or a donation made under a will to deductible gift recipients only receives a capital gains tax exemption if the gift is more than $5,000. This amendment will remove that cap.Schedule 1 also makes it easier for gift funds to obtain a tax exemption on income the gift fund earns. An anomaly exists in the current legislation which stops a charity gaining an income tax exemption for moneys in its gift fund if it gives money, property or benefits to two different types of charities. The amendment will correct this irregularity. Recognition has also been given to non-charitable funds which provide money, property and benefits solely to DGFs that are tax exempt. Where funds were subject to income tax, concessions will be now available to those funds which provide money, property or benefits solely to DGRs that are tax exempt. The final change to schedule 1 will allow ancillary funds to obtain a refund of franking credits on the same basis as other DGRs.The amendments to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 in schedule 3 add the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia within the definitions of ‘law enforcement agency’ and ‘head’ to enable the Commissioner of Taxation to disclose relevant taxation information to the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia. This treatment mirrors the provisions that apply to similar state bodies. The opposition is more than happy to support the amendment.Schedule 4 relates to the correction of yet another error. One of the more significant concessions to charities is that of being an FBT rebatable employer. It is well established in common law that an arm of government is not a charity. However, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2004 amended charities law in such a way as to allow many government bodies to secure exemption from 1 July 2005 including, for example, museums, art galleries and public universities. On estimates, this would have cost $20 million per year. This amendment ensures that a government entity cannot gain the FBT concession. Although these are worthy institutions, they should not receive the concessions because they are organisations intended to be funded by government. Recent case law has blurred the distinction between what is and what is not an arm of government in the charitable and welfare sector. Still, on the whole, the distinction is a worthy one. Arms of government should not get the tax concessions normally available to a charity. The exception to this rule is DGR status, but this is a concession given to the taxpayer, not to the entity per se.It is important to note that Labor will assist the smooth passage of this bill and will support the amendment to this schedule—but on a conditional basis. The condition is that we will reserve our right to change our position in the Senate once we have had the opportunity that we have so far been denied—that is, the opportunity to consult stakeholders. We of course reserve the right to change our position if stakeholders are able to establish that, again, there are anomalies in what the government is putting forward.Schedule 5 relates to the dependent child age criterion. Schedule 5 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to standardise the age criterion for dependent children for the purposes of taxpayers claiming tax concessions in relation to their dependants. Currently the dependent child age criterion varies across entitlements, such that a taxpayer may be able to take a child into account when claiming the medical expenses offset but not be able to take the same child into account when determining the family thresholds for the Medicare levy or the Medicare levy surcharge. A single age criterion will provide consistency and simplicity for taxpayers.Prior to the introduction of this bill, the independent child age test for the child housekeeper, zone and overseas defence forces tax offsets, and the Medicare levy surcharge was less than 16 years old for a student or 25 years old for a full-time student. This differs, of course, from the dependent child age criterion for the medical expenses tax offset and the family tax benefit part A. In the case of the medical expenses tax offset, a dependent child is a child of the taxpayer who is less than 21 years of age, a child under 16 years of age who is not a student or a full-time student under 25 years of age. For the family tax benefit part A, a dependent child is an individual aged under 21 or an individual who has turned 21 but is under 25 and undertaking full-time study. Standardisation in these areas is an important goal and objective. Labor supports the amendment.I have moved a second reading amendment in my name which takes the opportunity to make the point that the opposition expects a higher standard from the government—something more than the piecemeal approach it has had to tax legislation in recent months. In particular, when it comes to the budget we expect something more than a big tax handout—some $22 billion—to a select few in our society. We expect a real approach to tax reform and, in particular, a real approach to reducing effective marginal tax rates in this country. The fact is that the government has done little to reduce EMTRs. There has been a modest increase in the free area of family tax benefit part A. This will reduce EMTRs over a very small range. However, the government has no real plan to deal with the interaction of the tax and social security systems that leads to these massive welfare and poverty traps. The government needs to totally reshape the system and focus on tax reform, not just tax cuts. That is the issue: we have tax cuts aplenty but reform is nowhere to be found. The government has no vision or plan for improving the efficiency of the tax system in this country, no plan to improve our international competitiveness and no plan to make the tax system fairer.We call on the government to make these fundamental reforms. I note that when the Treasurer came into the House last Wednesday evening to participate in the consideration in detail stage of the government’s tax package—something that is a bit of a rare treat for the opposition, I must say, as we do not very often get the Treasurer in here participating in debate—he made no attempt to dissect Labor’s alternative tax policy. He made no attempt to issue a criticism of it, despite the fact that he had the broad principles attached to that policy for more than two weeks and despite the fact that he had had the detailed amendments to that tax policy for seven hours and 45 minutes prior to that debate. He comes in here and heaps criticism on the member for Lilley, the shadow Treasurer, heaps criticism on the Leader of the Opposition and heaps criticism on the Labor Party, but he made not one attempt to dissect Labor’s alternative tax package and not one attempt to issue any criticism of it. There was no comparison of the two packages, no acknowledgment that under Labor the average taxpayer in this country would get $12 in tax cuts rather than $6, no acknowledgment that giving big tax cuts of $65 a week to those earning more than $125,000 is unfair and no acknowledgment of the fact that more than 45 per cent of his tax cuts are going to the highest 10 per cent of income earners in this country.This bloke has been the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia for 10 years. We expected something more than that. If he has a problem with Labor’s alternative proposal, he should say so—but he should say so in detail. That is what debate in this place is all about. This is not a place in which you treat your opposition with contempt, because we on this side represent people. In many instances, we represent the people who have been most adversely affected by this tax cut package. It is absolutely wrong for the Treasurer to come in here, ignore Labor’s tax package, ignore the very strong arguments Labor have put up on our position on the government’s unfair tax package and simply lump criticism on the opposition. It is unacceptable to the opposition; it is unacceptable to the Australian community.Labor can make this promise to the government: we will continue to pursue a fairer tax cut regime. We do not have any problem with giving tax cuts to those at the high end of the scale—in fact, we support that. But we have a government, awash with money, taking in twice as much revenue as the former Keating government in its last year of office. The government is also awash with money as a result of a minerals boom in this country. The government should be returning a dividend to the taxpayer, returning the proceeds of bracket creep and giving the taxpayer a break. That has been part of the approach by the government in this tax package, but we want that dividend returned fairly. Low- and middle-income earners, of course, missed out in the last round of tax cuts—those under $52,000 annually. We were entitled to expect that, if there was going to be a tax cut this time around, there would have been more emphasis on low- to middle-income earners.Labor’s tax cut also deals with low-income earners and those seeking to move from welfare to work through our low-income and welfare to work tax bonus—Labor’s approach to addressing the very serious problems we have with EMTRs in the tax system. By contrast, the government has not addressed this issue. I call upon the government to keep bringing forward sensible bills—preferably without drafting amendments and with more notice given to the opposition—but what we are really looking for from this government is some real tax reform.","Second Reading","TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

171,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Prosser, Geoff, MP","RI4","Forrest","LP","N/A",35,"—I rise in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005, which will amend various taxation laws to implement a range of changes and improvements to Australia’s taxation system. Firstly, this bill gives effect to the government’s announcement in the 2004-05 budget to encourage charitable giving in Australia from both the private and corporate sectors. Schedule 1 of the bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to introduce a number of new amendments to increase flexibility for charitable funds, ancillary funds and prescribed private funds.There are four policy changes proposed to expand concessions. The first relates to capital gains tax provisions and proposes that a capital gain or loss made from a testamentary gift—that is, a gift made under a will of property to a deductible gift recipient—will be disregarded for capital gains tax purposes, regardless of the value of the property. This effectively removes the requirement that testamentary gifts have to be valued at greater than $5,000 in order to receive capital gains tax exemptions and hence removes any impediment that may discourage the donation of testamentary gifts.The second concession relates to distributions by charitable funds. Charitable funds will be allowed to claim income tax exemptions whether they provide money, property and benefits solely to charities based in Australia, solely to charities that are also deductible gift recipients or to a combination of these charities. Currently, an income tax exemption applies to charitable funds that provide money, property and benefits either solely to charities that are located in Australia and pursue their purposes in Australia or solely to charities that are deductible gift recipients. However, the law creates an inconsistency by not allowing charitable funds to obtain income tax exemptions when they provide money, property and benefits to both types of charities. This amendment allows funds that provide money, property and benefits to both types of charities to access an income tax exemption.The third concession relates to income tax exemption for charities and will allow prescribed private funds and ancillary funds that provide money, property and benefits solely to income tax exempt deductible gift recipients to qualify for income tax exemptions where the Commissioner of Taxation has endorsed these funds as being eligible for tax exemptions. The income tax law currently only allows ancillary funds and prescribed private funds access to an income tax exemption where they are charitable funds. Charitable ancillary funds and prescribed private funds only provide money, property and benefits to DGRs that are charities or for charitable purposes in benefiting DGRs. However, not all DGRs are endorsed as charities. DGRs that are income tax exempt but are not charities include some government bodies such as public ambulance services and research authorities. Consequently, ancillary funds and prescribed private funds cannot access an income tax exemption where they provide money, property or benefits to those bodies. To rectify this anomaly, this amendment will allow non-charitable ancillary funds and prescribed private funds to benefit from an income tax exemption where they provide money, property and benefits to DGRs that are income tax exempt, whether or not the DGR is a charity.The fourth policy change proposed under schedule 1 is to allow ancillary funds and prescribed private funds that are endorsed as income tax exempt entities to be entitled to a refund of franking credits. The income tax law currently allows endorsed and specifically listed DGRs and endorsed charities and charitable funds to claim a refund of franking credits on franked dividends. The vast majority of prescribed private funds already benefit from a refund of franking credits by virtue of being endorsed as an income tax exempt charity. However, an unintended consequence of this is that non-charitable prescribed private funds are not automatically entitled to this concession. This measure ensures that non-charitable prescribed private funds will be able to access a refund of franking credits on the same basis as charitable prescribed private funds. Non-charitable prescribed private funds endorsed under the new exemption will also be entitled to a refund of franking credits.The amendment proposed in schedule 2 to this bill relates to international shipping and airline profits. It is technical in nature and corrects an unintended outcome from the recently expanded foreign branch profits exemption by the New International Tax Arrangements (Participation Exemption and Other Measures) Act 2004. The expanded exemption, in conjunction with Australia’s treaties, could have resulted in foreign branch income and gains derived from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic not being taxed in Australia or the country in which the company operates.The expanded foreign branch income exemption will not apply to an Australian company’s foreign branch income and gains from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic. This means that Australian companies will continue to be taxed in the same way as they were before the start of the expanded foreign branch income exemption. This amendment ensures that certain foreign branch income and capital gains of an Australian company are included in its assessable income. This will be implemented through a change to the foreign branch income exemption in section 23AH of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.Australia has exclusive rights under most of its tax treaties to tax an Australian company’s foreign branch profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic. This is different to the tax treatment of other business profits derived through a foreign branch. The different tax treatment for those profits reflects the practical difficulties in allocating the income and expenses between countries in determining the profits from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic. The expansion to the foreign branch profits exemption meant that Australia would not tax those profits derived through foreign branches in treaty countries.The amendment to section 23AH preserves the way some Australian companies with foreign branches were taxed prior to the implementation of the New International Tax Arrangements (Participation Exemption and Other Measures) Act 2004. That act applies to income years starting on or after 1 July 2004. This amendment will also apply from that time to ensure that income and capital gains derived by an Australian company from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic through a foreign branch do not escape taxation. The amendment applies to the income and capital gains derived through foreign branches in all foreign countries—that is, there is no distinction between listed and unlisted countries, treaty or non-treaty countries or whether or not tax was paid on the amounts in any foreign country. The Australian company may be entitled to foreign tax credits under section 160AF of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 for foreign tax paid.Schedule 3 to this bill amends the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to allow disclosure of relevant information to the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia. The primary role of the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia is to report and investigate misconduct by Western Australian public officers and public sector agencies. The Commissioner of Taxation can release taxpayer information to certain law enforcement agencies, such as police forces and various crime commissions, if the commissioner is satisfied that the information is relevant to establishing whether a serious offence has been committed.Subsection 2(1) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 includes an exhaustive definition of ‘law enforcement agency’ and includes state and national bodies responsible for crime and corruption investigation. The Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia, which was established by the Corruption and Crime Commission Act 2003 (WA), replaces the Anti-Corruption Commission in Western Australia and the Royal Commission relating to the Conduct of Western Australian Police Officers.The Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia has all the powers that the Anti-Corruption Commission had, as well as the powers of the police royal commission. The police royal commission was an eligible royal commission under the definition of ‘authorised royal commission officer’ for the purposes of section 3E of the TAA 1953. As the new Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia is not an eligible royal commission, an amendment to the tax law would be required to enable the use of relevant taxation information by the new commission. The amendments insert the new Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia into the definitions of ‘law enforcement agency’ and ‘head’ under subsection 2(1) of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to enable the commissioner to disclose relevant taxation information under section 3E of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia to assist with investigations into misconduct by public officers which may involve serious offences or the making of a proceeds of crime order.The fourth measure under this bill will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to make a technical correction to the anomaly that allows government institutions that are charitable institutions at law to be eligible for fringe benefits tax rebateable employer status. Schedule 10 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2004 Measures No. 1) Act 2004 introduced a requirement for charities, public benevolent institutions and health promotion charities to be endorsed by the Commissioner of Taxation in order to access certain taxation concessions, including FBT rebateable employer status. FBT rebateable employers are eligible for a 48 per cent rebate of the FBT amount that would otherwise be payable. This amendment will clarify that certain government institutions of the Commonwealth, states or territories that are accepted as charitable institutions at law will continue to be ineligible for fringe benefits tax rebateable employer status from 1 July 2005.Finally, schedule 5 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to standardise the age criteria for dependent children in respect of whom a taxpayer may be eligible for certain taxation concessions. Currently, the dependent child age criteria vary across entitlements such that a taxpayer may take a child into account when claiming the medical expenses offset but may not take the same child into account when determining the family thresholds for the Medicare levy or the Medicare levy surcharge. A single set of age criteria will provide consistency and simplicity for taxpayers.Prior to the introduction of this bill, the dependent child age test for the housekeeper, child-housekeeper, zone and overseas defence force tax offset, as well as the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge provisions, was a child of less than 16 years of age who was not a student; or a full-time student of less than 25 years of age. This differs from the dependent child age criteria for the medical expenses tax offset, where a dependent child is a child of the taxpayer and is less than 21 years of age; and a child under 16 years of age who is not a student; or a full-time student under 25 years of age. For the family tax benefit part A, a dependent child is an individual aged under 21 or an individual who has turned 21 but is aged under 25 and is undertaking full-time study.The amendments will adjust the dependent child age criteria for the housekeeper, child-housekeeper, zone and overseas forces tax offsets, the notional dependent child tax offset, the notional sole parent tax offset, the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge and will standardise the definition such that a dependant is a child less than 21 years of age who is not a student. The criterion for students will remain that they are less than 25 years of age. Standardising the age criteria for dependent children will allow more families to benefit from the dependant related tax offsets and the Medicare levy and the Medicare levy surcharge family threshold. I support these five changes in this bill which will improve the Australian taxation system. I commend the bill to the House.","Second Reading","TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
172,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Emerson, Craig, MP","83V","Rankin","ALP","N/A",38,"—Labor supports this legislation but has moved a second reading amendment, which I also support. The amendment condemns the government for failing to pursue meaningful tax reform, for failing to seriously address the problem of effective marginal tax rates in the 2005-06 budget and for continuing to introduce tax bills with significant errors and anomalies requiring costly and cumbersome legislative correction. Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005 is an example of such a bill. It corrects a number of errors that have been made previously in the drafting of legislation.Just by way of example, schedule 2 corrects a very large error in an international tax bill that was introduced last year. The New International Tax Arrangements (Participation Exemption and Other Measures) Act 2004 creates a situation whereby income and capital gains from ships and aircraft of Australian companies may not be taxed anywhere, either in Australia or in the country in which the company’s foreign branch operates. That would have constituted a substantial revenue leakage, but it is not the only example. Schedule 4 relates to a ‘fringe benefits tax rebateable employer’—that is, an employer who is the beneficiary of concessionary fringe benefits tax arrangements. In this case, Taxation Law Amendment Bill (No. 1) of 2004 amended the charities law so as to ensure that many government bodies, including museums, art galleries and public universities, could get an exemption from 1 July 2005. That would cost in the order of $20 million a year. So Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No 3) Bill 2005 is amending Taxation Law Amendment Bill (No. 1) of 2004, which was amending the Income Tax Act. So we are amending amendments because errors were made in the drafting.Schedule 5 is another example. It seeks to rectify a situation where the age criteria for dependent children, for the purpose of taxpayers claiming concessions in relation to their dependants, at present differ from one case to another or from one part of the Income Tax Act to another. In schedule 5 the government is seeking to standardise the age of dependency to provide a single set of age criteria which will give some consistency for taxpayers.That is a bit of the flavour of what the government is doing with these taxation law amendment bills. These bills come into the House with monotonous regularity and by and large they are amendments to deal with anomalies, problems and even earlier amendments to the Income Tax Act which were drafted in error. It is a timely reminder of the state of the income tax system in Australia. That is why the Labor second reading amendment calls for genuine reform of the income tax system.Every member of this parliament will remember the Treasurer, in 1999 and 2000, boasting how he had devised a streamlined new tax system for a new century and that this would radically simplify the Australian tax system. Nothing could have been further from the truth. When the government was seeking the support of the Australian people to form a government in 1996, the then Leader of the Opposition and now Prime Minister of Australia said that he would set a goal of cutting red tape by 50 per cent. Upon winning government, he told the Alan Jones program that the so-called ‘streamlined new tax system for a new century’ would greatly simplify the income tax system—not only simplify it but radically reduce the size of the Income Tax Act. When the government came to office in 1996 the Income Tax Act ran to around 3,500 pages and it is now at least 9,000 pages.On top of the much more complex Income Tax Act, the Australian people are now confronted with the GST, itself a very complex tax. So rather than simplifying the tax system in this country the government has made it ever more complex. I note, in yet another announcement by the government, that it is now having another go at simplifying the income tax arrangements for Australia. I wish the government well. But, on past performance, whenever the government sets a goal of simplifying the income tax system it makes it ever more complex. I look forward to the outcome of yet another process that the government has announced to simplify the tax system.I turn now to an issue which is part of the second reading amendment, and that is the failure to seriously address the problem of effective marginal tax rates in the 2005-06 budget. The main change that the government made to the income tax scales in the budget was to provide a very generous tax cut to members of parliament and to others who earn in the $100,000 to $125,000 range. That income tax cut amounts to $65 a week, but I point out that that does not include the impact of another measure which enjoyed very strong support on budget night from coalition members, and that was the abolition of the superannuation tax surcharge. The abolition of that surcharge is of great value to people on high incomes—and here I talk about incomes of $125,000. If those people are making a 12 per cent contribution to superannuation, then the tax cut of $65 a week will become a tax cut of $94 when the abolition of the superannuation tax surcharge is counted.Just a few days later, of course, MPs were able to achieve a pay rise. At the same time the government was putting submissions to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission which, in effect, would amount to a reduction in the real value of the minimum wage. This is the fundamental reason for Labor opposing the tax cuts in the budget—because the government has skewed them so heavily towards the higher income end of the scale, leaving lower and middle income earners with a grand tax cut of $6 a week. But the problem does not just sit there. Over time, most Australians have some sense that they are being fleeced by the government. That is because they are being fleeced by the government through bracket creep.I refer to a number of occupations with which all Australians could identify, ranging from hairdressers to farmhands. In the context of the terrible drought that we have at the moment the Australian people would be interested in the welfare of farmhands. I refer to cleaners, shop assistants, receptionists, hospitality workers, clerks, factory workers, motor mechanics, enrolled nurses, machine operators, social workers and accounts clerks. What do all of these occupations have in common? They are the forgotten people. They are the people John Howard forgot in the last budget when he gave no tax cut at all to people earning less than $1,000 a week. According to official statistics, people in each and every one of these occupations earn less than $1,000 a week. As if that is not bad enough, given that they only received a $4 sandwich and milkshake tax cut in 2003—the only one since the GST came in, with no tax cut in the previous budget—in this budget they receive only $6 a week. But, using budget projections of wages growth and inflation, it is not too difficult to calculate the creeping impact of the income tax system for the forgotten people. And that is that as their incomes rise, purely because of inflation not because of real income growth, inflation takes more and more of their income into higher income tax brackets even though, in real terms, they have not earned anymore. Using the projections that are in the budget I have been able to calculate the impact of the government’s proposed tax scales over the next four years. The truth is very disturbing.By 2008-09, which is the end of the budget period, a hairdresser would be paying $17 a week extra in bracket creep simply because of the effects of inflation, not because of any growth in real income. So here is the government raking it in from hairdressers in this country who would be paying $17 a week more. That seems to be a pretty large number in the context of a purported tax cut of $6 a week. In fact, they will be paying $17 a week more. But it gets a lot worse. A farmhand will be paying $20.75 more; a cleaner, $20.30 more; a shop assistant, nearly $22 more; a receptionist, also nearly $22 more; a hospitality worker, again $22 more; an office clerk, $26 more; and—going to another category—a social worker, $31 more. That is what the government is doing—that is the caper. It is obtaining from the forgotten people, through bracket creep, the revenue to be able to fund the income tax cuts at the top and still keep the budget in surplus.It is instructive to compare that with the tax scales that the Leader of the Opposition unveiled as an alternative in his budget reply. Under those tax scales, which are much fairer, these occupations are in every respect better off as a result of the tax cuts. Most of the occupations—for example, office clerk, labourer, factory worker, motor mechanic, enrolled nurse, machine operator, social worker and accounts clerk—would have real tax cuts, not only in the coming years but by the end of the projection period. So the fundamental difference between Labor’s tax cuts and the coalition’s tax cuts is that the coalition’s tax cuts are illusory because bracket creep is larger than the tax cut that the coalition has announced.To borrow a phrase from the Treasurer, the coalition’s so-called tax cuts do not deliver a true tax cut to the forgotten people ‘not for one day or for one dollar’. Never are they ahead. In 2005-06 every one of them are behind. There is no real tax relief because the collection of revenue through bracket creep from these occupations exceeds $6, so they are all worse off. That is testimony to the fundamental difference between the coalition and Labor. The coalition is prepared to use bracket creep to fleece the forgotten people, middle-income earners, in order to pay for the tax cuts for high-income earners and to pay for the abolition of the superannuation tax surcharge.In the 13 years of the previous Labor government, Labor provided seven tax cuts returning all of bracket creep and more—not necessarily to exactly the same people, but in aggregate it was all of bracket creep and more. The Treasurer in his National Press Club appearance here at Parliament House the day after the budget said that the tax cuts were all in advance of bracket indexation. That statement is highly misleading. The only reason he was able to make that point, the only feather with which he was trying to fly, was the fact that in the year 2000 the government did introduce very significant income tax cuts. But we were told at the time the purpose of those income tax cuts was partial compensation for a new, very large tax, the GST—a $36 billion tax. This is the orphan tax. It is the tax that the Howard government now says is not its own. The Auditor-General says the GST is a Commonwealth tax. The Australian Statistician says the GST is a Commonwealth tax. The Australian people say the GST is a Commonwealth tax. The only people who maintain the outrageous pretence that the GST is not a Commonwealth tax are the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and members of the coalition sitting opposite here and in the Senate.There is no real tax reform in the government’s tax arrangements. High effective marginal tax rates still apply for low- and middle-income earners, often, very commonly, exceeding 60 per cent. We hear arguments from business groups that the top marginal rate of 48½ per cent is some shocking deterrent to work and it removes incentives from people on those incomes. If 48½c removes incentives for people in a particular income range, surely 60c in the dollar is a greater deterrent. Yet the government’s tax cuts, far from constituting reform, have done virtually nothing to improve the work incentives for people on low- and middle-incomes.That is where we are in relation to the failure of this government to introduce meaningful tax reform, but it gets worse. The whole budget is predicated on the fact that in the last few years our mineral prices have gone through the roof. They have gone through the roof and now constitute the best terms of trade that this country has seen in 50 years. What we know about rising commodity prices is that sooner or later they will fall. The reason for that is that countries around the world, including Australia, will respond to the higher prices and increase mine capacity and, as a result of that extra capacity coming onto markets, sooner or later the prices of those mineral products will be depressed. What the government is doing here—apart from using bracket creep from low- and middle-income earners to pay for tax cuts for high-income earners—is using that temporary surge in national income, which is showing up to a significant extent in the taxable income of mining companies, and that temporary surge in tax revenue from mining companies to provide tax cuts especially to high-income earners in this country.The total is around $22 billion of tax cuts—not counting the superannuation tax surcharge, by the way—over the coming four years. The general economic problem that can be created as a result of that is, given that this surge in income is inevitably going to be temporary, what happens to those tax cuts when the surge in income is over? Will they remain affordable? Will the budget be put under extra pressure? The budget papers are full of references to the risk that this temporary surge in income may end even more quickly than the government’s projections suggest. So there is a real risk to the budget associated with using the proceeds of company tax to pay for tax cuts for high-income earners.That is one of the risks, but the other risk, about which I have spoken before, is that the tax cuts that will flow—to the extent that they are real tax cuts—will increase consumer spending at a time when the Reserve Bank of Australia is in the red zone and considering whether or not to increase interest rates. Labor’s critique of the government, before the last election and subsequently, is that it has committed $66 billion to a spending spree over four years. The result of this budget is that the $66 billion spending spree has become a $103 billion spending spree, and a lot of that is front-end loaded to this period now where consumer spending is already going very strongly.The risk is that the government is pouring fuel onto the flames of high consumer spending and that the Reserve Bank will, as an inflationary consequence of this, act to increase interest rates. If that happens, later in the year the $6 a week tax cut—which is not a genuine tax cut at all but the handing back of some small part of bracket creep—will be wiped out as a result of increases in mortgage interest rates. So this is not tax reform. The tax system is in urgent need of genuine reform and the government has compounded the economic risks facing this country by providing tax cuts for high-income earners at a time when the Reserve Bank is very concerned about the possibility of rising interest rates.","Second Reading","TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
173,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP","TK6","Boothby","LP","N/A",42,"—The Jesuits have taken a line from the Bible to use as one of their maxims in education: to those whom much is given, much will be expected. While they use it in the area of education, it could apply equally in the area of corporate philanthropy. Australia does have a great tradition of corporate philanthropy. If you look at the art galleries and the universities around this country, you will see that many have received very significant endowments from people from the business world. Yet when we compare ourselves to the United States we see that the United States has a much more deeply entrenched tradition of corporate philanthropy.It was partly, I am sure, to encourage this spirit of corporate giving that the Prime Minister’s community and business partnerships were established, and since they have been established there have been many worthy winners of awards under that partnership. One which comes to mind at the moment is that of IT company Cisco Systems, who have had a famous collaboration with the Smith Family. It is expected that all employees of Cisco Systems, apart from doing their day job, will have an activity with this charity, the Smith Family. In 2001 Santos, in my home state of South Australia, announced that they would be endowing the University of Adelaide with a school of petroleum engineering. It was then, I think, about $25 million and was the largest example of corporate philanthropy at that time.The legislation which we are considering today, the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005, has five separate parts, but the first part deals with corporate philanthropy and tax concessions for corporate philanthropy. The first part deals with the removal of the capital gains threshold for certain testamentary gifts. There is an amendment introducing a new subsection, 118-60(1)(1A), into the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 which will deem any property with a value less than $5,000 as having been valued by the commissioner at a value of more than $5,000 for the purposes of the capital gains tax exemption. As a result of this deeming provision, property with a value of less than $5,000 will be eligible for the capital gains tax exemption.Reading this amendment just before speaking, it occurred to me that it is very complex. The intent of the legislation is to ensure that a testamentary gift be exempt from capital gains tax if it meets certain requirements set out in the Income Tax Assessment Act. This amendment is saying that if something is less than $5,000 the Commissioner of Taxation will deem it to be more than $5,000, because that is what another piece of legislation requires. It just seems to me that this amendment could have been written in simpler language. We have had TLIP, and there is the idea of using plain English in the tax legislation. There may be a very good reason for the way this amendment is written but, when I saw it, I thought it could have been done in a simpler way.The section referring to the ‘distributions to charitable funds’ tidies up the legislation so that charitable funds can claim an income tax exemption. Currently, it has to go either to charities located in Australia, which pursue their purposes in Australia, or to charities which have been accepted and registered by the ATO as DGRs. It has to go to one or the other. The next amendment will enable charitable funds to claim an income tax exemption if they distribute funds to both. The next section deals with an income tax exemption. At the moment, private funds, ancillary funds, cannot claim an income tax exemption if they distribute their funds to DGRs which are not endorsed as charities. We have an amendment that will deal with that.The last bit in the corporate philanthropy section deals with the refunding of franking credits. This will entitle non-charitable prescribed private funds to the refund on the same basis as charitable prescribed funds. Having said that, these are sensible amendments which arise from recommendations made by the corporate sector, who want to get more involved in the area of corporate philanthropy.The second part deals with profits derived from international shipping and airline operations. Again, this amendment is consequent on previous legislation considered in the parliament which had the unintended consequence of affecting the taxation of Australian companies involved in international shipping or airline operations. Under our tax treaties and tax law, Australia does have exclusive taxing rights to Australian companies in respect of the profits from ships or aircraft in international traffic. One of the consequences of the New International Tax Arrangements (Participation Exemption and Other Measures) Act 2004 is that foreign income from Australian companies involved in shipping and airline operations would have been exempt. This amendment addresses that.The third part of this legislation deals with secrecy provisions. It allows the disclosure of information collected by the Commissioner of Taxation to the newly established Western Australian Corruption and Crime Commission. The legislation includes the commission as an eligible recipient of relevant information collected by the commissioner.The fourth section deals with the area of fringe benefits tax. Again, this is to ensure that any institutions which are characterised as an emanation of government cannot receive fringe benefits tax rebatable employer status. This is significant. It leads to a 48 per cent reduction in the fringe benefits tax paid by an employer. It is available to charities, public benevolent institutions and health promotion charities to reduce the fringe benefits tax they pay by 48 per cent. It has been possible that government bodies of the Commonwealth, the states or territories could have been eligible for the rebate from 1 July 2005. The measure makes sure that the established legal principle remains the same—that is, institutions which are an emanation of government within the established meaning of charity at law will continue to be unable to claim this rebate.Schedule 5 is an alignment or harmonisation so that there will be a uniform age criteria for dependent children. The age at which a dependent child who is not a student will be able to be considered as a dependent child goes up to 21. Currently, the age is 16 for a number of things—for example, housekeeper-child, housekeeper’s-own and overseas defence forces offsets. The Medicare levy, Medicare levy surcharge and the medical expenses tax offset are more in line with what has been considered under family tax benefit part A—that is, 21 years for someone who is not a student, and 25 years for someone who is a full-time student.I was not able to vote on the income tax cuts legislation which went through the House last week, but I support it very strongly. One piece of unfinished business from the new tax system in 2000 was that the government were unable to get through the income tax cuts that we originally promised at the 1998 election. Last year in the budget, we were able to take advantage of the advent of Mark Latham as the Leader of the Labor Party, because he had advocated income tax cuts for people on higher incomes. We did that in 2004. It is only because of that that we were able to get the top two thresholds increased from $52,000. The tax cuts announced in this year’s budget are very significant.The Labor Party really has got this wrong. When you have steelworkers at Port Kembla who, through overtime, are in the top marginal tax rate and 48.5c of every extra dollar they earn is going to the government and not into their pockets, it really is a strange Labor Party. Labor identities like Bill Shorten have identified this politics of envy and of stopping people who actually want to work more, earn more, save more and take home more of what they earn. We should be allowed to do that. We also face a problem when there are a million Australians overseas—for many of them, coming back is quite punitive when they have worked in places like Hong Kong, with its low marginal rate of taxation, and face being taxed at 48.5c in the dollar in Australia. I very strongly support the tax cuts and I hope we will see them pass through the Senate in time for employers to get their withholding schedules right. I support the bill and I would be interested in an answer to the question I raised.","Second Reading","TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
174,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Brough, Mal, MP","2K6","Longman","LP","Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer",44,"—in reply—I thank all of the members who have participated in this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005. As many members have mentioned, this bill continues the government’s program of modifications and improvements to the tax laws. The first measure outlined in the bill gives charitable funds, ancillary funds and prescribed private funds greater flexibility in the way they make donations to other funds. It does this by removing the limitation on capital gains tax exemption for testamentary gifts to charities and by giving various funds the ability to make donations to a wider range of organisations without losing tax concessions.In his contribution the member for Boothby raised some very pertinent points about the way in which the federal government, and the Prime Minister in particular, have really led the business community in this country to be more philanthropic in their attitude. As a direct result we have seen a big jump in foundations being established and moneys going to worthwhile charitable organisations. I commend all those organisations, businesses and individuals who have taken up that challenge and used the leadership displayed by the Prime Minister and the supporting policies to add to the great fabric of the Australian community.The member for Boothby also queried the reasoning behind one of the measures contained in the bill. As it stands, you can claim capital gains tax when you provide a testamentary gift when that gift is valued at over $5,000. Until this bill becomes law, gifts under $5,000 do not have that benefit. I am advised that the reason for the way the amendment is structured is simplicity, so the tax office can say that, for all intents and purposes, there is no difference between gifts, regardless of value. I hope that clarifies the member for Boothby’s question. Clearly, there is more than one way to deal with these issues. This is the way that the draftspeople have deemed to satisfy the need, clarify the law and, most importantly, provide the capital gains tax relief to those who bequeath gifts valued at less than $5,000.On the second point, by way of background, under the current law the income tax exemption for charitable funds has a very limited application. This is unfortunate, and that is why we have moved to correct this. It is only available where charitable funds distribute solely to charities that are located in and are pursuing their purposes in Australia or solely to deductible gift recipients, but there is no exemption if they make distributions to a combination of both of these types of organisations—both worthy organisations and both able to receive those gifts in totality from one organisation but not if they choose to spread their charity around. The proposed measure will ensure that those charitable funds can access income tax exemptions if they distribute all of their funds to either organisation or a combination of both kinds of organisation.Additionally, under the current law, ancillary and prescribed private funds can only access income tax exemption if they distribute funds and/or property to deductible gift recipients that are also charities. But they cannot be income tax exempt if they distribute to deductible gift recipients that are only income tax exempt. The changes will mean that the ancillary and prescribed private funds will not lose the income tax exemption if they choose to distribute solely to deductible gift recipients that are charities and to deductible gift recipients that are income tax exempt or to both, providing them with greater flexibility and, once again, ensuring that their charity dollars go to as many worthwhile organisations as possible.Finally, and in addition to the benefits outlined above, this measure will improve access to refunds of excess franking credits. The existing law allows refunds to deductible gift recipients, endorsed charities and charitable funds. Under this bill, this will be extended to ancillary and prescribed private funds that distribute solely to income tax exempt deductible gift recipients. Ultimately, the measures will ensure that the tax law operates equitably across the range of philanthropic and charitable donations. In essence, it will allow funds a greater choice in the distribution of moneys. These changes also give effect to the government’s announcement in the 2004-05 budget.The next measure outlined in this bill is technical in nature. At present, the recently expanded foreign branch profits exemption can, when viewed in conjunction with Australia’s treaty obligations, be interpreted to mean that the international shipping and airline profits derived by Australian owned foreign branches are not subject to both Australian and overseas taxation regimes. I am sure that they would be happy with that arrangement, but of course it is not suitable and, basically, would ultimately result in a leakage of taxation from Australia. That was never intended by the legislation and through this bill we are now ensuring that those amounts will be taxed in Australia consistent with Australian tax policy. I believe that the member for Rankin in his address suggested that there would be a major financial impact as a result of this having not been picked up. I can assure him that is not the case, but, if we had not moved to rectify it in this bill, it may have been the case in the future.The third measure in this bill concerns the release of information by the Commissioner of Taxation. Currently the commissioner is able to release taxpayer information to certain law enforcement agencies if he is satisfied that this is relevant to establishing whether a serious offence has been committed or whether it is necessary to the making of proceedings of a crime order. The proposed measure will add the Corruption and Crime Commissioner of Western Australia to the list of law enforcement agencies able to receive relevant taxpayer information from the commissioner.The fourth measure outlined in the bill concerns a technical amendment to the fringe benefits tax law. The existing fringe benefits tax law provides in effect that the fringe benefits tax rebate applies to a scientific, charitable or public education institution as long as they are not a Commonwealth, state or territory institution. In the course of updating the law relating to charities, consequential changes were made to the rebate provisions. I should clarify a matter. The member for Rankin suggested that there would be a leakage in revenue as a result of this measure. I can assure him that is not the case. If these measures were not implemented, then the cost would be in the order of $80 million or $90 million going forward, but there has been no leakage in the revenue base.The last measure in this bill simplifies the rules for concessions which are contingent on having a dependent child of a particular age. Historically, different concessions have had different age criteria. This measure standardises the dependant child age criteria used to determine entitlement to a housekeeper, child housekeeper, medical expenses and zone tax offsets as well as the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge. The introduction of a single set of age criteria—that is, a child less than 21 years or a full-time student less than 25 years—gives much-needed consistency to the law. I guess in some small way it is a down payment on what many people are calling for: a simplification of tax laws. This does just that in these areas. Also, as the revised age criteria are more generous than the various criteria currently in place, they will allow more taxpayers to access dependant related offsets, including the concessional Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge threshold offsets and the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge family thresholds.The member for Hunter, in his response to this bill, was also concerned about schedule 4, ‘Fringe benefits tax—rebatable employer status of certain government institutions’. I believe he stated at the time something to the effect that Labor reserved their right to change their mind in the Senate, having given it the okay in this place and voting for it—and I acknowledge his nodding of the head. This really goes to the amendments that the Labor Party have put forward here and the position they have taken on the general tax cuts. What we are really looking for from the opposition is a decision. The only decisions that they seem to be making of late are to determine not to make a decision. I know it is difficult to make a decision but that is what government is about and that is what this side of the House does day in and day out. We made a decision, for argument’s state, to give tax cuts to every Australian from 1 July this year. The Labor Party have made a decision that they are not sure whether or not the Australian public should have those, and I guess they have reconfirmed that with their statements in the House tonight on these issues.","Second Reading","TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is fine for a political party to be confused but it is not acceptable when they want to go out and confuse the public, particularly the business community, over the tax cuts that are before us.The member for Rankin, in his final couple of statements tonight, said that the tax cuts that come into effect from 1 July this year—which the Labor Party cannot make up their mind about but say the Australian public should not have—are not tax cuts at all. That goes to what the member for Lilley has always stated: the $600 family payments are not real money. So we are starting to see some consistency within the Labor Party: consistency in not understanding that when Australian families receive a tax cut they get the money in their hand. Australian families can recognise that, even if the Labor Party cannot. While the public can appreciate receiving $600 child payments, the Labor Party cannot. I guess that is why they are sitting in opposition and are in the doldrums with the polls that have come out today. The public understand these issues. The coalition understand these issues, and we are here to ensure that we provide the best possible governance for the Australian public and in doing so we move these amendments.","Second Reading","TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES NO. 3) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[5]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

183,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP","8K6","Hunter","ALP","N/A",47,"—The Labor Party have made a definite decision to support the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2005. We are always happy to make a definite decision to support a bill on two bases: (1) that we get sufficient notice of the bill, so we have an opportunity to study it and consult relevant stakeholders, and (2) that we are sure there can be no unintended consequences. You cannot determine with any great confidence that there are no unintended consequences when the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer—who is now scurrying out of the chamber in embarrassment, one would think—introduces bills and expects us to absorb them and pass them in one day in the absence of any opportunity to consult stakeholders.The minister absolutely misrepresented me in his summation on the last bill, the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 3) Bill 2005. The point I made in the House is that we will support that bill in this place but, given this is another rushed event and the minister’s record of mistakes in this portfolio, before giving consent to the bill in the Senate we will take the opportunity to consult relevant stakeholders. We will reserve the right to oppose that bill or seek to amend it if unintended consequences are apparent, as has been the case with so many other bills that this minister has introduced. But surely he cannot get the bill that is now before the House wrong, because this is effectively a non-controversial housekeeping bill. It raises the low-income thresholds for the Medicare levy and the Medicare levy surcharge by the consumer price index. It amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 and the A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Act 1999 to increase the Medicare levy low-income threshold amounts for individuals, families and pensioners below pension age. It will also increase the phase-in limits as a result of the increased threshold amounts.The Medicare Levy Act 1986 provides that no Medicare levy is payable for low-income individuals and families where the taxable income or combined family taxable income does not exceed the threshold amounts. The Medicare levy shades in at a rate of 20c in the dollar where the taxable income or combined family taxable income exceeds the threshold amounts. A Medicare levy surcharge of one per cent applies on taxable incomes in certain cases where high-income taxpayers do not have private patient hospital cover. The surcharge also applies to reportable fringe benefits in certain cases where taxpayers do not have private patient hospital cover. However, a family member would otherwise be liable for the surcharge where the total amount of the person’s taxable income and reportable fringe benefits do not exceed the individual low-income threshold amount. Unlike the Medicare levy, there is no shading in of the surcharge above the threshold amount.Given that this is a straightforward bill, Labor supports its speedy passage through this House and the Senate. This is important, because these measures have to be in place by the end of June this year. Whilst supporting this bill, Labor does not endorse this government’s general approach to Medicare and the health system of this country. On that basis, I move:That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for failing to accept Labor’s proposals which would increase the threshold which senior Australians do not have to pay the Medicare Levy by $442, thus missing the opportunity to increase equity in the funding necessary to ensure that:Medicare is sustainable over the long-term;the Government’s failure to fund a sustainable strategy to increase bulk billing rates will be overcome;the blowouts in the Medicare safety net, concealed from the public, will be funded; andthe Federal Government will be able to work with the states on health reform”.This government claims to be the friend of Medicare but, given the Prime Minister’s track record, we on this side of the House and the Australian community know his real feelings on Medicare. He has stated them publicly on a sufficient number of occasions for us to be sure about them. The Prime Minister can be a friend of Medicare when it is politically expedient. There is no greater example of that than during last year’s federal election campaign, when the Prime Minister believed there was so much political opportunity in supporting Medicare that he was prepared to throw any amount of money at it. He was prepared to throw at Medicare any amount of money necessary to secure a fourth term for himself.I am, of course, referring mainly to the Medicare safety net. The Prime Minister was prepared to back a blow-out of $800 million in the Medicare safety net in order to secure his re-election. We now know with certainty that the Prime Minister and his health minister, the member for Warringah, were more than conscious of the blow-out in the Medicare safety net in the lead-up to the election. They knew about it at the time of the PEFO. In fact, when the Prime Minister stood up in Brisbane to deliver his election manifesto he knew that the safety net was blowing out substantially. But what did they do? They gave an ironclad guarantee—no conditions, no caveats, no questions asked—that the Medicare safety net would remain in place unchanged.What did we get after the election? We got a different story. We got what must have been the most significant sleight of hand in the history of our federation—the biggest backflip we have seen in the political history of this country. Let me remind the House what the Prime Minister had to say on 14 April about the Medicare safety net. He said:Since the election, it has become apparent that the cost of it is going to be even greater than we thought at the time and that is the reason why we believed in the interests of maintaining it, we have to increase the safety net.Of course, he was referring to the threshold. He went on to say:Well, certainly we didn’t say we were going to increase the threshold, no, but at the time of the last election, we did not believe it was going to blow out quite to the extent that we believe it is now.Who in the Australia community believes that statement? It is on the record. We know for a fact that the government was aware of the blow-out, because we had our own health policies costed and, to do that, the safety net had to be costed because we were claiming it is a saving. We know that the government was fully aware of the blow-out in the safety net. The government deceived the Australian people and it should be held to account.What does this mean for the so-called charter of budget honesty—a mechanism which the government sold to the Australia community as a means of holding the government to account on budgetary measures? The charter of budget honesty was sold as a means of ensuring that, when a government goes to an election, its election promises can be fully costed and paid for within the budgetary context; but we now know that it stands for nothing and means nothing. There is no greater evidence of that than what happened during the last election campaign in terms of the Medicare safety net. The charter of budget honesty is just a tool of government to make things more difficult for the opposition in the lead-up to a federal election. We now know that the opposition has to be held to account under the charter of budget honesty but the government does not feel a need to be held to account.Why did the Medicare safety net blow-out? Because it does not contain any incentives. It is not a policy that any sensible government would have introduced other than during an election period or in the context of an election. By contrast, Labor has long had a plan to raise bulk-billing rates by providing GPs with an incentive to bulk bill. The Prime Minister often talks about incentives. So why not provide some incentive for GPs to bulk bill? Because, in the election context, the Prime Minister saw an opportunity to spend up big while having in mind during that whole period the opportunity to renege on his promises after the election.I will make one last point because I know the Manager of Opposition Business has a bit to say about the Medicare safety net and like matters. Last Wednesday at about 6.30 pm we gave government members an opportunity to increase the Medicare threshold, the point at which senior Australians in particular pay a Medicare levy, and that was by offering the government members an opportunity to back Labor’s low-income and welfare to work tax offset. That was a perfect opportunity for government members to do something real about assisting seniors with their medical costs in this country. In addition to that, it was an opportunity for those on the other side to do something serious about effective marginal tax rates in this country, putting incentive into the work processes and giving incentive for people to move from welfare to work.We did not have any serious debate about Labor’s amendments last Wednesday night. This is the height of arrogance from the government. All we got was the Treasurer making a rare appearance, pouring scorn on the Labor Party, the member for Lilley, the Leader of the Opposition and all opposition members, but not at any time taking the opportunity to dissect Labor’s tax package to have a look at Labor’s low-income tax offset and what it would have done for the medical costs of senior Australians in this country.In conclusion, Labor is always happy to support sensible amendments in this place as long as we are given appropriate notice and an opportunity to consult the relevant stakeholders. Where we are not given that opportunity we reserve the right to hold up bills if necessary. We have been vindicated in that approach twice in recent times. One was on non-renewable long-term contracts and the imposition of the GST on them and the other was the effect of the GST on inbound tour operators. On both occasions we were able to highlight flaws in government bills which we were expected to support and give passage to in just one day—we certainly will not do it. But on this occasion, given due notice was given and the simple nature of the bill, the opposition is happy to give it support.","Second Reading","TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY AND MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

186,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Richardson, Kym, MP","E0B","Kingston","LP","N/A",50,"—I rise today in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2005. The purpose of this bill is to increase the low-income thresholds for the Medicare levy and the Medicare levy surcharge in accordance with the consumer price index. This increase will ensure that low-income individuals and families will not be disadvantaged due to small increases in their taxable income which are no greater than the increase in inflation. This bill will ensure that the protection awarded to low-income earners is not eroded by increases in the cost of living and small wage increases aimed at keeping up with those increases in the cost of living.The Medicare levy low-income threshold for pensioners below age pension age is also being increased in this bill. This will ensure that these pensioners do not pay the Medicare levy while they do not have an income tax liability. In 2001-02 the Howard government substantially increased the pensioner tax offset to allow these pensioners to earn more before they faced a tax liability. Since then, this government has increased the Medicare levy threshold to ensure that these pensioners who do not have a tax liability also do not have to pay the Medicare levy.From the 2004-05 financial year the Medicare levy low-income threshold will increase to $15,902 for individuals and $26,834 for families. The additional amount of threshold for each dependant child or student will also be increased to $2,464. For the same financial year the threshold for pensioners below age pension age will increase to $19,252. These amendments will take effect for the 2004-05 financial year so that individuals lodging tax returns at the end of this financial year will be covered by the alterations.This is an exceptionally important bill because it ensures low-income earners are protected from the burden of having to pay the Medicare levy. Alterations such as this to the levy thresholds in accordance with CPI ensure that the protection provided by the thresholds is not eroded by the passage of time and the increases in inflation. I commend the bill the House.","Second Reading","TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY AND MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
187,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Gillard, Julia, MP","83L","Lalor","ALP","N/A",51,"—I rise to speak in this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2005 and the second reading amendment standing in the name of the member for Hunter, which I have seconded. The bill amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 and the A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Act 1999 to increase the Medicare levy low-income threshold amounts for individuals, families and pensioners below pension age. It will also increase the phase-in limits as a result of the increased threshold amounts. As outlined by the member for Hunter, that in and of itself is a non-controversial proposition from the government. But there are many things that are deeply controversial about our health system and about this government’s conduct of it, and they are comprehended by the second reading amendment.The first huge item that you cannot move beyond when talking about health and the Howard government is the appalling breach of trust of the Australian public that arose from the Minister for Health and Ageing, Minister Abbott, breaking his rock solid, ironclad guarantee to the Australian community, given pre-election, that post-election the Howard government would keep the Medicare safety net and its thresholds unchanged. We know that Minister Abbott has not broken his word—he has smashed it. We know there is a conspiracy which lies behind the breaking of his word, because of what Minister Abbott has said on the public record. He has tried to justify this broken promise by saying that when he gave the promise he had not the ‘slightest inkling’ that the Medicare safety net would be changed after the election. There are reasonable grounds to believe that in making that ‘slightest inkling’ statement Minister Abbott was not really being frank with the Australian community on yet another occasion. It is those matters that the opposition are pursuing and will pursue in Senate estimates, through freedom of information requests in this parliament, and in any other forum available to us until we get the truth.I went to some of these matters last night but, just to remind the House and to focus specifically on the unbelievability of Minister Abbott’s explanation in relation to this matter, there is a series of events—Labor has referred to it as the time line of deceit—about the costings of the Medicare safety net which means any reasonable person would have known that this program was blowing out fundamentally and that something would have to be done about it. I am particularly directing the attention of the House on this occasion to the media release that the minister issued on 28 June 2004 when he went out and boasted that 415,500 people had reached the threshold for the Medicare safety net. This was against a backdrop of the scheme being budgeted for 450,000 people to qualify in a full year. So by then Minister Abbott would have had to have known that if almost the number of eligible people who were supposed to reach the threshold in 12 months had already reached it in three months then there was a fundamental problem with costs. That was way back on 28 June 2004.In July 2004, the Herald Sun newspaper revealed that an internal Health Insurance Commission audit had evidence of changed billing practices among doctors and that this very HIC audit report showed that more than 3,000 patients in Victoria went onto the safety net in only one month. The audit report revealed a $1.4 million blow-out in the scheme in Victoria in June alone. Even if the Minister for Health and Ageing was not aware of this HIC internal audit report—and one would wonder how he would be unaware of such a major report pointing to cost blow-outs in the Medicare safety net—I can warrant to the House about Minister Abbott’s everyday behaviour that he certainly reads his newspapers. He reads them or perhaps someone reads them for him, but in any event he is certainly advised as to what is in the newspapers. There is no way that such a major story from an investigative health journalist, on this occasion Jason Frenkel, would have escaped his attention. Jason Frenkel is well known as a health reporter and his report would have been treated as credible.From time to time people ask themselves, ‘Where is Jason Frenkel?’ I am sure the minister has sometimes asked himself that question when he has been looking for Jason Frenkel to try to give him some completely incorrect information with which to try to get a media story to tarnish the opposition. But we do know where Jason Frenkel was in July 2004. He was writing this very important investigative piece about a blow-out in the Medicare safety net. The saga went crescendoing on, with the revelation on 27 September 2004 that the Medicare safety net had blown out to $1.3 billion. That was, of course, revealed during the Charter of Budget Honesty process. We know that in August, in the lead-up to the election campaign, there was a veritable flurry of activity within the government about this Medicare safety net blow-out.","Second Reading","TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY AND MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

189,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Gillard, Julia, MP","83L","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—It was a rock solid, ironclad guarantee. If the minister can discard one of those, anything could happen next. We do know that in August 2004 the budget area of the Department of Finance and Administration commenced a closer examination of the Medicare safety net and this involved consultation with the Department of Health and Ageing. We know that Finance officials admit that they had better data, including spending data, with which to undertake this closer examination. We know that towards the end of the month these officials acknowledged that the program was growing faster than had been estimated at the time of the budget, we know that a Finance official was sufficiently concerned to make two to three calls to the office of the Minister for Finance and Administration to speak to his personal staff about the Medicare safety net and we know that the minister for finance has conceded that he was verbally briefed.What we do not know is who then said what to whom, but we suspect, and I think on very good grounds—because the Prime Minister, the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Finance and Administration have all refused to answer questions on discussions held between them post this point—that they, their officers and departmental officials were in a cabal canvassing changes to prune back costs on the Medicare safety net. Minister Abbott knew that, and he knew the day he walked out and gave a rock solid, ironclad guarantee that there was no way in the world that it was going to come true. And we are going to keep after that matter until we rock solid, ironclad prove it to every member of the Australian community.That is not the only broken promise dealt with in the second reading amendment. It is not the only very significant broken promise that the community has already had to face in the area of health. The government promised in the last election campaign that it would give $30 million extra for better outcomes for mental health programs. But, of course, when we saw the budget we saw that the amount of new money invested in better outcomes for mental health fell $18 million short of this pledge from the Howard government. It is disgraceful.This is an important program that enables people to go to GPs who have been trained up in dealing with mental health issues. I note the Parliamentary Secretary for Children and Youth Affairs at the table—and she will be very well aware of this. For many people in rural and regional Australia, the only place to get any assistance at all with mental illness is through the local GP. This program supports GPs to provide that assistance. The Howard government promised an extra $30 million for this program and only delivered $18 million.When I made that very clear and factual point, Minister Abbott had a spokeswoman from his office out trying to deny this clear truth. She was muttering about PIPs, SIPs and EPC. You might think, Mr Deputy Speaker, that she had descended to speaking gibberish or perhaps another language, but what she was trying to suggest was that somehow this $18 million shortfall did not really matter because now—for assistance with funding that enables GPs to service the mental health needs of their patients—GPs could turn to the practice incentive payments program, the so-called PIPs; the chronic disease service incentive payments program, the so called SIPs; or the Enhanced Primary Care Program, or EPC.If Minister Abbott’s staff member was right, then when you look at PIPs, SIPs or EPC you would see an extra $18 million, wouldn’t you? Because there was going to be $30 million extra, and instead of delivering it all through better outcomes for mental health they had decided—you would have thought from this spin from the minister’s staff member—to put $18 million of the new $30 million in PIPs, SIPs and EPC. But, looking at the budget papers, it does not look to me like there is an extra $18 million in PIPs, SIPs and EPC. We will be pursuing that matter this week in budget estimates, because we think $18 million did not get delivered and we think the excuse given for not delivering it is a transparent piece of spin that does not hold up to the light of day. As the Leader of the Opposition would say, it is a spin not a spend, and not a spend on an issue that really has no humour involved in it when we know that the burden of disease in the Australian community from mental health afflictions is so acute. It is acute across Australia but particularly in rural and regional areas as people deal with huge stress factors, including the consequences of the drought for their lives and their businesses.I would note, even if this $18 million turned up in the PIPs, SIPs and the EPC—and I have absolutely no confidence that it is going to do so—that mental health professionals do not believe that this is the best way for the $18 million to be delivered. They would like it delivered through better outcomes for mental health because PIPs, SIPs and the EPC are programs for people with chronic diseases, and there are many people who need mental health assistance who do not fulfil the chronic disease criteria. They are not people who are chronically ill; they are people who are battling a mental health episode at some stage in their lives and, with appropriate care and support, will make a full recovery. The best way for them to access additional assistance is through mental health programs, not chronic disease programs. Mr Deputy Speaker, I assure you the hunt for the $18 million will continue up hill and down dale through estimates—and I do not think we are going to find it.The cutbacks for health did not end there, of course. As we know, in the budget the government made an additional $1.3 billion in savings from cutting the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This comes on top of the Howard government hiking the price of medicines by 27 per cent on 1 January. To be fair to the government, they alerted the community to that change before the election, but they did not tell the community that they were planning to rip a hole in the PBS safety net. They did that in the recent budget by changing the safety net threshold, adding two scripts per year to the number required to reach the safety net and also saying that scripts resupplied within 20 days will not count towards the PBS safety net. This is another attack on health.The government did not tell you before the election that it was planning to take calcium tablets off the PBS, putting up the price of calcium for people on concession cards—older Australians who would have accessed calcium on the PBS at the concessional copayment rate but who are now required to pay the full price. Many of them will not be able to pay the full price; so, instead of taking calcium and keeping their bone density up, many of them will no doubt fall victim to osteoporosis—a disease that already costs this country $1.9 billion per annum in health costs and a further $5.6 billion in indirect costs. If that is a smart idea then someone needs to explain it to me, because it just seems absurd.We note that the budget does not guarantee funding beyond December 2006 for the vaccine against the deadly pneumococcal disease for Australian children. The Labor Party shamed the Howard government into this initiative, but apparently we only managed to shame them until December 2006 because there is no certainty about the funding and provision of the pneumococcal vaccine beyond that point.There must be something about the minister for health and figures, because whenever he tries to deal with figures he invariably does not manage to get the truth out or gets it wrong. I am not sure whether this is an example related to truth-telling or an error, but I feel the need to correct a statement that the minister made in this House in question time on Monday, 30 May, which simply was not right. The minister, in an answer to a dorothy dixer—he could not have been taken by surprise or startled unless something is really going wrong with the government’s tactics committee, but presumably he was being asked a question he knew he was going to be asked—about funding for rural health, claimed:... through the rural health strategy, the government is spending an additional $830 million over four years ...This is nonsense. The $830 million is reauthorised money from the 2001-02 More Doctors, Better Services program. When that program was first funded, it was funded at $200 million a year. You used to spend $200 million a year on it and now you are going to spend $830 million over four years. One does not need to know much about inflation, particularly health inflation, to know that that increase of $30 million has barely taken into account indexation. There is certainly no part of that that could be described as truly additional funding. So the Minister for Health and Ageing was not right when he tried to claim in this place that there was a new $830 million in rural health. There is not, and not one country Australian should believe for one moment that there are extra services coming their way because of the statement made by the minister on that date.I conclude on a matter also dealt with by the second reading amendment. Apart from getting all of these things wrong, the minister does not even want to think about the biggest picture issue in health—the question of health reform. This minister has had more positions on health reform than most Australians have had hot dinners, ranging from a speculative, ‘What about I take over all the public hospitals?’ to, ‘It’s all a matter for the states,’ right through to, ‘I’ve given up on public sector health reform; now I’m going to focus on private hospitals.’ Every position under the sun one could have on health reform the minister has had at least once. Some of them he has had two or three times. But, whilst he might dance from position to position, the truth is he does not get anything done.The one thing the Howard government was going to do—and it was not the minister for health who was going to do it; it was the Prime Minister—was to have Mr Podger review the health system and have the outcomes of the Podger review go to the Council of Australian Governments meeting. We were very critical of the Podger review. It was the ultimate black box review—a bureaucrat literally sitting in an office and not seeing anyone, not talking to anyone, not consulting with anyone and not asking anyone with expertise what they thought should be done next. It was the ultimate black box review, but it was the only thing going. And now we understand that even that is off the table, that the Prime Minister has indicated that the Podger review document is now cabinet-in-confidence and will not be made available to the states, and that whilst he is willing to discuss some issues in health reform there will be no system-wide health reform. That failure by the Howard government is going to continue to cost our health system over $1 billion each year in waste. It is not good enough. It is an abandonment of the single biggest thing that needs to be done in health. That is what more than 40 professional health organisations say, as do I. It adds to the Howard government’s track record of failure in the area of health.","Second Reading","TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY AND MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
190,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Brough, Mal, MP","2K6","Longman","LP","Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer",55,"—I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2002, including the member for Lalor, who did not talk much about it but talked about everything else, and we were kind enough to let her ramble on. This bill gives effect to the budget announcement to increase the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge low-income thresholds in line with increases in the consumer price index.The members opposite, particularly the member for Hunter and the member for Lalor, have indicated that senior Australians would be better off should this House pass the Labor amendments. What they fail to tell the Australian public is that in fact many senior Australians in the financial year 2005-06 and then again in 2006-07 would in fact find themselves with a Medicare bill as a result of Labor policy if Labor went ahead and moved their own amendments as far as the tax cuts are concerned and had them accepted. So in the short term—the next two to three years—far from actually being assisted, many senior Australians would find themselves, as a direct result of Labor Party policy, with a Medicare bill that they would not have if this amendment bill passes. This is not surprising, given that going into the last election the Labor Party proposed tax cuts which would have meant that many people in my electorate actually paid more tax. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be very much aware of that. The Labor Party like to pick winners and they like to pick losers, but unfortunately they get very distressed when members of the public find that they are in fact the losers in failed Labor Party policy.The member for Lalor went on at length about the Medicare safety net. I remind the member for Lalor and those that sit opposite—and, more importantly, the public—that there is only one side of this parliament, and that is the Liberal-National coalition, that actually wants and will have and will continue to provide to the Australian public a Medicare safety net. I suggest to the Labor Party that they have a number of challenges in front of them. One is: what will the Labor Party’s policy be in regard to the safety net at the next election? Will they be endorsing the policy that the public has in fact endorsed?

195,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Brough, Mal, MP","2K6","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—I certainly will. This is a tax laws amendment bill and, as such, we are referring to tax laws and therefore we are in fact on message. Let the member for Lalor go on and on about anything and all and sundry, both irrelevant and of course inaccurate, but I will come back to a very serious issue. The Labor Party must confront its own demons. It must decide whether it will go to the next election supporting coalition policy for a Medicare safety net—yes or no; it is a pretty simple proposition—and whether it will maintain the tax thresholds that will pass this place and that we know will pass the other place at some time, whether before or after 1 July. They are the questions to which the public need to know answers. I guarantee you that, whoever is the leader of the Labor Party come the next election, it will not be holding the so-called principled position it is currently taking to the Australian population.This bill ensures that low-income individuals and families are not disadvantaged due to small increases in taxable income. If the thresholds are not increased, low-income individuals and families whose income had only increased in line with the consumer price index would face a Medicare levy liability where they had not in previous years. I remind those opposite, particularly the member for Lalor, that her policy, if it were implemented and the coalition policy were not, would condemn many senior Australians to having a Medicare levy liability. That is an absolute fact. These changes will ensure that these low-income individuals and families will continue to be exempt from paying the Medicare levy or surcharge.From the 2004-05 income year, the Medicare levy low-income threshold will increase to $15,902 for individuals and to $26,834 for families. The additional amount of threshold for each dependent child or student will also be increased, to $2,464. This bill also increases the Medicare levy low-income threshold for pensioners who are below age pension age. The Medicare levy threshold for pensioners below age pension age will be lifted to $19,252. This threshold has been increased each year since 2001-02, when the government substantially increased the pensioner tax offset, which meant that the level of taxable income at which these pensioners started to pay income tax also increased. The increase will ensure that pensioners below age pension age do not face a Medicare levy liability where they do not have an income tax liability.I remind those opposite that they have many challenges in front of them. Is the $600 family tax payment going to be ‘real money’ and will that be endorsed by the Labor Party at the next election? Will the Medicare safety net be policy at the next election? Will the tax cuts that the Labor Party are endorsing today, which do not come into effect until after the next election, be their policy? I am absolutely sure that their current position, like everything else, will change again and again, in the same manner that their leader has. I commend the bill to the House.","Second Reading","TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (MEDICARE LEVY AND MEDICARE LEVY SURCHARGE) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

202,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP","8K6","Hunter","ALP","N/A",57,"—The Superannuation Laws Amendment (Abolition of Surcharge) Bill 2005 will abolish the high-income earners tax surcharge on contributions to superannuation and relevant termination payments, with effect from 1 July 2005. The tax was introduced in 1996 in the government’s first budget, at a rate of up to 15 per cent. The tax commences at a surchargeable tax income of $99,710, rising to a maximum amount of $121,075 of income. These income levels are of course indexed.This bill is to abolish the superannuation surcharge, and it is not the government’s first attempt to do so. It is interesting to note that, once upon a time, superannuation in this country was something of a privilege enjoyed only by public servants and high-income earners. It is no secret that it was the former Labor government that changed those circumstances. It was the former Labor government that opened up superannuation to all Australians and Australian families, to all workers whether they were in the public sector or the private sector. For the first time, ordinary workers in this country had access to occupational superannuation, including an employer contribution to superannuation. This not only provided significant assistance to individuals and families; it had a significant impact on Australia’s savings capacity, with knock-on effects to the current account and other key economic indicators. So it is worth beginning my contribution to this debate by reminding the House of that very important point.The Howard government then went to the 1996 election with a very important commitment: it promised no new taxes. It is a matter of history now that we got lots of new taxes after the 1996 election. It was a bit like that promise of ‘no more red tape for small business’. In fact the promise was a 50 per cent reduction in red tape for small business. I can see the member for Watson nodding his head because he is acutely aware of this broken promise.","Second Reading","SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF SURCHARGE) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

204,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP","8K6","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—The member for Watson makes the point that they have been pretty good at building it back up to 1996 levels, with a range of new imposts, not least of which is the GST on small business. It is important to note that there was a commitment to no new taxes. But after the election of the Howard government, and in particular its first budget in 1996, it became a much different question. One of the first broken promises on new taxes was related to the superannuation surcharge, and it was on that basis that the Labor Party opposed this surcharge at the time.How ironic it is. Today I checked in the Hansard some of the comments made by government members at the time, in particular by Mr Miles, who was the parliamentary secretary to the cabinet and the Prime Minister at that time. He accused this side of the House of suggesting that someone on $70,000 was a high-income earner, as if we lacked an understanding of the way families in this country are struggling on incomes of around $70,000, $80,000 and $90,000. Of course we have a full understanding of that point. It is interesting to note the defence back in 1996 by government members of this new impost on high-income earners. Then, I think, the surcharge cut in at around $70,000. I made the point at the time that many of the coalminers in my electorate were going to be whacked by that surcharge—and they certainly have been ever since. We made all the points about this being an inefficient, unfair tax—and history has proved that. I think the administrative cost of the tax has been about 50 per cent of what it has raised, and in recent times we have seen an admission from the ATO that it is struggling to collect the surcharge from all individuals concerned.We took a highly principled stand in those days and a correct stand in terms of the efficiency of the surcharge. But what the government are asking us to do now is abolish the surcharge for high-income earners while at the same time they are directing the majority of their income tax cuts in this recent budget to high-income earners. We think that is inherently unfair. If the government want to bring in some sort of superannuation tax package that treats these matters fairly then we would always be happy to support them. But that is not what the government have done in this instance, and on that basis the opposition will not be supporting the abolition of the superannuation surcharge. This is probably a good time for me to move the second reading amendment which has been circulated in my name. Therefore, I move:That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:“the House declines to give the bill a second reading, and condemns the Government for:failing to deliver meaningful overall tax reform to underpin future economic growth;directing through this measure the largest tax benefits to high income earners while failing to deliver meaningful tax relief to those on average incomes; andfailing to reform tax measures consistent with Labor’s fairer tax package”.The really interesting thing in this debate is the basis on which this surcharge was introduced and the basis on which it is being repealed. I refer the House to the Treasurer’s budget speech of 1996 when, under the heading ‘Superannuation’, he said:Superannuation is central to encouraging self-provision for retirement. It is central to coping with an ageing population and is an important vehicle for national saving.I take that as an endorsement of the very good work Labor did throughout the eighties and nineties in creating the very system that he is talking about in that budget speech. He then went on to say:The measures I am announcing tonight are designed to make superannuation fairer.A major deficiency of the current system is that tax benefits for superannuation are overwhelmingly biased in favour of high income earners.That rings a tune we have become familiar with in recent days. He went on to say:For a person on the top tax rate, superannuation is a 33 percentage point tax concession while a person earning $20 000 receives a 5 percentage point tax concession.It seems the Treasurer believes in a progressive system when it suits him, when it applies to income tax cuts, but in 1996 he was in a sense opposing a progressive system. There is a lack of consistency emerging here. He went on to say:High income earners can take added advantage through salary sacrifice arrangements that are not available to lower income earners.The Government is remedying this situation.From tonight, a surcharge of 15 per cent will apply to future employer superannuation contributions for those whose income (including deductible superannuation contributions) is at or above $85 000. The surcharge will phase in over the income range $70 000—I was right earlier—to $85 000. It will apply to defined benefit and unfunded schemes ...And then he went on to some of the more technical detail. So it is quite clear that in 1996 the Treasurer was not seeking additional revenue to pay off government debt, he was seeking to inject more fairness and equity into the superannuation system.Just in case anyone wants to challenge this, let us go to the contribution made in the second reading debate by Mr Miles, the then member for Braddon and parliamentary secretary to the cabinet and the Prime Minister. At 10.47 am he made his contribution and he said:The superannuation system has been inequitably biased in favour of high income earners. Those high income earners have been benefiting from the concessional taxation treatment of superannuation to a much greater extent than low income earners.The introduction of the Superannuation Contributions Surcharge for High Income Earners is this Government’s response to ensure that the superannuation system is more equitable for all Australians, while also ensuring that superannuation remains an attractive savings option.The obvious question is: what has changed? Only one thing has changed and that is the government’s view, in that it is trying now to rewrite history. The Treasurer now tells us, in the context of his speech on this bill, that this was a measure to recover revenue to pay off debt. He says nothing about equity.I was delighted the Treasurer came in here last Thursday to give the second reading. That was something he was not prepared to do in 1996. This is another example of a bill that has been rushed upon the opposition. We understand why that is the case on this occasion. Usually it is because the government has been inept, it is behind in its program, it has had drafting errors and it has had to catch up—and we, on this side, have to wear the pressure of that. But that is not what has happened on this occasion. The Treasurer came in here last Thursday morning with that Cheshire cat smile on his face—looking like the cat that has swallowed the canary—because he thought he had a stitch-up for the Labor Party. So he sent in the parliamentary secretary in 1996 to do the hard grunt, but when he thought there was some political opportunity involved he came in himself, all smiles. Let me share with the House what he said last Thursday:After bringing down 10 budgets and eight surpluses this measure is no longer required to keep the budget in balance.In 1996 the measure was required to introduce equity into the system, but now, in 2005, he says that it was only introduced because the government had to pay off some government debt. What a lot of rubbish. The government has been exposed.The other interesting thing that I was intrigued to learn of today is that Mr Miles’s speech of 13 February 1997 does not appear in the electronic Hansard. I challenge members to go into ParlInfo and find the speech of the then parliamentary secretary and member for Braddon, Mr Miles. It will not be found. So it seems there has been a little bit of airbrushing here. The government is onto the fact that they have been inconsistent with their approach to the superannuation surcharge, so they have tried to airbrush the former member for Braddon’s speech. But what the Treasurer cannot airbrush is his first budget. He has just done his last budget, but in his first budget he claimed that a superannuation surcharge was necessary in this country to make the superannuation system fair and equitable.They have been exposed at a most sensitive time, when they have introduced in this budget $22 billion worth of tax cuts which are weighted heavily in favour of high-income earners: $6 a week for workers on average incomes in 144 electorates around the country and, of course, up to $65 for us who sit in this place. Now they want to add to the tax cut for parliamentarians by extending to them another tax cut through the abolition of the superannuation surcharge.The Treasurer continues to portray this as a savings measure—a means of promoting savings in this country. He has a funny way of going about it. If he were serious about future funds, if he were serious about savings measures in this country, if he were serious about his Intergenerational report and responding to the very real warnings coming out of that report, he would have done something about it in this budget. The future fund does not do that—it is a tax liabilities offset fund. All it means is that people are going to be taxed more heavily today to pay off the debts of the taxpayers of tomorrow. The point has regularly been made in this place that there is no crisis in the unfunded liabilities in superannuation on behalf of the Commonwealth. Indeed, now that the unfunded schemes, the defined schemes, have been closed down, those liabilities are falling.I am pleased to see the member for Paterson enter the House because he is one of those members who are supporting this unfair package of tax concessions that will disadvantage people in his electorate, giving the average worker there just $6 a week, while he votes and gives himself a $65 tax cut. If the Treasurer was so awash with money—largely because, as a result of the minerals boom, we are enjoying the best terms of trade in 50 years—he could have considered returning the dividend to the people in the form of savings rather than consumption tax cuts. That would have made some sense to me. The future fund does nothing in terms of those issues, but an additional investment in savings in this country could have given working families a boost without boosting consumption, with all the implications that that could have for interest rates in this country. Of course, interest rates are a very important part of this debate. As we already know, following the interest rate rise of 25 basis points in March this year the $6 that goes to the average worker in the member for Paterson’s electorate has already been eroded. For someone with a $200,000 mortgage the additional cost will be $8, which more than erodes the $6 tax cut extended to the member for Paterson’s average income earner. So there were much smarter ways of doing it.I am a tradesman and I am proud to be tradesman, proud to have had my hands dirty and to have worked in small business as a tradesman. Unlike many who sit on the other side, I have a very good understanding of trades, of tradesmen and of the struggle of those working in trades, particularly those who are trying to make an income from their trade as a self-employed tradesperson. I can tell you with great certainty that there are not too many self-employed tradesmen in this country earning more than $60,000 a year. That is the reality. In question time today the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, standing at the dispatch box, wanted us to all scream out with great joy because he was giving a toolbox allowance to apprentices in trades. We think that it is a great idea and an appropriate thing to do if that is what the government thinks is the priority, but we do not think that is the priority. We think there are much bigger issues in the area of skills than giving an apprentice a subsidy for a toolbox. We know the Reserve Bank, among others, has made the point that lack of skills training is proving to be one of those big capacity constraints on the Australian economy which is putting more pressure on interest rates. But the point I make is that not too many self-employed tradesmen or, indeed, tradesmen will be amongst those getting the biggest tax cut out of this budget package.","Second Reading","SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF SURCHARGE) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am sure it was genuine, but I draw to your attention to a second reading amendment circulated in my name which goes directly to the tax cuts in the budget, particularly in the context of the package here, which is the extension of those tax cuts through the superannuation break that the Treasurer is attempting to extend to those same workers.Let me go back to the tradesmen. The fact is that under this tax package the average tradesman will get six bucks. That is the reality. Some tradesmen are fortunate, working in some industries like mining: some will get more. During the debate on tax cuts last week I made the point that the average coalminer in my electorate receives about $95,000 annually. At question time we regularly hear the member for North Sydney calling across the chamber: ‘What about your coalminers? You are denying your coalminers a tax cut.’ We are doing no such thing.The Labor Party are not opposing tax cuts. We believe that a government that is awash with money should return a dividend to working Australians. What we are opposed to is the inequitable nature of the tax cuts. We are happy to give relief to the top end of the scale—we think that they deserve it—but we are certainly happy to give relief to the middle-income and lower income parts of the scale. The reality is that a tradesman working in one of my coalmines for $95,000 will be 93c worse off under Labor’s tax package than he would be under the government’s proposed tax package. I know my coalminers pretty well. I do not think that any of them would complain about giving up 93c on a weekly basis to help one of their mates that they drink with at the Australia Hotel in Cessnock, for example, on a Saturday afternoon—a $12 tax cut rather than a $6 tax cut. I do not know of any of my coalminers who would begrudge giving up 93c.","Second Reading","SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF SURCHARGE) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Around 6.30 pm last Wednesday he graced the chamber with his presence to debate Labor’s amendments to his tax package. You would think that, after 10 years as Treasurer and having had our detailed amendments for seven hours and 45 minutes, he would have had some criticism of our tax package. He might have dissected it, ripped it apart, found the faults and presented them to the chamber. Guess what? He did no such thing. Instead, he came in here and heaped scorn on the opposition for denying people tax cuts. I wonder why he shared with the House not one criticism of Labor’s tax alternative. I have a pretty strong theory on that: he could not find any problems with Labor’s tax package. He could not find any fault with Labor’s low-income and welfare to work tax offset. He could not find any fault with the way in which we changed the thresholds throughout the scales, because they are fair and they are without technical fault. He did not have an argument to put up. For three weeks we have been making the $6, $12 and $65 point: the consequences of the government’s tax package. Not once during question time or during any debate in this place has the Treasurer challenged those figures—not once.We know why that is. Firstly, he cannot; secondly, he knows we are right; and, thirdly, he knows it is true: that is the impact on average income earners in the 144 electorates in this country. He knows that is the case and he knows that Labor’s package is fairer. But we know also that he was not worried about that. He had done the deal with the Prime Minister and they had come to the conclusion that it was time to give their natural constituency a break, and the best time to do that is during the first year of a new parliamentary term. That is what this tax package is about. That is what this surcharge cut is about.I go back to where I began: Labor recognise that there are problems with the superannuation surcharge. We acknowledge that it is hardly the most efficient tax ever imposed by any government, let alone by this government. We are happy to consider fair tax cut proposals, whether they be in direct tax cuts or in terms of a superannuation reform package. But this is no reform package. There is no reform in it at all. If this were a reform package it would be doing something at the lower end to again increase the savings capacity of ordinary Australian workers. The government said that the surcharge is about equality. It was originally about retiring debt, but that is now no longer necessary. The fact is that this surcharge reduction is about one thing and one thing only: taking care of the Prime Minister’s and the Treasurer’s natural constituency. On that basis they stand condemned and on that basis we will be opposing this measure.","Second Reading","SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF SURCHARGE) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

214,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Fawcett, David, MP","DYU","Wakefield","LP","N/A",63,"—I rise to support the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Abolition of Surcharge) Bill 2005. I am fascinated to see that yet again members opposite are going to try to put a roadblock in the way of hardworking Australians getting adequate reward for their labours. I am fascinated also to see that they say that their package stands on such good merit that the government should be responding to it, when in the press releases that they send out the figures do not stack up—they cannot even compare apples with apples. They launch scurrilous personal attacks on people and compare two levels of income—one being the average electorate income for each member—and then they compare the figures that they contest that their tax package would deliver to voters.The figures looked impressive upon my first reading. I thought, ‘How could this be?’ In the fine print at the bottom of the page, where they hoped that nobody would find it, was the fact that their figures were based not on $37,500, which they contended when they looked at the coalition’s tax package, but on $85,000. If their package is so good, why do they need to obscure the facts and use different figures to compare apples with oranges to try to sell their package? In their own words, they are undone.In 2004 the superannuation industry lobby group, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, and the Australian Consumers Association argued that one way to encourage people to put more away towards their retirement nest egg is to reduce tax. The Chief Executive of ASFA, Philippa Smith, said:... the Government needs to be a partner in the savings effort for middle Australia ... Bolder steps and initiatives are still needed to fill the looming savings gap.The Howard government has taken significant steps with measures detailed in this year’s budget. These measures, which include not only the abolition of the superannuation surcharge but also tax cuts for all Australians, have been supported by a broad range of groups, including many of the state Labor premiers. In fact, there is only one significant obstacle to every Australian receiving a tax cut on 1 July this year, and that is the members opposite.With respect to the abolition of the superannuation surcharge, interestingly, some of the criticism from the member for Hunter related to the fact that it was this government that introduced the measure in 1996. ‘Why,’ the opposition argue, ‘does it now want to remove it?’ ‘Doesn’t it show,’ they argue, ‘that this was an unwise measure in the first place?’ There appears to be in some quarters an unrealistic expectation that circumstances never change, that priorities never change and that plans should be perfect and able to be followed without alteration, happily into the future. In my life experience, military analysts are often quoted as saying that battle plans are perfect until the first shot is fired, then victory relies on combat commanders who can adapt to changing conditions. So let us take a little time to look at the contexts of 1996 and 2005.In 1996 the new Howard government faced, among other things, the daunting task of dealing with the $96 billion debt left by the Labor government—a debt that was costing the Australian taxpayer over $5 billion a year. The introduction of the surcharge was one of a number of measures introduced in part to contribute to the long task of paying down Labor debt. It is worth noting at this point that not only has the good economic management of the Howard government paid down this debt by $90 billion but it has boosted spending on health, education and defence, amongst other portfolios, to record levels. So, while the surcharge was not introduced for debt reduction alone, the fact that this debt no longer exists is one more factor allowing the government to now move to abolish the surcharge entirely.With the immediate concern of debt reduction largely dealt with, there are two other areas of longer term concern that this government continues to respond to through a range of measures, including the subject of this bill. One is the ageing of Australia’s population. The other is the shortage of labour and, associated with that, the shortage of a skilled work force. Australia faces an ageing of its population over the next four decades. Twenty-five per cent of Australians will be aged over 65 by 2044-45, which is about twice the present percentage. As I speak with community groups and individuals throughout Wakefield, a common question I am asked pertains to how Australia will afford to look after its elderly into the future. Population ageing of itself should not be seen as the problem, but it will have economic and fiscal impacts that will create significant policy challenges. People over 55 have lower work force participation rates than younger people, and as more people move into older age groups participation rates are expected to drop even further.The Intergenerational report, commissioned by this government, indicates that taxation revenue is expected to follow GDP growth but that government expenditure is likely to rise rapidly, placing budgets under considerable pressure. Education and some welfare payments are projected to increase more slowly than GDP, while government spending on health, aged care and pensions will grow at a faster rate. If the government does nothing, the aggregate fiscal gap will be around 6.4 percentage points of GDP by 2044-45, with an estimated value over the 40 years of around $2,200 billion in 2002-03 dollars. A range of policy measures will be needed to reduce the fiscal pressure from ageing. Measures to raise productivity and participation would enhance income growth and the capacity to pay for the costs of ageing, including through taxation. Measures to encourage savings for retirement will also lesson the burden on the taxpayer into the future. Population ageing can only be conceived of as a crisis if we let it become one.The Howard government response has been broad and consistent in its direction. Over the past few years the government has implemented a number of important measures aimed at improving the superannuation and retirement income arrangements for all Australians. These changes have assisted Australians to build financial self-reliance for their retirement. Initiatives in 2001 increased the attractiveness and accessibility of superannuation. These measures included the introduction of the co-contribution scheme for eligible low-income earners who make voluntary superannuation contributions, and reductions in superannuation surcharge rates. The policy paper entitled ‘A more flexible and adaptable retirement income system’, released in February 2004, outlined further measures to improve the accessibility, flexibility and integrity of the retirement income system and to reduce red tape. This included the removal of work tests for individuals under the age of 65 who wanted to contribute to superannuation.The 2004-05 budget contained incentives to save for retirement worth $2.8 billion over four years and included an expansion of the co-contribution scheme and further reductions in the superannuation surcharge rates. The government has passed legislation to deliver choice of fund and has reconfirmed its commitment to the superannuation contribution splitting policy. In the 2002-03 and 2004-05 budgets the government announced reductions in the superannuation surcharge. Unfortunately, those reductions were opposed in the Senate and the government was only able to secure through the Senate a reduction to 13.5 per cent in 2004-05. The government now proposes, through this bill, to remove this impost on superannuation savings and abolish the surcharge payable on individual surchargeable contributions and relevant termination payments, with effect from 1 July this year. The measure presented in this bill will provide incentives for individuals to make additional voluntary savings through the superannuation system, as well as simplifying the operation of the system.The other area that government is addressing is the issue of work force shortages. These shortages have resulted from strong growth in the economy which has caused a growing demand for labour, both skilled and unskilled. This is true across all the sectors that I speak with in Wakefield. I see signs on power poles in Playford and Salisbury, for example, advertising vacancies right now for unskilled workers to commence work in the poultry sector. Growers in Virginia talk about their inability to obtain unskilled workers to work in their packing sheds. Businesses expanding in the viticulture sector tell me that their No. 1 risk is the inability to secure both skilled and unskilled workers.Employers I have spoken to indicate that they see a number of ways to increase work force availability but that there needs to be more incentive for workers to take up these opportunities. More work is available for many who wish to do overtime, but many workers do not have the incentive to do this, lest they be pushed into the top tax bracket. As stated earlier, there is only one group that is standing in the way of a solution to this. Unless the Labor Party decides to stop blocking the lifting of tax thresholds proposed by this government, not only will these workers and their families miss out but over 800,000 businesses in Australia will be forced to wear the higher costs associated with implementing multiple withholding schedules. Yet again, Labor is showing that it is no friend of small business. Like the changes to the tax thresholds, removing the superannuation surcharge provides another incentive for workers to undertake overtime without the risk of being pushed into another bracket, where additional work does not correspond with appropriate levels of additional reward.The opportunities to upskill are there for many workers, some funded by industry and some funded by the government. But there must be incentive to train. A large part of that is having the confidence that there will be an appropriate increase in reward for the effort put in to obtain the qualifications and for the effort and time spent fulfilling new responsibilities. This government—those on this side of the House—still believes in reward for effort and decries the politics of envy that would seek to cut down the tall poppies that seek to better themselves and their families. Again, the recent tax cuts and this bill are part of the response to this concern. I call on the Labor Party to get out of the way of the tax cuts and the superannuation surcharge relief that the people of Wakefield deserve.People have spoken to me about our tertiary qualified work force, the engineers needed by industry in Edinburgh Parks and Elizabeth West and the medical practitioners needed to support individuals and families in centres in Wakefield such as Riverton, Munno Para, Clare, Salisbury and Gawler. I have been asked many times why so many who train in Australia are no longer working in Australia. The thousands of professionally qualified Australians working overseas are sometimes known as the Australian diaspora. They are there for a variety of reasons, including family, professional development and even life experience. But a recent study by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry shows that the Australian government should focus on opportunities presented by this diverse and talented group whilst also tackling some of the domestic reasons that push them to live and work overseas—things such as our high personal income tax levels and workplace relations over-regulation. The ACCI study found that Australian expatriates tend on average to be highly educated and well skilled. They have strong engagement with the labour market where they are overseas and they are more likely to be employed on a full-time basis in their host country.In a 2002 study of Australian emigration patterns, demographic researchers found that almost 42 per cent of Australian expatriates surveyed held a postgraduate degree compared with around seven per cent of the resident Australian population, with almost 89 per cent employed as professionals and on a full-time basis. According to one of these Hong Kong based expatriates:The solution to the diaspora and retaining talent at home is to drastically reduce the tax rate to return incentives for working, saving and investing in Australia.","Second Reading","SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF SURCHARGE) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

221,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Crean, Simon, MP","DT4","Hotham","ALP","N/A",66,"—I rise to support the second reading amendment to the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Abolition of Surcharge) Bill 2005, moved by the member for Hunter. I do so because it is important that, in the interests of fairness in this country, as we debate this particular bill we put forward what should be the obvious alternative to the course the government has chosen.On the specifics of the bill itself, it is true that Labor opposed the introduction of the superannuation surcharge when it was introduced in 1996. It did this for two reasons. Firstly, it was a broken promise. The government said that it would not introduce any new taxes and charges. It called this a surcharge and tried to pretend it was not a tax. Secondly, in introducing it, no other offsetting savings were introduced at the time to encourage or build upon the great legacy that Labor left this government in the establishment of a national superannuation system for the nation—a compulsory superannuation scheme. We are now opposing the abolition of the surcharge because, on top of the massive tax cuts for the wealthy that were introduced in the budget, this is an unfair measure. In terms of superannuation reform, it is not the appropriate starting point. The truth is that there are far more important tax related issues, including those associated with the tax on superannuation contributions, that need to be addressed.To give some perspective on the unfairness associated with this, just consider this situation: on top of the $65 a week tax cut for an employee on $125,000 a year, this measure represents an additional $27 a week tax cut when nine per cent superannuation contributions are made and $45 a week when 15 per cent superannuation contributions are made. If there is a common thread that has held this government together over the past nine years, it is the continual smash and grab from so many to give to so few. That common thread of greed and unfairness is the very essence of this government. Just recall that, in the 13 years that Labor was in office, we made seven tax cuts. Practically all of them benefitted ordinary wage earners. Some of the amendments benefitted high-income earners as well. We, after all, were the ones that reduced the top marginal tax rate that the Howard-Fraser government left—that of 60c in the dollar—to 47c.Unlike we who took the view that tax reform had to impact on everyone, that is not what this government has embarked upon. Tax reform introduced by this government was the mother of all taxes: the GST. For that, some people got compensation, which was eaten up in less than 12 months. You cannot really count that tax reform. In addition, over the last three years there have been three tax cuts, but the benefit for ordinary wage and salary earners from that has effectively been $10 over three years. There was the $4.40 milkshake and sandwich tax cut, nothing last year if you earnt under $52,000, and only $6 this year, while people who sit on the opposite side—members of parliament—get 10 times that amount. That is the unfairness that is embodied again in the nature of this proposal.I want to focus on a number of key issues that arise from this bill. The first is this. Labor have always been the party for the pensioner. We are now the party for the superannuant, because the biggest advances in superannuation in Australia have only ever occurred under a Labor government. Despite all of the opposition from the coalition between 1983 and 1996, Labor, through the accord, initiated, designed and implemented a true national savings scheme for this country—the most significant intergenerational policy ever implemented in this nation. But in the last nine years there has been no policy initiative by the government to advance the adequacy of superannuation. John Howard and his government have fought workers every inch of the way when it has come to superannuation.The abolition of the superannuation surcharge on top of tax cuts for high-income earners is the wrong priority at the moment. This is a surcharge that should be abolished—a tax that should be abolished. It never should have been introduced in the first place. But there are more pressing priorities before we do that—priorities which left unattended will not only add to the unfairness in this nation, which I have just outlined, but lead to a situation in which we are not investing in the drivers of economic growth and in which we are putting upward pressure on interest rates. So we are suggesting, and the second reading amendment does this, that the government should utilise the revenue generated from the superannuation surcharge to recast their tax cuts along the lines of those put forward by Labor. If they want to cut superannuation taxes, why not cut the contributions tax for everyone, thereby benefiting all workers, not just the top five per cent of workers? This was what Labor proposed in the lead-up to the last election.It is a historic fact that superannuation entitlements for all working people in this country came about because Labor governments recognised the need to address the long-term decline in our national savings as well as the need to provide financial security and peace of mind for people in their retirement. In 1983 what we inherited from the Howard-Fraser government was only 40 per cent of the work force in superannuation. Today, because of Labor’s reforms, and Labor’s reforms alone, that figure is 92 per cent—the vast majority of the work force. Savings, like investment, is the key to long-run economic growth, particularly as it relates to technological change and innovation. During the 1980s and 1990s, Labor responded to the need for greater national savings by introducing a world-class compulsory superannuation system—a system designed to secure a better retirement future for ageing Australians while reducing the intergenerational burden of government funded pensions. That is the very question that the member for Wakefield posed not five minutes ago. But he is not even here to hear the answer, so interested is he in learning the answers to his own questions. I interjected at the time. I am now doing it in accordance with parliamentary procedures, but he ain’t here to hear it. What sort of staying power do these people have?The impact of our changes for the future are that superannuation funds now amount to some $693 billion and they have given more than seven million workers greater security in retirement. You see, Labor did not just address the question of income adequacy whilst in work; we have also been prepared to address the question of income adequacy and economic dignity in retirement. The Prime Minister rabbits on about the so-called cuts to real wages. They did occur between 1983 and 1990, not between 1990 and 1996. The government conveniently ignore those figures when they run on about their real wages growth. Labor started the path to real wages growth with the economic legacy that we left this country. The government have just ridden the wave of it. In addition to that, the price—if you like, the benefit—of some of those real wage cuts was that we introduced superannuation for everyone: nine per cent compulsory superannuation. That is something that the Prime Minister not only never refers to but fought every inch of the way.The Howard government have never understood the concept of superannuation and, at every step, every opportunity, they have taken us backwards. I remind the House about what the Prime Minister, John Howard, said in 1991: ‘Even in better economic conditions, legislated superannuation imposts are wrong in principle.’ He does not believe in the great intergenerational policy change that Labor implemented for this country. I say to the government: if they do not believe in it, let them get out of the way; let them give Labor the opportunity to implement again the very mechanism that is going to provide the basis for economic dignity in this country.By 1996, the revolution in superannuation was so successful that John Howard went to the 1996 elections promising not to interfere with it and promising to implement the co-contribution. But he did touch it. He abolished it in the very first budget. Labor should have known and should have legislated that co-contribution so the Howard government could not get their grubby little hands on it, because what did they do? They converted the savings into a savings strategy that lasted all of six weeks. They abolished it within six weeks and that money in turn went to fund the private health insurance rebate. They shifted from savings to health. They shifted from a scheme that benefited all workers to one for only those who could afford private health insurance.As I have said many times, budgets are about choices. This government are making the wrong choices in terms of the future of this country. The first opportunity they had they abandoned that contribution which by now, if they had honoured it or if Labor had legislated to introduce it instead of relying on the Prime Minister’s word that he would keep it, would have seen compulsory superannuation not at nine per cent where it is but at 15 per cent. If that policy had been continued it would have delivered an additional $9 billion a year into the superannuation system.What does that mean? Back in 1995 for a person in their thirties on average weekly earnings that meant an extra return in real terms of $100,000. In the context of an accumulation account that is massive. That is what Labor’s policy would have done. Obviously it would be a lot more today and more again for young workers. That is the answer to the member for Wakefield’s question. That answers the question of how you lift adequacy. It is what decent policy does. We had bipartisanship on it but it only lasted as long as it took Howard to get elected. He then scrapped the promise. I make the point again: what sort of a friend of the workers is John Howard really? He comes into this place and says that he is the friend of the workers but he has fought them every inch of the way.","Second Reading","SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF SURCHARGE) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

223,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Crean, Simon, MP","DT4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—Budgets are about choices—I have made that point. Do not let us have any of this nonsense by the Prime Minister that he has got the interests of working people at heart. If he had their interests at heart he would have continued the plan that Labor had in place and not be undermining those conditions. Not only has he undermined our superannuation system, the Prime Minister is now gearing up for a full frontal assault with his industrial relations reform.The Treasurer’s big contribution to savings in this country was that savings rebate that I talked about before. It lasted all of six weeks and then ended up funding private health insurance. The government constantly undermine superannuation with ham-fisted, ad hoc measures that threaten our premier savings vehicle. In addition to abandoning the co-contribution they introduced this tax, which they now want to abolish, and they introduced a notion, a half-baked idea, to allow low-income earners to opt out of the superannuation guarantee. It is a pale imitation of Labor’s original co-contribution scheme—a voluntary, low-income earners co-contribution. Voluntary? How can people on such low incomes afford that contribution? Rather than benefiting low-income earners, anecdotal evidence shows that it is overwhelmingly benefiting wealthier taxpayers who are allocating superannuation funds for a low-income partner or offspring. The circumstances were that government even had to change the definition of the policy to allow this, because the uptake of the original proposal was so pathetic. The government’s direction is clear: they do not support the concept of compulsory superannuation. They cannot therefore be said to be supporters of the national savings of the country. The Howard government have never understood the importance of building on the vision they inherited. Rather than shape it to their own form, they have been intent on dismantling it.The government have also failed to provide Australia with a comprehensive retirement incomes policy. They have made the superannuation system more costly and complicated, ultimately contributing to the public’s current lack of faith in it. More importantly, this lack of commitment and policy has meant that this government has not continued to address the issue of the ageing population. I remember, because I was shadow treasurer at the time, that the Treasurer was asked, after his 2000 budget, what the next big issue on the agenda was. He said with that stupid smirk, ‘Ah, it starts with an “s”.’ When he was asked to elaborate, according to journalist Paul Cleary in the Australian Financial Review of Saturday 29 July, Mr Costello suggested perhaps ‘another Treasurer might undertake these reforms’. In other words he could not even say the word and he said that a future Treasurer would have to be the one that did something serious about superannuation.He is dead right. The only way we will get advances in superannuation in this country again is under a Labor government. Certainly his next agenda in this field started with ‘s’—it is silence. We have heard nothing from him about advancing superannuation in this country. Labor did introduce a strong national savings scheme and we will ensure that it continues despite all the efforts of the government to distort the benefits towards the wealthy at the expense of those in genuine need.We are alarmed at the administrative burden that the government’s obsession with choice of fund will impose. My colleague the member for Watson will be addressing this in relation to further legislation, and I will leave that to him. For 900,000 employers this system that they have introduced will mean a massive new compliance burden requiring some 34 complex steps. So much for cutting red tape, the other great broken promise of this government! They have swamped small business with it, as they did with the GST.The great irony is this: the government talks about choice of super funds but it will not, under its new industrial relations legislation, allow workers the choice of negotiating superannuation and including it in the awards. They are going to remove it as one of the allowable matters—what hypocrisy! They talk choice as if it is a great Australian virtue but, in the great revolution in this country on retirement incomes, not only have they done nothing about it, they have also denied workers the right to negotiate it and include it in their awards. What nonsense, what backwardness—what sort of a vision is this? This is steeped in the Prime Minister’s obsession with the past—an obsession which aims to ensure that trade unions do not develop superannuation and an obsession that says the funds themselves should then be dismantled. That is what they are about—they have done nothing to back it.I make the point that this was a budget of lost opportunities in many ways. But this particular measure, as part of a comprehensive approach to superannuation, retirement incomes and adequacy would have great merit in this country. We would support it in that context, because we never introduced this tax. But what we are saying is that it is not the appropriate vehicle for reform at the moment because too much remains to be done in terms of lifting adequacy. That path was started by a Labor government, it will only be continued by a future Labor government, and the sooner we get the opportunity to do it the better off Australians will be in their retirement.

224,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Washer, Dr Mal, MP","84F","Moore","LP","N/A",71,"—The Superannuation Laws Amendment (Abolition of Surcharge) Bill 2005 abolishes the surcharge payable on individuals’ surchargeable contributions and relevant termination payments, effective from 1 July 2005. The surcharge applied when an individual’s assessable income and superannuation contribution exceeded $70,000. The surcharge was imposed at the rate of one per cent for each $1,000 of assessable income and superannuation contributions, to a maximum of 15 per cent when assessable income for surcharge purposes reached $85,000 per annum. These income thresholds have been indexed since that time and now stand at $99,710 and $121,075 respectively. Income for surcharge purposes includes not only superannuation contributions but also salary and wages, fringe benefits and superannuation lump sums paid to individuals.The superannuation surcharge has been unpopular for many reasons. It is complex and costly to administer and collect. Its collection costs are carried by all fund members, most of whom do not have a surcharge deducted from their contributions. It applies to low-income earners if the value of their superannuation lump sum payment on retirement means that their annual income for surcharge purposes in the income year in which they received the lump sum payment is above the surcharge thresholds. It is especially difficult to determine the amount of surcharge paid by defined benefit fund members, because the value of their deductible contribution—that is, their employer’s notional contribution—is difficult to calculate. While the surcharge applying to accumulation fund members is paid in the year after the liability occurred, defined benefit fund members pay any surcharge liability out of the benefits paid, via either pension or lump sum, when they finally retire.This bill will mean approximately 640,000 taxpayers will no longer be subject to surcharges on contributions and termination payments made or received from 1 July 2005. Many of these 640,000 spent the majority of their working lives in the decades before the implementation of compulsory superannuation payments. These individuals need as much incentive as possible to make additional voluntary savings through the superannuation system.Superannuation is a long-term savings system designed to provide income in retirement. It first commenced in Australia around 1850. These early funds were mostly established by banks and large private companies, such as insurance companies and financial institutions. Some public sector superannuation funds were established, such as the Police Superannuation and Reward Fund in 1862. At that stage, superannuation was regarded as a managerial gratuity because members were predominately managers and white-collar workers. Most employees had to rely on their personal savings to fund their retirement. If there were no personal savings, they had to satisfy the strict qualifying tests for age pensions provided by some state governments in the 1890s and the Commonwealth government from 1909.Selective vesting rules in Australia were common at this time and restricted superannuation benefits to a select few. Early vesting did not catch on in Australia, unlike in the United States and the United Kingdom, where enhanced retirement benefits were used to quell industrial unrest. For the first 130 years, there was little change in the way the superannuation system operated. In the 1950s, superannuation spread to more of the work force, although it was still mainly for permanent, generally male, staff and was seen more as a reward for long and dedicated service. Private sector employers started to set up their own company administered funds or paid contributions into a life office administered fund. During the 1960s, superannuation became more popular when the tax treatment of contributions to funds became more generous for the self-employed. However large sectors of the work force still did not receive superannuation.In 1974, only 32 per cent of employees were covered by superannuation. During the 1970s, combination funds—now referred to as hybrid funds—emerged. These plans had a dual benefit structure, with the employers’ benefits placed in the defined benefit section and the employees contributions plus investment earnings in the defined contribution section. This way, the advantages of both fund designs could be obtained. During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s a series of government inquiries into the superannuation sector set the scene for superannuation in Australia to change.In 1986 there was a major change, with the inclusion of compulsory super in industrial awards. A three per cent wage productivity increase was put through superannuation rather than a direct wage increase. Guidelines were also introduced requiring that contributions were fully vested in the member and preserved in a super fund until retirement. This encouraged the growth of defined contribution funds and immediate vesting of benefits. In 1983 the total value of assets invested by Australian superannuation funds was $32 billion. In 1991 the total had increased to $135 billion.With an increasingly large ageing population that would need to be supported in retirement, award super would not have grown fast enough in terms of contribution levels and coverage. Therefore, in 1992 compulsory super for all employees was introduced, with the objective of improving total retirement income in a way that taxpayers could afford. Prior to this time, Australia was one of the very few developed nations that did not have a national employment related retirement income plan. A non-tax deductible levy was imposed on employers who did not abide by the superannuation contribution rates for employees. The superannuation guarantee charge commenced on 1 July 1992, starting at three per cent of employee earnings and progressively increasing to nine per cent by 2002. That resulted in 92 per cent of the Australian work force being covered by superannuation. In 1996 the superannuation surcharge was introduced to help correct the deep $10.3 billion deficit left by the Labor government.The superannuation system then became more attractive in 2001 with the policy statement A Better Superannuation System. This enhanced the system by the introduction of the co-contribution scheme for eligible low-income earners who made voluntary superannuation contributions. In the 2002-03 budget, the government announced that the superannuation surcharge would be reduced at the rate of 1½ per cent per annum so that it would be reduced to 10½ per cent by the 2004-05 financial year. However, this proposal was blocked by the Senate and the government was only able to secure a reduction to 13½ per cent in 2004-05.Not to be deterred, the government then announced in the 2004-05 budget reductions to the surcharge at the rate of 2½ per cent per annum to 12½ per cent in 2004-05, reducing to 7½ per cent in the 2006-07 financial year. Once again, opposition from the Labor Party in the Senate blocked this proposal. In February 2004 the policy paper A more flexible and adaptable retirement income system was released. This contained further measures to improve the flexibility, accessibility and integrity of the system and also to reduce red tape. It included the removal of work tests for individuals under the age of 65 who wanted to contribute to superannuation.That history of superannuation changes brings us to today. After 10 budgets and eight surpluses the superannuation surcharge is no longer necessary to keep the budget in balance. As you are all probably aware, the projections are for a doubling of the population over 65 to around 25 per cent of the total population over the next 40 years. It is far better to enable people to contribute to their health and retirement costs. Therefore, we need to provide as much incentive as possible for people to contribute additional voluntary savings into the superannuation system.There is disparity between men and women in both the incidence of having superannuation and the average balance of accounts. There is not much difference between men and women up to the age of 25. But, by around age 60, there is a 15 percentage point difference between men and women in the incidence of having superannuation, and the balance of women’s super at the time of retirement is around half that of men.There are a couple of factors at work. Younger women have the benefit of compulsory superannuation contributions for most of their working life, while older women have had access to employment-linked superannuation contributions for only part of their working life. Superannuation outcomes for many older women will have been affected by time out of the labour force, in order to raise children or to undertake other family responsibilities.Women aged over 55 who have returned to relatively well paid jobs in the labour force have a lot of catching up to do. Even though more men than women pay the superannuation surcharge, it is of particular disadvantage for women aged over 55. At this stage, many women are earning reasonable salaries, have their children off their hands and can afford to top up their contributions.Over the history of changes, this government has been committed to assisting Australians in building finances for their retirement. This bill not only provides further incentives for individuals to make additional voluntary savings through the system but also simplifies the operation of the superannuation system. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia has calculated that the abolition of the superannuation surcharge will benefit over one million Australians. I commend this bill to the House.","Second Reading","SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF SURCHARGE) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
225,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Emerson, Craig, MP","83V","Rankin","ALP","N/A",73,"—Who said, ‘Truth is absolute, truth is supreme, truth is never disposable in national political life?’ Who said, ‘A coalition government will provide in full the funds earmarked in the 1995-96 budget to match compulsory employee contributions according to the proposed schedule’? The answer in both cases is John Howard. It is a matter of record that one of the first acts of the incoming coalition government was to, in fact, renege on that ironclad commitment that the Prime Minister had made and, in doing so, to commit one of the greatest acts of vandalism in Australia’s economic and social history.A superannuation system had already been legislated and funded, whereby nine per cent was to be obtained from employers over a period, another three per cent from employees and a co-contribution of three per cent from the Commonwealth of Australia. That totals 15 per cent, and if those measures that had been legislated by the previous Labor government had not been wiped out—abolished—then Australians by now would be enjoying superannuation contributions of 15 per cent: nine per cent from employers, three per cent from employees and three per cent from the Commonwealth.But the government abolished that plan, Labor’s plan to get compulsory superannuation up to 15 per cent, and now we are debating another measure that the government introduced around the time. We are debating now the abolition of the superannuation tax surcharge that was introduced in 1997 because the government said it needed to be more equitable in the range of spending cuts it was implementing and it therefore wanted to take some pain from higher income earners.At that time, Labor said it opposed the introduction of that surcharge for one clear reason, and that was that the government, in another commitment pre 1996, had said—this is again the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, as opposition leader—that there would be no new taxes and no increases in taxes in the first term of a Howard government. The introduction of the superannuation tax surcharge violated that pre-election commitment, and the Australian Labor Party held the government to account on that by opposing the introduction of the superannuation tax surcharge.The measure before us—that is, the abolition of the surcharge—involves in the order of $2.5 billion. In the circumstances confronting Australia in 2005 and in the context of the income tax cuts that the government introduced in the 2005-06 budget, Labor does not consider the abolition of the superannuation tax surcharge to be a fair measure. The reason for our opposition is that, if you combine the income tax cuts for those on incomes above, say, $100,000 with the abolition of the superannuation tax surcharge, the outcome could be tax cuts not of $65 a week—which we have quoted as being the value of the tax cuts alone—but tax cuts of anywhere up to $110 a week. Labor does not consider that to be a fair proposal at a time when higher income earners would be getting this double benefit of a personal income tax cut of $65 a week and the abolition of the superannuation tax surcharge and low- and middle-income earners are to be content with a $6 a week sandwich and milkshake tax cut. That is why Labor opposes these measures, including the abolition of the superannuation tax surcharge. Labor has a different view of fairness in this country.As I was sitting here listening to the Treasurer deliver the budget, I noticed that when he announced the tax cuts at the high-income end, every coalition member understood precisely what that meant for them—that is, a very substantial tax cut of $65 a week. The cheers got even louder when the Treasurer announced that he would be abolishing the superannuation tax surcharge, because that meant more money in the pockets of members of parliaments—paid for, I must say, by the operation of bracket creep on low- and middle-income earners. Earlier today I pointed out that a range of occupations, including receptionists, hairdressers, sales assistants and farm hands—in the context of a very bad drought—would be getting tax cuts in the order of only $6 a week. They got no cuts at all last year because the tax cuts were restricted to those earning more than $1,000 a week and they got a $4 a week sandwich and milkshake tax cut in 2003. One then has to go back to the year 2000 to find the earlier tax cut, which was in fact a partial compensation for the introduction of a $36 billion goods and services tax.The history of tax cuts under this government for the forgotten people is a very sorry one, and is compounded by the most recent budget. The effect of the government being unwilling to provide any significant tax cut for low- and middle-income earners is that bracket creep will be taking more from them than the tax cut gives to them. Not for one day or $1 will the forgotten people be ahead, not even in the coming financial year. Bracket creep for them, according to the budget forecasts and their earnings as revealed in the Australian Bureau of Statistics surveys, is such that the $6 a week tax cut is smaller. So they do not get a genuine tax cut not for one day or for $1. So, on equity grounds, we consider the proposal before the parliament to be unsatisfactory, and that is why we are opposing it.I will move now to the more fundamental question of superannuation in this country. Why is it that the coalition has such difficulty in supporting superannuation for the working men and women of this country? Prior to the Hawke and Keating Labor governments and the introduction of compulsory superannuation in the mid-1980s, superannuation was the preserve of the privileged. But, in a farsighted set of policy decisions, the Hawke and Keating governments introduced compulsory superannuation for working people through the award and, through that, the development of industry funds.Those industry funds, interestingly, have performed very well. They have low fees and charges and, over time, they have proven to have performed very well for the working people of this country in the investment returns that they have been able to achieve. But, for purely ideological reasons—because these are industry funds and trade unions are associated with them—the government has felt very hostile towards them. This hostility goes right back to the mid-1980s when the coalition opposed root and branch Labor’s attempts to introduce superannuation measures. It opposed those measures in the House of Representatives and the Senate, but fortunately we were able to get those changes through. The consequence of those dramatic reforms has been that superannuation funds now have assets of well in excess of $600 billion.Back in the early 1980s, one of our greatest problems was national savings. Labor in government created a massive national savings pool of, as I say, more than $600 billion now. And here we are back to a situation where national savings rates in Australia are very poor yet again. One of the reasons for that is that this government has favoured consumption over savings and has not supported compulsory superannuation in Australia. That has meant that the savings rates are very low. It would be terrific if the government were more serious about supporting superannuation in Australia.In 2002 the Treasurer introduced into parliament through the budget processes the Intergenerational report. It was a valuable document because it drew the attention of policy makers and the Australian people to the economic challenges of having an ageing population. The Intergenerational report and subsequent work by the Productivity Commission project that in the decade from the year 2020 our growth rate per person will be half that of the early 2000s. That is a consequence of two insidious forces operating in Australia. One is the ageing of the population, and on this matter I do agree with the Treasurer when he says that demography is destiny. There is not a lot we can do about the ageing of the population because the die is cast.The other force is faltering productivity growth. Through far-sighted economic reform measures implemented by the Hawke and Keating governments, Australia was able to achieve a sustained period of strong productivity growth that provided the foundation for very large improvements in prosperity in this country. You would think the Howard government, upon coming to office, instead of coasting on that productivity growth, would continue a reform program, including a superannuation program, to ensure that there were adequate national savings and, more generally, to ensure that productivity growth was able to be maintained at very high levels, because we know that today’s productivity growth is tomorrow’s prosperity.But instead of doing that this reform-lazy government, in a most vandalistic fashion, reneged on a commitment that the Prime Minister had given before the 1996 election to ‘provide in full the funds earmarked in the 1995-96 budget to match compulsory employee contributions according to the schedule’ that had been set out in the previous budget. So the signs were very bad for Australia when this government came to office, because one of the greatest reforms that Australia could have—that is, the spreading of superannuation through the Australian work force and the generation of a massive pool of national savings—was being undermined by one of the first decisions of the incoming coalition government.Fast forward now to 2005, and here we have the legacy of a reform-lazy government where our national savings effort is nowhere near up to scratch. One consequence of that, of course, is increasing current account deficits, and even today figures have been released showing that the current account deficit is 7.25 per cent of GDP. In 1986, when Paul Keating warned of the dangers of Australia becoming a banana republic, the current account deficit was a much smaller share of GDP. This government seems completely unconcerned about having a current account deficit 7¼ per cent of GDP. It says that salvation is just around the corner—‘Don’t you worry about that!’ in the immortal words of the late Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. It says that we are going to be rescued by high mineral prices. It has really been saying that since around the year 2000. The budget forecasts for export volumes have consistently been underachieved by very large amounts. We had government ministers in the parliament today saying, ‘Look, things were set to improve but we have this terrible drought now, so things may not improve on the current account to the extent that we would have hoped.’So we are now saddled with the problem of inadequate national savings and of large current account deficits, and those current account deficits are consistently feeding into record foreign debt. Back in 1995 Mr Costello and Mr Howard, who were then in opposition, said when they launched their debt truck that they would follow policies to bring down the foreign debt. Bring down the foreign debt? At that time it was $180 billion and now it is $425 billion. Far from bringing down the foreign debt, this government has presided over a more than doubling of Australia’s foreign debt because of the large current account deficits, because of the persistent trade deficits—41 trade deficits in a row—and because of this government’s lack of a national savings strategy.The only contribution that I can think of it making to a savings strategy was the ill-fated savings bonus. Members might recall the Prime Minister being asked whether he would claim that savings bonus that the government had introduced in a prior budget. He said he would not, and the rest is history. That particular measure was scrapped just a few weeks after it was introduced. This government has failed very badly to ensure that we have a pool of national savings to deal with the economic challenges of an ageing population.Today we have a debate about the abolition of the superannuation tax surcharge, and that abolition is designed to achieve one thing and one thing only—and that is, the ascendancy of the Treasurer to the prime ministership. He has the backing of his entire party room for that measure because they know what the personal consequences of that are. But, in terms of the economic consequences, this budget does nothing of any significance to improve our national savings effort. It yet again favours consumption over investment; it favours consumption over savings. It has increased the spending spree that Labor complained about before the last election from $66 billion to $103 billion. If a $66 billion spending spree was going to put upward pressure on interest rates—which it did, resulting in the Reserve Bank increasing interest rates in March by a quarter of one per cent—then certainly a $103 billion spending spree can only add to the risk of further interest rate rises.Indeed, BIS Shrapnel, in conducting some economic forecasts, has suggested that mortgage interest rates could reach nine per cent in the not too distant future. I certainly hope that does not happen, because nine per cent mortgage interest rates would flatten the Australian economy. The truth is that previous economic recessions have been caused by the Reserve Bank increasing interest rates by too little and too late.The government, through the budget that it brought down a couple of weeks ago—including this measure—has only increased the risk of further increases in mortgage interest rates and the flattening of the Australian economy. Instead of investing the proceeds of the record terms of trade—the benefits have come to Australia via large mining company profits that are then being taxed—the government is using that money to fund the abolition of the superannuation tax surcharge and the provision of income tax cuts for people on higher incomes.These proceeds from the best terms of trade in 50 years should be used to achieve a better savings result for Australia—because that is what we are debating tonight: a savings policy for Australia. The government has not done that. Some of that money could have been spent fairly on income tax cuts and on investing in the nation’s future through extra investment in education, innovation and infrastructure. On all those counts, the government has failed. Instead it has brought down what is effectively a pre-election budget a year after an election for reasons best known to the Treasurer. Those reasons have more to do with the aspirations of the Treasurer of Australia to become the Prime Minister of Australia than they do with the legitimate aspirations of the Australian people for future increases in prosperity and living standards.The government’s budget, including the measures that we are debating tonight, is a very short-sighted document. It has no vision for the future. It does not invest in Australia’s future; yet, at the same time, it increases the risk of further interest rises in the future. It would be quite difficult to imagine a more unfair budget or a more economically irresponsible budget. Mr Deputy Speaker, if it does come to pass that interest rates do rise later in the year—and I do hope that they do not, because the Australian people and the Australian economy cannot afford it—let it be known that the Australian Labor Party opposed this government’s budget, not only on equity grounds but also on economic grounds.","Second Reading","SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF SURCHARGE) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
226,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Brough, Mal, MP","2K6","Longman","LP","Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer",77,"—I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Abolition of Surcharge) Bill 2005. The bill represents a further significant step in improving the superannuation and retirement income arrangements for all Australians. It is only one step in many that this government has undertaken since it came to government in order to maximise the retirement incomes of retiring Australians and, in doing so, give them the quality of life that they both deserve and would want to enjoy in their retirement years.The government believes richly in incentives. It has delivered incentives through the co-contribution scheme and through this legislation by providing the most tax effective investment that anyone can utilise for their retirement—that is, superannuation. It is very important for Australia that individual Australians save for their future so that they can obtain the highest possible living standards and so that the drawdown on the budget as we age as a population is minimised.The surcharge, as everyone in this House knows, was introduced in 1996 when the Liberal-National Party was brought to power after the demise of the Keating government. It was not until after the election in March 1996 that the true position of Australia’s financial position, the government’s financial position, was known. What has become known as ‘Beazley’s black hole’—some $10 billion—was the legacy left to us by the previous Labor regime.The then Howard-Fischer government and now the Howard-Anderson government took unprecedented steps to ensure that a sound financial basis underpinned this nation and, in doing so, put down the footings that would lead to the prosperity that this nation is now enjoying, with record numbers of people in jobs, record levels of wages growth, low inflation, housing ownership up, share ownership up, and people feeling that they have a secure future. One measure by which that has been achieved has been the implementation of the super surcharge. It was done to raise additional revenue so that we could plug Beazley’s black hole.It is extraordinary that nearly 10 years later the member for Brand is still, in Labor’s eyes, the best they have to throw up as an alternative Prime Minister. This is the person who, as the finance minister in the Labor regime under Keating, plummeted us into such a position. As a nation we found out that $10,000 million was the hole in the budget for one single year. Some $96 billion was the legacy left to this government and, more importantly, to the taxpayers of this nation over the coming years.The government has taken measures to get us back into a position of security where the public debt in this country is at acceptable levels. As a result of the budget which has just been brought down, which contains the measure for the removal of the surcharge, the federal government has reduced public sector debt to just $6 billion from the high of $96 billion. That was the reason the surcharge was brought in. Today we are debating how we can remove it, given that the Treasurer announced on budget night that that was the government’s clear policy.Today the federal budget is in a solid financial position with more than one per cent of GDP in the surplus, not only this year but also in the out years. It gives some comfort to know that we can maintain our AAA credit rating, because that keeps downward pressure on the interest that the nation bears and on interest rates generally. By doing this, we have been able to achieve the removal of an impost of some $2.5 billion from 600,000 taxpayers.In simple terms, that means that 600,000 taxpayers will have larger retirement incomes. They will also have greater incentive to save more of the tax cuts that will come on 1 July, or shortly thereafter if the Labor Party continues to stymie our efforts to bring them in—but be assured that every Australian taxpayer will have their tax cuts on 1 July or very shortly thereafter. Eligible Australians will take the option to use the government’s co-contribution to maximise their savings incomes and get the $1.50 for every dollar they put in. As to higher income earners, I remember the fellow on the tarmac at the airport who wanted to get a message to the Treasurer about how pleased he was, as were his 50 co-workers, that this was being abolished. They can now make a choice—a choice which is theirs to make, not the government’s—to put some of those tax cuts into their retirement incomes, get the tax effectiveness from them and build a more sound and secure retirement for them and their families.This bill complements a significant boost to superannuation savings announced last year. The government expanded the very successful co-contribution, where once it was dollar for dollar and some 500,000 Australians earning under $40,000 took up the option in its first year of operation. That was a wonderful achievement. The member for Groom, from the Toowoomba region in Queensland, had over 7,000 constituents make a contribution and receive a dollar for each dollar of contribution. That is an extraordinary percentage for any one electorate. In my own electorate it was over 5,000. I am very pleased that people took that opportunity.I encourage everybody in this place to go out in the next month—30 days; that is what we have left—and encourage Australians to get their slice of the co-contribution. Encourage people earning under $58,000 to put a little something away for the future. Put a down payment on the tax cuts that are coming in now and the Howard government will match that with $1.50 for every dollar that you contribute. It is only through these measures and through responsible government that we have been able to remove the $2.3 billion impost in the super surcharge, increase the benefits of the co-contribution and make more flexible the superannuation arrangements for many Australians who wish to remain in the work force part-time and draw down on their superannuation as they grow older.It comes as no surprise to me that the Labor Party will oppose this bill tonight. They have opposed the tax cuts. With the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2005, which we debated directly before this bill, they stand ready to ensure that, as a result of the tax cuts being rejected, some older Australians will pay a Medicare levy that they otherwise would not have to. Now they are saying to 600,000 Australians: you do not deserve to have the superannuation surcharge removed even though the country is now on a sound financial footing and you should continue to have that impost placed upon you when it is no longer required.It is a sad position for Labor Party. It is a position which is inconsistent in all but one manner: the Labor Party opposed the introduction of the super surcharge, they opposed the reduction in the super surcharge and they are opposing the abolition of the super surcharge. That is consistency—three different positions, but at least they consistently oppose. If oppositions, both state and federal, could learn something of what the public feels these days it would be: don’t oppose for opposition’s sake. I am afraid that is what we are seeing here tonight. We have seen many bills put forward by the government being opposed by the Labor Party in recent times.Quite simply, Labor’s recent record on superannuation lacks any semblance of credibility. It is far removed from the Labor Party that introduced the superannuation guarantee. It is a party that went to the last election not only promising to put taxes up for some Australians and to take away the family tax benefit for all Australians but also, unbelievably, to rip $3.8 billion, according to their own documentation, out of retirement incomes of Australians by removing the very popular co-contribution. On top of the $2.5 billion, $3.8 billion simply says that the party that once trumpeted superannuation as being important to this nation has run away from this as a policy initiative which can do many good things for the individual and for the nation as a whole.The abolition of this surcharge will simplify the operation of the superannuation system, and I know it will be welcomed by superannuation funds, businesses and the ATO alike. It will boost the superannuation savings of affected individuals and provide incentives for individuals to make additional voluntary superannuation savings as and when they can. It also builds on previous changes introduced by this government aimed at assisting Australians to achieve greater financial self-reliance for their retirement. I not only commend this bill to the House but I say to the Labor Party: remove yourselves from the shackles that have so hindered your capacity to move away from this ideologically driven position of wedge politics and envy politics. Acknowledge that the previous Labor government left a terrible legacy to Australia in the form of debt. With that shackle now removed from Australia we know, in good faith and with assurance, that we can remove the superannuation surcharge once and for all. I commend the bill to House.","Second Reading","SUPERANNUATION LAWS AMENDMENT (ABOLITION OF SURCHARGE) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

230,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP","8K6","Hunter","ALP","N/A",80,"—The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer must be very pleased I moved that second reading amendment on the previous bill, the Superannuation Laws Amendment (Abolition of Surcharge) Bill 2005, in order to give him something to talk about as he tried to sum up debate on a bill which I think was entirely unjustifiable for all the points I made throughout the course of that second reading debate. So to assist the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer on this bill, the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005, I shall now move an amendment to this bill as well:That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:condemns the Government for the poorly designed choice of superannuation fund regime which is too complex and unsafe; andcalls on the Government to:exempt small business—20 employees or less from this new red tape burden;remove the two year gaol term and the $22,000 fine on employers if they provide advice to their employees; andkeep the Superannuation Holding Accounts Reserve Account open”.You have to ask yourself what this government has against small business. The bill we are debating tonight amends a bill which was passed a year or so ago and does not come into effect until 1 July 2005. I made the point in earlier debates that the minister who was just at the dispatch box, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, is becoming a serial offender in messing up these legislative programs. Here we have a bill not yet implemented that we are amending in this House tonight and the opposition will be supporting most of the amendments to the extent that they are designed to reduce the burden of the superannuation choice regime on small business. So we are more than happy to help the government out in this regard but what we will also be submitting to the House is that these amendments are not enough because the superannuation choice regime imposes such a burden on small business that no amendments short of repealing the original bill could hope to redress the situation. So what does the government have against small business? Why are they imposing this additional burden on Australia’s more than one million small businesses and the more than three million employees they pay on a weekly basis?This arose from a 1996 election promise and the Labor Party have justifiably been running interference on this proposal ever since. They went to the 1996 election promising a number of other things. Firstly, one was no new taxes—and we have just had the debate on the superannuation surcharge. In the first budget of the Howard government we had a surcharge which of course was effectively a new tax, and that is why we opposed that provision. Secondly, they promised small business a 50 per cent reduction in red tape. What a laughable matter that has become in the intervening 10 years or so. I should say that it would be laughable if it were not so serious. So we had the Bell committee, the Prosser committee, the Reid committee and the Baird committee along the way and where has red tape gone? It has gone north. There has been no greater contributor to that northward shift in the red tape burden on small business than the introduction of the goods and services tax.The government do not want to talk about the GST anymore. They would have us believe that all is rosy out there with respect to the GST. I have been prepared to concede in this place on a number of occasions that I think some form of consumption tax in this country was inevitable and, as the government well know, the Labor Party had a go at that itself. But it is all in the implementation, and there is no doubt that the compliance burden of the GST on small business has been even worse than small business could ever have imagined. We have a report put out by the Australian Taxation Office last week that indicates the extent to which small business is behind in remittance of their GST payments to the government.So this government has been a serial offender in this matter. It says it is about choice. But it is not about choice when it comes to the Trade Practices Act. The government refuses to move to give additional protection to the small business community under the Trade Practices Act post-Bell in cases like Rural Press and the inadequacy it has left in section 46 of the Trade Practices Act. This is not about choice in any case. This is ideologically driven. This bill is simply about the government’s concern about any influence the union movement might have over some $700 billion that we now have invested in superannuation funds in this country. That is what the bill is about.I remind the House that, prior to the Hawke and Keating governments, superannuation was a privilege extended in this country only to public servants and those on high incomes. We also had a national savings problem in this country. The Hawke and Keating governments addressed both of these big issues in one fell swoop by introducing for the first time in this country access to superannuation for all Australian workers, not just for a select few. That has had an enormous effect on the economic and social wellbeing of individual workers and working families in this country. With $700 billion under investment, that has also done much for national savings, a challenge which still lies before us with the inadequacies of the nine per cent contribution to superannuation. Despite those inadequacies, the government is not prepared to take on that issue. With the Intergenerational Report and all the Chicken Little predictions that came out of that report, we were entitled to expect that the government would have sought to address some of those issues in its 2005-06 budget but, alas, they chose not to do so. We got a future fund which is no more than a tax liabilities offset fund bringing forward the future obligations of taxpayers to current taxpayers, which means more tax for current taxpayers, but nothing which will address Labor’s core concern coming out of the Intergenerational Report—that is, the inadequacies of our savings pool in this country.If the government wanted to do something about that in the budget, they could have delivered tax cuts in the form of savings rather than consumption, which would have gone a long way to addressing the issue of returning a dividend to the Australian taxpayer at a time when the government are awash with money, rather than putting that money straight into consumption with all the implications that might have for interest rates in this country. Instead what did the government choose to do? They chose to deliver a $22 billion tax cut package which, as we know, was targeted at the higher income ranges in this country—$65 a week for those who sit in this place and on average $6 a week for those workers on the average wage in the 144 electorates represented in this place.That is a bit of the history of this bill. It seeks to amend a bill which has not yet been implemented for all the reasons that Labor pointed out when the original bill was debated in this place—a bill which was ideologically driven which was going to produce an inappropriate impost on business, particularly small business. The government’s concern in relation to super funds which may have a union influence in this country is totally beyond my understanding, given the performance of those funds and the contribution they have made to the economic infrastructure of this country. This bill amends the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2004, which was passed by the parliament some time ago. Specifically, this bill contans amendments to (1) close the government holding account for unpaid employer super guarantee contributions on 30 June 2006, (2) remove the obligation on employers already providing choice to employees to provide the standard choice-of-fund form to existing employees, (3) prohibit the employer from recouping part or all of the administrative costs associated with implementing choice of fund by charging employees, and (4) make ASIC responsible for enforcement of third-line forcing provisions and some other minor amendments.It intrigues me to hear the government expressing concern about the potential for third-line forcing under super choice when in another bill, which is apparently stalled in the Senate, it talks about relaxing third-line forcing provisions. That is a not insignificant change in the Trade Practices Act and will have significant implications for the small business sector. We have seen that very recently with the attempt by Coles to force certain marketing arrangements upon their suppliers. The government says that in some cases third-line forcing can prove a competitive market. But they have thrown the baby out with the bathwater. If someone wants to engage in activities that come under the definition of third-line forcing, they can go to the ACCC to get authorisation to do so—and that happens all the time. It happens with cooperatives, taxicabs, Sky News going into local hotels and clubs—you name it. It happens with shopper dockets, an example which those on the other side in this place like to throw in from time to time.If the ACCC comes to the conclusion that third-line forcing is competitive rather than anticompetitive, it can authorise it. But the important thing is that the ACCC can revoke authorisation at any time. Under the system being proposed by the government, which I suspect is mirrored in this bill, all the applicant would need to do is give notification of the action. The important thing about that is that the onus is then put back on the ACCC to prove that the third-line forcing arrangement will not lead to a substantial lessening of competition. That is a reversal of onus but is also a raising of the bar in terms of the test that the ACCC has to meet or prove that it is an uncompetitive practice.All the amendments in this bill, except for the first one, are reasonable, and they are accepted by Labor. The government claim they are closing SHAR because it is no longer needed. This is supposedly due to the existence of bank provided retirement savings accounts, which the government claim are a low-cost alternative. They have not been shopping around too much—and that does not surprise me, because we in this place are pretty comfortable in our superannuation arrangements. But if they had looked around they would have found that the RSAs provided by the banks are low return at about 2½ per cent and, of course, attract significant fees. An examination of a bank web site shows that this government, by closing SHAR, is giving a free kick to the banks. In other words, we are abolishing SHAR to allow the banks to grow their retirement savings accounts, impose big fees and provide low returns.The fact that the government is making a further major change to its own legislation within days of the 1 July start of choice highlights how poorly considered the policy is. ‘Costly, complex and unsafe’ is Labor’s description of the implementation of choice of superannuation fund by 1 July 2005. For 400,000 employees there will be a massive new compliance burden. Some 34 steps are needed to comply, including five million forms to be handed out to existing employees in the first year and over one million forms in each year thereafter; ongoing record-keeping for five years to be made available for tax office inspection and enforcement; and payments to multiple super funds—there are thousands of different funds, and the funds nominated can be changed every 12 months. Employers can be fined up to $500 per employee if they get all this wrong. Employers will face significant legal liability if they give advice to employees, even if they are asked. The fines extend to jail terms. All this adds up to one thing: higher costs for employers. Not since the GST have employers seen anything like it, and plenty of them are reporting it. A further 200,000 employers and two million employees will be added to this complex regime on 1 July 2006. Small business will be hardest hit by the new compliance burden. That is why Labor is calling for an exemption from super choice for small business.Two specific matters that have arisen in the past few months require further detailed comment. The first matter is that more than 900,000 employers are being told to print and pay for 3.8 million forms to implement the Howard government’s employee choice of super fund. Five million employees will need to be given the forms by their employer over the next few months, with a further one million forms needed each year thereafter. Employers face the major new red-tape burden of form filling and record keeping, and the costs of the new super scheme which starts on 1 July.It is outrageous to expect employers to carry the cost of printing millions of forms on top of all the other new costs. Businesses are complaining that the tax office infoline is telling employers to print and pay for their own forms. The tax office admitted at the Senate Treasury estimates in February that only 1.2 million forms would be printed. Five million forms are needed initially and only one million will be available. Senator Sherry, Labor’s key superannuation spokesman, has already established at estimates who will bear the cost of the payment system. All the costs in the new cost burden will be borne by the employer. Form printing and distribution, checking and record keeping of forms, payment of contributions to multiple funds, software systems upgrades and specialist advice on the new system are all new costs to the employer.The second matter is the excessive penalties: two years jail and/or a $22,000 fine for employers is what they face under the new super choice law if they risk giving advice. It is important that all business owners, particularly of small businesses, push the Howard government to remove the penalties as they are too harsh for any mistakes that could be made. The penalties are over the top: they are harsh and excessive. They are also unnecessary. The two-year jail term should be removed and the fine of $22,000 should be substantially reduced. In the circumstances of a new and complicated system the penalty on an employer under the FSR Act should be reduced substantially to the same level that applies under the choice of superannuation legislation itself.Labor is all for protecting the funds of small business employees but these controls are over the top. Many small business owners are unsure how to cope with the additional workload necessary to offer choice of super fund and they will be the ones most vulnerable. The penalties are a result of the application of the FSR Act that applies to any person who gives advice who is not licensed to do so. Of course, most employers are not licensed financial advisers and planners nor are they ever likely to be. It is a certainty that some of the five million employees will ask their employer for advice about what to do and some employers, trying to act in good faith and do the right thing, are inevitably going to give advice about the funds. The employer should not give legal advice but it is understandable that some will do so. It is understandable that some will not understand the legislation. It is understandable that a good employer will want to help an employee through the maze of paperwork and help them grow their super fund and will give advice not knowing that they could be breaching the law.Super choice is incredibly complicated and the Howard government is demanding employers be across it by 1 July, even though tonight the Howard government is bringing in a bill to correct the original bill itself. This is simply unfair and the employer has to wear not only the new red tape costs but now face unnecessary penalties. The Howard government said it would cut red tape for small business. It would be a good start if they stopped making it worse.For employees there is an unsafe regulatory framework that fails to protect consumers from fee rip-offs. For example, entry and exit fees and commission based selling is still permitted providing it is disclosed in complex, lengthy 50-page disclosure documents. Super fees and charges will come down due to competitive pressures as promised by the Liberal government. Labor will hold the government accountable to that promise. The inclusion of retirement savings accounts as a default fund with no insurance coverage when it is required by other types of funds is not a level playing field. This clearly favours the banks which offer this type of account. Labor will be listening to employers and employees to develop a simpler and safer choice of fund system.First, the government should be picking up Labor’s suggestion and exempting small business with 24 or fewer employees. This is not an arbitrary figure. We have heard this 20 employees figure before. In fact we have heard it ad nauseam in this place over the course of the last 10 years as the government has argued that small business should be exempt from the unfair dismissal laws. It has argued that small businesses do not have a human resources department to deal with these claims. It has argued that small businesses are at a special disadvantage. Tonight, in one sense, the Labor Party is agreeing with the government and saying, ‘Yes, that’s right. Small businesses with 20 employees or fewer do not have the capacity, the human resources department, the money and the time to be dealing with this excessive red tape burden.’Second, Labor want to remove the threat of the $22,000 fine and we certainly want to hear the government spokesperson on this bill reassure us that no small business operator in this country could face a jail sentence for inadvertently giving advice to an employee on the question of his superannuation fund. We will be very happy if the minister comes in here tonight for the summation and explains to us that the FSR Act does not apply in these circumstances and reassures us that no small business person could possibly face a jail term under these arrangements. If he does that then we will be happy to withdraw our in detail stage amendments, which would remove that threat. We will be happy to withdraw them. If he does not give us that assurance then we will be obligated to move those in detail stage amendments to ensure those small business people are protected.We are living in a funny world at the moment. We have a Commonwealth government in this country that is at the moment drunk with power. This new form of federalism would cause Menzies to turn in his grave. Gough Whitlam was often accused of being centralist. He pales into insignificance compared with what we are seeing in the Commonwealth government today. In fact, Gough Whitlam was not much of a centralist. Gough Whitlam believed in a greater role for central government in the affairs of people but at the same time as he was building on the Commonwealth’s power he was devolving power to the regions. He was creating sectoral commissions and cooperative arrangements between the three levels of government to ensure the decision making was not top down but bottom up. He has been misrepresented in many senses on his approach to federalism in this country. After years of screaming states rights the current Prime Minister and his senior ministers are trying to take control—the Minister for Health and Ageing is trying to take control of health in this country, the Minister for Education, Science and Training is trying to take control of education in this country and the Attorney-General is trying to take control of defamation laws in this country. It goes on and on and on. It should be of real concern to us all.This government needs to remember that the federal system works best when it is working on a cooperative basis. It cannot work otherwise. The federal system is a good compact. It is being embraced by new nation states like Iraq and Afghanistan. In the UK, even though they have a unitary system, they are moving towards a federal model in the sense of the strengthening of regional decision-making bodies. The federal system can work and can work well. That has been recognised around the world. But it cannot work when it is not a partnership. We should all be concerned about this.The government wants to talk about choice. How about giving the voting public a choice? How about giving them the opportunity to have a federal compact in this country which works, an arrangement where you have a cooperative relationship between the various levels of government in this country. So let us talk about choice, let us talk about cooperative government in this country, not the Commonwealth government acting on what it might see as a mandate—which, I can assure it, will be temporary in controlling the Senate. The government will not have it next time. No-one is likely to have it for a long time, and I think the government should start acting more responsibly.","Second Reading","SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

245,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Robb, Andrew, MP","FU4","Goldstein","LP","N/A",88,"—I rise in support of the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005. This bill consists of measures the government seeks to put in place to ensure that the transition to super choice on 1 July is as easy as possible for businesses and employees and to minimise the burden on employers in complying with the new super choice regime.Superannuation choice allows employees to choose the fund into which their compulsory employee contributions are made. This superannuation choice measure complements a range of important superannuation initiatives that the government has put in place to increase the savings pool for the Australian community—initiatives such as the co-contribution, which has been hugely popular, and the scrapping of the surcharge, which will provide people with a significantly greater incentive to save and make provision for themselves rather than rely in future on taxpayers to support them.This government believes in choice. The member for Hunter, in the previous speech on this bill, repeated much of what he said in 2003 about the original legislation and claimed that the bill is not about choice but about ideology and an objection to industry funds. Maybe the member for Hunter has not noticed, but this government is all about choice, and not just in superannuation. We have had a concerted program over 9½ years of government to increase choice in education, in health and now in industrial relations—in a host of areas. In education we have got tremendous opportunities for parents around the country to choose between government schools and private schools, independent schools. There has been a concerted program which has increased the excellence of our schools right across Australia. These are not the class based policies which the Labor Party presented at the last election. Those policies, I might add, have not been rescinded; they remain Labor policies.Mr Deputy Speaker, you also see choice in the health sector. We have got 56 per cent of all operations conducted in private hospitals. We have got a great model of private and public hospital provision. Again, that is a very significant and deliberate approach taken by this government to increase excellence, to provide choice and to provide efficiencies across all sorts of sectors. Again, in industrial relations, which we have been talking about in the last few days, we are not scrapping awards; we are providing choice, serious choice, so that we can increase the flexibility and the efficiency of the workplace.In that same vein, the government is offering choice in superannuation, and not through any ideology or any preconceived view about industry funds—they are free to participate and to operate in this whole choice equation with other funds. The choice in superannuation will allow Australians to take control of their own superannuation savings and consequently their futures. Being involved in the decisions about where their superannuation contributions are paid will mean that employees will start to consider the adequacy of their retirement savings sooner rather than later. This is a good thing. The policy provides for choice right at the start of a person’s employment life and causes them to reflect upon the provision they are making for the future. It is not smart to start thinking about the adequacy of your provision for retirement as you approach retirement. Choice will play a big part in helping to focus the minds of people throughout their lives on the adequacy of provision of funds for their retirement.Choice of funds will also mean that the superannuation industry and individual funds will need to be more competitive and responsive to the needs and wants of Australians in terms of their superannuation investments. Greater competition means greater efficiency, which should drive improved returns on superannuation, lower charges and lower administration fees. Already we are seeing considerable evidence that super funds are reducing fees and administrative charges in the lead-up to the provision of choice on 1 July. Competition is already starting to deliver results. This is not ideology; this is the power of choice with regard to superannuation.Choice will also be an advantage for people who want to change jobs on a regular basis or are involved in casual or temporary work. If people are allowed to choose their fund, it will ensure that lost superannuation money will become a thing of the past. In 2003, when this legislation was being debated, there was around $7 billion and 4.6 million accounts on the lost member register of the Australian Taxation Office. That is a very significant item, one that needs to be dealt with and one that will be dealt with by the provision of choice.The current arrangements also disadvantage those in itinerant work and those in multiple part-time jobs and, again, this will be addressed by the provision of choice. There is a further, intangible benefit when individuals are empowered to make decisions on things such as their superannuation savings: they become far more aware of the broader economic decisions and events that will impact upon their future livelihood. This is a good thing. It is a very good thing to increase the awareness of people right across the community about things that will improve their lives and the provision of funds for their retirement. Choice and individual freedom are major drivers of good policy. That is the conclusion. It is a not a matter of ideology; it is a matter of good policy. It is working in so many areas of public policy now as a result of the very deliberate efforts of this government which are delivering great results in all sorts of areas.Tonight an amendment was moved that seeks to exempt small businesses with fewer than 20 employees. This is a frivolous amendment in the sense that it will cause more problems than it seeks to solve. The fact is that the paperwork requirements for small business, for all business, have been deliberately and very effectively reduced to a minimum. In fact the interaction with small business over the last few months through a very serious education program put in place to educate, advise and communicate to small business the requirements they face—the two-page form they are required to fill out within one month from 1 July, a form required to be filled out once a year—and through the shifting of the onus onto employees has meant that the response from small business is such that, in all of the efforts around the 850,000 small businesses in this country, there is not a concern about the implementation or the paperwork. The only thing that is really worrying small business is the scaremongering being perpetrated by those on the other side of the House. When they have looked at the detail and have looked at what is involved, they are comfortable with what they are required to do—that is, to fill out a two-page form within a month of 1 July and to repeat that exercise every 12 months.If an exemption were provided for small business, it would mean that a very large number of employees would not be given the right to choose a fund. I have just been through a whole series of advantages that choice will provide to Australian workers right across this country. All of those advantages would be denied to a very large number of employees. Small business accounts for nearly 97 per cent of all private sector businesses and employs 50 per cent of private sector employees. The Labor Party seeks to deny hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of employees the opportunity of choice in super and all the advantages that come with a choice in super. Choice of fund is expected to increase competition. As I said earlier, the fees and charges of various superannuation funds are already decreasing. They are already coming down as a result of the announcement effect and the implementation effect of this policy provision. If small business employees are unable to choose their own fund that will reduce these benefits of competition.This bill makes some consequential amendments to the Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. Schedule 1 of the bill amends the aforementioned acts as follows. An employer may not directly charge an employee for the cost associated with complying with the super choice legislation and implementing the choice regime. This bill imposes a penalty on employers who seek to do so. This is important because employees must not be discouraged from exercising their right to choose a fund through the actions of their employer. However, this does not imply that an employer is liable for any financial disadvantage experienced by an employee as a result of their choice of fund decision where this loss is not related to the actions of the employer—for example, if a fund chosen by the employee increases its fees.Secondly, this bill specifies circumstances where an employer does not have to provide employees with a standard choice form, thus avoiding the imposition of unnecessary costs on some employers. A very serious attempt has been made to minimise the requirements, the paperwork and any onerous provisions on businesses, especially small businesses. A very successful attempt has been made to do that. Section 32NA of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 provides for circumstances where an employer is not required to comply with the choice of funds legislation in providing a standard choice form to their employees. This includes situations where the employee was offered choice of fund prior to 1 July 2005. Further, the bill clarifies a number of matters, including the test for whether a defined benefits fund is in surplus, the employer’s obligation to contribute to the fund specified as the default fund on the standard choice form, whether a choice of fund offered by employers before 1 July 2005 is consistent with the choice legislation, and the penalty provisions in relation to these matters.The bill specifies that ASIC will be responsible for the administration of the ‘no employer kickback’ provisions in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. Fund trustees must not try to inappropriately induce employers to move their employees’ contributions to the trustee’s fund by offering personal incentives. The bill further amends the provisions in relation to the use of the superannuation holding account special account. This special account was originally established to receive small superannuation amounts from employers who could not find a superannuation fund. In future, employers will not be able to use this fund, because this facility will no longer be needed as retirement savings accounts offer similar low-cost benefits for employers.The bill will amend the legislation to make the superannuation holding account special account an eligible choice fund until 20 June 2006, giving employers a further year to make arrangements to contribute to a superannuation fund or retirement savings account. From 1 July 2006, the special account will be closed to new employer deposits. All of these provisions are designed to make it easier for employers to implement this scheme and to make it easier for employees to follow the arrangements. They are commonsense and I welcome the support for these provisions by the other side of the House. Choice of funds is an important policy and it is important to all working Australians. This bill makes the necessary amendments to ensure that the transition to choice is as easy as possible for all employees, employers and businesses. I commend the bill to the House.","Second Reading","SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
246,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Burke, Tony, MP","DYW","Watson","ALP","N/A",91,"—The member for Goldstein made some extraordinary comments just then concerning the concept of choice. He used the line that this government is all about choice. He is claiming, in the context of superannuation, that the government is all about choice just days after the Prime Minister stood in here and said that superannuation should cease to be an allowable matter. The Prime Minister stood in here and said that if an employer and employee agree and want to put something into an industrial instrument, the government will get in the road and say, ‘You’re not allowed to exercise that choice.’ On the exact issue of superannuation which the member for Goldstein has just referred to we find that if an employer and employees agree that they want to have a default fund and that the default fund will be the only one available—whether it is put into an AWA or a collective agreement—and they make the decision because there is a clear benefit to the employer in terms of paperwork, this government will say: ‘We’re going to interfere and not allow that choice at all. We’re going to get in the road and say that you’re not allowed to agree on that anymore.’If it is okay by the employer and it is okay by the employee but the government is troubled by it, I say that it is bad luck for the government. Let the employers and employees make their own agreements. That is why they are called agreements. They do not necessarily have to agree with the member for Goldstein, but if they agree with each other it should be allowed to be an allowable matter and should be allowed to be put on foot.There is another thing about which we have no choice at all. There is no choice when it comes to red tape with this government. This government said that they would reduce red tape by 50 per cent—in fact, they said it even before they became a government. That comment was made by the member for Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition as he then was, in the great debate when questioned by Ray Martin. He said, ‘We are committed to reducing the red tape that small business has to grapple with by 50 per cent in our first term.’What do we find subsequently? We find, in the Financial Review on 18 April this year, the Minister for Small Business and Tourism saying that the new federal review stems from the Howard government’s fourth term agenda goal of reducing red tape. What was meant to be done in the first term in reducing red tape has now become a fourth term agenda item. It is open to the government to do that now. There is a new way that the government can reduce red tape by 50 per cent: take it back to 1996 levels and you will probably be there. Nothing annoys small business more than the way this government has added every extra level of compliance burden and said to small business on every occasion: ‘It is your fault and you can deal with it.’ A fascinating speech was made in 1994 in which someone said:They have no idea that the average small businessman is simultaneously the managing director, the sales manager, the personnel manager, the chief accountant and the tea lady all rolled into one. They have this vision that small business operators have a personnel department that can fill out all the forms, answer all the questionnaires and keep all the records of discussions with employees. They do not know the realities of trying to run a small business and the sorts of pressures that bear upon small businessmen.That speech was made on 5 May 1994 by the member for Bennelong. If only he remembered those words now, because every time this government has a new idea and decides who is going to do the paperwork, it leaves it at the door of small business. It leaves the red tape at the door of small business. This government knows it has nothing at all to be proud of when it comes to that original promise on red tape for small businesses. Subsequently, at the great debate at the National Small Business Summit only held a couple of weeks ago, we had a ringing endorsement from the minister for small business on this policy. She said:You appreciate that this whole issue of superannuation choice has been around since 1998 when Senator Rod Kemp was the assistant Treasurer and so it has been out there for a very long time, but this is something I have inherited.That was a ringing endorsement from the minister for small business. It is no surprise that when we debated the exemption for small business in an MPI, the minister for small business was nowhere to be seen in this chamber. She got out the door before I got to my feet and made sure she had nothing to do with defending this policy.When we are debating a second reading amendment to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005 dealing quite specifically with an exemption for small business, wouldn’t you think that might be an occasion for the minister for small business to wander down into the chamber? But, no, she was not put on the speakers’ list because the government realises the nightmare that has been created for small businesses in the way this has been implemented. The government knows it full well, and every time the government interacts with any small business operator, which clearly does not happen nearly as often as it should, this government will be told the same message.How extraordinary it was to hear the previous speaker say, ‘You talk to small businesses and there are no big problems out there once you explain it to them.’ I presume he thinks COSBOA is guilty of the same level of naivety. I presume he believes that the peak body of small business organisations, which publicly backs Labor’s call for an exemption of small business, just have not looked at the detail. Well, I am sorry, members of the government, they have. It is extraordinarily patronising and condescending to anybody who is out there running a small business and having to deal with the paperwork—when what they want to focus on is running their business—to be told: ‘It’s only a two-page form.’ Good one! It is a two-page form with a 16-page explanatory document for employers and a 55-page explanatory document for employees.Faced with that sort of paperwork, what do we think employees are going to say to the small business operator? It is pretty clear what they will say. There will be some who say, ‘Can I rip it up?’ and they will rip it up. There will be some who go out there and make a choice. And there will be a lot who say to their boss: ‘What do you reckon I ought to do?’ I have to say that is a relatively innocent question. But if the employer answers that question and gives honest advice, which has been requested in good faith, they are subject to either a maximum $22,000 fine or a maximum two years imprisonment. When this was debated in the MPI we had what I have to say was impressive spin. I will concede to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer it was impressive stuff—and I have the quote here because if I tried to paraphrase no-one would believe it:I make it clear to the shadow minister and to the small business community of Australia—quite a creative moment in his speech—that there is no such provision—referring to the jail sentences—in the choice legislation. I invite the shadow minister to take a look. The comments of the shadow minister, and of his leader in his speech in reply, alluded to the point that somehow we, the government, had introduced in this legislation a policy and a position that would require, in the event of a broken commitment by small businesses, their ending up in jail—and that is untrue.The same sentiments were echoed in the MPI debate by the member for Mackellar, who said:For the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for small business to try to drum up fear and loathing—which I thought was creative in itself—and purport that a $22,000 fine is contained within this legislation is unworthy of members of this parliament. Indeed, it is the sort of tactic that gives politicians in general a bad name.At one level what they said has an element of truth to it, because at one level it is true. The jail penalties are not contained within the choice legislation. The jail penalties are contained within the Corporations Act and they are activated by the choice legislation. But we had said in this parliament that somehow it is great compensation to small business operators to say: ‘Well, if you end up making a mistake with this and you end up giving financial advice, at least you’ll have the consolation of knowing it wasn’t the legislation responsible for super choice that put you in jail. It was only the way it interacted with the Corporations Act.’ They’ll be able to lean back in their banana lounges in Long Bay Jail quite content—thank heavens it was the Corporations Act and not any piece of legislation that had super choice in its title.Sorry, but the super choice legislation activates those clauses. If you are simply operating from a default fund, you never fall into the trap of accidentally or inadvertently giving financial advice. The mere fact that employees are given these forms means—let us not pretend: everybody in this room should know this for certain—the scenario I described before will occur. Employees will say to the boss: ‘What do you reckon I ought to do?’ If you do not think they have that sort of close relationship with the boss then you do not understand how small businesses operate. In so many ways the people who work for a small business act as an extension of the family of the employer, even though they might not be directly related. The relationship is that close. Advice will be sought.For the government to say that there is any relief because the jail penalties come under an act with a different title is to treat small business with utter contempt. Yet that was the argument that was run in this chamber last week by the minister for revenue and the member for Mackellar. I hope no-one runs that line in this debate tonight because the dishonesty of it is now exposed, so I say to you: if you have been given your speaking notes by the minister I would have another read over them.For those people who think they might have inherited this legislation, for those people who think that this might be the responsibility of others, the opposition is making sure there is an opportunity to deal with that. For those people who think that they did not really intend for that interaction to happen between the super choice legislation and the Corporations Act, Labor are making sure that there is a way of dealing with that. We are making sure of two things. I was not here for the whole speech by the previous speaker but I heard him refer to one of them, which is an exemption for small business. This is not small business under the new workplace relations definition of 100 employees, but small business with fewer than 20 employees. We will provide that exemption for them. It is not good enough to argue in rebuttal that that is terribly unfair to the employees. We already have a period of time where it is currently not applying to people under collective agreements or AWAs, although the government is planning on changing that and interfering with the choice of the parties further down the track. We already have a case that for more than 12 months to go it will not apply to people on state awards. There are already exemptions in the system. So it is simply not good enough to say, ‘That would be terribly unfair to employees,’ because it is already being introduced as a package that will not be universal when it kicks off. That is already the case.We are giving two opportunities to the members of this House in respect of the super choice legislation tonight. In the morning, members of this House are going to divide and all those members of the government are going to have to come in here and decide first of all whether they support an exemption for small business. They are going to have to vote as to whether it is reasonable at the very least to stop making the red tape burden worse. I do not know how they managed to come up with such a convoluted system. I do not know how anyone can say it is just a two-page form. Mind you, if all that comes back is a two-page form and the employer acts on it, they are acting in breach of the legislation, because it has to come back with a certificate as well. Simply to say it is a two-page form is wrong and ignores the issue about the 16-page explanatory document for employers and the 55-page explanatory document for employees. So the exemption for small business is not an unreasonable call. It is not unfair to employees but it gives the choice to small business operators that if they do not want to have to take on an extra burden of red tape they do not have to.But the second amendment that we will be dealing with in the morning, which every member of this House will vote on, will be quite explicit: do you believe that there should be jail terms when an employer inadvertently gives advice, even when that advice is requested by the employee? If there is a kickback involved, if an employer is giving advice and getting a kickback to make some money for themselves, there ought to be serious penalties. If the employer is going out and being a full-on advocate and trying to persuade employees and push them in a particular direction, that is contrary to the spirit of the legislation and penalties ought to prevail. I have no worries with that at all. But surely it is reasonable to say that, if the request comes from the employee and the employer simply answers a question in good faith with no pecuniary benefits, they should be exempt from prison terms. This is not a big call. This is not a really radical view.I have to say, when we first embarked on making a bit of noise about this issue, I thought we would lose traction on it very quickly because I thought the government were going to announce that they would fix it. I cannot for the life of me understand why the government would believe it is good public policy to impose a prison sentence for a small business operator who acts in that manner. People might say, ‘The courts will take it into account.’ A prison sentence should not even be on the table as a possibility for an employer who acts in that fashion. Every single member of this House will exercise the vote tomorrow morning and will make it clear whether or not they believe employers who act in good faith at the request of employees should be subjected to prison terms.I am looking forward to seeing which way the member for Kingston votes, what he is going to say to the businesses in Lonsdale or Seaford and what he is going to say when the Southern Times Messenger is notified about the impact of this on the local small businesses in that electorate. I am looking forward to hearing what the member for Bonner has to say and what the Wynnum Herald subsequently reports on the issue of prison terms for employers who act in good faith. I am looking forward to seeing what the member for Greenway has to say to the Blacktown chamber of commerce and to the Blacktown Advocate when she has to defend increasing the red tape burden on small business and defend prison terms for employers who act in good faith. I am looking forward to seeing how the member for Wakefield, the member for Braddon, the member for Hasluck and the member for Stirling decide to interact when they are asked questions on 7BU, by the Northern Argus, by the Midland Kalamunda Reporter or by the Mount Barker Courier. I am looking forward to all of that.","Second Reading","SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

248,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Burke, Tony, MP","DYW","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—I am being told a classic principle by the member opposite: ‘Just worry about yourself.’ Isn’t that precisely what the government have done? For the government to handle any part of the paperwork would involve a cost to government—and we can’t have that! Let’s make it a cost to business. On the cost to business issues, you bet they have just worried about themselves. We even had the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer in this chamber last week saying, ‘Look, there is really no compliance problem because there are these things called clearing houses.’ Yes, there are things called clearing houses—just as there are accountants and bookkeepers—and every one of those things costs money. None of that financial burden is being borne by the government. The government are providing the exact level of leadership that I just heard across the table. They will just worry about themselves and look after themselves.When it comes to small business, that is not good enough. The government has not just ignored this key promise but has gone in the exact opposite direction. There was a key promise about the reduction in red tape for small business and the government has increased it. It is about to increase it again, and tomorrow morning we will get a chance to say enough is enough. Small business should not bear the brunt of a government that only cares about itself. Small business should not be subjected to criminal penalties when acting in good faith. Small business deserves a break. Small business deserves to have what was originally promised to it: less red tape. I say to the members opposite: even if you have decided that you are going to dishonour this promise, even if you have decided that you do not really care about small business, just stop making it worse. Members opposite get a chance to do that tomorrow morning. It would be a shame to miss that opportunity. We might get political traction out of it, but it is a lousy deal for small business.","Second Reading","SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
249,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Cadman, Alan, MP","SD4","Mitchell","LP","N/A",96,"—The member for Watson made an interesting speech. It is a pity it was not accurate and a pity it was not based on fact. Here is the first newspaper I have picked up, and look at this headline: ‘MYOB survey reveals confidence about the next 12 months’. The survey also attests that most small businesses already offer choice in super. In the survey, 1,501 small business owners and general managers answered 17 questions about their business via the internet. So much for the confected argument that this is a worry to small business. I just want to educate the member because he is trying to manufacture a case that does not really exist. The results of the second survey show:… although 54 per cent of businesses do not believe super choice will be a significant burden … More than 90 per cent of businesses with five to 19 employees are aware of super choice. The need for super choice in the small-business sector has been called into question by this survey, with 73 per cent of businesses surveyed already offering choice of super to their employees.Where does the Labor Party stand with these jolly confected amendments and the carry-on about the damage to small business? There is one survey of 1,500 small businesses.There are other surveys, but firstly I want to demonstrate to the House how simple this matter of choice is. The Assistant Treasurer has provided me with a copy of the ‘Choice of superannuation fund Standard choice form—information for employees’. Option 1, in the first column, reads: ‘You do not have to choose a fund’. Option 2, in the second column, reads, ‘Choose a fund’. It also gives further information. When you turn over the form you find that half of the page contains information for the employer to complete. It reads, ‘Part A: Employer to complete’—which just means he has to fill in his name and address. He then has to list where the employer superannuation guarantee contributions have previously been made. The choice part of the form asks the employee for their name and address—the usual stuff—and the fund into which they want the money to go. How simple is that?What a manufactured process the Labor Party is using tonight. By filling in half a page of this form employees can indicate which fund they wish to put their money into. By completing half a page of this form employers can indicate which funds they have used previously—if employees seek to switch the fund they use. It is simple. It is not difficult. There is no angst. Three-quarters of small businesses already offer choice in superannuation. In fact, if they decide that their employees will be given choice between now and 1 July, that is satisfactory. It does not have to be done on 1 July or during the month of July; it can be done now.I noticed in the Australian Financial Review of 13 April this year an article by Barrie Dunstan headed: ‘Wake-up call on super’. He writes:With only 11 weeks to go, a study of super fund members by Mercer Human Resources Consulting found that at least 10 per cent were considering switching funds in the next two years.There we have a choice in super producing movement in the marketplace, with people shopping around and looking for something different. The article continues:The study revealed the profile of prospective switches: they were likely to be male, dissatisfied with their current fund, with multiple super accounts and—some with—high account balances.So there we have a typical itinerant worker in the building industry with a multiplicity of funds with all the companies that he has worked for, each of them shoving his money into a fund of their choice—not his choice. That worker is dissatisfied with the process. A large number of workers are looking at the options in the market already and are wondering where they are going to put their money. What happens to the industry? Of course, the superannuation industry are worried about that because they do not know what the results are going to be. So what does that concern produce? It produces reduced fees and better conditions for the investors. That is the competition process that the choice in super generates. The article continues:As example of the mismatches, Mercer found that the two features members most wanted were the ability to nominate a beneficiary at death—81 per cent wanted that—and the ability to choose their own fund.Seventy-two per cent wanted the ability to choose their own fund. There we have both the employees, 72 per cent, wanting to choose their own fund and the employers, 75 per cent, who have already given that opportunity to their employees. The manufactured indignation from the Australian Labor Party just does not hold water. Three-quarters of employees and three-quarters of small businesses have already made up their mind. Numerous surveys indicate that they are not worried about it. They are more worried about interest rates rising, and they certainly will not have interest rate rises to the same degree under this government as they would have had under the Labor Party. So they have confidence in that area and choice of super is not of concern to them.When you look at the form you have to ask yourself: what could be simpler? I know that the most uneducated person living in a boundary riders hut in Deputy Speaker Scott’s electorate, who had never been to school, would have no difficulty in understanding this form. I believe that the most poorly informed employer, starting out in business with their first employee, would also find this a simple form to fill in. They would know their own name, for instance. They would know to which fund they had made contributions before. If they had no contributions previously they would just scratch that part out. The form reads, ‘Employer superannuation guarantee contributions have previously been made to ...’ There are just three questions that they have to answer. So the most uninformed employer has three questions—one of which includes their name—to complete in the choice of super form which, according to members of the Australian Labor Party, is supposed to be so complex.For the employee there are four questions to answer. The fourth question is a little harder; it is a tick the box question. The part reads, ‘My employer’s previous superannuation fund named in part A question 3.’ If they want their money to go there, they tick that box, or they tick the second box which reads, ‘My own choice of fund.’ Having chosen one of those two boxes, they have to write down their own name and address and other details. It is hard stuff; it is really difficult; it is really complex! It is half a page with great big boxes that are easily filled in. Even a person who is half-blind could read it without any assistance. As I say, it would be as easy for a jackeroo as it would be for a station manager. It would be as easy for the small businessman with a take-away shop and his weekend casuals as it would be for people wanting to make extra money working at weekends to supplement pocket money from their parents. I do not know what the Labor Party are on about.There is one other aspect of this that I find fascinating. In an article by Chris Wright in the Fin Review of 30 March, he writes about the increased interest in the do-it-yourself funds by people who are now given a choice. People not only have the choice of going to their employer’s fund or a fund operated by a large institution, they also have the option of investing in their own fund. Chris Wright outlines in the article the advantages for people who invest in their own fund from research by AMP Capital Investors and research group Investment Trends. The article states:Many investors felt that the choice of super regime, which kicks in in July, would prompt still greater numbers to take the DIY route. As more and more corporate funds close, and investment options gain greater attention, it’s likely that many will opt to try managing their own superannuation assets.The study showed that the motivations for doing so are not as straightforward as is usually assumed.While a desire for greater control of investments was the main driver towards starting a DIY fund, with 55 per cent of respondents mentioning it, only 24 per cent said they launched such a fund in order to save money on fees.The article quotes Mark Johnston of Investment Trends:‘It’s a relatively small subset who say it’s all about fees.’There we have increased interest in doing it yourself, employees who are well informed, employers who are already doing it and a simple form at that.The provisions of the bill before the House make clear some of the aspects of choice that need to be known before 1 July. This relates to the way the taxation fund, the SHASA, is operating. This is a fund operating out of the Australian Taxation Office that allows employers to put small amounts under the care of the tax office. It does not earn any interest but no fees are charged either. If an employer does not know where an employee is, the money goes into that fund with the name and details of the employee. It also allows itinerant workers, such as fruit-pickers, who earn small amounts to lodge in that fund—maybe small weekly payments for a short period. That fund is going to operate for another year and will close on 1 July 2006 because the government has decided it will be simpler to move that investment across to retirement savings funds operated by banks.When he gives his speech in reply, I would like the Assistant Treasurer to give us a bit more information about those bank operated funds because, according to the Bills Digest, the earning capacity of RSAs may not be as high as regular funds and their fees may be higher. I think there is some uncertainty about whether that is a fact and I would like a few details about how RSAs perform compared with normal funds. If employers of, say, fruit-pickers or itinerant workers of any type choose that route, I would hate to think that any contributions being made into those funds are going to be whittled away by increased fees and charges by the banks. I think we all have enough of a healthy respect but also a suspicion of bank charges to know that they need some careful supervision of whether or not people are going to be disadvantaged by that process.I think this is just a terrific thing for Australia. The whingers in the Australian Labor Party are really base because they know that industry funds are not going to be able to compete. They know that the union based funds have not performed as well as they should have, so they focus on small business in order to draw attention away from the campaigns being waged by industry funds to hook in more people. The union movement are advertising on television day and night to try to attract people to industry funds operated by the union movement. They forget to say that in the advertisements, but that is what those funds are about.I have here a booklet authorised by the Australian government entitled ‘Super choices—think about your future’. It is a simple booklet that lays out all the key factors. Anybody wanting information about choice between now and the end of July should try to get hold of this booklet. It is readily available and contains web site addresses and a toll-free telephone number that people can call. The booklet offers advice on the types of funds that a member can join and where they can get information. They can also get information about the performance of the different types of funds operated by different companies and compare the fees and benefits of different funds.There is also a useful table indicating who is eligible to join this choice process. In New South Wales, for instance, employees whose superannuation contributions are paid under state awards or industrial agreements can choose a fund under state law. However, there is no obligation on your employer to agree to the choice. This regime will apply to about five million people coming under the ambit of Commonwealth law or awards. The information about choices allows people to find out about each fund, how their money gets paid back to them, how they can consolidate if they should change jobs—so the portability factor is there—and compares costs and fees.Also, whether or not there is a death and disability adjunct to the super fund is something of great interest. As I remember, 81 per cent of employees are very interested in whether or not there is a death and disability factor attached to their super fund. Most people want that because, if they have families, they like to be sure that their families will be well cared for if they become incapacitated. There is even a worksheet to allow people to work through the process. It is a simple booklet—well prepared and easily understood. It is only a few pages, but it clearly sets out information to assist anybody wanting to make a choice of super.The process is easy: people can have choice as to their super fund and they have to do that before the end of July. If they decide they want no choice at all, the employer can make that choice for them. If they decide not to exercise a choice, the employer will do that for them. If they make a decision for choice and they choose a non-complying fund, they have a period in which that can be fixed up. They have a right to change their fund once every 12 months if their fund is not performing or they get better information and they decide to consolidate their funds in one place. ATO tax educators’ seminars will be happening around the country so that people will be better informed. So information will be provided to people wanting to know more about funds. If there is noncompliance by an employer, the fines are there but they cannot be more than $500 per employee. I would like to warn employers this is a process that needs to be complied with. It is simple: it is just half a page with three questions to be answered by the employer.This is a terrific change for Australia. This puts people in charge of their own destiny. It stops money being wasted. Hundreds of millions of dollars are lost each year by people who cannot keep track of their super. At the end of the day that means funds which are rightfully theirs cannot be used in their retirement and funds to which they have contributed by hard work are lost and may go back to central revenue. This is an opportunity for everybody who works to take advantage of the nine per cent compulsory payment. It can be put in one place where fees and charges do not fritter away or eat up their hard-won funds and salaries. So the simplicity, the ease with which small business is adopting it and the processes entered into by this government to simplify the process and make it easy should encourage everybody to be involved. I think it is a great move forward. I want to congratulate the government and the ministers involved for producing such an excellent scheme.","Second Reading","SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
250,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Bowen, Chris, MP","DZS","Prospect","ALP","N/A",100,"—I am pleased to be able to speak in support of Labor’s amendments to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005 but it gives me no pleasure to speak on a bill which involves such a substantial increase in paperwork and compliance burdens for small business. We have just heard a contribution from the honourable member for Mitchell, who said that it was a ‘simple’ process. Unfortunately, he simply showed how out of touch he is with small business. It beggars belief that the honourable member for Mitchell can say that a process is simple because it simply involves a two-page form. If it is such a simple two-page form, why does it require a 55-page explanatory document for employees and a 16-page explanatory document for employers? That does not sound very simple to me.This bill makes quite significant changes to the superannuation choice regime just one month before the new regime comes into force. One must really question the amount of planning that has gone into this when such significant changes are being made just one month before such a major change comes into law. There is one minor improvement in this bill, and I suspect we should be thankful for small mercies. This bill removes the obligation on employers already providing choice to employees from having to provide the standard choice of fund form to existing employees. It should not have been so complicated that such an amendment was necessary so late in this process. It should not have been so complicated that there would need to be changes to this paperwork nightmare. The fact that the government has had to bring into this House legislation which exempts those businesses already providing super choice to employees from providing the forms to existing employees shows how terribly complex this regime is, how terribly complex the paperwork is and what a burden it will be on people in the small business sector.Small business people tell me time and time again that the biggest issue facing them is compliance. In my electorate and other electorates the issue that gets raised again and again is compliance. For example, not one person who runs a small business has raised with me the need for unfair dismissal reform. However, people have raised with me time and time again the paperwork burden. But this bill and this regime make the paperwork burden so much worse for people in small business. On 3 May the shadow minister for small business, the honourable member for Watson, visited my electorate and we went together to the Filpure water filter shop in Fairfield and spoke to Alex Kariki, the proprietor. I am sure what he said about the changes would be echoed by many small business people throughout the nation. He said, ‘I thought the GST paperwork was too much but this is ridiculous.’ I certainly endorse that remark by Mr Kariki.From 1 July, small business will have to deal with a whole new compliance regime. Putting aside the penalties and ridiculous burdens placed on business people, just the paperwork alone—apart from the business activity statement and the other paperwork that small business people have to comply with—will prove significant. I always think it pays to go back and look at what the Liberal Party has said about these things in the past. In 1996 the then Leader of the Opposition and now the Prime Minister said:We are committed to reducing the red tape that small business has to grapple with by fifty per cent in our first term.There are many things that I could say about that statement—obviously it is a non-core commitment or a rock solid, rolled gold commitment—but I will simply say it is just another broken commitment. But there is an easy solution to this; it is not complex—simply exempt small business. Exempt small business from not only the two-page form, which the honourable member for Mitchell described as ‘simple’, but also the 16-page explanatory document for employers and the 55-page explanatory document for employees. This government finds it simple and easy to exempt small business from unfair dismissal legislation, so it has found a way to do that, but it finds it intolerably difficult to exempt small business from the paperwork nightmare that will accompany the introduction of superannuation choice. This brings me to a closely related matter, which is that of penalties.The intersection of the financial services reform regime and the changes that are encompassed in this bill means that an employer who innocently answers an employee’s question about which superannuation fund the employer might think the employee should sign up to is liable to fines and imprisonment. The government will no doubt say that will never happen and we are just scaremongering as it will never get that far. If it is not going to happen, remove the doubt: accept Labor’s amendments.COSBOA, the peak small business group in Australia, certainly agree with Labor that small business should be exempt from the draconian penalties contained in this regime. COSBOA are not traditionally seen as an organisation affiliated with the Australian Labor Party. They are not traditionally seen as a radical socialist organisation. They are seen as a mainstream organisation representing small business. But on 4 May 2005, COSBOA issued a press release which in part says:The Shadow Small Business Minister Mr Tony Burke is right when he calls for exemptions for small business.I am glad that the shadow minister has been able to join us in the chamber to hear the endorsement of his actions by COSBOA. Our only difference with COSBOA is that we say all employers should be exempt from these draconian and ridiculous penalties. There is a real inconsistency here. If this legislation is passed without Labor’s amendments, as I have said, an employer answering an innocent question from an employee about which fund the employer would recommend the employee enter into could find themselves liable for a fine of $22,000 and a two-year jail sentence. If that same employer gives his or her employee some advice about buying a property—if that same employee went to the employer and said, ‘Excuse me, boss, do you I think I should buy this property down here?’ and the employer said, ‘Yes, that’s a great investment, it’s going to have a great return over the next few years and I would strongly recommend that you buy it’—there is no penalty. Even if that employer has an interest in that property which they do not disclose to the employee there is no penalty. Under Australian law as it stands at the moment, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.So an employer or any other individual can run a shonky property investment advice business, lead people astray, give them poor advice and take kickbacks, and there is no penalty. But in the legislation proposed by the government we have a situation where an employer who gives advice to somebody in their business—they might say: ‘Yes, I think that fund looks fine. I’ve been in that fund myself and I’ve always found them good’; it might be quite innocent advice—would potentially find themselves liable to a jail term and a $22,000 fine. The government says that that will not really happen, so it should support Labor’s amendments and remove the doubt.The government has allocated $88 million over the next five years to implement this policy. Most of that will go into compliance enforcement—forcing small business people who are already struggling with a compliance nightmare to comply with this extra paperwork burden. I was drawn to comments made today by Peter Switzer in the Australian. We heard a lot of quotes from the Australian Financial Review from the member for Mitchell, but the one thing he did not quote was in the Australian today. Peter Switzer is a very respected commentator on small business matters. This is what he said today:Let’s focus in on the madness that Super Choice has created …These are not my words or the member for Watson’s words but the words of an independent commentator in the Australian. Later in the article, he says:Well, if this employer fails to follow the Super Choice regulations he or she could be in a lot of trouble—unwittingly.And don’t even think about the workload if your eight—or however many—staff all start their own self-managed super fund. Experts warn that even one staff member going for this option will be an administrative nightmare.What is all this for? The member for Mitchell said: ‘This is great, because 10 per cent of people might want to choose their own super fund. We are going to send a paperwork nightmare to small business people who are already struggling in paperwork. We are going to threaten jail terms and fines so that 10 per cent of people can exercise a choice of super funds.’ If that 10 per cent of people could be accommodated without this massive burden on small business, we on this side of the chamber would have no problem with that. But this is a matter of balance. This government, which uses so much rhetoric about small business, is willing to impose on small business this paperwork burden—all for, as the member for Mitchell said, the 10 per cent of people wanting to exercise their choice.In this bill, the government is also saying it is the employer’s responsibility to be aware of the merger of super funds. If an employee is a member of a super fund which merges, it is the employer’s responsibility to notify the employee and make sure that the employee is aware of it and can change their arrangements. Again, if they do not comply with that, there are penalties. Wherever you look in this bill there are penalties for small business people struggling to do their bit in a difficult environment with compliance paperwork issues imposed on them not just by this government but also by state and local government. Some of it is justified and some of it is not, but the bottom line is that a small business person has to spend on average one day a week just on paperwork—not making sales, not going out and chasing leads, not training staff but doing paperwork. And that will only be worsened by this bill.This government likes to portray itself as a friend of small business. It goes on and on about unfair dismissal exemptions. We will be saying a lot more about that when the legislation comes before the House and about how this government could be reducing the compliance burden on small business in a much fairer and more effective way. That is not a matter for this debate, but we will certainly be arguing very strongly in coming months when the government again brings the legislation before the House. This government refuses to accept Labor’s amendments to this bill which support small business. I call on those Liberal members who parade around their electorates pretending to be the friends of small business to do one of two things. They like choice, so we will give them a choice. Choice No. 1 is to come into this House and vote with the Labor Party—vote for the amendments to support small business. I am not sure they are going to take that choice. I am not sure that many of them will show the courage we have seen from some of the members opposite.Over the last few days we have seen the member for Kooyong, the member for Pearce and the member for Cook show considerable courage. They and all members opposite could show some courage on this matter and vote with the Labor Party for the constituencies they parade around the country pretending to defend. Let them come in and do that. But, as I said, they get a choice. If they do not wish to do that there is choice No. 2, which is to come in here and explain their position. Look at the speakers list. There are three speakers from the government on this bill. Where are the members from Western Sydney who parade around as friends of small business? Let them come in and defend their position. Where is the member for Lindsay? Where is the member for Greenway? Let them come in. Where is the member for Macarthur?They go around the small businesses in Western Sydney and I bet they say—because we have heard this before—‘Small business has never had a better friend than the Howard government.’ They will say around this country, ‘The Howard government is the best friend of small business.’ They say it in the chamber and they will say it elsewhere because that apparently is the mantra that focus groups are promoting through the government. It is everybody’s best friend. It is like kindergarten—remember? You had so many best friends. The Howard government is everybody’s best friend. But let them come into this House and explain to small businesses in their electorates why they are voting for jail penalties, why they are voting for fines and why they are voting for increased paperwork burdens. It is not a choice they have to make. It is very easy. They could come into this House and vote for Labor’s amendments. We are making it easier for them. They have brought this bill in and provided us with an opportunity to again move this amendment. We are giving them a second chance. Come in and support small business. Defend small business. That is their rhetoric.They claim we are the party of the trade unions and everybody except small business. We are proving that we are the party that defends the battlers and those who are having difficulty with the compliance burden being placed on small business. We are the friends of small business in this House. This government is showing that it is not. Those individual members should come in here and justify their position—the honourable member for Greenway, the honourable member for Lindsay and the honourable member for Macarthur. Let them come in here and explain to their constituents and to their small business people why they are not voting for Labor’s amendments. Let these people who promote themselves around the countryside and around their electorates explain why they are not coming in here and supporting Labor’s amendments. Why are they not supporting the exemption of small business from this legislation and, just as importantly, why are they not supporting exemption for all businesses—small and big—from these ridiculous penalties and this ridiculous enforcement regime?I have not been here for as long as some honourable members, so I have not seen as much legislation go through, but this has got to take the cake. For the time I have been here this is probably the silliest piece of legislation I have seen. I have seen some silly legislation in this House and in other houses. This is the silliest. It takes the cake. Maybe the honourable ministers responsible, the Minister for Small Business and Tourism and the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, are having a little competition to see who can have the silliest legislation. This one is taking an early lead. We have 2½ years to go of this term so it may get pipped at the post as we go, but they are certainly making a strong start early in the term.Let me turn to some other aspects of this bill. I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Mitchell steal my thunder on this. He actually made the point that I was going to make—and all credit to the honourable member for Mitchell. He actually made a valid point about this. This bill provides for the abolition of the superannuation holding accounts, special accounts, which were put in place in 1995 to receive funds paid as part of the superannuation guarantee where those contributions cannot be paid into employees’ superannuation funds. This is particularly important for itinerant industries—fruit pickers and others who move around the countryside. There has been some growth in publicity for web sites which allow people who have left their employment without a forwarding address to go back and get the appropriate superannuation rolled over into their current fund, and I hope that more people do that. That is good for them and it is good for the economy. However, as the honourable member for Mitchell said, the SHASA pays no interest and does not charge any fees. The government says that SHASAs are no longer necessary because the retirement savings accounts offer similar low-cost benefits for employers.I say to the government, with respect, that the evidence is to the contrary, and the honourable member for Mitchell made this point. He might be voting with Labor on this item. I did not get the impression he was going to support the amendments protecting small business because he showed how out of touch he was with small business. He said the two-page form, which needs a 55-page explanatory memorandum, was very simple. It is particularly simple for the honourable member for Mitchell. I am glad he found it simple; I am not sure that the small businesses in his electorate will. The retirement savings accounts do charge fees. In the financial year 2003-04 the total expenses of retirement savings accounts were 2.3 per cent of assets under management. The average fees and expenses of superannuation funds for the same period were 1.3 per cent. The evidence is that the returns on RSAs are not as high as those for other superannuation funds. They are certainly not high enough to justify their fees.I do not mean to disparage retirement savings accounts. They are a legitimate choice for many people. However, I fail to see the logic of the government’s arguments. They say RSAs are a suitable replacement for the SHASAs, but the evidence is that they charge high fees and do not have comparable returns. The honourable member for Mitchell said he would like the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer to come in here and explain that. I endorse his request. I think he should hear the explanation for that because it does appear to defy all logic.Let me return to the central items of this bill. I commend Labor’s amendment, as moved by the honourable member for Hunter and supported by the honourable member for Watson—the two relevant shadow ministers. It is fair, it is sensible and it provides some relief for small business. I call on all honourable members to support it. This should not be a matter of politics; this should be a matter of supporting small business.Let those honourable members who go around talking to the papers and the chambers of commerce in Western Sydney, Parramatta, Blacktown, Penrith and Campbelltown and those Liberal Party members who hold small business functions—morning teas and fundraising dinners and no doubt fundraising lunches and breakfasts—come in and justify to those people why they are voting against Labor’s amendments. It is not too late. The speakers list is out and there are only three government speakers, but I am sure the Chief Government Whip would allow more speakers from the government to come in here and justify their position. I suspect that they will not because they find it hard to defend the indefensible, and that is unsurprising. They find it hard to come in here and say, ‘We are the party of small business and, by the way, we are voting for increased compliance costs and penalties which involve jail terms and which do not apply to shonks in the property industry but will apply to people running milk bars and other small businesses throughout suburbs in electorates in Western Sydney.’ I do not think they will do it and it will be to their eternal shame.","Second Reading","SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
251,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Tollner, David, MP","00AN4","Solomon","CLP","N/A",105,"—Many members will know that before coming to this place I had a career in the superannuation industry. I worked for a couple of years as an insurance and investment multiagent working for various banks, insurance and investment companies. Early in 1992 I moved to an industry super fund, the Australian Retirement Fund, where I continued to work until I was elected in the seat of Solomon.I have followed the superannuation choice of funds debate for several years now, and it surprises me that members opposite constantly refer to this legislation being an attack on industry superannuation funds. There are generally two types of funds around: there are public offer funds and those not for offer to the public such as public sector funds—which are exempted from this legislation—and corporate funds. Corporate funds will be the big losers in this legislation because they have no ability whatsoever to attract new members. They are the types of funds that are run by large companies that provide a superannuation account for their employees. They are only open to employees of the company or the entity that runs them. Because they cannot attract new members the only thing that can happen is for them to lose existing members.With public offer funds, we know that there are small self-managed funds, which are required to have fewer than five members, and they make up a miniscule part of the superannuation industry as a whole. However, the people who start those funds tend to be the higher earners, the high net worth people, because administratively they are very expensive. But they do allow greater flexibility in investment and retirement options for those people who take them out.The other funds are retail or commercial funds and the industry superannuation funds. I want to dwell for a little while on the fundamental differences between industry superannuation funds and retail or commercial funds. Industry funds are probably the only mutual superannuation funds that exist today. They are funds which are called ‘not for profit’. All profits go to account holders of that fund. Profits are not creamed off to pay the shareholders or to pay commission agents. Ultimately, the owners of the funds are the members of the funds. The design of these funds has a couple of interesting benefits. Because there are no shareholders or paid commission agents, those funds do not have the overheads that the commercial or retail funds do. The funds can manage to keep fees very low for members because they can access wholesale investment products in the investment market.It stands to reason that the bigger the industry fund the better it is going to be for the members. There are economies of scale with superannuation, as there are with most other things. To buy one egg costs you so much money; to buy a truckload of eggs reduces the unit price of each egg. The same principle works in investment markets, so the larger industry funds have tended to perform extremely well over recent years. The fund that I worked with has somewhere around half a million members and has performed exceedingly well. The fees are around $1 per week for members. The returns have been exceptionally good. For the last two years the fund has won the award for superannuation fund of the year.We have heard a bit tonight about compliance burdens. One of the biggest compliance burdens for superannuation funds, be they retail or industry funds, is the superannuation surcharge. That has massive compliance costs. In industry super funds—evidently the funds that our friends opposite recommend to people—a lot of their members are paying for those compliance costs throughout the whole fund. So I was quite surprised to hear earlier tonight that the Labor Party opposed the abolition of the superannuation surcharge, because ultimately the superannuation surcharge affects not just the high-income earners but members of all funds; they are all hit with meeting the compliance costs. As I said, the bigger the industry fund the better. Over recent years we have seen mergers of many funds because they have realised that either you get big or you get out. Small industry superannuation funds will not survive in the current climate.I find it interesting that members opposite, for the last few years, have seen choice of fund legislation as an attack on industry superannuation funds, when industry superannuation funds themselves are screaming for the introduction of choice of fund legislation. They can compete, they can compete very well and they can compete on their own terms. Industry funds have matured in the marketplace and they are ready to stand on their own feet without award compulsion. Award compulsion is how industry funds started. As you will know, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the late eighties, with the introduction of award superannuation, employers were forced to pay into their industry’s superannuation fund. Those funds quickly grew through the compulsion that employees had to be members of those funds, and they thrived as a result.The point of all of this is that the way the retail funds operate is quite different. Retail funds and commercial funds are set up primarily as a mechanism to pay dividends to shareholders of the entities that own those funds. The second priority, of course, is to provide a return to their members. Retail and commercial funds generally market themselves in the community by way of commissioned agents and financial advisors. So there are costs for those funds.You can weigh up the differences. The commercial funds have a very active army on the ground of advisors who willingly run out there to sell their product. If they want to sell more product, they merely have to increase the commissions on the policies they sell, whereas industry funds tend not to engage commissioned agents. The reason I mention this is that I was reading an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday, 28 May by Simon Hoyle, who was commenting on an industry fund’s advertising campaign:If you could increase your retirement savings by $76,000 simply by paying lower fees, you’d probably grab the opportunity with both hands. That’s exactly the reaction industry superannuation funds were hoping you’d have when you saw advertisements they were running, in print and on television, before the introduction of fund choice on July 1.But the funds’ plans are on hold, at least for the time being, after the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on Friday raised concerns about the content of the advertising. ASIC’s main concern is understood to centre on the ads’ comparisons of average fee levels for industry funds and retail master trusts. It’s believed the regulator thinks it might be misleading to project those fees over a long period.The article goes on to mention the regulator’s concerns:At the centre of the regulator’s concerns are the assumptions and calculations used to produce the numbers in the industry fund ads.The financial modelling was done by superannuation research and ratings firm SuperRatings. Jeff Bresnahan, the firm’s managing director, stands by the calculations. “We were asked to provide a series of comparisons, and we did so with a series of variables that we built into the models,” he says. Wherever possible, he says, SuperRatings used assumptions suggested by ASIC on its consumer website. “We have total control over the sourcing [of data] and modelling,” Bresnahan says. “We did work off a brief from IFS ... but I am quite confident that the results are fair and representative.”… … …An advertising campaign was seen as the only effective way for the funds to communicate with the public. They can’t rely on the distributors of financial products—mainly financial planners and investment advisers—to do the job.Commercial fund operators are not planning a marketing campaign to counter the industry funds’ message. But a commercial fund operator doesn’t need to advertise a fund to make it attract money; all it has to do is crank up the commission it pays or provide some other incentive to its distribution force.That says in a nutshell what the differences are between the industry funds and the commercial funds. I am not going to take sides and say one is better than the other, but clearly they are different. Clearly one offers better returns and lower fees; the other offers, I suppose, personal advice and support throughout the time you hold a policy with that particular entity. What concerns me is that ASIC have decided to intervene in this matter. I am concerned that, in a choice regime, they are not allowing adequate information to get out to the public to allow people to compare funds. They seem quite happy to allow financial advisors to go and talk to a multitude of Australians about how to make a choice, but they do not seem happy to allow that advice to be aired in a public advertising campaign.I intend to follow this through with ASIC and find out exactly what their concerns are. I would have thought that, if they had concerns, they would have had some modelling done. But evidently that is not the case. They are asking that the industry funds group putting this advertising campaign together to vindicate their figures.I would like to comment on a couple of points that were made by members opposite. Firstly, the member for Hunter seems to have some problem with the closing of the superannuation holding accounts reserve and the redirection of funds to RSAs that would normally go to SHAR. His concern was that RSAs are run by banks and, in some way or another, it is not good to let banks look after this money. I should inform the member for Hunter that it is not just banks that run RSAs. Credit unions and his friends at the industry superannuation funds also run RSAs. They are just as likely to pick up the funds that would have normally gone to SHAR and that will now go to banks, credit unions or industry superannuation funds. I cannot see the need to retain SHAR, considering we now have the lost members register. It is a lot easier to locate lost members; there are protocols between superannuation funds that have identified lost members and work is happening more and more to find lost members and ask them which fund they would like to be in.Another concern the member for Hunter had was to do with compliance costs for small business. Since it became an issue several years ago that the choice of fund regime would cause costs for small business, there have been a lot of technological developments that will obviously be the answer to the compliance costs for small business. Most small businesses that I am aware of these days have bookkeepers, accountants and access to computer technology. Those ones that do not are generally small employers of the micro size, where sending off one or two cheques a month is not going to make a great deal of difference to compliance costs.The member for Prospect seeks to exempt small business from the superannuation choice regime. He says it is because one person may want to get into a self-managed fund. I find that quite bizarre. Generally, as I say, there are not very many people in the work force in self-managed funds. They are generally high net worth people of considerable means who have a full understanding of how the choice system works and are fully capable of arranging their own affairs to make sure that an employer can contribute to their fund. I see no reason why employers with fewer than 20 employees should be denied the opportunity for their employees to make a choice.For a number of reasons, including some of those which I have just mentioned, I support the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005. I do not have a problem with funds getting in there and fighting it out for their members. I would like to see a level playing field. I would like to see ASIC get on the program, get out of the way and let the industry superannuation funds advertise their products fairly. But I see that industry super funds these days have matured greatly, certainly compared with the early days when I worked with them. They are ready to stand on their own two feet, not worry about award compulsion and compete in a free marketplace. I am more than happy to support this bill.","Second Reading","SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
252,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"O’Connor, Brendan, MP","00AN3","Gorton","ALP","N/A",108,"—I rise to make comment on the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005, to reflect on the amendment that has been moved by the shadow minister and to inform the parliament of the concerns I have, and others share, in relation to this matter. There is no doubt in my mind that there has been a lot of ideological positioning by the government in relation to this matter. I do not accept for a moment that the government has considered the adverse effects that will flow from the enactment of this bill, not only to small businesses—and we have focused primarily this evening on the concerns they have about what will happen if this legislation, certainly in its present form, is enacted—but also to employees. I know many members, certainly on this side of the House, share a concern about the potential effects upon employees.It is a little rich to listen to members of the government seeking to lecture the Labor Party on superannuation. I really think it is a little rich for the government to attempt to put to members of the Australian Labor Party in this parliament a view that the government somehow have a great record on superannuation. The fact is that the coalition, when in opposition between 1983 and 1996, had to be forced kicking and screaming to the table to support the legislation in relation to super in that period. Indeed, there were circumstances in which they opposed the superannuation guarantee contribution that was enacted by the Hawke and Keating governments.We know which party and which governments have made the most significant contributions to the fundamental underpinning of super in this nation. It certainly has not been this government. In fact, in almost 10 years this government has done very little to improve upon the policy that was created over that 13 years Labor were in government. What we do know is that in 1996 the Treasurer introduced a surcharge—in reality a tax—on a significant number of employees, and it has taken almost nine years to abolish that tax. The Treasurer, on behalf of the government, managed to impose the tax and now he is abolishing the tax. I would suggest, and I am sure many would agree with me, that it is not really a great improvement to the super scheme of this nation to impose a tax and then remove the tax and effectively boast that you are doing something in relation to super.My personal view is that we should have moved on from the nine per cent superannuation guarantee contribution that is made by employers to employees in this country. If we were serious about national savings, we would have gone a lot further than the maintenance of the nine per cent and there would have been some building upon the efforts made by Labor governments between 1983 and 1996.I can recall how many workers were without any form of superannuation in the early 1980s, and certainly before that time. In fact when I sat at the kitchen table speaking to my dad and other family members, superannuation to us was a benefit to a certain group in society, not necessarily the average, ordinary workers—those who worked with their hands and worked in factories, those who worked in banks as tellers or those who worked as tradespeople. Those occupational groups rarely had any form of savings whatsoever. I am talking now about the 1970s and early 1980s. It was not until the Hawke government introduced some form of compulsory contribution that we started to see universal superannuation for employees in this nation. As I have said before, that was resisted by the coalition parties in opposition.So we do not really need a lecture from the government in relation to superannuation. What we do need, however, is a policy that makes it easier for those responsible for operating the schemes and, indeed, for those who will be affected by the schemes. What we have said this evening, and will say tomorrow as this debate continues, is that there has been a failure by this government to really understand the adverse impacts on the way in which employers, particularly small business employers, will be able to apply the provisions of this bill if enacted. So I would like to take the opportunity to touch upon some of the concerns that I have, and I know others share with me, in relation to this matter.Firstly, we know that the bill itself leaves open the possibility for employers to be liable for either a fine or, even worse, a jail sentence if they are placed in a position of providing advice unwittingly to an employee in relation to what super fund the employee wishes their contributions to be placed in. As I understand it, the view of government is that that is not a concern, is an unlikelihood and would not eventuate from the passing of this bill. But as the member for Prospect and others have said in this debate, we could remove all doubt by accepting the amendment moved earlier which would remove the penalty provisions of the FSR Act that provide for jail terms of up to two years and/or fines of $22,000 if employers give advice in good faith in the context of choice of superannuation fund implementation.That should be very easy to do. If there is any doubt, and if the government would like to see this bill passed with the support of the Labor Party, all it has to do is support the removal of the possibility of employers being penalised, either by fine or by jail. I cannot see why the government would not accede to that request and accept the amendments. They have been put in good faith and they should be accepted in good faith so as to remove all doubt in the minds of members in this place and, more importantly, in the minds of small business people who on 1 July will be confronted with an enormous amount of paperwork. As we know, it is a two-page form, but it has a 16-page guidebook. For the employee there is a two-page form and a 55-page guidebook. Those things are about to hit all the businesses in this country. What we can do tonight, if the government accedes to the proposition by Labor, is to remove all doubt that those penalties could apply.Further to that, Labor believe that we must exempt those small businesses that have fewer than 21 employees from the provisions of choice of superannuation fund. We do not believe that is a very difficult thing to do. We listen to the government day in, day out talk about their concerns for small business, yet they have failed to concern themselves with the compliance that will be precipitated by the enactment of this bill. The amount of paperwork and red tape that will apply as a result of this enactment is going to make it a lot more difficult for small businesses. Some will deal with it better than others. There is no doubt about that. For example, if the small business operator is lucky enough to have all of his or her employees wanting to join the same fund, there will be less of a problem in relation to the regulations required. Equally, if it is a medium-sized company there will be less regulation, or if they have on their books someone who looks after these arrangements and looks after the payroll and all of the administrative matters it may be a bit easier.But think for a moment of those very small businesses where the employer happens to do a range of things because they are too small to hire specialists. It will fall entirely on them to undertake these functions which are being thrust upon them by this government. Think of the concern that small businesses of maybe four or five people will have if this bill is passed. I listened earlier to the wisdom of the member for Solomon, and I have to say that I do not agree with him when he says that all of the small businesses that he knows of have accountants, bookkeepers and the like. That is clearly not true; it is clearly not the case. I think he should go back to Darwin and spend a bit of time walking through the streets, going into the shopping centres and talking to the small businesses in that city. He would find—and it should not take too long—that it is not the case that small businesses have specialists undertaking the administrative functions or the financial decisions for the employer.As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, the small business people in your own electorate, and indeed in mine, have to do a myriad of tasks. And this bill, if enacted—particularly if enacted without the amendments that has been proposed by Labor—will compound the problems already inflicted upon them. Let us remember—because I can assure you that the small business people have not forgotten—that it was this government that turned them into tax collectors. It was this government, when it introduced the GST and imposed that regressive consumption tax upon the nation, that created a responsibility on all of those small operators to become tax collectors, apart from everything else. This government has form in relation to adding compliance regulations and red tape, or whatever you want to call it, to small businesses. And they are doing it again. Labor is giving the government an opportunity to remove that level of compliance for at least those small operators with fewer than 21 employees. We ask the government to seriously consider it.With respect to employees, choice about superannuation is very significant. As you well know, superannuation is probably the biggest saving that ordinary workers will ever have. They may have their houses and some assets but effectively, near the end of their working lives, close to retirement, the biggest asset they have is their superannuation. Throughout the course of their working lives, decisions made about super are very important. Having said that, I do not think we can assume that the five million workers whom it has been asserted this bill will cover would necessarily be able to understand all of the regulations and requirements to make an informed choice about superannuation. So we on this side are concerned that too little information has been provided to employees on what would be, without exaggeration, one of the largest financial decisions of their lives—the choice of a superannuation fund. They will have to choose a superannuation fund in a climate where the white shoe brigade will be spending money on advertisements, selling their wares and attempting to convince employees that they have the best scheme. All the snake oil merchants will be out there, hoping to seduce employees into a particular scheme.Under all of that there will be very little transparency—because there does not seem to be enough prescription in relation to that—about entry fees, exit fees and fees to administer the funds. Employees will not have the wherewithal, the inclination or the information to understand exactly the decision to be made. But it is imposed upon them by this government to make a choice which may lead them to find themselves out of their current arrangements.In theory I have no problem with allowing employees to have choice but I do have concerns about the way in which this is structured. I actually printed from the web site, just this evening, the ‘Choice of superannuation fund standard choice form—information for employees’. I have a law degree. Hopefully I can understand this one-page document, but in looking at this document I am concerned that employees will be greatly confused about how to fill out this form. The form has a heading ‘Option 1’ and underneath that there is a line which says:You do not have to choose a fund.That is the title of option 1. You can imagine that many employees who do not have a great deal of knowledge about the types of superannuation funds available may say, ‘I guess I can choose option 1. That way I do not have to choose a fund. That way the status quo will remain because I am not making a choice as to a fund.’ I can assure you that many employees will assume that that will mean that the status quo will remain. But the status quo will not, or may not, remain. If the employer chooses as the default fund a super scheme other than the one that the employee is already under—that is, if the employer chooses a different superannuation scheme—and then the employee ticks option 1, that employee unwittingly will find himself or herself in a different super scheme.I can assure you that in the first paragraph of this supposedly simple form there is already a capacity for people to make a mistake. They will make that mistake by filling out the form under option 1 ‘You do not have to choose a fund,’ and they could find their retirement money, their savings, diverted to another fund. That is a real problem. You would not want to have any problems with your vision, but if you look closely at that first paragraph you can see a line that says:This may not be the same as your current fund.You would almost have to get out the magnifying glass to read the small print on the form. When employees are basically told, ‘You do not have to choose a fund,’ then I can assure you that they will assume that that choice will leave them with the status quo, when it will not leave them with the status quo—or it may not, if the employer changes the fund. Whether this bill is passed, with or without the amendments proposed by the Labor Party, it is very important that we get the paperwork right.This is already on the government’s web site. As I understand it, listening to the shadow minister in the MPI last week and again this evening, the government is not even putting out these sorts of forms anyway. But they are on the web site. If I am confused, I would say that many others may be confused. If the government is concerned about employees making an informed choice and a genuine choice then it should be ensuring that they do not consider option 1 as the status quo, because it may not be.Mr Deputy Speaker, you have to give the government some credit: they have managed to offend small business people and employees at the same time. Normally they go after employees. It is usual for them to go after workers; it is a sort of default mechanism of the government. We understand that. They hate workers. But when you see them go after small business people and employees at the same time, you have to take your hat off to them. They have managed to offend small business people in effectively imposing compliance, red tape and bureaucracy on the one hand, and on the other hand they are going to make it very difficult for employees. On that basis I ask the government to consider the amendments, otherwise we cannot support the bill.

253,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Hayes, Chris, MP","ECV","Werriwa","ALP","N/A",112,"—I rise today to speak in strong support of the amendment put forward by the opposition to the Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005. I cannot help but think what the small business owners and operators must be thinking about this bill. Here we are 30 days away from the introduction of superannuation choice for all employees, except for those who are ineligible, and the government is hurriedly trying to get through the finishing touches to this legislation—finishing touches, mind you, that have been foreshadowed since March but have only recently been introduced to the parliament.This is legislation that should have been completed long ago. It is a mess that we are in, but I am glad that this has occurred because it has given the opposition the opportunity once more to try to convince government to take some notice of the concerns of small business. It is another opportunity to point out the serious flaws in this superannuation choice plan. It is another opportunity for Labor to add a few of its own finishing touches to the scheme. It is another opportunity for the government to support the exemption of small business from the super choice plan.Whilst some may think that Labor’s campaign to exempt small business from super choice and to point out the flaws in the legislation is merely an attempt to differentiate itself from the government this is just not the case. The opposition is clearly concerned about the position of small business—a position that has been reflected through the electorate in the real and genuine concerns of small business owners and operators across the country. Let me take the opportunity to have a closer look at some of the concerns of small business owners and operators.Small business owners are concerned primarily with the compliance costs of the scheme and the associated penalties. First, let us consider the compliance costs. Although small businesses are used to filling out plenty of forms and paperwork for this government, it is surprising just how much time is spent in complying with these requirements. As I began to come to terms with the amount of paperwork involved with super choice, it was at that point that I realised that I was glad to have recently left my small business and entered this parliament.In order to work out exactly what small businesses are obliged to do under the scheme, small business owners have to go through a 16-page document entitled ‘Choice of superannuation funds—guide for employers’, which outlines what has to be done in order to meet their obligations. I can see what is going to go on. Despite the government’s generosity in investing more than $19 million in its super choice advertising campaign with its catchy theme song, most people would not have thought much about superannuation. Regrettably, it is a fact that most people probably do not spend much time thinking about superannuation. However, shortly they are going to have to, as this is what I imagine will be the likely scenario come 1 July.The night before superannuation choice forms must be provided, in many houses, in thousands of small businesses and home based businesses, you will hear the sounds of modems dialling. They are going to log on and get the form and they are going to have to print it off, because the ATO will not be providing all the necessary forms. They are going to download all the forms on superannuation choice on the web site—provided it does not crash. The next morning they are going to hand the standard form to their employees and tell them that this is the form they need to fill out for super choice. The employees are going to say, ‘Super what?’ This is where it is going to get tricky. Of course, having read the publicity available, small business owners know that they can only provide information to employees about what superannuation choice is, about their obligations as an employer and about how the employee nominates their fund. Words during this conversation will be chosen very carefully as small business owners know that if they say or do anything that may be considered as advice or a recommendation they could be faced with criminal sanctions of up to two years in jail and a $22,000 fine.We have all heard that in a few weeks time it is expected that some five million employees will be handed one of the super choice forms. It is a relatively straightforward document. It is two pages in length and gives an employee the opportunity to choose a super fund into which will go their employer’s contributions. Of course, if the employee wishes to investigate further and find out exactly what they are filling in, that straightforward two-page document comes with a very handy 55-page compendium which will give them more information on super to help them make the super choice decision. After receiving the form and getting the limited help that the boss is able to provide, the employee, form in hand, will still be as confused as ever as they walk away wondering what they are going to do next.Let’s face it: this is not a small decision. It is a very significant one. This is about saving for people’s retirement. Even the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer concedes that this is the second largest financial decision that people will have to make in their lives other than the purchase of their homes, and they cannot take advice from their bosses, no matter what their relationship with their employer is. Being a small business person myself and knowing many other people in a similar position, I have to say that we actually have a reasonably caring attitude to staff—at least in my case—and to think that small business operators would not be so disposed to help employees and to give advice if they are asked is just nonsensical.As I mentioned earlier, before I entered this place I was a small business person. I worked pretty hard in my business and I do share the concerns of other small business people. But, in my case, I had one employee. As I read about superannuation choice, I wonder what my position would have been come 1 July. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.Leave granted; debate adjourned.","Second Reading","SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHOICE OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) BILL 2005","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

256,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Sercombe, Bob, MP","QK6","Maribyrnong","ALP","N/A",114,"—Telstra is an extremely powerful organisation within our society. In fact, it is an organisation whose power continues to grow. By this I do not just mean that it is powerful in a corporate sense because of its size but powerful because of the sophisticated technology the organisation utilises, and this sophistication continues to grow through the convergence of technologies. To illustrate this point, I refer to yesterday’s Australian Financial Review, the lead story of which was ‘Telstra’s plan for internet TV revolution’. The story starts off:Telstra is negotiating partnerships with major commercial television networks and key Hollywood film studios as it ramps up revolutionary plans to deliver television, movies and interactive services over the internet.The story goes on ‘They encompass a range of offerings, including built-in personal video recorders’ and the capacity to offer ‘music video and audio streaming, home shopping, multi-media messaging services, educational content and wagering on sporting events’. Interestingly, within the Financial Review yesterday there was an editorial supporting the lead article that started off with the sentence, ‘Telstra’s ambitions know no bounds,’ and I think that is an accurate reflection of the increasing significance of Telstra in our society.The sort of technology that Telstra is increasingly the master of does have a capacity, if managed correctly, to increase the range and the diversity of opinion in our society and in fact increase the liberties in the society. But where these powers and these technologies are concentrated in a particular organisation—an organisation with some of the characteristics of a monopoly—it has quite the opposite effect. These are particularly significant when we are talking about an organisation that the government is hell-bent on privatising because that process removes the very significant constraints of public ownership that puts some limits on the organisation. This is an organisation which has significant problems in its culture, and particularly problems in its management systems.I think this is best illustrated when you look at the way the organisation treats its own staff. I had occasion in a debate in this place back in November 2003 to refer to allegations about Telstra misusing information stored in a database of a subsidiary company—a company called Integrated Public Number Database. More pertinently tonight, I raised the circumstances of Telstra abusing its technology and its role as a manager by invading the privacy of employees. I referred in that context to a Val Butler, and I referred particularly to a constituent of mine, Mr Peter Zabrdac. Mr Zabrdac, as I pointed out to the parliament in a subsequent contribution in June last year, alleged—and I believe with considerable accuracy—that Telstra utilised the software package called Ultra to improperly record telephone conversations he was having that were not connected at all with his workplace duties.I regret to advise the House tonight that I have evidence of another prima facie case of such inappropriate conduct. Ms Kim Sund, who is a constituent of mine, on 25 May emailed the privacy officer of Telstra in the following terms:… whilst conducting a regular one on one appraisal, my one up manager … advised me that my personal calls were being monitored and had been so over the last few months. This was specified by himself in a written document he composed detailing the discussion topics of the one on one meeting. In this document he stated: “None of these calls appear to be of an urgent nature, so I would encourage Kim to utilise her spare time in the afternoons to make these calls”.Time prevents me from going into further detail on this, but there are a variety of Telstra procedures and policies in place to handle this sort of matter and it appears on the face of it that Ms Sund’s calls have been inappropriately monitored by Telstra in defiance of both her own privacy rights and Telstra’s own management protocols. On the face of it, this is a significant abuse of Telstra’s technological power and it is a further example of how Telstra, given its current management culture, conducts itself. I believe this raises serious questions about the important liberties of the Australian public in a circumstance where important constraints on Telstra’s processes are being removed whilst privatisation occurs.

257,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Vasta, Ross, MP","E0D","Bonner","LP","N/A",115,"—Every Australian should be proud that we have one of the best health systems in the world. Medicare ensures that all Australians have access to free or low-cost health care. It is an honour to be a member of the government that has increased spending on health by more that 260 per cent, from $17 billion in 1996 to $45 billion in 2005.In recent years, the government has implemented the biggest improvements to Medicare since it was first created in the 1980s. We have invested $3.8 billion in the Strengthening Medicare package; $2 billion for the 100 per cent Medicare; and $500 million in Round the Clock Medicare. Thanks to these changes bulk-billing rates across the nation have increased from 66 per cent in December 2003 to 72 per cent in December 2004.Bulk-billing rates have also increased in my electorate of Bonner. The simple reason that we have been able to invest this extra money into our health system is because the government has managed the economy sensibly. These additional resources did not appear out of thin air. They are the result of a careful and deliberate policy to keep the budget in surplus and to repay government debt. It was not too long ago that government finances were in a very different state.When the Keating Government was voted out of office in 1996, the incoming Howard government inherited a $96 billion debt. To put this figure in perspective, it is worth noting that the interest payments on government debt at the time amounted to more money than we currently spend on state schools in a year. It is against this background that the coalition government quickly acted to make the tough decisions necessary to get the budget back in the black.One of the hardest decisions the government had to make was to close 43 low-volume Medicare offices across Australia. Four of the Medicare offices closed were in Brisbane, including the office in the bayside suburb of Wynnum. Media reports at the time indicated that the Wynnum Medicare office was being used by an average of only 45 people per day. While I understand that cutting back on government services is never popular, we should never forget that the decision to close down the old Wynnum Medicare office came as a direct consequence of Labor’s financial mismanagement. Fortunately, many things have changed since then. The sacrifices made in 1996 and 1997 have paid off, and we now have more money available to spend on improving government services in our community.The most important change since 1997 is that thousands of new families have moved into our local area and there is a new demand for government services, such as Medicare. Anyone who knows Brisbane’s bayside suburbs will tell you that they have experienced dramatic growth and renewal in recent years. Brisbane is at the centre of the fastest-growing region in Australia and the eastern and bayside suburbs have been growing at least 25 per cent faster than the remainder of Brisbane.At present, the nearest Medicare office is located eight kilometres from Wynnum in Carindale, and a growing demand for Medicare services means that people using this office are often faced with long queues. Last year, the government made the decision to open the Carindale Medicare office on Saturdays to cope with the high demand. With all of this growth occurring, it has become increasingly apparent that bayside residents need their Medicare office back as a matter of priority.As a result, I gave local residents my word that I would do everything possible to secure a new Medicare office for them. Since my election to the House of Representatives last year, I have kept my promise. I have used every trip to Canberra as another opportunity to lobby my parliamentary colleagues about this issue. With the help of the local community, more than 5,000 signatures were collected in support of my fight. I particularly want to acknowledge the editor of the Wynnum Herald newspaper, Mr Ron Goodman, for the vital role he played in mobilising community support for a new Medicare office.Today, I want the record to show my gratitude to the government for listening to the people of the Bonner electorate. Not only has the government listened—it has acted as well. (Time expired)","Medicare","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
258,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Burke, Anna, MP","83S","Chisholm","ALP","N/A",116,"—Tonight I want to put on the record my thanks and appreciation to two wonderful women from my electorate—Elaine Ong from the Box Hill Veterinary Hospital and Dr Audrey De Jong. Both of these phenomenal women have recently been back to Sri Lanka on a couple of occasions to use their skills to help in the post-tsunami reconstruction. Dr Audrey De Jong wrote to me about her post-tsunami visit to Sri Lanka, and I would like to read from her letter tonight. The efforts to rebuild have not been completed, and we should not forget that there are still many people volunteering their time, their resources and their skills in these devastated areas. I think we should not leave them out of our thoughts for too long because the work still needs to go on. Audrey writes:I volunteered to be part of a second medical team that visited Sri Lanka in early February. The team consisted of Specialist Physicians, Surgeons, Psychiatrists, GP’s, a Nurse and a Surgical Trainee.My involvement was as a result of my brother Dr. Quintus De Zylva, a Specialist Physician, who had the first medical team in Sri Lanka just three days after the Tsunami struck to assess on going needs and render whatever assistance at that time. We took with us loads of medical equipment and supplies and medicines, all generously donated.After our arrival in Colombo the medical team headed south. Nothing prepared us for the scenes of devastation we encountered, it was shocking to see so much suffering and loss.In Galle my brother Dr. De Zylva set up a state of art Coronary Care Unit.I would like to put on the record my thanks for the generous donation from Philips Medical Systems who provided six beds. They also sent an engineer to personally set up the equipment and a supervisor trainee to assist the local doctors and nurses in how to use this state-of-the-art equipment. The letter continues:The Psychiatrist ran a teaching session in grief and trauma counselling as the suicide rate was increasing rapidly and the children were showing signs of anxiety and panic.The main hospital in Galle had been damaged and there were about 1200 babies a month being delivered there. A makeshift maternity ward was set up in the Outpatients Dept. ... and there was overcrowding, 3 patients to one bed and on the day I visited there was a baby weighing less than 1 kg who was born. There was no incubator available.We set up field clinics ... another 3 1/2 hours by road from Galle. We worked outdoors under a Banyan tree and worked in very hot and humid conditions. The message passed by word of mouth that there were Doctors arriving with medicines.On the first morning we saw over 200 patients and after a very short break for lunch, when we returned there were even more. Over the next few days I think we saw an entire village. We started at 8:00am and did not finish till 7:00pm. It was exhausting physically and emotionally but, we just had to keep going. We could not turn anyone away. We ran out of medicines on the first day and had to get another van load of supplies from Colombo the next day. We were the first Doctors that some of them had seen since the Tsunami and that was six weeks later.We treated injuries, infected wounds, saw lots of children, many orphaned, anaemia, malnutritioned, and chest infections and of course depression and sadness after all that they had been through. Just to be able to be there for them was so important but the task was enormous.Where to from here?We intend to keep the support going. Another medical team is being put together—they have already been and returned—and I am planning to go again.Having been there on the ground we are in a better position to advise on what is needed. I am also talking to a local group about our experience in Sri Lanka. People are still giving us donations and these donations are very important to continue the work we have started.Although I was exhausted I came away with a sense of peace and achievement and with some hope that the recovery/rehabilitation process has begun.Elaine Ong, who is a veterinarian, also travelled to Sri Lanka. She writes:After the 17 hour flights, it is another 10 hours by van to the South Eastern coastThe journey is long and hot. The roads are narrow and bumpy. There is no such thing as a luxury vehicle to rent unless you pay a fortune, so all the volunteers have to sit in an old van with no airconditioning and no seat beltsI wondered if I would arrive in 1 pieceHaving arrived at the refugee camp:We operate on 20-50 dogs /cats per day with 2-3 vets and 2-3 dogcatchersThey all receive a rabies vaccination, injections for parasites, antibiotics, flea/tick treatment and multivitamins. The stray animals are let go as there is nowhere to house themThe very ill or injured animals are euthanased humanelyThey also performed many desexing operations to ensure that the animal population would decrease. I do not think people thought about the plague that animals had actually been causing in the area. This is a country that prides itself on being humane to animals. They have trained two Sri Lankan vets and two dog catchers to keep the work going. Much of this work has been done by their own charity as many people did not think about it. I certainly want to thank them for their great work. (Time expired)","Indian Ocean Tsunami","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
259,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Secker, Patrick, MP",848,"Barker","LP","N/A",118,"—I wish to raise a matter that would be of interest to the member for Wannon—not a name that we often hear, but we know he is present—regarding the Border Road. I will explain to the House what the Border Road proposal is all about. On the South Australian-Victorian border there is a surveyed road. Some of it is track, some of it has been sealed by the Wattle Range Council and some of it is unformed. But it is right smack in the middle of the vast pine and ever-growing blue gum plantations in both the electorate of Wannon and my electorate of Barker.There are enormous predictions of extra truck traffic that will transport forestry products, often to the port of Portland in Wannon. It is very important to both federal electorates and it is a state government responsibility. It is a very important road and I have been committed to it for four years because I can see the looming crisis that we would have with the roads in our district, especially in the areas around Mount Gambier, Penola and Naracoorte. At the moment we have the Riddoch Highway, which goes from Keith to Mount Gambier. It is largely a single-lane road with a couple of passing lanes. It is hardly coping with the traffic volumes now, but in the next four years it is predicted that traffic will close to triple when the blue gum forest production comes on line.So it is important that we plan for the future. Unfortunately, the state government has not made any commitment. I know the local state member for MacKillop has been committed for quite a while and I understand the member for Mount Gambier has finally come on board. But we certainly have not had any commitment from either the South Australian or Victorian state governments. This is rather strange. They brought the parliament down to Mount Gambier in the south-east, but they still have not twigged to the fact that probably the biggest issue in the area is planning for road infrastructure.I note in its budget last week the state government announced a paltry $22 million for road infrastructure for all of the rural areas in South Australia. You might compare that with the $200 million or so that the Commonwealth government gives directly to local government for roads. We also found $204 million under AusLink for the Sturt Highway redevelopment in my electorate, $15 million for Dukes Highway and some more for the electorate of Grey. So there have been considerable funds coming from the Commonwealth, but the state government, which is awash with money and seems to be city-centric, is prepared to provide $20 million or so for a tramline in the middle of Adelaide that will go about one kilometre and an extra $80 million for an opening bridge at the port because of a foolish promise made by the Deputy Premier for a bridge that only opens twice a day. Meanwhile, the Border Road is on a major freight route. You can see what the concerns of the Labor government are in South Australia. It is really a very city-centric government.In 2001, the privately owned Auspine company commissioned a study of the cost-benefit ratio of the proposed Border Road project using their own transport data and blue gum harvest estimates. This study did not take into account the other benefits to industry in the south-east and Victoria; nor did it take into account the less tangible benefits, such as reduction of noise, vibration and intimidation by trucks passing through Mount Gambier, Penola, Nelson and Coonawarra and so on, or the improved conditions for tourists. It did not take into account the fact that the Border Road would reduce heavy vehicle traffic, in particular trucks transporting timber on the Riddoch Highway, making it a much less stressful road.

260,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Jenkins, Harry, MP","HH4","Scullin","ALP","N/A",119,"—Seventy years ago, James Henry Scullin, the fourth Labor Prime Minister of Australia during the period 1929 to 1932, wrote:Justice and humanity demand interference whenever the weak are being crushed by the strong.In the year 2005 this remains true, and in no area of public policy at the moment does it ring more true than industrial relations, given the way in which the Howard government is looking to put through wholesale changes to the way in which industrial relations is being carried out in this nation. It can be said that the reforms that are suggested by the Howard government have their basis back when the Prime Minister was Treasurer or even further back to when he first arrived in this place. But saying that does not acknowledge the great changes that have been made in industrial relations over that 30-year period. It flies in the face of considering the contribution made by the efforts of Australian workers and trade unions to the way in which Australia has progressed as a nation.Often we hear the trite saying of the Prime Minister that he is ‘the worker’s greatest friend’. He rolls out statistics about wages and compares them to the period of the Hawke and Keating years but he does so without acknowledging the way in which Australia operated in a cooperative manner. Not only employees and employers but also government were part of a tripartite approach which enabled Australia to progress and reform the way in which the economy was structured. The government sat down at the same table as representative organisations of employers and representative organisations of employees. The accord not only achieved great changes that the government was able to implement but also ensured, through its social wage aspects, that Australian workers got protection way beyond simply what money they got in their pockets.Tonight the House has been discussing a number of pieces of legislation to do with superannuation, and it went forward without the other side actually acknowledging the advances that were made in superannuation, such as the expansion of superannuation to all through the superannuation guarantee that ensures that all employees have access to superannuation. These were achieved through the cooperative efforts of the government and employees through their organised trade unions. It is simply irrelevant to suggest in a debate about industrial relations in the year 2005 that the government has an ideological bent about collective action on behalf of workers. This is a point that I have visited before and will continue to revisit. Those opposite seem to have a penchant for denying the ability of workers to come together as a collective, go forward as a collective and achieve as a collective. That is the basis for and the way in which Australia’s industrial relations has progressed in the past. Denying an employee’s access to organise collectively through a trade union and, by doing that, failing to ensure that there are decent minimum wages and conditions, and denying individuals proper rights in the workplace—these are the things that this House must put its mind to and discuss as we go forward on the pieces of legislation.I see one of the government whips, the honourable member for Corangamite, in this place. The third member for Corangamite was James Henry Scullin and of course Mr McArthur is the 11th member for Corangamite and the longest-serving one. He and I have distinct differences over the way in which industrial relations should be carried out. I hope that one of them is not on the basis that the present member for Corangamite does not believe that ‘justice and humanity demand interference whenever the weak are being crushed by the strong’. In my last comment tonight I want to say to the honourable member for Corangamite that the market is going to Epping because on this basis elected officials of the Labor persuasion saw that they needed to be involved in agitating on people’s behalf because the western solution that he so championed had the support of the millionaire backers and it was on this occasion that the weak banded—(Time expired)","Industrial Relations","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
261,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"May, Margaret, MP","83B","McPherson","LP","N/A",120,"—I want to pay tribute tonight to the surf-lifesaving movement and the impact it has had on my electorate since the beginning of the 20th century. At this time of the year many of my surf-lifesaving clubs hold their annual presentation evenings at which they recognise the dedication and commitment of young men and women to protecting our beaches during the summer months. It may not be well known that at the beginning of the 20th century bathing during daylight hours was considered indecent. How life has changed since those early years. I am told that residents flouted the law, forcing it to be changed so that residents could enjoy our beautiful beaches particularly during those hot summer months. A change in the law meant the now very popular recreational and sporting pastime of surfing began to grow into what it is today: part of the Australian way of life, a way of life that is enjoyed by thousands of visitors every year to our country and a way of life that is enjoyed by both young and old. Seaside holidays were family favourites and the Gold Coast was one of the most popular destinations for a seaside holiday.As surf-lifesaving grew rapidly in popularity, its dangers rapidly became apparent. The sea is unforgiving of those who are inexperienced in water. It is dangerous for those who cannot swim. There was concern by experienced and regular surfers about the rising incidence of drownings in the surf. More experienced surfers began to form themselves into lifesaving bodies to assist those who were required to be rescued from an unfamiliar environment, and so the lifesaving movement began. Surf-lifesaving in Queensland began at Coolangatta Beach, in the electorate of McPherson, on 21 February 1909. From these very humble beginnings of a fragmented voluntary surf rescue service, Surf Life Saving Australia has now achieved world recognition for the outstanding courage and service of its members. At present in Australia there are 285 clubs with over 100,000 members who protect the bathing public around the beautiful Australian coastline. In Queensland there are 59 clubs with in excess of 23,000 members. In my own electorate I have 11 surf-lifesaving clubs. Each of these clubs has its own history. Many of them have been operational for years.Tonight I want to pay tribute to the Tallebudgera Surf Life Saving Club. The club is located adjacent to the Tallebudgera Recreation Camp and approximately 500 metres south of the entrance to Tallebudgera Creek. The Tallebudgera Surf Life Saving Club was formed in 1946 by a group of ambitious young men who had no former training or experience of surf clubs or surf rescue. There was no gear whatsoever. Initially, a reel and line brought down from the Palm Beach club was used to train the first squad. Later, a reel on loan from the state centre enabled the club to mount its first patrols.From these humble beginnings grew a mighty club which is now steeped in history and has gone from strength to strength delivering rescue services to the Tallebudgera Beach area. There have been many people involved in the success of this club—a club of volunteers does not prosper, grow and serve the community without the dedication and commitment of many people. The history of the club is about individual achievements and collective achievements; the success of the club is about the collective skill, hard work and dedication of all concerned over many years. A club of any sort is neither more nor less than a group of people. More than 1,000 members have been connected with the Tallebudgera Surf Life Saving Club over the past 50 years. In addition to those members there are also members of the various committees, juniors groups and supporters clubs.The recent annual awards at the club presentation night were a celebration of volunteers giving to their community. It was a celebration to acknowledge those in the club who had given that bit extra. It was about recognising a new life member, Bob Maskell. It was about recognising Ian Hamilton, Chris Gregory, Emma McAuliffe and life saver of the year Erin Harmer. There were many others—special helpers Ron and Ursula, best junior Tenille and many others. There is not time tonight to name them all, but to each of the winners go my sincere best wishes for the contribution you have made to your club and your community over the last 12 months.Surf Life Saving Australia is primarily a volunteer organisation. Surf-lifesavers are rostered on beach patrol duty by their clubs, and they complete these patrols in their own time and for no pay. From its earliest days, the association’s motto ‘Vigilance and service’ has not changed. The role of surf-lifesavers is to watch over and care for the people who use the ocean beaches. To that end, the record speaks for itself—almost 500,000 lives have been saved. We all need to continue to see the red and yellow flag and our surf-lifesavers remaining on our beaches during the summer months for many years to come.Question agreed to.","Surf-lifesaving Movement","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

These wonderful gentle giants of the sea, renowned for their long oceanic treks around the world, their unique communal hunting, communications and social activities, are still unforgivably being hunted and killed. But, what is worse, they are being killed and slaughtered in Australian territorial waters.Many people today may be thinking to themselves, ‘Hang on. Surely we banned that sort of thing ages ago.’ And they would be right in thinking that. Whaling was officially banned in Australian waters in 1981 when the Whale Protection Act 1980 came into effect. This was back in time when Australia was one of the leaders in the international efforts to protect whales. Australia also played a key role in the declaration of the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary in 1994. Under Australia’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, it is made very clear that killing whales in the Australian Antarctic Territory is illegal. Whales in Australian waters are protected by Australian law and it is time the government enforced its own legislation. The Prime Minister’s 2001 election policy on whales stated:The government has strengthened domestic legislation protecting Australia’s whale and dolphin species. Under the EPBC Act, Australia’s entire Exclusive Economic Zone has been formally declared the Australian Whale Sanctuary. This offers unprecedented protection for all [whales and dolphins].Since 1994, the Australian Antarctic Territory has been part of our exclusive economic zone. However, since 2000 Japanese factory ships have slaughtered over 400 whales within Australia’s waters as part of Japan’s notorious ‘scientific’ whaling program. Australia has a proud history on environmental issues such as preventing the slaughter of whales. Given this proud record, current moves by Japan to increase its killing of whales should be strongly opposed. Unfortunately, the values of those progressive and enlightened governments of the past do not seem to be reflected by the federal government today.I would like to congratulate, however, the state and territory governments who have joined with the federal opposition in condemning the Howard government for its failure to effectively oppose the proposed slaughter of humpback whales and the proposed increase in the slaughter of minke whales. In its recent communique, signed by every single state and territory government and by the federal opposition, demands were made of the federal government in this regard.I also draw attention to the fact that I have launched a petition within my electorate which is being picked up very quickly by my community, who are going to add their voice to mine here today, calling for the stopping of this action—the slaughtering of minke and humpback whales—by Japan, and by any others for that matter. I call on government members to join us in putting all the pressure we can on Japan to ensure that this terrible slaughter is not allowed to occur.","Whaling","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
291,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP","EM6","Murray","LP","Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration",124,"—In this week, when we are thinking about reconciliation—the ongoing business of bringing our various races in Australia towards a better understanding of each other’s history—I thought it would be useful to remind ourselves of how far we have come.I want to refer to a document that is in a book that I had published in the 1970s called Aborigines in White Australia. It is a documentary history of the attitudes affecting official policy and the Australian Aborigines between 1697 and 1973. This is a quote from the Hansard of the progress report of the Royal Commission on the Aborigines, in July 1913. It comes from the South Australian parliamentary papers. The chairman, the Hon. J Jelly, asks Mr EC Stirling what he feels should be brought to the attention of the royal commission review. Mr Stirling, an expert in Indigenous affairs at the time, stated:I would like to refer to the half-caste children. My opinion is that the more of those half-caste children you can get away from their parents and place under the care of the State the better. I think you should take them at an early age. Supposing they were taken charge of by the State Children’s Department it would be easier to deal with them if they were taken when they have the attractiveness of infancy. There is always something attractive in the infants of all races, whatever be the color. You would get people to take those children young who might be disinclined to take them when they were older. I think that it is the best way to save the half-caste children—take them away from their surroundings. When they are caught young they are far less inclined to revert to their old state. There is a strong tendency among the half-castes when they have grown up to go back to the ways of the natives. They are far less likely to do that after they have had a long contact with civilization.The Hon. J Jelly asks:What would be a suitable age to remove them?Mr Stirling answered:I think when they are about 2 or 3 years of age.The question was asked:You would not recommend that they be taken away when they are absolute infants?Answer from Mr Stirling:No; because then you would have the burden of them that all children are at such a young age. When they are a couple of years of age they do not require so much attention and they are young enough to be attractive.Question from Hon. J Jelly:Do you think that their experience of two years with the black mother would seriously interfere with them?Answer from Mr Stirling:No. There would not be time for them to establish habits and customs. I am quite aware that you are depriving the mothers of their children, and the mothers are very fond of their children; but I think it must be the rising generation who have to be considered. They are people who are going to live on.We have come a long way since 1913. Thank goodness! I commend our government for the work it is doing in making better the lives of all our Indigenous fellow citizens, especially the stolen generations. I commend our Prime Minister’s recent statement to the nation giving our government’s support for all things that will help, both symbolically and materially, in our progress towards walking together in the next century.","Reconciliation","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
292,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Lawrence, Dr Carmen, MP","XS4","Fremantle","ALP","N/A",125,"—I want to argue today in favour of a royal commission into the unarguably unlawful detention of Cornelia Rau and the treatment that she received while in detention. I have spoken to a lawyer representing Cornelia Rau and I am aware of work by the University of Newcastle Legal Centre.There are clear problems with the Palmer inquiry. It is no reflection on his integrity, simply a question of the process. Unlike a judicial proceeding, you cannot test the evidence. We do not know what evidence has been provided to Mr Palmer, so lawyers cannot ask questions about it, challenge the claims, collect relevant dissenting opinions and so on. One of the lawyers at least has had experience in dealing with DIMIA—the recent case in the South Australian Supreme Court is illustrative. Only after systematic questioning and independent psychiatric evidence did a clear picture emerge of the treatment of two detainees in Baxter.Rau’s lawyer has also been refused funding to enable independent psychiatric assessment or to pursue the questioning of witnesses—mainly detainees who are reluctant to give evidence to Mr Palmer for fear there may be retribution in their cases. The University of Newcastle Legal Centre, acting on behalf of the family, have also raised serious questions about the adequacy of the Palmer inquiry. Limited powers and narrow terms of reference might not allow the identification of systemic failures and those who are responsible for them—it is about what happened, and not why. As I mentioned, there is no protection for detainees alleging potential criminal misconduct. Two such people approached me while I was at Baxter and I have passed that information on to Mr Palmer. But, again, those people are not available for direct testimony. It appears from the terms of reference that the Palmer inquiry will not address questions of the lawfulness of Rau’s detention and may fail to look at the question of her treatment and the provision of adequate care. In my view anyone who is in the sick culture that now pervades DIMIA is unlikely to get adequate care.Palmer is already reported as recommending an open inquiry with judicial powers, after some 200 more cases have been dumped in his lap. He suggests that the Ombudsman might be an appropriate person to conduct that inquiry. I want to argue today, very briefly, against that proposition, based on my own experience with the Ombudsman’s inquiry into the December 2003 disturbances in Port Hedland. At my request the Ombudsman undertook inquiries. DIMIA appointed Keith Hamburger to conduct an internal investigation. The Ombudsman determined that it was ‘professional and independent’. He wrote to me outlining briefly 67 findings and 37 recommendations. The key ones would have prevented what has just happened in Baxter if they had ever been made public and acted upon. He reassured me that the inappropriate detention of people in management support units and their inadequate care would be the subject of change by the department.I have never been able to get a copy of that report under FOI. It remains languishing somewhere on someone’s desk in DIMIA. More than a year ago this material would have been available to the department and in the public arena and I believe would have prevented what has happened to Cornelia Rau and others. We need a full, public, open inquiry, with proper testing of the evidence, and with commitments from the department to systemic change, which is clearly the problem in this case. No more pussyfooting around. (Time expired)","Ms Cornelia Rau","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
293,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Gambaro, Teresa, MP","9K6","Petrie","LP","Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence",126,"—I would like to congratulate Craigslea State High School, one of the fine schools in my electorate, and to mention Kaye Gardner. Craigslea State High School has been chosen as one of 61 Australian schools to trial the federal government’s Family-School Partnerships Framework. Funding from this excellent package will enable the Craigslea State High School to implement and evaluate innovative ways of building strong partnerships between the school and the parents of the attending students. I think everyone in this place would agree that families have a major impact on the upbringing of their children and their achievements and that when schools and parents work in partnership the children perform better, stay in school longer, and enjoy their scholastic days much more. I want to congratulate all the stakeholders who have worked together to draft the structure for the Family-School Partnerships Framework. These include the Australian Council of State School Organisations, the Australian Parents Council and all the staff and students who participated in the program.I would like to take a moment to congratulate the Craigslea State High School on their very proactive approach to improving the standard and amenity of their school canteen. I understand that the P&C association and staff are working through a plan that will not only modernise the facility to the new standards that the community desires in the range of nutritional food available but also, quite innovatively, change the canteen from a place ‘where food is’ into a cafeteria that has the potential to become the social hub of the school and to have a positive impact on the whole tone of the school and school life.As well as achieving the desired result of a much more nutritious and innovative menu for students, it is envisaged that this modernisation will make the new cafeteria a far more attractive place in which parents will be delighted to volunteer to participate and, again, strengthen links between the school and parent communities. It is also pleasing to note that students are being actively encouraged to be part of this upgrade and that the P&C are strongly motivated in their support of this particular project.The two programs that I have just mentioned are the types of progressive development in education that I know members in this place strive to achieve for all of the schools in their electorates. I want to particularly thank all of the school community—the parents and all of the students at Craigslea State High School. I know that they are going to be the beneficiaries of a terrific canteen, or tuckshop, when it is finished. I thank them for their wonderful achievements to date and congratulate them once again.","Craigslea State High School","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
294,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Hayes, Chris, MP","ECV","Werriwa","ALP","N/A",127,"—Child care is a significant issue in our community, an issue of concern to families and an issue that impacts on workplaces. Not unsurprisingly, it is an issue that constituents of my electorate of Werriwa are also concerned about. I bring this issue to the attention of members not simply to pass comment on the government’s child-care policies but to draw the attention of members to the case of the Bambi Kindergarten in Ingleburn. Bambi Kindergarten is a not-for-profit preschool run by the community and established in 1952. It is currently facing eviction because the land on which it stands has been allocated by the Department of Defence to the new Edmondson Park development. The Bambi Kindergarten was established by the wives of soldiers serving in Korea. It acted as a support centre for families as well as an early childhood education centre.Edmondson Park development is not new and I do not stand here today objecting to it. I object to the actions taken by the Department of Defence, in being unwilling to secure some land within the development to retain this facility. I toured the facility in my by-election campaign and was informed by the kindergarten that on several occasions they had been provided with verbal assurances that the land would be secure and the lease renewed.Sadly, this facility is far from secure as the department has backed away from these assurances. Bambi Kindergarten has recently been offered a further, but final, annual lease. Needless to say, this news was received poorly. It left the management, staff and current users of the facility, as well as the community, generally questioning this government’s commitment to the provision of child care. Through the shadow minister for defence and homeland security, the Minister for Defence has been approached to consider options such as gifting the land and allowing the kindergarten to remain or assisting the kindergarten to secure alternative accommodation. To date, I have yet to receive a response from the minister.This kindergarten has a unique historical association with Australia’s defence community. I encourage the minister to intervene to make sure that it can continue to provide high-quality child-care services to the people of Prestons, Horningsea Park, Macquarie Links, Ingleburn and of course Edmondson Park. Child-care places are scarce enough. Why exacerbate the situation by closing down a facility with 200 child-care places per week, a facility that provides affordable child-care services and that has served the community for well over 50 years?","Bambi Kindergarten","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

My electorate of Fisher includes most of Maroochy shire and the city of Caloundra, both of which will benefit from an influx of visitors when winter takes hold of the southern states and their cold well and truly sets in.The weather is just one of the many reasons that so many people from interstate gravitate to the holiday mecca that is the Sunshine Coast. Winter on the coast is characterised by cool nights and warm days. However, even at 23 degrees today, the weather bureau, I am told, says winter appears to have come early to the Sunshine Coast this year: the average temperatures over recent days are lower than we would normally expect. But it does not change the daily movements of the local surfers, who are also enjoying the mild weather. The water may be a bit nippy but I imagine it is much more pleasant than conditions in the southern states.Visitors have a range of options as to what they can enjoy when they visit the coast. For some, it is a leisurely stroll along one of the beaches; for others, it is enjoying the outdoor dining at Mooloolaba. Some, of course, are content to simply enjoy time out, relaxing in the sun.It is easy to gloat when you come from such a beautiful part of the world as the Sunshine Coast. Not only are the water and weather pleasant but so are the people. Visit the coast and you will be greeted by many a happy smile. It is a good lifestyle on the Sunshine Coast, without the traffic snarls of the major cities and without the lengthy travel times to get to the places you want to go.The attributes of the coast are what help to attract a thousand new residents to Queensland each week. The population of the south-east corner of the state is 2.6 million and expected to grow to 3.7 million by 2020. On the Sunshine Coast we would expect our population to double over the next 10 to 15 years, as people move from the rustbelt areas of southern Australia to what is undoubtedly the best part of the country to live.

Some chardonnay-swilling, towny journalist from a publication by the name of Australian Traveller has had the audacity to say that Zeehan and Queenstown are ugly and are ‘must-flee holiday destinations’. This denigration of these two important Tasmanian working towns is not only stupid, even in fun, but plainly not true.All the west coast towns are mining towns, steeped in an incredible history which you have to know and touch. That history can be seen in the curious moonscape hills of Queenstown, in the architecture of the old part of Zeehan and the southern part of Queenstown, and in the opera house and the museums of both towns. This area is a photographer’s dream. Many tourists I have met who may have come for a day end up staying for three or four because there is so much to do and see, if you like your history real and still being formed. You cannot argue with the fact that Dame Nellie Melba sang in the Zeehan opera house; that our own Tasmanian princess, Mary, took her new husband, Prince Frederik, there; and that Princess Anne has also been a visitor. They thought Zeehan was well worth a visit. Neither town has masses of expensive restaurants, shopping malls or trendy coffee shops, but that is immaterial to the real traveller, the one who wants to know what a country is made of, how it became what it is today.The west coast is a region made up of a number of small towns, all with different functions, and set among some of the finest wilderness in the world. It is sold as a whole experience. The west coast produces the wealth of Tasmania in all sorts of ways, and one of those is tourism. Others are mining, forestry and fishing. So if you want a real experience, forget those seagull critics, take a trip to Zeehan and marvel at the conditions people lived in only 100 years ago. Follow the coast down to Strahan and then hop onto our beautiful Abt railway up to Queenstown, where the local people will give you a warm west coast welcome.

I would like to raise the matter of wearing of unofficial, purchased or commemorative medals on the left breast. Following the 2005 Anzac Day ceremonies it was brought to my attention that several personnel were wearing bought, unofficial medals together with their official medals on their left breast. I know that many veterans have also approached the President of the Townsville branch of the RSL, Rod McLeod, about this concerning matter.Australia’s honours and awards system has been recognised throughout the world as being beyond reproach. Medals have never been awarded without detailed justification. Indeed, the recently amended Defence Legislation Amendment Bill increased penalties awarded for personnel wearing official medals to which they have no entitlement. However, there has been no corresponding legislation to preclude anyone—veteran or nonveteran—from buying any number of unofficial medals and wearing these on their left breast, either with or without official medals.To the general public these people appear to be veterans who have rendered invaluable service to our nation. In reality, they are denigrating the real official medals worn with justifiable pride by veterans. Many of these official medals have been awarded for active service which has involved, sadly, loss of life or which has seen personnel wounded physically or psychologically. If we do not do something to preclude the wearing of these unofficial medals on the left breast, our highly regarded honours and awards system will become a sham.I am aware that a succession of ministers has indeed examined this particular issue and, unfortunately, the gobbledegook that comes back from the department has to be seen to be believed. You get words like this:... the Directorate of Honours and Awards has sought and received some legal advice on this complex issue. However, further detailed advice is required before options can be formulated to address this issue and determine a way forward. The Directorate of Honours and Awards has sought further legal advice and a response is awaited ...Too right—a response is awaited.","Honours and Awards: Medals","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[8]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
300,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"George, Jennie, MP","JH5","Throsby","ALP","N/A",129,"—I have been contacted by the Illawarra Legal Centre over the last couple of days concerning the possible closure of the New South Wales Working Women’s Centre and I have been requested to pursue the matter here in parliament. It appears that the centre is faced with somewhat of a funding crisis. Originally the grant to establish the centre was in the order of almost $300,000, which has reduced to $240,000 in the last budget—a decrease in real terms of up to 37 per cent. When the financial problems began to emerge, the funding from the federal government, originally instituted by a federal Labor government, was added to by a $100,000 contribution by the state government. The centre looks as if it might have to close its doors because the demand for its services is outstripping the financial capacity of the organisation to remain viable.I have a particular interest in these centres because, as I indicated, they were first established by a federal Labor government and the purpose of their creation was to provide information, advice and assistance on work related issues for women, particularly women who may not have been members of a trade union and women who were not able to access legal services through payment for those services. Originally they were established in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. On all accounts these working women’s centres have performed well and provided a very valuable service.The linchpin of the centre in New South Wales is its telephone advisory service, which provides confidential support, information, advice and assistance to women who ring. I am told by the centre that the issues of common concern relate to unfair dismissal, discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and caring responsibilities. The demands for the services of working women’s centres are growing the more the labour market is deregulated.It would be a great tragedy if the New South Wales centre is forced to close. It is the only specialist community legal centre in New South Wales for employment related advice and representation for women. In its 10 years of service to working women it has developed a particular expertise in the interface between employment and discrimination law.I believe the government should urgently address the funding problems that beset this centre and that extra funding should be provided to ensure that the New South Wales centre remains open, accessible and viable and continues to provide support to women at work, many of whom as we know are now part-time and casual workers who are desperately in need of such assistance.

It is something that is being experienced right across the horticultural areas of Australia and we are not finding the solution that we need. Sure, there have been a couple of programs introduced such as the working holidaymaker program, under which we have reciprocal arrangements with a number of countries throughout the world, including the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands, Japan, the Republic of Ireland, the Republic of Korea, Malta, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Hong Kong, Finland, Cyprus, France, Italy, Belgium, Taiwan and now Estonia. But with all those arrangements in place to allow students and working people between 18 and 30 to come to this country for 12 months—and, if they work in a seasonal activity in a regional area for three months, to apply for another 12 months—we still have not come anywhere near to solving the problem.My good folk in Kununurra, specifically the members of the Kimberley Primary Industries Association, have made investigations in Thailand. They have established that there is a large list of ready and willing workers to come to Australia from Thailand to contribute their efforts. However, I am not for a moment advocating that we permit an unfettered avalanche of unskilled employees to come to Australia. In this regard I am pleased that the minister has told me that a work and holiday program is being negotiated with Thailand and will see 100 unskilled workers allowed to come and work and holiday in Australia. That is a maximum of only 100.The prime problem in the Gascoyne region of Western Australia and in the Ord Valley at Kununurra is that they are a long way from the bright lights of south-east Australia. Almost 100 per cent of these workers would prefer to be in that south-east Australian region where they can flit a couple of hundred kilometres, get involved in some picking work and then qualify for another 12 months stay while always being on the fringe of those bright lights. What we need to do is come up with some solution that will see these people penetrate through to some distances from south-east Australia. My growers are prepared to foot the bill for some transport, accommodation et cetera if these workers will only come to the Ord Valley. The question is: how do we effectively communicate that? Even though we have some web sites in place today, it is not enough. We need a solution for agricultural workers.

319,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Moylan, Judi, MP","4V5","Pearce","LP","N/A",132,"—Firstly, I congratulate the Treasurer on another successful budget. It is his 10th budget and, if my memory serves me correctly, the eight in surplus. Good economic management does not happen by chance; it has to be planned for. The measures we take now will undoubtedly have a very major impact on the Australian people and the Australian economy in years to come. As the Treasurer has said, measures taken in the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006 and cognate bills will prepare the country for the great demographic changes that are now taking place and anticipated to take place in the next decades. Those changes will undoubtedly reshape our communities over the next several decades. It is never an easy task to work through the many competing demands for funding and achieve a balanced budget in terms of both the bottom line and the competing interests. Like other developed countries, Australia has many challenges, and the added considerations of managing the finances over what is a very vast landscape with a relatively small population base are quite a challenge.The matter of clean water provision, for example, and maintaining a strong environment policy are both very big ticket items for the government, and the government is to be commended for the policies that it has worked through to date with local communities. One of the features of the government’s environment policy is that its detail is worked out with local communities, and local communities help to extend the value of the dollars spent on environmental work and remediation because of the numbers of volunteers who become involved in these projects. The government backs this commitment with a substantial injection of funding and has done so now over several budgets. On this occasion, some $200 million will go to conserve water and improve the state of local rivers and waterways. Once again, I am aware that in many electorates throughout Australia people are working voluntarily in these areas and extending the value of those dollars in their communities. Many dedicated people work in the electorate of Pearce, often on a voluntary basis, to improve the environment and conserve water.One again, the government’s commitment to working with local communities is an excellent one. I have seen evidence of that in many of my country towns. Having a large country electorate and a large geographical area to look after, I see the work that is done in country towns, and it is impressive. One of my country towns, Northam, for example, with a population of about 5,000 people, has won a number of awards for its ecohouse. The ecohouse shows and demonstrates to people how they can conserve energy and water. It is very popular. It has become quite a talking point in the town and a place where many tourists like to go. They can try first-hand and see first-hand how they can, with some simple measures, conserve energy and water in their own homes. The house that has been used as the ecohouse model in Northam, and partially funded by the federal government, is a very old house—I think these houses go back to about the 1950s—so it was quite a challenge for the local council and others helping with this project to find ways in which to conserve energy in an old structure.I would also like to mention the farmers in my electorate who rely on the health of their land for their ongoing living. Farmers know the value of conservation and in my area they work very hard to ensure sustainable agriculture. One of the issues they have been very concerned about over recent times is the eradication of weeds. We have a weed in many parts of the Pearce electorate called Paterson’s curse. It is a huge problem and it has spread alarmingly throughout the electorate. These days, because of good transport routes, a lot of areas in my electorate have become closer to the city and hobby farms have been taken up by city people who are often not there all the time to manage the land as well as perhaps some of the people who have lived on the land all their lives and live on the land and work on the land 24/7.Paterson’s curse has been spreading and a number of constituents have been to see me and have contacted me about what they see as an increasing problem throughout the electorate. I know for them the $60 million that the government has set aside in this budget for weed eradication will be very welcome. The program will include research, biological control, community awareness and action. Assistance will be given to the livestock industry to introduce the National Livestock Identification Scheme for cattle, with work progressing on an identification system for sheep, although this is primarily a state government responsibility. Although there are cattle farmers in my electorate, the livestock farmers are predominantly sheep farmers and I know that these measures will be particularly welcome.In an electorate such as Pearce, which covers around 26,000 square kilometres, roads are a very big issue. We have been very pleased that our minister has committed large sums of money in the past to improve the two main arterial roads—the Great Eastern Highway, which connects my electorate and indeed, WA, to the eastern seaboard, and the Great Northern Highway, which runs through my electorate connecting the northern pastoral and mining areas to the city, the airport and the wharf at Fremantle. So they are particularly important roads. Over the years these roads have fallen into disrepair. It is also true to say that the volume and the extent of traffic traversing these roads has grown enormously, with a lot of large trucking, as you can imagine, coming down from the northern mining areas. These trucks have increasingly taken to the roads and the roads are just not adequate to deal with them. With the intersection of these two roads—one from the east one from the north-west—the works take on important dimensions for industries, businesses and tourism within the Pearce electorate.When we talk about roads we have to think about the mums and dads and the ordinary folk who have to use those roads every day to take kids to school, and we have to think about the school buses that run every day in a country electorate. It is of increasing concern to the general public that these roads are in a safe condition for all kinds of traffic. It is very pleasing now to see the work taking place to improve a very large section of the Great Eastern Highway between Sawyers Valley and The Lakes. That is a very welcome improvement to what has been a notorious stretch of road which has caused the deaths of a number of people. A further $3 million of the funding will be used to build the Clackline bypass in 2006-07. I know my constituents will be pleased with the news that black spot funding will continue, as it has been used on many occasions to deal with particularly dangerous conditions such as poor visibility, surface works and widening and alignment in particularly bad spots of the road—and there are many. Earlier in the year, $330,000 was allocated to improving a roundabout in the town of Northam, which I have spoken about as the town of the ecohouse, and an improvement to a section of the northern Cranbrook Road south of Beverly was allocated $250,000.I would like to put on record that I am grateful for the work of the local community groups and shires that keep me up to date with problem areas and assist me with presentations to our minister to ensure that the roads in the electorate are safe. I am often out on the road with community groups, looking at dangerous spots. They are always the eyes and ears of the electorate and I find it very useful to have these people alerting me to various difficult transport or road safety issues.Moving away from the subject of roads and the economy, can I say that it is heartening to see money being given to carers in this budget. That builds on previous budgets. I had the great pleasure of being the Minister for Family Services when the Howard government first took office. The Prime Minister took a very personal interest in the issue of carers. It was not until the Howard government came in that carers were substantially given a voice in this place. The Prime Minister recognised that many families in our communities care for chronically ill people, people with profound disabilities and the elderly, and that they were doing that with very little support from government a few years ago. In almost every budget, the government has sought to improve the situation for those many families around the nation who care for other members of the family. There is increased support for families and I know that it will be of great assistance to those who care for a family member who is chronically ill, profoundly disabled or ageing.Targeted funding to specific areas of health, including cancer care and dementia, are also welcome announcements. Cancer is a disease that touches the lives of most people at some time. Funding for screening, which allows early intervention, is a measure to save lives that is well known in the medical profession. I am also pleased to see health measures that will target young people, with a youth campaign to discourage young people from taking up smoking.In addition to that, we have had some important changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I know that it requires people to make a small contribution to the cost of their medications. The Treasurer pointed out, and it is important for us all to understand, the cost of many life-extending drugs. The Treasurer used the case of Herceptin, which is used to treat breast cancer. The cost of that drug is around $50,000 to $100,000 per patient per year.Having established in this House an informal backbench group concerned about diabetes, I know that there are many advances in many areas of medicine and pharmaceuticals. These are often life-saving advances. If everyone makes a small contribution to the cost of the medications that they receive to enhance and improve the quality of their lives, it means that more drugs can become available to more people with serious illnesses and, hopefully, either sustain life or improve the quality of life. That is certainly the case with diabetes where there have been some very important advances in recent years with medications that can prevent the early onset of the worst aspects of diabetes, type 2 in particular. It is important that we ask people to make some contribution towards the cost of their medications so that we can ensure that all Australians have access to life-saving and life-enhancing medications.The Treasurer made the point, and I think it is true, that sometimes, if people get medications for nothing, there can be a tendency towards hoarding. That is quite well documented. Many people—I guess we are all guilty of it—have medications in their medical cabinet that are unused and that are subsidised quite heavily by government.With an ageing population and life expectancy increasing, dementia presents a considerable challenge to us for the future. I recently had the pleasure of meeting with Professor Martins, who is an internationally respected Western Australian researcher into Alzheimer’s disease. I have to say his presentation was compelling and disturbing, so I was very pleased to see some of our budget directed towards managing Alzheimer’s disease. The Treasurer allocated $321 million to increase extended aged care at-home places, and the package makes provision for dementia specific training for carers, community and residential care workers, and people working in services such as the police and transport and emergency services. This is quite an important step forward.One of the greatest threats to world peace and stability continues to be abject poverty. We live in a region where many people lack the most basic necessities of life. Opportunity for education and improved access to health care and the ability to become self-sufficient are crucial to tackling the worst ravages of poverty and, in turn, promoting greater community and regional harmony. No countries today live in a vacuum. We are all part of the bigger world. We are part of an important region, and some parts of that region are very poor indeed—you only have to look at some of the Asia-Pacific countries to see that. On Monday, I put a motion to the House with regard to the spread of HIV-AIDS in the western part of China on the border of Laos, north Vietnam and Burma. The number of new cases of HIV-AIDS that have been registered is very disturbing. It is also disturbing to hear from local officials that the spread to mothers and their children is also alarmingly high. So I am particularly pleased that the government does remain committed to playing its part to ease the burden of poverty on our near neighbours. It is in our national interest to assist our neighbours, and this government has been generous in its commitment to many countries in the Asia-Pacific region as well as other countries.However, the centrepiece of the budget is the tax cuts, and these have been made possible through the ability of the Howard government to manage the economy. We expect the economy to grow steadily at three per cent in 2005--06. Unemployment is now at a 28-year low, and it is anticipated that that will stay at a low level. A strong economy with low unemployment is one of the most positive ways to ensure that all Australians improve their circumstances. Having the opportunity to work is one of the best ways to avoid the poverty traps that so many families on welfare face and, along with tax cuts for all taxpayers, I am broadly supportive of the Welfare to Work measures and the money that the government has committed to assisting people to move from welfare to work. I say ‘broadly supportive’ because we must watch this support very carefully. Raising children alone is a very onerous task, and people with a disability have an added challenge in accessing the work force. These people need a lot of support. Adequate child care, decent wages, opportunities to improve education and skill levels, and access to transport and workplaces are all key issues for these people. It is my hope that we will closely monitor the implementation of this policy to ensure adequate support.In the short time I have left, I pause to address the issue of mental health. I have spoken to our government about the concerns I have for people with mental health issues and their access to the work force. Most of these people want to work and are very capable of working, but many of them have an illness which is of an episodic nature and sometimes renders them unable to work on an episodic basis. For them, finding consistent employment is sometimes quite a challenge. I think we have a deficiency in our response across the whole mental health system, particularly at the state level. It is important that we are mindful of some of the most disadvantaged and poorest in our community and that we always ensure that, in the implementation of the policies, these people are given fair access to supporting services.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
320,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Byrne, Anthony, MP","008K0","Holt","ALP","N/A",136,"—I rise to speak in this place this evening, during the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006 and related bills, about a subject that I have canvassed on many occasions. It relates to government and it relates to regulation. It relates to government’s role in regulating predatory practices by major corporations with enormous market power who exercise that power on a group of small businesses. This is an issue that I have raised over several years in the hope that the government would take some action to protect the rights of a number of small business people around the country. I am speaking about the motor vehicle insurance industry and its relationship with the smash repair industry. In particular I want to talk about the predatory behaviour of the motor vehicle insurance companies and the consequences of that predatory behaviour.I believe—and in this place I am going to cite an incident—that the practices of these major insurance companies are creating the preconditions for a potentially lethal accident. The practices that they are forcing crash repairers to indulge in are resulting in unsafe cars being put back onto the street. That is a disgrace. Government has a responsibility to ensure that predatory practices being perpetrated by the major vehicle insurance companies on the vehicle smash repairers are stopped, and it does have the capacity to actually do this.I am aware of the fact that there is a Productivity Commission report of an inquiry into the smash repair business, a report which is currently being considered by the Treasurer. I believe it was handed to the Treasurer on 18 March. My understanding is that he has 25 sitting days to form a response. I say to the Treasurer that, in contemplating his response to the Productivity Commission report, he needs to look at, potentially, a mandatory code of practice. There has been some form of discussion in the past about a voluntary code of conduct or practice. My belief, from the experience that I have in talking to smash repair businesses across the country, is that we have gone past the point where it should be just a voluntary code of practice. There are too many incidents where major vehicle insurance companies are using their market power to force unsafe working practices on smash repairers. From a personal perspective, I just do not think a voluntary code is going to be satisfactory. I think there needs to be some legislative instrument that can be used.The motor vehicle insurance industry, around the 2000-01 period, had revenues of about $5 billion in premiums. So that is $5 billion in the year 2000-01 out of a total insurance pool nationally of about $21 billion. It is interesting that more than 90 per cent of all motor vehicle insurance business is done by just four companies: IAG, Suncorp, Promina and Allianz. What that means is that there are four companies with enormous market share. They have a sort of symbiotic relationship with about 5,000 smash repairers across the country.I have raised in this place before some of my concerns about the insurance companies’ use of unqualified assessors. These are people who, in my experience and from what I have been told by the smash repair businesses, are sent by insurance companies to deduce the value of the insurance repairs required to put a car back on the road. The information that I have from some of the documents that I have cited quite clearly indicates that these people are simply not qualified to be making that assessment. In a sense, what they are also doing is creating artificially low assessment prices and then forcing the crash repairers to accept those prices.The other thing they are doing is using incentive programs to drive down the cost of a motor vehicle quotation by an assessor. This document from a major insurance company says, in writing, what happens if you meet certain benchmark standards or go underneath benchmark standards. You quote an average price for a vehicle. If in your overall pool of insurance assessment you meet a target where the quote falls below that, you get a bonus. This is a bonus for assessors to underquote on the real cost of smash repairs. When that happens, the smash repairers are forced to repair the car at a lower cost.These issues have been raised in the past and nothing has been done. But adding to that, and giving the Treasurer something to think about when he is contemplating this report by the Productivity Commission, are two further issues. One is the issue of cash settling. What has happened in recent times is that the insurance companies have basically asked the smash repairers to sign an agreement where they become a preferred repairer. That means that—particularly for someone who has been a preferred smash repairer for 20 or 30 years—if they sign the agreement with the insurance company and that preferred repairer is not on the list, then they have to pay in some cases an additional premium to access that preferred repairer. But what is also happening is that a lot of smash repairers are being forced into a very restrictive arrangement with these major insurance companies. If a vehicle is smashed and needs repairing, the person—under RACV, for example—is obliged to go to the preferred repairers nominated by the insurance company. That sounds really good, but I question the relationship between those preferred repairers and the RACV, particularly when these people are relying upon them for customers, given the market share they have.I want to read a particular insight from a smash repairer who had some dealings with this and was very concerned about being forced into a preferred repairer agreement with the IAG. I will just read onto the record—and he has asked me to do this—some of his concerns about this. The document is titled ‘Paying for freedom of choice’ and reads:IAG Insurance intends to include a new provision in Motor Insurance Policies from November 15th 2004.That has already been done. The document continues:The inclusion will allow the policyholder to have freedom of choice in regard to who will repair their vehicle after an accident.This freedom of choice will cost the consumer an estimated $69.30 on top of their normal Comprehensive Insurance policy.It would appear the idea behind this venture is to achieve something IAG have been working on for several years.Basically the consumer (who believes they won’t have an accident and only take out insurance to be responsible and in case of bad luck) by not taking out the freedom of choice levy will hand over complete control and the right for IAG to do as they wish with the policyholder’s vehicle.The majority of the Auto Body Repair Industry in Victoria and NSW have signed IAG’s associate smash repair contract. In doing so, they have had to invest on online imaging and claims handling systems, which was part of the requirements after signing. The repairers were promised that, after becoming an ASR repairer, the arrangement and new equipment would simplify assessments and generally make it easier to do business with IAG.The new so-called freedom of choice policy (unless the vast majority of IAG clients takes it out) will completely do away with all ASR arrangements and the investments made by repairers. As failure by the insured to pay the extra levy on a policy renewal will take anyone other than a preferred IAG repairer out of the equation and do away with the insured’s freedom of choice.This exercise by IAG is nothing more than an effort to take control of vehicles they insure by using smoke and mirrors and relying on motorists gambling on whether or not they will have an accident.Freedom of choice for the consumer is supposedly a normal and expected part of life in Australia and something the ACCC was commissioned to protect and uphold for both the consumer and business communities alike. And certainly not an issue that can be used by a large company to take control of smaller competitors and the consumer.The fact that IAG has proposed such a scheme—and it has been implemented—shows contempt for both the Auto Body Industry and consumers alike. Especially at a time when the Government inquiry into the Body Repairer and Insurance industry relationship is currently being held.… … …If this policy is rubber stamped by the ACCC, it will have a catastrophic effect on the Body Repair Industry and open the door for the Insurance industry to put in place other such methods of control.It is signed ‘from a cranky crash repairer’—I will not read out the exact words. In a sense, what you have is an enormous insurance company with enormous leverage and market power forcing smaller businesses into an arrangement which does not provide freedom of choice. What happens to significant crash repair companies that are reputable and have been in the game but do not want to do this? What happens is that they are subjected, particularly if they have had an agreement with the RACV, to an operation called cash settling.If you are a crash repairer and you do not want to be an approved repairer or to sign that RACV contract or be an associate repairer, they say, ‘If a person comes to you and is insured by us and wants to get the car fixed up, normally we would ensure a fairly smooth process but unfortunately we are going to pay the customer directly after some period of time and then they can pay you.’ This is a standover tactic by major insurance companies over small crash repairers.Most crash repairers are small businesses. On average they employ six or fewer people. I want to refer to some documents that I have received from some of these smash repairers who feel very uncomfortable about what they are being subjected to. I contend that it is an abuse of market power. I will read these into the record; I have been asked to do this by the people concerned. The first document reads as follows:To whom it may concernDelphic Cove Pty Ltd has been providing the RACV with panel beating services since 1983. In that time, we have served both the RACV and our clients who were insured with them with services that do not suffer from interruption, confusion or delaying tactics.In 2003 RACV implemented a preferred repairer scheme and invited Delphic Cove Pty Ltd to participate. After reviewing the agreement and obtaining expert industry and legal advice, we chose not to be contractually bound to the RACV.The consequences of this action have had adverse consequences for our clients. They have been threatened and inconvenienced in the following ways as set out in the table shown below. The table also sets out realistic times and conditions which clients should enjoy, in the absence of the tactics used by RACV to dissuade clients from exercising their right to freedom of choice.The table then describes the process in the cash settlement situation. Someone lodges a claim. Realistically that would be processed in about five minutes; with RACV it is a half-hour process. A book assessment process should be immediate; the RACV tactic is to take two weeks. An authority to proceed should generally involve no delay but it takes two weeks under the RACV. In a realistic situation, payment should take three days but it takes six weeks under the RACV. In a realistic situation a warranty should be for a lifetime, but under the RACV it is nil. There are also provisions for policy cancellation and other issues in terms of the individual I have just been referring to.Another assessment was carried out by Gerry Raleigh from Kerry Panels. Gerry is a person whom I regard as a person of integrity. He has been attempting to raise these issues of the abuse of market power for some time. He has asked me to read his statement to the House:The cash settling process used by RACV is nothing more than a spiteful effort to make those repairers who do not wish to sign an RACV contract conform.Cash settling by RACV means the consumer is inconvenienced, he will have to arrange the repairs himself, no warranty is offered by the Insurer, he must wait until he receives a cheque and then proceed with repairs.If his vehicle is not driveable then naturally he would probably buckle and use the RACV repairer.A repairer can have a working relationship with RACV for 20 years, but with the introduction of the RACV repairer contract if the body shop does not conform, a wedge is driven between himself and his customer.And that has happened time after time with this particular smash repairer. This person uses some fairly colourful language here and I read this advisedly:The RACV repairer contracts are akin to a Mafia protection racket, in other words we offer you nothing but if you do not sign we will make life very difficult for you.These are not my words. These are his words; the words of a small business person who has been subjected to this abuse of market power. He went on to say:A common practice is for the consumer who stands by his independent repairer to have his policy cancelled.Those are two incidents, and I have one more document that I need to read to the House. This document is important and it is from LP Bodyworks. The person who runs the business says:In these years of operating our business we have acquired quite a substantial customer base, for these reasons we have always tried to work with our industry affiliates such as the Insurance Sector. This is why I would like to express my concerns with some issues, in regards to the way “RACV” as we know is underwritten ... is conducting itself when they implement their “Cash Settling” process with, what they call their “Non Accredited” shops.I would like to make the forum aware that we have been affiliated with RACV in the past and ongoing processes for the last 10 years, but for obvious reasons we stopped our relationship with them two years ago when they decided to revamp their Preferred Repairer Network (PSR). We found that the way this particular Insurer was trying to influence or control the repairer processes, was not keeping the customer’s and the repairer’s views in mind, but simply at cost not quality and most importantly “safety and manufacturers specifications” when it comes to reinstating the consumer’s vehicle.And that is a concern. It continues:This method that the RACV has imposed is nothing more than a ploy to inconvenience and use the customer as a lever hold on the repairer, hoping that they will give in to the pressure and steer them through their own repair networks.That is the third small business. There are many more incidents and there are many more complaints that I have received about the RACV and that cash settling process. Clearly this is abuse of market power and it is something that should be investigated. I note that the ACCC’s Graeme Samuel has said recently that they want to be notified if there are any big businesses using standover tactics, and they are looking at utilising section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act. I am going to suggest that these small businesses start writing to the ACCC. Unfortunately, these small businesses have been saying that they have been raising their concerns with the ACCC and that no action has been taken. But I will be asking each of those people to make submissions to ACCC Chairman Samuel on the basis of the comments that he has been reported to have made in the media.Another issue with respect to the practice of insurance companies is colloquially called a ‘cut and shut’ operation. What does cut and shut mean? There are many cute names and technical terms, but it effectively means that if a car is totalled, if a car suffers extensive damage, if a car—like in the incident that I am about to report—has been half smashed away, the car is cut in half and half a different car of a similar model is basically welded onto it.I would like to talk about the case of a Holden Berlina which was owned by Mrs Sharon Hooper. In May 2004 the car was smashed into from behind and was extensively damaged. It was insured for the value of just over $17,000. It was probably overinsured, but the premiums the Hoopers had been paying for a number of years had been paid on the basis that the car’s value was $17,000. Its actual assessment value would have been less than that. When the car was taken to the RACV’s preferred smash repairer, an extensive quotation was given—it was in the order of $8,000—but the owner and the owner’s husband, Mr Richard Hooper, were basically saying: ‘This car has been totalled. It has been written off. We do not understand why you are attempting to repair this, it is in such a bad state.’ The insurer, RACV, insisted on the car being repaired. The car was repaired. But when Mr Hooper walked in to see what was happening with the car, he noticed that it had been cut in half. He was not even told that this was what was going to happen with the vehicle. When he walked into the premises of the approved smash repairer that had been referred by the RACV, he was told it was a ‘cut and shut’ repair.Mr Hooper picked up the vehicle but, after a short period driving it he realised that it was handling poorly and that the driver’s seat felt different. There is an extensive list of faults, with 31 faults being listed. He took the car back and said, ‘This car is not functioning properly,’ and that he wanted a proper, independent assessment. He left the car there. When he came back to see the progress being made, he found them trying to fix those very faults that he identified. He then demanded, legally, that an independent assessment be conducted. I have a list of 31 faults. It is absolutely extraordinary. The fuel tank was incorrectly fitted. The fuel lines were not appropriately secured. So this car was in fact a death trap. Seatbelts were distorted. The front seatbelts were incorrectly fitted. The fuel lines were incorrectly fitted. The vehicle was driving around right-hand turns; it was on an automatic right-hand turn. This car should have been written off. The insurance company should have had the integrity to have had this car written off.These cut and shut practices, not appropriately supervised, are a way for the insurance companies to cut costs. I will say to the RACV and other insurance companies: if you are going to keep on doing this, I am going to keep on raising it in parliament until you get it right. Stop screwing small independent business holders and start acting appropriately or I will urge the Treasurer, in considering the report from the Productivity Commission, to take the appropriate action and make a mandatory code of conduct.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
321,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Entsch, Warren, MP","7K6","Leichhardt","LP","Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources",141,"—I rise this afternoon to add my voice to the debate on the appropriation bills and to proudly associate myself with the achievements of this government, particularly economic achievements, over the past 10 budgets that we have had responsibility for. This year is no different. There is an $8.9 billion surplus—the eighth surplus since we have been in government. The unemployment rate is at its lowest level in some 28 years and we are delivering some $21.7 billion worth of tax cuts to the Australian people over the next four years. This is on top of the $14.7 billion worth of tax cuts provided in last year’s budget.Another very significant point in this budget is the fact that we have now paid off $90 billion of debt that we inherited when we came to office in 1996. To put that in simple terms, in 1996 we were faced with the challenge of having to find $9.6 billion out of tax funds just to pay the interest on the accumulated debt that we walked into in 1996, before a cent could be paid towards any services to the Australian people. We are now in the situation for the next financial year of having reduced that debt to less than $6 billion, which of course means that we will have in excess of $9 billion in additional funds available to spend on the Australian people. Of course, the more debt we pay off, the more we can commit to other things—it is not rocket science. As the Treasurer said, this is not by accident. It certainly was not a fluke. This is an outcome of very sound economic management.The budget has been extremely generous to my electorate of Leichhardt. I certainly appreciate the contribution to a number of projects, including the ongoing flood proofing of the Bruce Highway at Tully, south of Cairns. There was an additional $2.9 million to assist the state government in their planning works for this program. There was $1.5 million allocated last year to get these works underway and to prioritise them. Unfortunately, the state government have continued to drag their feet. The planning work was supposed to be completed next month for the work to be finished in 2006-07, but we have now discovered that the state government has not been able to achieve this outcome. We have allocated another $2.9 million to see if that can help light a fire under the state government planning authorities to get something done there. It is certainly a serious economic and social impediment in Far North Queensland. Unfortunately, even at this stage we are probably looking at 2008-09, if they actually get their act together, to get it to completion. I have to say that sending the shadow minister from Victoria up there to become a poor apologist for the state government did not do anything for achieving this outcome. I think he would do a lot better if he were to encourage his state government colleagues to start to do some work rather than make excuses for not doing it.Russett Park was another good example of a commitment from this government. Half a million dollars was committed to the Russett Park community and to the Mareeba Shire Council to put a three-metre causeway across a river. For many years the community, which is only about 15 to 20 kilometres from Cairns, has been stranded by that river. Unfortunately that river has taken two lives to date. In spite of a lot of huff and puff from the state government, with the money committed from the local residents, the council and the federal government, people will be able to drive onto a three-metre causeway. However, because of the state government’s reluctance to contribute, there will be quite a significant fall off one end because it is not going to be quite completed, and that is the legacy of the state government. I encourage the council and the residents to go ahead and do what they can to get as much of this completed as they can because, at the end of the day, if another life is lost in another wet season that will be squarely on the shoulders of the Labor state government.The Roads to Recovery program is another very successful one. In my electorate Cairns City Council will receive another $1 million-plus. There will be $700,000 for Cook Shire, a very large electorate; $166,000 for Douglas Shire; and $93,000 for Torres Strait. Since the Roads to Recovery program has come in the amount of bitumen that has been laid by local authorities is amazing. The money is going straight through to these local authorities and they are able to prioritise their work, keep their work force on the job—certainly not allowing anything to be cost-shifted back into the state government coffers—and you can certainly see the results.A good example of that was the opportunity I had the other day to open the new works at Aumuller Road, a four-lane highway. That work had been well overdue. Concrete slabs were laid by the American troops in the 1939-45 war and of course in the period since then the road has deteriorated significantly. The Roads to Recovery funding has allowed the Cairns City Council to upgrade this road to an excellent piece of infrastructure.The other thing in the budget which I was looking for and was very pleased to see was the additional $90 million in the black spot funding program. Again, this has provided vital funding in regional areas and, in my view, it has saved a lot of lives. You only have to drive on any of the highways in Cairns and outlying areas to see outstanding examples of work carried out under this program—work that certainly would not have been done if we were waiting for the state government to put their hands in their pockets.Another very successful funding achievement was $10 million for the Cairns Esplanade. This is on top of a $9 million spend that we had about three years ago, taking the total Australian government investment to some $19 million. The results of the work so far have been quite profound and not only for visitors to Cairns—although 40 per cent of its economy is reliant on tourism, and it is the second biggest international tourism destination to Sydney. The work that has been done on this esplanade area has certainly added to the experience of locals as well as to that of international visitors. It is amazing to see the number of locals who have come to love and enjoy this area. The additional $10 million is going to be able to finish the whole waterfront area of Cairns City and it certainly will make a huge difference to that area.Then there were the unsuccessful bids by the reef and rain forest CRCs last year. I remember that Senator McLucas was on her knees praying every night that they were going to fail, that they were never going to run, because that would give her something to criticise. She makes no effort whatsoever to get off her butt and do something about seeing if she can find an alternative. Instead, she uses political opportunism just to criticise or knock for the sake of knocking to try to build her own political stakes.But there are those in the community who realise that the bids that were put in by both of those entities were not appropriate—that they did not fit the criteria—and they are prepared to work with me to find an alternative. Again, I would like to recognise the outstanding contribution of Russell Reichelt, CEO of the Reef CRC; Daniel Gschwind, CEO of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council; and John McIntyre, who was with TTNQ. Rather than criticise and make cheap political shots, as happened with Senator McLucas, they realised that there were problems and that we had to do something different, and they sat down and worked with me. As a direct result of the contribution of those three outstanding citizens, we now have the Marine and Tropical Sciences Research Facility for Far North Queensland, which has been funded with significantly more resources than both the reef and rainforest CRCs combined. There has been some $40 million to establish this magnificent, world-first facility—it will be the best in the world—in both Cairns and Townsville. It will be the premium facility in the world for reef and rainforest research.It will certainly attract a lot of interest from both the conservation and scientific communities around the world. James Cook University have been very excited by this, because it gives them another opportunity in relation to expanding options that are available through their campuses. This is on top of a veterinary school. A few years ago we announced a medical school for James Cook University—again, provided through good economic management by this government and strong lobbying by me—and the member for Herbert, Peter Lindsay, played a very significant role in achieving that. So we had the medical school, and now we have a veterinary school—and the funding has been set aside for that. Of course, the vice-chancellor of James Cook University is very excited about the opportunities this will provide and some very significant and unique strengths and attributes will enhance the delivery of services of James Cook University.Another issue that has been of concern in my area—and, again, it has been addressed through this budget—is illegal fishing, particularly in the gulf and Torres Strait. Some 87 illegal fishing vessels were apprehended in northern waters this year alone, and we had to look seriously at dealing with the vessels that were impounded and held in the harbour, which was totally unsatisfactory. Residents on Thursday Island and Horn Island had concerns with regard to health problems and security. But $32.5 million has been set aside for the detection, detention and prosecution of illegal fishermen. A very significant amount of money has been set aside to build a purpose-built, 48-person facility on Horn Island to immediately process illegal fishermen with regard to their health et cetera and send them off to Darwin for prosecution. There will also be a purpose-built facility for the destruction of vessels that are taken in the area. That can be done in a way that is not going to cause any environmental problems. That will provide a significant number of jobs for local residents on Horn Island and Thursday Island, something that has been very much welcomed by that community. Given that, particularly in the Torres Strait, fishing is the only natural resource, other than tourism opportunities, it is absolutely imperative that we do everything we can to protect the integrity of that resource.We are also enhancing search and rescue in Far North Queensland. Some $54.7 million has been allocated out of this budget for the establishment of a new search and rescue service. There will be four turboprop aircraft, which are much faster than anything that is available now. Three will be flying at all times. One, I would expect, will be based in Far North Queensland—in Cairns, I expect. These are very high-speed purpose-built aircraft for search and rescue. Instead of taking Coastwatch off task to look for people who are lost in this vast area, these aircraft will be readily available. They will be fitted with the latest technology, including surface search radars and forward-looking infrared equipment, which will allow them to work at night time, and satellite communications, again offering another level of support and safety in our region.A range of other initiatives has also been made available through this budget. They are national initiatives, certainly, but they are initiatives that are going to be of great benefit in my electorate. There is $179 million for new Indigenous health measures. We know of the work that needs to be done there. There is an additional $40 million for primary health clinics in communities. There is over $102 million over four years to improve the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mothers, babies and children and to reduce the impact of chronic diseases. There is $8 million to help deal with issues of petrol sniffing. There is also funding of some $10 million for government hearing services for Indigenous communities, and funding to help communities keep professional staff through an extension of the fringe benefits tax supplementation program for an additional four years.There is funding for bowel cancer. The prevalence of cancer touches all of us in the community. There is some $43.4 million for the national bowel cancer screening program and another $23.1 million over four years to help local groups and care providers offer better support for cancer patients and their families. This new funding will be used to fit out and equip premises for palliative care, pastoral care, counselling and family support. There is also $25 million to assist in tackling problems with young people who are starting to smoke at an early age—they have got to start at the source, particularly in relation to lung cancer. There has been additional funding for mental health, which is an issue I raise regularly in this place. There is some $69 million for youth mental health initiatives, appreciating that three-quarters of mental health problems begin before the age of 25. There is another $39.6 million for the national depression initiative, money certainly well spent and a direct result of responsible economic management by this government. Diabetes initiatives will also receive a boost of some $44.2 million and asthma will receive another $27.1 million. All in all, it has been an outstanding contribution to these areas.Another area which has caused some difficulty for the other side of politics, for the Labor Party, is the tax cuts, with the reduction from 17 to 15 per cent for our lower income earners and the lifting of the thresholds which has been quite significant. You always hear complaints, particularly from the other side, about the brain drain, about our intelligent young people moving overseas because of the high tax problems here. We are losing all those young people. What we have done is bring our tax system into line with those countries that attract these young professionals. It will mean that there is no longer a reason for them to travel overseas.I would have thought that the Labor Party would have offered congratulations, particularly given the skills shortages that we have in this country at the moment and our desperate need to retain those young highly skilled people. But, no, purely for the sake of politics they are out there jumping up and down, threatening to disallow this and coming back with a plagiarised mickey mouse alternative. From talking to my own business community, I know that there is a lot of confusion out there. They desperately want this to be introduced on 1 July. We have got to call on the Leader of the Opposition to stop blocking this, stop playing havoc with the employees in Far North Queensland and stop threatening to block these tax cuts. At the end of the day, all he is going to do is cause an unnecessary cost to business. I ask him to stop the nonsense and allow the tax cuts to go through.

322,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Edwards, Graham, MP","83R","Cowan","ALP","N/A",145,"—In speaking on the appropriation bills I want to defend Western Australia. It seems to me that the federal Treasurer and Liberal leadership hopeful Peter Costello wants to base his leadership push on proving just how well he can bully the states. The Treasurer’s recent attack on Western Australia is incredible and his threat to withhold GST revenues from that state is state bashing at its pitiful worst. The Treasurer has threatened to withhold GST revenues from WA unless WA drops more state taxes. It is interesting that the Treasurer would do this because on the one hand the government are saying that this is not a Commonwealth tax but a state tax, yet on the other hand it is a tax they want to control when it suits them. The other interesting thing is that it was a Liberal Premier who signed WA up to the GST.Because of the Treasurer’s threats, I went to the current Premier’s web site. I was very pleased to discover the following information, which I want to quote:In 1999 the then Premier Richard Court signed an agreement on behalf of Western Australia to receive a share of the GST revenue in return for abolishing three state taxes and reviewing a further six.Indeed, since 1999, as part of that agreement signed by Premier Court, WA has abolished three state taxes. It has abolished financial institutions duty and listed marketable securities duty, and debits tax is legislated to be abolished on 1 July 2005. WA has reviewed the other six and abolished three more taxes. It has abolished unlisted marketable securities duty, leases duty and cheque duty. Western Australia also abolished a further two taxes not listed on that agreement: stamp duty on workers compensation insurance and stamp duty on life insurance. In total, the WA state government has abolished eight state taxes, while the agreement only required the abolition of three state taxes. While the GST was signed up under the previous Liberal state government, the incoming Labor government has met those commitments, and I think the Premier’s claim that Western Australia has not only honoured its side of the agreement but exceeded it is demonstrably true.I also want to point out to the Treasurer—Australia’s next Leader of the Opposition—that my home state of WA contributes $2 billion more each year than we get back in federal funding. That is a $1,000 subsidy by every man, woman and child in Western Australia to the rest of the nation. In addition, up to 90 per cent of the royalties Western Australia receives from its resources are distributed to other states, yet the federal government refuses to adequately fund the necessary infrastructure required for mining and other resource development. Indeed, ABS figures show that the Commonwealth tax take is $10,462 per person, while just $2,503 per person is derived from state based revenue.I am grateful to the Premier’s office in WA for the above information. Something else that I have been pointing out in Western Australia for years is that in WA we are free from the plague of poker machines—and we thank successive governments for that. I would certainly call on future state governments in Western Australia to continue with that no pokies policy. We need to remind the federal Treasurer that we do not, unlike other states, derive income from those machines. Indeed, it is worth pointing out that New South Wales derives $1.311 billion from gambling and Victoria $1.324 billion. That puts WA behind the eight ball right from the word go. But I would rather have it that way than to allow Treasurer Costello to force poker machines into our state. They are not wanted and they are not required—and I think that is pretty well a bipartisan position in Western Australia.The other taxable revenue device we do not have in WA is road tollways. I am not sure what revenue is derived from road tollways, but it seems to me that this is becoming more and more a means of revenue in New South Wales and Victoria. I to say the Treasurer: ‘Thank you very much, but, just like poker machines, we don’t want any road tollways in Western Australia either.’I also noticed that the WA government in last week’s state budget scrapped the bank debits tax, freed up some 24,000 people from paying land tax, raised land tax thresholds and cut the middle land tax while abolishing stamp duty on mortgage refinancing for owner-occupiers and small business. Overall in WA the state government is returning some $870 million in tax relief over the next four years. This is on top of the $1.5 billion in tax cuts announced last year. In WA, the Gallop government is delivering $2.4 billion in tax and family relief. In addition, it is putting more investment into training teachers, building new schools, providing more police, generating more electricity and expanding and building new hospitals. At the same time, in partnership with the resource sector, it is investing in new infrastructure.Infrastructure is something the Howard-Costello government refuses to accept a fair responsibility for in WA, let alone show any responsibility for. On the one hand the Howard-Costello government is refusing to assist with infrastructure and resource development, but at the same time it wants to reduce state revenue and is saying to WA, ‘We want you to generate more income so we can confiscate that for Canberra.’ It is pretty obvious that both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, who both come from the eastern states—and I am not saying there is anything wrong with that—have little knowledge and appreciation of the fact that it is well-run and well-managed states like Western Australia that are hand in hand with the resource sector developing our nation, expanding our exports and building our economy. The Treasurer should get off the back of WA and get out of its path. He should stop being an impediment to Western Australia’s development and for a change he should support our state and our crucial resource sector.Mr Deputy Speaker, you would well know that prices of minerals fluctuate—there are peaks and troughs. There is no guarantee in the future that the prices you are getting today will be there in five, six or seven years time. Any state government which cut its funding and by so doing inhibited its ability to work hand-in-hand with the resource sector to explore and develop new prospects, fields or mining areas would be cutting the throat of the state in the long term. My advice to the Treasurer is that he ought to give WA a fair go. He should not be the goose that kills the state that lays Australia’s richest golden egg. If Western Australia allowed itself to be bullied by this Treasurer, this Prime Minister and this government, not only would we be killing the goose that lays Australia’s richest golden egg, but in view of the figures that I gave a little while ago—and in view of the revenue which is generated in Western Australia and distributed to other parts of the nation—we would be doing a great disservice to this nation. So the state government, with the support of all federal members, Liberal and Labor, should stand up to this Costello-Howard government and support the Premier of Western Australia. If they do not, they are turning their backs on the people of that great state.Having exposed the Treasurer for the reckless person that he is, particularly in relation to Western Australia, I have a number of other issues that I want to deal with. I want to turn tonight to another issue to do with the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. I call on this minister to fix the incredible debacle which surrounds the issuing of military medals in Australia. We recently saw the very embarrassing situation our nation found itself in when the president of Indonesia awarded that nation’s humanitarian medal to the nine Australians killed in the Sea King disaster. It was an embarrassment to Australia—not that the medal was awarded but that we had nothing that we could give. It was a very emotional moment for most Australians when they saw those coffins coming back with the medals from Indonesia, and they were matched by a sprig of wattle, I think at the suggestion of the Governor-General.The government moved fairly quickly to arrange for our own humanitarian medal to be awarded to those people who were so tragically killed. They did that with this opposition’s support, and I think it was a fair and reasonable thing for them to do. But it is interesting in this context to remember that, some 11 months ago, the government announced a new Australian Defence Force medal, and they said applications for this medal would be called for by the end of last year. Interestingly, that announcement was made as a lead-up to the last election. Where have the medals gone? We have no idea where they are, what their design is, when they will be available, and what the criteria for these medals will be. That is despite this government having promised on more than one occasion that applications would be called for at the end of last year.Labor’s policy is very clear in this area. We announced it last year, and we have stood by that policy. We would award the Australian Defence Force medal to volunteers who have served their initial period of enlistment of three years or in some circumstances two years. You might remember back to the post Second World War era when some people who served in Korea only had to enlist for two years.We would also award the medal to next of kin of those killed on duty or to those who were forced to take discharge because of injury, or in the case of women because of situations where they were forced out because of marriage or pregnancy. A number of women served in the ADF for a period of four years or signed up for four years. Some of them had to get out because they were married or having a child. We would want to recognise the contribution that those women made.I believe that this government has made a farce of these new medals, and it is really high time that it got the house in order. But it does not end there. In July 2002 I, along with several other members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, visited our troops on the ground in the Middle East. Included in that was a visit to our SAS blokes in Bagram. While we were there we gave a commitment, as much as a group of members of parliament can give a commitment, to pursue the issue of a campaign medal to recognise the wonderful service that those people were contributing in that country. Indeed when we returned to Australia the committee wrote to the Minister for Defence seeking the government’s commitment to such a campaign medal.Last year the minister announced the medal and gave the impression to recipients that it would be available for them to have by Anzac Day this year. Not only has the Afghanistan campaign medal failed to materialise but there is now a story which causes some concern to me, and that is that the medals, yet to be manufactured, will be further delayed because the government is considering having them minted overseas. I do not want to divert from the real case, which is the fact that these people are entitled to their medals. But I do think that the minister should, if she is going to allow these medals to be minted overseas, be prepared to defend that decision, because there will be a fair amount of angst in Australia if that is the case.The real story here is that recognition delayed is recognition denied. In my view, and I know in the view of many former and current serving soldiers, the length of time they have had to wait for these medals is a fair reflection of the lack of appreciation that this government really has for the job that these blokes and these women did. The individual and personal challenges and dangers that these members of the ADF, as soldiers operating in difficult terrain, had to expose themselves to and the dangers of the elements as well as the enemy are exactly what campaign medals are designed to reflect. So I am going to pose the question: why are our Afghanistan veterans who were serving that country in 2002 and the Iraq veterans still waiting for their campaign medals so many years after the campaign, particularly in relation to the Afghanistan campaign? I think it would be very difficult for any member of this parliament to justify such a delay. As I said, recognition delayed is recognition denied. I want to call on the minister to demand some action here and to demand it now. These blokes are entitled to their medals. They should have them.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
323,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"May, Margaret, MP","83B","McPherson","LP","N/A",148,"—The future prosperity of Australia, the continuing strong economic growth, the continuing high employment, the continuing low interest rates and low inflation and the record highs in consumer and business confidence are all due in no small way to the policies of the Howard government. In bringing down his 10th budget just three weeks ago the Treasurer called it a budget framed for the future. It was a budget framed for the future, a budget focused on future opportunities for our young people, a budget focused on care for our aged, a budget focused on the continued security of our nation, a budget focused on the health services that our citizens will need in the future, a budget focused on the continued strong economic growth of our nation that is synonymous with the Howard government.The coalition government, under the leadership of John Howard, have a great deal of experience under our belt. Our win at the last federal election has given us a unique opportunity of ensuring that the next three years of policy decisions really count. The agenda for Australia’s future has to be cemented further, given our ageing population. Level-headedness, maturity, commonsense and sound decision making are going to be needed more than ever over the next three years. The recent budget sets a blueprint for the next 12 months and lays the foundation for the fourth-term agenda of the Howard government.There has been a lot of talk about the future. Without continued strong economic growth, our future as a country and for our people would not be in the position it is in today. The Australian economy has performed impressively and that is not by accident. It has performed impressively because of sound economic management and a commitment to ongoing reform and policy decisions that have been taken by the Howard government.What does this budget mean to the people I represent in the federal parliament, the people of McPherson? What does it mean to our communities on the southern Gold Coast? How have we benefited and what will those continued benefits mean in the future to our young people, our young families, our aged and our city as it continues to grow at a rate unmatched anywhere else in Australia?Because of our prudent management of the Australian economy, the government will deliver further personal income tax cuts to all Australians. We are a government that believe in giving Australian taxpayers back their hard earned dollars with a budget surplus. It is now up to the opposition to pass on those tax cuts and to allow Australians to benefit from these tax cuts from 1 July. I say to the opposition: don’t penalise the Australian taxpayer by blocking this legislation. Vote with us and pass on the tax cuts.Under the proposed legislation, further personal income tax cuts are worth $21.7 billion over the next four years. These are tax cuts that will assist low-income earners, boost disposable incomes and reward participation and hard work. Australians will keep more of what they earn, and why shouldn’t they? There are now more incentives for Aussies to continue to work hard and reap the rewards of that hard work.With the support of the opposition, from 1 July this year the 17 per cent marginal tax rate will be cut to 15 per cent, and the 42 per cent tax threshold will increase from $58,000 to $63,000 on 1 July 2005 and to $70,000 on 1 July 2006. From 1 July 2005, the 47 per cent threshold will increase from $70,000 to $95,000 and on 1 July 2006 it will increase again to $125,000. In my view, these tax cuts and increases in thresholds are fair and well targeted. These changes ensure that more than 80 per cent of taxpayers face a top marginal income tax rate of 30 per cent or less over the forward estimates period, and from 1 July 2006 the top marginal rate will apply to only three per cent of taxpayers.In addition to the income tax cuts and the government’s ongoing plan to encourage people to save for their retirement, the superannuation surcharge will be scrapped altogether from 1 July 2005. The cut in the lowest rate of tax benefits also benefits seniors and means that senior Australians eligible for the senior Australian tax offset will now pay no tax on their annual income up to $21,968 for a single and on equal incomes up to a joint $36,494 for a couple. Once again I say to the opposition: pass the tax cuts. Allow all Australians to benefit from the personal income tax cuts from 1 July 2005. Australians should share in the prosperity of our nation and the economic benefits that have flowed from our strong economic management. I say to the opposition: act responsibly and pass the tax cuts.One of the most significant achievements of this government has been the continuing fall in unemployment rates. McPherson’s December unemployment rate hit a historical low of 5.2 per cent compared to the then national average of 5.5 per cent. It was the first time our unemployment rate was better than the national average. In the past McPherson has trailed somewhere between two and three per cent behind the national average. These figures were welcome news for the southern Gold Coast. It meant that more people had jobs and that young people had job opportunities. The results reflect the Howard government’s strong economic management once again and highlight the significant labour market improvements that are achievable when a government is prepared to reform the employment services market through the Job Network and make the hard decisions on workplace reform.Despite the fact that more Australians are in work today and that the unemployment rate has fallen to a low unmatched for 28 years, it is more important than ever that the opposition support the government’s workplace relations and work force participation reforms, which have the potential to make even further inroads into the level of unemployment. Another challenge for the opposition is to support key reforms in the areas of increasing work force participation and in the labour market.Part of the challenge for government in securing our future is increasing participation in the work force. Our 14 consecutive years of growth have been accompanied by low unemployment rates, low inflation rates and low interest rates but the future will see Australia come under increasing pressure as it competes in a freer global market environment, where competition will be aggressive, not just for our natural resources, manufactured goods and services but importantly for our greatest asset, our labour force. Participation in the work force, assisting people from welfare to work, is much more than statistics about unemployment rates. It is about people becoming financially secure and sharing in the wealth of this country. In many cases it is about people’s self-esteem and confidence. It is about people overcoming their social isolation. It is about recognising the value of a person’s contribution to our society. It is about people feeling worth while about contributing.As a government we have a responsibility to ensure all Australians who want to work and who are able to work are given the opportunity to participate. We have to ensure that there are programs that will assist in training and skilling people so that they can become productive members of our society. It is about assisting people from welfare to work. It is not about paying people a benefit every fortnight and forgetting about them. We have a responsibility to engage those people who are able to and want to work. It is about providing rehabilitation services and education and training opportunities that will give these people the best chance ever of participating.Employers will also be encouraged to employ people with disabilities. Schemes will be expanded to assist employers to take on these people. We will work with industry to identify the skill shortages and ensure we address those skill shortages with the appropriate training programs. We need to encourage as many people of working age as we can to join our work force, to become productive members of our communities.During the last federal campaign our government announced a commitment to 24 technical colleges to be built in regions around Australia. The Gold Coast has been identified as an area to receive funding for such a college. This election commitment provides for the establishment and operation of colleges for year 11 and 12 students to promote excellence in the teaching and acquiring of trade and craft skills at the secondary school level. Each college will be linked to and endorsed by industry and run autonomously by principals who will be able to engage teaching staff on a performance pay basis.We know today that one of the greatest challenges for business is finding people to take up skilled jobs. For too long success for young Australians has been equated to finishing year 12 and obtaining a university degree. This, of course, is a path that many young people aspire to and a path that should be supported. However, there is an attitude in the community that only a university degree will secure employment. In many cases it has become a status symbol and as a country we have paid a significant economic and social cost for this attitude. One-third of students who start university will not finish their studies.As a country we are facing critical skill shortages in the trades, including building and construction, metals, manufacturing and automotive. On the Gold Coast we are also facing shortages in the hospitality industry. We desperately need young people to take on traineeships or apprenticeships as chefs. We need people in this industry, both front of house and back of house. People need to be well trained and willing to work in this multimillion dollar industry, which supports our very strong tourism industry.This government is committed to revolutionising vocational education and training, through the 24 colleges. As a nation, we should value trades training as highly as any other form of postsecondary education. I look forward to the Gold Coast technical college becoming a reality and offering choices and another education pathway to the young people on the Gold Coast. I know a number of tenders have been presented from the Gold Coast. I wish each of the consortiums every success with their bids and of course look forward to working with the successful consortium in establishing the Gold Coast Australian technical college.Small business, as we know, is the backbone of the Australian economy. Businesses have been growing. They have had to become smarter. They are now part of opportunities in a growing global market that has become increasingly competitive. We need to ensure that our businesses are as productive and competitive as they can be, and that means we need to address impediments to business activity. There is an increasing need for industrial relations reform to increase work force participation. Legislation such as the fair dismissal bill will assist business in employing those extra people they need.The Treasurer announced $1.8 billion of tax cuts to enhance the competitiveness of Australian businesses. Already abolished is the three per cent tariff on imported business inputs which do not have substitutes manufactured in Australia. This will be a saving to business of $1.3 billion over the next five years.The tourism industry on the Gold Coast is made up of thousands of small businesses, and our tourism industry will be a winner from the extra $453 million being invested into attracting tourists to our country. Our local communities will benefit from the extra $7.5 million that will be spent on promoting tourism projects and encouraging visitors to stay on the Gold Coast longer, through the Australian Tourism Development Program.Tourism is big business for our local communities, and the Gold Coast is no exception. The industry provides thousands of jobs throughout Australia, and by boosting tourism in local areas extra jobs can be created and additional income earned by small businesses. I encourage all members and senators to take a trip north to Australia’s tourism capital. Everyone deserves the chance to experience our unique way of life, to take part in a fresh Gold Coast adventure that stretches from historic rural communities in the north to border towns and coastal centres on the southern Gold Coast, and to enjoy our beautiful hinterland—the green behind the gold—and our pristine beaches. We have it all.There have been many discussions over a number of years about the future of our great country—the future of our ageing population, the future of our environment, the future of our health system and, importantly, the future infrastructure plans for our road and rail systems. Through AusLink, many of these infrastructure plans will be funded. With this budget, an additional $150 million over five years will be provided to expand the Roads to Recovery program, and an additional $90 million will be provided to continue the Road Safety Black Spot Program.The Gold Coast City Council will benefit from these funds. An additional $14 million will be provided to the council for the Roads to Recovery program. There is no doubt that this funding is urgently needed on the Gold Coast to address the serious traffic problems we are encountering due to our rapid population growth. I know the council will also be applying for funding under the Road Safety Black Spot Program, which has been a successful initiative in the past.The establishment of the future fund is also a very welcome announcement. There is no doubt that we need to make provision for the future. We need to begin saving for the future to meet the costs of our ageing population. The future fund will be an independent fund with a statutory board of eminent people who are going to make an investment on behalf of Australia’s future. It will be a large fund and it is expected to accumulate earnings over a period of time, which will mean that the government can fund its liabilities and relieve future generations of the costs of the ageing of the population. These earnings will be safeguarded by legislation. The future fund will only invest in infrastructure projects that make commercial sense. The government expects the fund to be able to invest in listed infrastructure vehicles and listed property trusts. There will not be uncommercial, risky investments being made by the future fund that would risk the capacity for government to pay the superannuation liabilities.Since coming to power in 1996, the Howard government has managed to retire most of the $96 billion debt we inherited on coming to office. By reducing this debt, we can look to the future with confidence. We can be assured that our commitments, as a government, to all Australians will be met. The savings by government from the reduction of the debt will ensure that the future fund will meet the needs of our nation in the long term.There are many good news stories in this budget—for example, a one-off lump sum payment this year of $1,000 to eligible carers receiving the carer payment and $600 to those receiving the carers allowance. Carers in our community should never be taken for granted. They undertake a selfless task, often a lonely task, isolated from society because of the very nature of the task they have undertaken.Cancer is an insidious disease. I have recently lost two very close friends to this disease and have a very dear friend who is currently fighting the disease—Wal is being very brave, but I worry about his fight. The government is committed to a major funding package to improve cancer care through bowel cancer screening, dedicated cancer research, the training of cancer nurses, increased funding for palliative care, and $5.5 million over two years to raise national awareness of skin cancer and encourage action to prevent it. Another important program is the commitment to a national youth campaign aimed at reducing the number of young people who take up smoking. We all know that smoking is a killer. Early intervention programs hopefully will have the desired effect. The government has committed $25 million over four years to help discourage young Australians from taking up smoking.The budget also makes dementia a national health priority. The $321 million package will enhance the quality of life of dementia sufferers and their carers. As life expectancy increases, dementia will become more common within our communities. The funding package will offer more opportunities for dementia-specific training for carers, community and residential care workers, and people working in services such as the police, transport and emergency services. I particularly commend this initiative by the government. Dementia is a debilitating disease. Sufferers and their carers face huge challenges on a daily basis, and any help and assistance will be welcome, I know.Diabetes is also becoming a huge national health concern. The government has provided $44.2 million over four years to continue a national approach to improve the prevention and management of diabetes. There is no doubt that education on the effects of diabetes, and programs to assist Australians to recognise early warning signs, are positive steps in bringing diabetes under control.Balancing work and family and the daily stresses of life can have huge impacts on families. Often families need outside counselling to help keep relationships and families together. The government has announced funding over four years to establish a network of 65 family relationship centres across Australia. These centres will help couples access premarriage education and assist families experiencing relationship difficulties with information and access to family skills training and support that can be delivered through other departments and agencies. This initiative is another example of government support for and recognition of the importance of strong family relationships within our communities. Strong families build strong communities and ultimately a strong country.The Prime Minister has often referred to Australia as having a decent society, a tolerant society, a society that recognises and supports low- and middle-income families with dependent children. Through this budget, those families and children are being supported and encouraged now and for the future. I commend the bills to the House.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
324,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Emerson, Craig, MP","83V","Rankin","ALP","N/A",153,"—I would like to concentrate my remarks on the budget primarily upon an economic analysis of the budget and the wider economic implications that flow from it. Members of parliament will be well aware of Labor’s critique of the government’s spending program that began before the previous budget, carried through the 2004-05 budget and then flowed into the pre-election campaign period. That critique was that the budget spending spree amounted to $66 billion and would put undue pressure on interest rates. Labor did not come to this view belatedly but said it consistently as the government went upon this spending spree.There was only one purpose behind that spending spree, and that was to get the government re-elected. It was clear it was going to give total priority to that and then, after the election, worry about the economic consequences. After the election the chickens did come home to roost, as Labor had feared they would: the OECD, the IMF and the Reserve Bank of Australia all expressed concerns about the management of the economy, including in their critique the $66 billion spending spree.In March 2005 the Reserve Bank had no choice left to it but to increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. The effect of the pre-election spending spree was to pour fuel onto the flames of already strong consumer spending. The government knew exactly what it was doing, but calculated correctly that it would be able to get away with it and deal with the consequences after the election. The interest rate rise itself has had an adverse impact on home borrowers. A quarter of a percentage point interest rate increase can be a significant increase when people are borrowed up to the hilt, as they are. If Labor’s critique of the pre-election spending spree of $66 billion was right, then surely a critique of a $103 billion spending spree would carry some weight. And that is, in fact, what the government has done in the 2005-06 budget—it has gone on a $103 billion spending spree. I have said consistently that I am concerned about the impact of this on further interest rate rises. The Reserve Bank’s task is quite straightforward—that is, to keep inflation within a nominated band. It is an independent Reserve Bank, that is its job, and if inflation increases beyond the upper limit of that band the Reserve Bank has little choice but to act.The pre-election spending spree was 10.3 per cent in real terms in 2004, which was the fastest in more than 20 years. It is interesting to cast one’s mind back to when such a pre-election spending spree last occurred. It was, in fact, by the Fraser government, when John Howard was Treasurer of this country, when they sought in vain to get re-elected by making very large and expensive promises. It did not work in 1983 because Labor swept to power, but it has worked in the most recent election. But the problem is that the spending that is going on in this economy has been at such a rate that the capacity of the economy to supply the goods and services that are being demanded is now very limited.The government has failed to invest, in its nine years, in improving the capacity of the Australian economy to meet the demands associated with strong consumer spending. When strong consumer spending smashes up against a capacity constraint, it spills over in one of two ways—in Australia’s case, in both. The first is into imports. It is a matter of record that Australia now has recorded 41 successive trade deficits and record current account deficits, and the figures released today put the current account deficit at 7.25 per cent of GDP. This is a horrendously high level, far in excess of the level when Paul Keating warned of the dangers in the mid-1980s of Australia becoming a banana republic, and yet this government is completely complacent about a record current account deficit—a chronic current account deficit—which, again, is feeding into Australia’s international debt. In 1995 when the government rolled out its debt truck, Australia’s international net debt was $180 billion. Today figures reveal that it has climbed to $425 billion, more than doubling since the time that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer promised to follow policies that would bring foreign debt down.At that time both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer warned that at some point—and they believe that point had been reached when debt was $180 billion—foreign lenders would apply a risk premium to the interest rate that they charge Australia for borrowing such large amounts of money. Again, the Prime Minister has been condemned by his own rhetoric, by his own belief. Now, with foreign debt at $425 billion, foreign lenders are definitely applying a premium, because Australia has the third-highest interest rates in the Western world.If that is not bad enough, we are now in a situation where we are at the peak of a commodity price cycle. Commodity prices can only go down from here. The Australian dollar is a commodity currency. If you track the movements in the Australian dollar with commodity prices you will find a very close correlation. As the commodity price cycle has peaked, the risk for the exchange rate is that it will depreciate. A depreciating exchange rate will increase the cost in Australian dollar terms of goods imported from overseas—and we have lots of goods imported from overseas as a result of the spending spree spilling over into imports. If that happens we have a new source of inflation in Australia through a depreciating exchange rate.In the last couple of years the prices of domestically produced goods have risen above the Reserve Bank’s range at which it would need to act to increase interest rates. But the impact of an appreciating dollar as the commodity price cycle has gone up has been that there has been an offset to domestic inflation from overseas such that the overall consumer price index has remained within the range. Therefore, with that one exception of March 2005, the Reserve Bank has not been forced to increase interest rates. But now that the government has failed to respond to the capacity constraints and has poured fuel onto the spending fire, the risk of a depreciating currency means that those strong domestic price rises will not have an overseas offset but will be exacerbated by inflation from overseas.In those circumstances the Reserve Bank will have no choice but to increase interest rates. Recessions in this country have been caused essentially by the Reserve Bank acting too late to dampen spending and then having to put the brakes on too severely. That has caused recessions. The preconditions for a recession now exist in Australia. Am I saying that there will be a recession? I am not making that prediction, but I am saying that this government has substantially increased the risk of a recession. Ask BIS Shrapnel, who earlier in the week were forecasting mortgage interest rates of nine per cent. Mortgage interest rates of nine per cent would smash the Australian economy because of the very high levels of debt of most Australians who are trying to buy a home.One of the indicators of the state of the economy at the moment is that the unemployment rate is the lowest since 1976. That suggests a tight labour market—in fact, it is proof of a tight labour market. Another is that job vacancies are the highest in the 26-year history of job vacancies; again, pointing to a very tight labour market. There are labour shortages. Business is reporting labour shortages as a constraint on output. That particular indicator is the highest in the 15-year history of the survey. Capacity utilisation has just fallen away little, but from a 15-year high. Interestingly, over the years I have found the survey of consumer sentiment to be a very important indicator. The survey of consumer sentiment had reached record levels and then, when the quarter of a percentage point interest rate rise came through, it fell away. But now that people have gotten used to that interest rate rise, consumer sentiment has gone up again. In parliament today the Treasurer said that the latest retail sales figures suggest that consumer spending has now perhaps peaked and is starting to moderate. But the retail sales figures were all adjusted as a result of the Australian Bureau of Statistics having another look at those figures, and they were all revised upwards in the previous month. So there is plenty of evidence around of capacity constraints and of strong consumer spending.In respect of the housing market, a fundamental cause of the very high house prices—it is true they have peaked—is the large immigration program, which I support fundamentally. But the underlying contributor to the pressure on housing prices is an immigration program which has continued to increase in this year. I do not complain about that, I simply point out that house prices are unlikely to collapse, that they are moderating and there is a very significant possibility that they will increase in the coming months, if not in a year’s time.Put all those pieces together and you see the preconditions for an interest rate rise. The reality is that the government knew this. It knew when it was bringing down the budget that this was a very substantial risk. If you look at the statement of risks in the budget, you will see that it points to these sorts of risks. Why? Because Peter Costello does not write budget statement No. 1. The people who write budget statement No. 1 are the Treasury. The Treasury need to cover all possibilities so that no-one can say that they got it wrong.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

326,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Emerson, Craig, MP","83V","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—It is honest disclosure. They do not want to be in a position where we as parliamentarians can say, ‘Treasury got it wrong.’ If you go through the fine print, you can see in the statement of risks that Treasury are fully aware of the potential consequences of this budget.Late last year, Martin Parkinson, a senior Treasury officer, gave a speech to an economic forum where he pointed out that any budget is just a series of point estimates. By that I interpret him to mean that you can only make your best guess about each of those things, but around each point there is a substantial risk. I am saying that, around the budget estimates, there are very substantial risks associated with the settings of that budget. I do not want it to be the case that, if interest rates rise, anyone can believe that Labor supported the budget. We did not. We did not support the budget on the grounds of equity—that is, the fairness of the tax cuts. I am putting on record again tonight that we do not support the budget on the grounds of macroeconomic management either.I want to go on to some of the longer term opportunities that were lost in this budget. We are talking about capacity constraints, a reform-lazy government that has surfed on the record productivity growth generated out of the economic reform program of the Hawke and Keating years. Wouldn’t you think that a government would say: ‘Wow, what a gift! This is tremendous. Hawke and Keating have unleashed this productivity growth for us. We’ll make sure we keep it going by investing in the new sources of productivity growth in the country: education and new ideas in the form of innovation and infrastructure.’ But a reform-lazy government has failed to do that. Those hard-won increases in productivity as a result of the reform program have now turned negative. In the year 2004, productivity growth in this country not only slowed; it turned negative. Some of that might be statistical aberration or cyclical factors—any such possibility—but if you were a government that was concerned about the long-term economic management of this country, you would be very worried about productivity growth turning negative when, again, our competitors around the world are making sure that they are investing in the new sources of productivity growth.What does this government have against government in public investment in education—public investment in schools, vocational education and universities? The fact of the matter is that with the most recent fee increases—25 per cent increases in HECS and an expanded system whereby up to 35 per cent of places at universities can now be taken by full-fee paying Australian students assisted by a scheme called FEE-HELP—the private returns from a university education are now getting to a point where it is just not worth it. Is this short-sighted? Of course it is. How could a government be so ideologically obsessed with private provision and funding of university education that it simply refuses to invest in access to universities in this country?So it has failed on the score of investing in the skills of this nation and in the area of research and development. Under the Hawke and Keating governments business spending on research and development, as a share of gross domestic product, skyrocketed and started making us competitive with other OECD countries, where the gap between their spending on research and development and ours was narrowing. But one of the first acts of this government when it came into office was to cut the R&D tax concession, and business spending on research and development as a share of GDP fell year after year. More recently it has lifted ever so slightly, but not relative to the rest of the world. So on the second score of investing in ideas the government has gone missing, deliberately and wantonly refusing to invest in that public good that is innovation and investment in ideas.The third area, probably the most noteworthy in terms of public commentary, is infrastructure. The government blames the states for infrastructure bottlenecks. There is no national infrastructure leadership in this country. What we need is a national infrastructure advisory committee and council, and we need a national infrastructure plan. It does not mean that the Commonwealth has to be the sole investor in infrastructure. The states obviously must do so. The private sector obviously must do so. But the Commonwealth should be taking a leadership role. Labor has been advocating a national infrastructure advisory council now for about three, maybe four, years. But for reasons best known to the government, probably ideological ones or a desire to shift the burden of infrastructure spending on to the states and away from the federal budget, it will not take even that sensible measure.Finally there is the area of incentives. The government talks about the need to give incentive to high-income earners to do extra work. It has lifted the threshold for the top marginal rate of tax to $125,000 a year. The government has been saying, ‘These people need more incentive because 48½c in the dollar is such a prohibitive marginal tax rate.’ Yet many people on lower and middle incomes are facing effective marginal tax rates of at least 60c in the dollar. Many of them face at least 60c in the dollar. I say that if 48½c in the dollar is a disincentive to work then surely 60c in the dollar is a disincentive to work and to participate in the economy.To achieve what we need to do to sustain prosperity in this country for a fair Australia, we must invest in the new sources of productivity growth and increase work force participation. The government’s response to work force participation is to do virtually nothing about those high effective marginal tax rates for low- and middle-income earners but to pick on single mothers and say to single mothers, ‘You must get out and work when your child turns six.’ But the wives of millionaires are actually paid to stay at home. What sort of incentive is that? On all reasonable criteria—economic management, equity, any capacity to look beyond the next election and invest in the nation’s future—this government’s 2005-06 budget is an abysmal failure.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
327,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Tuckey, Wilson, MP","SJ4","O’Connor","LP","N/A",157,"—The member for Rankin always says so many things that I practically do not have to bring my own speech to this place. As a person who has got a PhD in something—I am not sure what—it is interesting to hear him make some remarks regarding various aspects of government policy and the effect of overseas debt. He says that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer frequently made promises to follow policies that reduced the overseas debt. If you as a government reduce your own debt by $90 billion, what better policy could you follow? What he is really suggesting is that Prime Minister Howard should go on the John Laws show, predict death and confusion and the banana republic, and deliver the recession we had to have driven by 17 and 20 per cent interest rates. The member for Rankin is suggesting that that is good government policy to reduce overseas debt.Women are going out and buying themselves remarkably cheap Chinese clothing. Qantas, which is booming as one of the few profitable airlines in the world, might go out and buy another few 747s or 777s or a couple of airbuses. Of course we will borrow money from the rest of the world. The evidence is that they are delighted to lend it to us. But they are lending it to people who are making personal decisions about business or consumption, not to the government. I heard Prime Minister Keating or Treasurer Keating tell us time and time again, ‘The government are not borrowing from overseas.’ No; they just soaked up every dollar in savings that was floating around Australia and drove everybody in the private sector overseas.The real factor pointed out by the Prime Minister today is the fundamental fact that there is a simple test of the risk of overseas debt, and that is how much interest is being paid on that debt as a percentage of the nation’s exports. I understand that you are economically dead if that hits 27 per cent. That is apparently a huge danger signal. I read that many years ago and I will stand corrected, but it is about 27 per cent. The Keating government—and this is why I read it—got up to about 20 per cent. There was an article in the paper that said, ‘mate, you’re knocking on the door.’ The Prime Minister informed the parliament today that the current figure is nine per cent. I would imagine that is comfortable.The member for Rankin also talked about the Hawke-Keating reforms. I think in many respects they were excellent. They frequently followed policies that were espoused by the coalition election after election, policies that were criticised by the then government. But the big deal was, when they put their hands up to float the currency, we came out and said: ‘Good on you.’ I wonder what the response of the present opposition would be if that situation confronted us today. If they were to support the process, it would be about the first thing they have supported in nine years.The same applies with tariff cuts. When you are too scared of your base constituency, or at least of those who have a huge influence on your preselection, you do not go out and write the appropriate industrial law that, as reported in the media the other day, puts up the wages of a dozer driver in the Pilbara by $20,000 and gives that dozer driver access to staff superannuation; you do not do that. You have to find something that confuses the proletariat, so you drop tariffs. It is a nice blunt instrument. I am all in favour of it in a properly ordered way. But the massive drops of the Whitlam and Hawke governments just sent a simple message to workers that said, ‘If you don’t do something and readjust your wage demands, your job will go to China or Thailand or somewhere like that.’Another difficult thing is the sale of assets. The member sitting opposite knows very well that if we as a coalition in opposition had tried one iota of mischief on the sale of the Commonwealth Bank it would never have gone through caucus. But, as I remind people constantly, whilst the previous government borrowed $80 billion in pursuit of retaining office, they also sold tens of billions of assets and spent that money too. That is not what we did.Having said those things, it is interesting that the member for Rankin wanted to talk about public investment in education. What is happening out there in Australia? People are voting with their feet. They do not want public education. Many of them—sometimes with extreme financial pressure to their family budgets—are moving their children to private schools. Now, in a last line of defence, the Queensland government is legislating to ban for-profit schools. If there are people in our community who think the best opportunity for their kids is for them to go and pay money to a for-profit organisation and if we as the taxing agent can get a bit of that money back as a consequence of any profits made, what is wrong with that? This is an important process. We live with this myth that, unless the government provides the service, the service will not be provided.Every state education budget now represents 50 per cent of revenue from the Australian taxpayer, which is half the cost of educating a kid in a state school. I keep asking why we cannot just send the equivalent of the Australian government’s contribution to education to parents by way of a voucher which would be restricted to being cashed at school. Similar things have been done in other areas. Why can’t we say that ordinary Australians do not need a nanny state? I am arguing with my side of politics. We apparently think that people are so deficient in numeracy that, when an airline puts in a newspaper prices of airfares that need to be added up to get a total, the government should do it for them. That is going to create a few problems for small business, who might make a mistake one day and find the ACCC dropping on their head. I have already received communication, which I have circulated today, from the liquor industry saying, ‘Just how do we do that with WET and GST and all the other things that we are supposed to incorporate, which we now put in separately and say, “This is our price plus”?’ As I said, if you want to keep people thinking, maybe you can give them the odd arithmetic problem.I close my remarks in response to the member for Rankin’s comments by saying that we keep being told that the tax rate for somebody re-entering the work force can be as high as 60c to 70c. That is true. But there are all sorts of people out there working—functional families, a husband and wife with a couple of kids, both parents working, both paying taxes. There now seems to be an argument that, when a job becomes available which could be filled by a person who is not working and who is receiving payments due to the generosity of the taxpayer, we should bribe them into taking the job. They are only moving into the same situation as another person who is working in that form of employment. They have not had a job so the government, on behalf of the people, says, ‘Here is assistance for you.’ Of course, that is the nature of Australia. But if someone rings them up or puts an ad in the paper and they take a job, should we add half the assistance that was provided for their previous circumstances, at the cost of other taxpayers, simply because they have taken a job? I do not think we should. I think it is a mythical argument that we have created, and we have got all sorts of people trying to put up solutions. Why not say to everybody on a low income, ‘Keep half the equivalent of unemployment benefits’? You would not do that. I do not think it is an argument we might have to have. I think we are all convinced about it. But it has started to come to me as, ‘Why do I have to pay people to go back into the work force to actually assume a benefit that is different?’I want to touch on a particular couple of issues in the budget. A lot of people have said things about the new tax rates, and I will spend time on that. I have looked at this Welfare to Work proposal and I congratulate the government on what they are doing. I have received quite a lot of correspondence from people who say that they are single mothers who have a responsibility to their children and that they could not fulfil that responsibility if they were in the work force. I have two married daughters and one daughter-in-law, who are all in the work force, as are their husbands. One has two beautiful daughters, who are very well adjusted and very bright. Another has a son and I think he is a bit like me; he is a bit harder to describe. He is a lovely boy; and his mother works. My third daughter, who is younger, is expecting and I am delighted about that. She is the chief vet of the Western Australian racing industry—a very demanding and highly regarded job. And her husband works.All these families have the problems of getting their kids to school, getting them home and worrying about them. Sometimes someone says to me, ‘Well, I don’t have to be like those other women who work.’ But why do they work? To get on—and to send their kids to private schools, I might add. These are the issues. It is unfair to say: ‘I’m different because I’m a welfare recipient. I’m different from all those who work.’ I do not think welfare recipients are different. But, in order to accommodate both functional families and other, broken families, I cannot see why government is not taking more initiatives to encourage business et cetera to create more opportunities to work from home.In my time as minister for local government, I gave local government a $30,000 grant simply to go out and see how many of their staff positions could operate from home with modern technology. As an example, I am told that in the country town of Bunbury, which is represented by the member for Forrest, there is a Centrelink call centre with 300 employees. Why don’t we decentralise that call centre? We are having a good season in my electorate of O’Connor, but with good broadband why can’t some of the farmers’ wives or farmers who are presently in drought conditions sit at home doing their shift in a decentralised call centre?I had a visit from the institute of planners, drawing to my attention the recognised great shortage of town planners. I mentioned this survey I had given money to local government to conduct and the fellow said, ‘If that were available now and people could work from home, there would be no shortage of town planners.’ There are people out there, taking the family option, who have the skills and qualifications to be town planners and, unless you have a face-to-face job in local government, you can do that from anywhere with modern technology.There is a challenge for government to look at opportunities for married women and single women, including women who are no longer with a spouse—or, for that matter, women who are supporting husbands—to work from home. If they work four hours a day at home, they will net as much money as they would from going to work for eight hours a day if they had to pay for child care and those sorts of things. I make those sorts of points as examples of where we can have our cake and eat it too.I have spoken on personal tax cuts at length in recent times. I welcome wholeheartedly the measures of this budget and these appropriation bills, but the quicker we get rid of 42 and 45 the better. There is a myth in society. An anonymous email was read this morning. Let me say to the Labor members present: I do not think the Labor Party realise how many of their constituents, particularly in this town, are in those wage categories. They are not pleased with you—not pleased with you at all. There is a view in the Labor Party that, when you earn $25,000-plus a year, you vote Liberal. In fact, in the modern day, very large numbers of people on very high salaries do not vote Liberal, but they are pretty interested in how much stays in their pocket. I have never employed any person who did not at some time say to me: ‘Thank you for that offer, but what do I get in the hand? How much am I going to take home to my family?’ That is of fundamental interest, and I do not blame them for it.In these higher salary groups, if the tax burden and the add-ons get too high, the jobs will go to India. Government is a major contributor to the cost of employing people. We had better be careful about it because, when you get some high-quality person in your office to an interview and you start talking wages, they want to know how much is left for them. If you have to build that with huge tax burdens, you will start to say, ‘Oh, I can ring up IBM and they will get me some bloke,’ or there are Indian companies running around Australia now. They are the problems. It is no longer a world where certain things are ours because you would have to send gold bars to England to buy the alternative product. If we do not take note of that, we will not do people any favours.I read the other day that if Malcolm Fraser’s arrangements for indexing the tax thresholds, which were implemented I think when I was here, had been retained, the top marginal tax rate would now commence at about $270,000. That is evidence of bracket creep. A little while ago I heard certain representatives of the frontbench of the Labor Party complaining about bracket creep and saying that we were screwing the public. I have to agree: I think we are. But we should not be having this debate about what some people earn, the tax cut they get in absolute terms and what somebody else gets. If you want to have that debate it has got to be in percentage terms.It used to be said, comparing an American with someone living in the United Kingdom, that when someone living in the United Kingdom saw someone in a Rolls-Royce they would say, ‘I will get that bloke out of that one day,’ while in America that they would say, ‘I will own one of them one day.’ I think the psyche of Australians today is that we all aspire to something better and we are not jealous about the person who has got it. We should not be trying to get this argument up again. I think it is bad policy. We are not doing it. We are only part of the way as far as I am concerned. I will not go any further into how we can retain a reasonable budget.In that regard, the back page of the Financial Review quoted a Dr Sinclair Davidson of RMIT, who pointed out that the lowest 25 per cent taxpayers contribute 3.1 per cent of the tax collected, the middle group of taxpayers contribute 32.8 per cent, while the top 25 per cent of taxpayers contribute 64.1 per cent. People who earn over $100,000 or more account for 3.5 per cent of the population yet pay 25 per cent of all net income tax. I am not sure that that is entirely fair and I am not sure that it is smart. I do not know why we keep getting dragged into that particular argument and, for those who think it might give them a political advantage, I do not think it is resonating with the Australian people. I favour these tax cuts and I will go on arguing that the best way to get out of all the tax schemes that often trap people is to harmonise the company tax rate and the highest marginal tax rate. There are ways of achieving that. When we get to that our society will be better off. Someone made the silly remark the other day in Queensland that a flat 15 per cent for rural workers would be a good idea. There are not too many rural workers who pay a flat 15 per cent. That is further evidence of it. (Time expired)","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
328,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Ripoll, Bernie, MP","83E","Oxley","ALP","N/A",161,"—I rise today to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006 and cognate bills. It is amazing that, when we get to these appropriation bills, which are bills about taxes and the things that the government has done in the budget, government members—and I have listened to quite a few of them speak—barely mention the budget, the tax cuts and the details of how good it supposedly will be for their own constituents. There may be an explanation as to why government members are not spending a lot of time explaining how good the tax cuts are. It may be because they are not really that good at all. They talk about looking at it in percentage terms and in dollars. I do not really care whether government members raise it in percentages, in dollars or whatever. The reality is that a lot of people are realising that what they are getting is basically a couple of stubbies worth of a tax cut while people in the top bracket are getting a full buffet, a bottle of wine and a sixpack as well. I am also yet to hear many government members talk about how good this is for them, but I will get to that a little later.This budget was meant to be about Australia’s future. It was meant to be about trying to make Australia a more productive and efficient country and a better place for everybody, where people who work hard are rewarded more. I agree with a lot of the sentiments put forward by government members, by our members and by a lot of people who say, ‘Reward for work, reward for effort.’ I have no issue at all with that principle and that concept. The Labor Party is based on the principle of reward for effort and reward for work. But we do not see that in the budget. What we see are two principles, two ideologies. One ideology within the budget is very clear: it is the argument from the government and from Peter Costello that, to give people at the top end of the brackets the incentive to work harder, you need to give them bigger and bigger tax cuts and to reward them more.We just heard the member for O’Connor talk about what he believes to be middle and high and low, and he has it all over the place. These days when we talk about ‘the middle’, we are talking about anyone on $30,000, $40,000 or $50,000, right up to $80,000 or $90,000. The world has changed, and maybe a few government members should have a closer look at what people are earning in the middle. The ideology of the government in the budget with regard to the middle to lower end is that, to get them to work harder, you need a bigger stick: ‘We’re going to take more off you and we’re going to make it harder for you, because that’s the only thing you understand.’ That is what the government says to people.People will work this out. People will feel this, as the tax cuts start to come through from 1 July. People will start to understand that they are not really getting much of a difference. It is very little. It is always welcome; there is no doubt about that. I am being sensible about this: of course people welcome tax cuts. They would welcome it if you gave them one dollar, but it does not mean they are overly happy about it. It just means you are giving them back a little in return for the masses you have taken from them. In the history of this parliament, there has never been so much money, so much revenue, come into these chambers as now. It is the rivers of revenue that flow into Canberra in unprecedented proportions that can feed the huge surpluses and that can go back in the form of tax cuts. I would have been much more impressed with the tax cuts if they were more about tax reform. I think that is where we should have gone.The issues I have just spoken about are what the budget is about. It should have been about Australia’s future but it was really all about Peter Costello’s future. It was about him putting forward an agenda to demonstrate to his party room colleagues that he is the man to lead; that he as the Treasurer is the person who can deliver massive tax cuts—in terms of the totality, nearly $24 billion—and give the majority, the biggest bulk, the biggest chunk, to high-income earners. Those who are rewarded the most are people who sit in this chamber. I as well as everybody else in this chamber will get the biggest windfall out of this budget, and people will work this out. They will understand that the people who won out of this budget more than anybody else are those on the highest of high incomes—in that top three per cent, as the member for O’Connor said. Only three per cent of taxpayers in Australia earn more than $125,000 and yet they will by far get the largest chunk of the tax cuts.In this budget, Peter Costello’s focus was not on the Australian economy. It was not on efficiency; it was not on productivity and growth or fixing up bottlenecks. It was not on any of those things. It was not about making us a stronger, more robust, resilient economy into the future for the next 15 years. It was all about him, the Treasurer. It was about his personal ambition. It was about him making a statement to his backbench that he will make up for things that might have been lost in previous times.I am not the only person to have that view. Government members opposite might not be surprised at this, but former Liberal Party leader Dr John Hewson had this to say in the Australian Financial Review on 13 May 2005:This budget was much more about Costello attempting to build broader political support for his claim on the leadership than it was about setting a detailed medium-term policy agenda ...In short, the Treasurer was paving the way, with the rivers of revenue from taxpayers’ hip pockets, for his tilt at the top job. We know it is a little quiet in the Liberal Party at the moment but it is not too far away. The Treasurer really does not have too many choices, does he? He can be just a complete wimp on this issue and just not bother—why did he even drag people to this point?—or at some stage he has to make a move. We are all watching. We will watch this space.As I said, this budget and this government were about the tax cuts in themselves; they were not about tax reform. Tax reform is what the business community has been asking for, and that is what people on middle, low and high incomes have been asking for. Let us have a look at a real agenda to make the economy stronger and make our tax system a fairer tax system, and let us reward effort and work. Let us do it through a better tax system.There is an unprecedented amount that is being spent, but what is also unprecedented is the unfairness of that which is being spent on tax cuts. People need to remember that the reason the government is giving back such a chunk is that they have taken more than they have ever taken before, and it is not about to end. Future predictions of revenue to government through taxes are phenomenal and like nothing we have seen in the past. It is simply an unfair, unbalanced budget, and I believe that Australians deserve a better, fairer deal and that it can be easily achieved. In the words of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, they deserve a new deal. They deserve a new deal, because they deserve more than the $6.I know government members will laugh, but let me put it to you in these terms, which are quite simple. For the same impost on the budget, the same money—no extra—and without putting a burden or upward pressure on interest rates, you can deliver real tax reform to ordinary Australians, people earning up to $70,000, $80,000, $90,000 a year. You can give them not just $6; you can double it and give them $12. But that is only if members of parliament on the government side—the Liberal and National party members—are prepared to slightly cut their own tax cut. I just cannot see that happening. I cannot see that out of the goodness of their hearts they will walk into this place and say: ‘Hang on; these guys have actually got a point. Rather than pocketing $65, I’ll still get a fairly big tax cut, but a little bit less will be enough to redistribute down to the people who need it. There would be a decent impact on the economy, and it would give them double. I think that is a fair trade; I think that would actually work pretty well.’ They could do that.We are not opposing tax cuts. Where did the government get that crazy idea? We are putting forward a better, new deal on tax cuts—a $12 tax cut. We are saying to the government, ‘Support Labor’s agenda on tax cuts and give people $12 not $6.’ We are not about delaying or somehow making it harder in terms of tax; we want the tax cuts. We want to make it fair, and we want people to get a decent tax cut of $12, not $6, and at the same time deliver some genuine tax reform.People mention all that stuff about bracket creep and they talk about how any real gains we are getting are being whittled away. This is not even to mention what the Reserve Bank, the IMF, the OECD and a range of other credible institutions have said. They have made it quite plain and clear that delivering a $24 billion injection into the economy through these types of tax cuts will put upward pressure on interest rates. So one week people will get a $6 tax cut in their back pocket and the following week the Reserve Bank of Australia will be moving to put up interest rates and they will lose more than they will gain. Does the government believe that is fair? Those tax cuts will be eaten away in two ways: one, through interest rate increases and two, through bracket creep and inflation. There is no real incentive in terms of a decent tax cut for people from this government.I believe that a much fairer and more reasonable position would be to service the vast majority of Australians. I will give you some examples. This one is quite simple. In my electorate of Oxley the government are denying around 92 per cent of my electors a decent tax cut of $12 just because they want to keep their own tax cuts in their own pockets. I could go around this chamber and name almost every member in this regard—except, perhaps, three in the wealthier suburbs on the North Shore of Sydney who would not be in that category. Most government members are denying around 80 per cent to 90 per cent of their constituents fair and decent tax cuts.Again I want to turn just briefly to what Dr John Hewson had to say in terms of where the government is in relation to this budget and tax cuts. He said:Although the government would claim to be a tax reforming government, it has not really bitten the bullet of genuine tax reform. It has just danced around it.That was in the Australian Financial Review on 13 May 2005. So somebody of standing in the business community and in the Liberal Party such as Dr John Hewson also confirms that there just is not any real tax reform. This government claims to be the government of great tax reformers and so forth, but when you look at its record it does not stand. Where is the tax reform? Where are the great changes that will need to be made? It smacks of a lack of leadership. What we have seen is a lack of leadership. This economy and this country need solid leadership into the future.It is not by accident that we enjoy good economic times under this government. It was not the making of this government. They inherited it from the previous government. Any economist will tell you and anybody who is worth their weight in salt will show you that the easy figures on this 15-year economic growth did not come from the nine years of government from this mob. This mob inherited it. Even the Prime Minister said in 1996 that it was an economy ‘better in part than most’. He inherited a decent economy, an economy that had the fundamentals and the principles right. It was an economy built for sustainability into the future. It was built for growth and built to deliver the sorts of returns the government can now enjoy.It takes a very brave and courageous government and people with some fortitude and vision to take the hard decisions. They will hurt and often you will pay a political price for taking tough decisions. Tough decisions never come cheap. Sometimes the political price is losing office. But the reality is that you set the course for the next 20 years, a generation away from where you are today, for the future. That is what this government should do. I would not bemoan it if this government came into this place with a decent reform agenda on taxation. They would probably be very surprised. They would get a very supportive attitude from our side, from Labor, because we are trying to push for reform. The business community wants reform and I can tell you that taxpayers certainly want reform, but we are seeing no leadership in this area.There is another area where we see no leadership. A great opportunity has been missed in budget after budget, and we wait in hope. People wait in hope for leadership in terms of infrastructure. Infrastructure is a bit of a buzzword around the place and I do not want to overuse it in this chamber. But the reality is that Labor has been talking about infrastructure for years—to deaf ears in the government, I have to say. We have been talking about all sorts of infrastructure that drive our economy. But what have we seen from this government? The best they could come up with was AusLink, commonly known around the traps as ‘AusStink’ because there is not much in it. It is $12 billion, a substantial amount of money, but let us put that into context. Let us weigh up ‘AusStink’ on one hand with what the Queensland state government is doing in just one part of Queensland. I see the member for Maranoa in here and I do not think he could disagree with me if I said to him that a $55 billion state infrastructure plan legislated for—the first of its kind in Australia—actually delivers certainty. It actually gives the economy in Queensland a decent place to go into the future. It gives us direction.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is about roads, bridges, ports and airports. It is about ensuring a future for Queensland. Anyone who looks at the Queensland economy will agree that it has a very bright future. If only we could convince the leader of this country, the Prime Minister, to take on board some sort of comparatively weighted infrastructure plan for this country. If south-east Queensland alone—and, as I said before, I will take the interjection of the member for Maranoa—can spend $55 billion and have a 20-year strategic plan, why can’t Australia do that? Why can we not see this country take some leadership on some of these issues and give us some comparatively weighted infrastructure?I have heard the Treasurer, Peter Costello, bleating to us many times in this place about Dalrymple Bay. But what does he offer? One day we hear him bleating about it and then he comes into the chamber today and says, ‘Oh, they’ve actually done something about it and they’re going to have it done in two years time.’ Can the Treasurer do it faster? I do not think so. Has he offered any money? No. Has he offered any concrete criticism, anything positive, anything we can do to make Dalrymple Bay a more efficient port? No, he has not. All he is offering is criticism. He is not offering a solution.What do we hear John Anderson, the Deputy Prime Minister, say? He goes off and bleats about Dalrymple Bay without knowing what he is talking about. He starts talking about regulation and bringing in the ACCC. The same day he cops a backhander from the Prime Minister and has to apologise to the whole country and recant on what he said. Do you know why he had to recant? He had to recant because he did not know what he was talking about. I was completely offended by the Deputy Prime Minister talking about Dalrymple Bay, something he knows nothing of. All he knows is that 40 ships are sitting off the coast. Anyone could tell you that because they are sitting out there. But it is a much more complex and involved issue and, if people looked at it more closely, they would understand what has been taking place.Yes, I have some criticisms about what has been taking place, but something is being done. It did not take the federal government to do it; it took the Queensland state government to do it. They are working towards a solution now with prime infrastructure. But all we get from this government is criticism. You do not get a positive outcome. You do not get a solution. You do not get some sort of suggestion saying, ‘Okay, let’s work together. Let’s work in a partnership. Let’s find what we need to do to make this economy stronger and grow.’ No.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

337,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Scott, Bruce, MP","YT4","Maranoa","NATS","N/A",166,"—I rise tonight in the budget debate to talk about the further privatisation of Telstra. It has been on our agenda since we were elected in 1996, and at subsequent elections we have gone to the people of Australia saying that we continue our policy of looking to the further privatisation of Telstra. I will seek to table some documents during my address. I have checked with the opposition and they are quite happy. The documents I wish to refer to and table during my speech follow my study trip to New Zealand looking at the issue of privatisation of Telstra—what has happened in New Zealand and the comparison between the regulatory regime in New Zealand and Australia. There is quite a clear document which identifies the differences between the two regulatory regimes. Also there are some press clippings in relation to some of the things I will refer to tonight.Many in this House would know that the electorate of Maranoa is primarily a rural electorate. It is important that all of us in this House represent the concerns of our constituents. After all, they sent us to Canberra and it is our duty to make sure that their concerns are raised in whatever forums are appropriate, including our party forums. I will be raising some of those issues in my address tonight.To begin with, who could forget the state of affairs this government was left to deal with when we came to government in 1996, after 13 years of Hawke and Keating Labor government? I want to remind the House that in 1996, when the coalition came to government, not only were we left with a $96 billion debt, high interest rates and high unemployment but Labor had also deserted regional, rural and remote Australia, particularly in relation to basic telecommunication services and infrastructure. The Labor government had not only neglected the Australian economy but also abandoned the people who live in rural and remote parts of Australia.Telecommunications is an essential service for all Australians. It enables families to keep in contact with each other and allows businesses to conduct their day-to-day operations more efficiently. With the latest telecommunications infrastructure, school students can research their assignments on the internet. Tourists are more likely to visit if they can stay in touch with their families. In reality, the list of benefits from quality, world-class communications infrastructure is endless. Unfortunately, people in rural and remote parts of Australia are simply not always privy to—and have not been in the past—the same essential services that are accessible to people in urban and suburban parts of Australia. An inequity exists between city and country with regard to communications, and we as a government have been trying to close that digital divide.We all know that profits are the bottom line. That is the nature of any business; we understand that. Since Telstra were made a government business enterprise, they have had to make sure that they did not undertake any unviable business propositions. That was one of their responsibilities when they were corporatised in 1991. Telstra will still freely tell you today that, whatever they invest in, it is going to have to show a business return to Telstra in the near future. Sometimes that is four or five years away, but they have seen that as one of their very important charters since corporatisation. Unfortunately, this will all too often become the catchcry of a fully privatised Telstra. It is for this sole reason that the government must safeguard the people of the bush prior to the full sale of Telstra.Since coming to government we have done a great deal. I want to outline some of those things tonight. Many people in rural Australia have vivid memories of the privatisation of government business enterprises in the past. The Labor Party privatised the Commonwealth Bank and TAA, and they were necessary reforms, which we supported when we were in opposition. For that very reason, the people of rural and remote Australia know that when it happens it is all about the business bottom line. You have to make sure when you do that—and in this case when Telstra is fully privatised—that you put in place regulations to ensure that future services will not deteriorate. That is the fundamental concern that people of rural and remote Australia have. They know that we have done a great deal since coming to government. They know that it is our duty, and my duty as the member for Maranoa, to make sure that we future-proof communications services and grant access to new technologies as they become available in the future.I remember also that when Labor was in government they abolished, in law, a perfectly good mobile phone technology—the analogue service. It was working well. It reached further than many of our newer technologies because of its power and the type of system that it was. That technology was abolished by law without there being a replacement. I said earlier in my address that the people of rural and remote Australia are still well aware of the Labor government’s record, not only in their management of the economy but also because they took away a perfectly good mobile technology and did not have any plan to replace it or to provide funds to make sure that a new technology was rolled out.Since coming to government we have assisted in closing the digital divide that exists between city and country in telecommunications in Australia. Among other achievements we have had the Besley and Estens inquiries. Following the Besley inquiry a major fund was established called Networking the Nation. The Estens inquiry brought forward many recommendations which we as a government are still rolling out today and the money for which has been provided in the budget to ensure that communications advances continue to be made in rural, regional and remote areas of Australia. Following both those inquiries and the money that we have provided, we have seen substantial improvements in telecommunications infrastructure and I want to mention a few of those tonight.We have been able to inject some $1 billion of capital into infrastructure and the roll-out of new technologies. My own electorate has seen the roll-out of the extended zone contract for untimed local calls. When we came to government there were still 40,000 subscribers—and I know you had some in Tasmania, Deputy Speaker Quick—who still paid for timed local calls. So often I would hear people say, ‘All Australians have access to untimed local calls.’ That was wrong. Telstra needed money to put in new infrastructure so that those communities who for generations had timed local calls were able to access untimed local calls, like 99.9 per cent of Australians. That came as part of the extended zone contract. Being the successful tenderer, Telstra added value to their competitive tender by making available to those communities a two-way satellite which gave them access to the Internet, which was otherwise unavailable. That was a tremendous contract and a great step forward in technology for those many subscribers in rural and remote parts of Australia.The roll-out of the CDMA technology for mobile phones has been a magnificent replacement for analogue. The funding from the federal government enabled the roll-out of this technology in areas where the analogue system used to be. That roll-out has been expanded because of an injection of federal government capital into areas where mobile phone coverage was previously not available.The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts recently visited my electorate to view the latest communications technology in action. This technology has been made available following the Besley inquiry and the injection of more than $1 billion into communications infrastructure around Australia, particularly rural and remote parts of Australia. The minister was terribly impressed with what she saw. When she visited at a property north of Longreach in my electorate she saw three small children participating in a school lesson. What was so exciting about this was that, while it may be commonplace in the city to see children participating in a school lesson, I can assure you that it has not been a normal scene in rural parts of Australia.These three small children were located some 80 kilometres north of Longreach on their family property and were conducting their school lessons via the internet. The internet was connected via the two-way satellite. As I mentioned earlier, that came as part of the extended zone contract at no cost to this family or those who got connected through this technology. And they were using the telephone that comes through the wireless local loop as the clear voice signal. The wireless local loop, the CDMA technology, replaced the DRCS. The telephone call was a local untimed call to the Longreach School of Distance Education. So here were these students doing their school lessons 80 kilometres away from where the teacher was. There were students a further 200 kilometres away on the other side of Longreach, connected via the internet, via two-way satellite, using a clear voice signal. It was magnificent, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Quick—I am sure you can appreciate the scene.How it has changed, and only in the last few years. These students for decades and decades, until only a few years ago, did their school lessons over an HF radio system. On HF radio only one person could talk at once, and sometimes when atmospheric conditions were poor they could not even make contact with their teacher. This is a magnificent example of how the government’s communications fund money has been used to tremendous advantage to bridge that digital divide. To see young children being able to utilise world-class technology to gain access to education was certainly invigorating.There is still a long way to go to bridge this divide between city and country. In some parts of my electorate people still have a single-channel radio service as their main trunk route. What this means is that this technology does not have the capacity to allow for the installation of mobile phones in these communities. There is not the bandwidth capacity to be able to put mobile phones in places like Birdsville, Bedourie, Windorah and Jundah. In fact, you might have heard of those at question time today. The Minister for Small Business and Tourism answered a question from me today about how tourism is growing in these remote parts of Australia. She talked about the jobs that are being generated because of the tourism growth in this part of Queensland. I know it is similar in many parts of Australia. It is not just confined to the western part of my electorate. Those communities will not be able to have hand-held mobile phones while ever a single-channel radio system is their connection to the main trunk routes into the main network across Australia.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am talking about what we have done to bridge that digital divide and to replace the analogue service that was legislated by a Labor government to be abolished, what we have replaced it with and what we have done to bring modern communications into these small rural and remote communities. I said a moment ago that we have got more to do, that our job is not over. My job as the member for Maranoa is not complete, hence my speech tonight.Telstra Country Wide has been one of the most wonderful things that Telstra have done. I am sure that you found that in your home state, Mr Deputy Speaker. They put the face of Telstra back into the communities. They had walked away from those communities. They thought that people of rural Australia and those remote communities would always be loyal—they could go to Brisbane, Sydney and Hobart, and people would always stick with them.I can assure you that the people out there were very disappointed when that happened. It happened over many years, including under previous governments. But we have addressed that by law to make sure that Telstra has a face, which is one of the recommendations of the Estens inquiry—that they have a physical presence in 39 regions around Australia. They understand the geography and they understand the people, and that is why I have to say that Telstra Country Wide has done a magnificent job. My time is going to run out if I do not move very quickly to what I saw in New Zealand; hence I seek leave to table the documents in relation to the reports on what I saw in New Zealand.Leave granted.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
345,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Scott, Bruce, MP","YT4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—In New Zealand, I found exactly the same circumstances as exist in Australia. There are about 10 to 15 per cent of subscribers who they flag as non-viable business market opportunities. In other words, they have to be covered by a universal service obligation just as ours have to be in Australia, but many of these are in my electorate and rural and remote parts of Australia. There are many concerns from farmers who are living in these non-commercially viable markets in New Zealand, and that concern also resonates here in Australia. That is covered in the reports of my visit to New Zealand.What we have to do as we move to the further privatisation of Telstra is give confidence to the people of rural and remote Australia, wherever they live, that we are going to ensure that, through future proofing, they are not left behind again. They have been left behind before—not just by something that previous governments might not have done; it dates back in history, and I do not want to point the finger at anyone in that regard—and we have a responsibility to make sure they are not left behind in the future.The challenge confronting the government is that there are parts of Australia where commercial markets will not provide for new and improved services and infrastructure, because it is simply not a good business proposition for the carrier. The same applied in New Zealand. My fundamental concern as the member for Maranoa is to ensure general parity of pricing and equity of services between city and country post the full privatisation of Telstra. This includes connections of new services currently covered by price averaging and should include the cost of satellite internet infrastructure.I would require a minimum of three pillars to ensure future parity, with the first to establish a trust fund using the proceeds from the sale of Telstra for future technology upgrades. This fund would be dedicated to providing for any future upgrades to technology and/or infrastructure in rural and remote Australia and would be made available through a competitive tender. The second would be the establishment of a rural and remote independent telecommunications advisory board, which would need to report annually on service levels and conduct regular reviews on the standards of service every three years or when deemed necessary. Furthermore, I would like to see Telstra Country Wide being required by law to maintain a physical presence in rural and remote Australia as a condition of licence.

347,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Hall, Jill, MP","83N","Shortland","ALP","N/A",171,"—The Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006 and cognate bills we are debating here in the House tonight are related to a budget of missed opportunity, a budget under which the people of Shortland have fared very badly. It always makes me feel very sad when I rise in this House and see legislation that has been brought to the parliament that disadvantages the people I am elected to support in this House. There were just a couple of things that I thought the government could have provided to the people of Shortland that would not have been too big an impost for them.For a very long time, we in Shortland have been fighting for the government to reopen the Medicare office in Belmont. I have submitted somewhere in the vicinity of 20,000 signatures supporting the reopening of that office. It is in an area that supports an elderly population. It is in an area where there is a low level of bulk-billing. It is in an area where people really need to be able to access a Medicare office. But, unfortunately, the government was not prepared to move beyond its political agenda and provide that to the people in an area of great need—where 40 per cent of the people actually vote for the government.I think sometimes the government forget that there are a significant number of people who live within Labor electorates who actually vote for the government. If they have the mentality of only supporting and looking after those people who vote for them then they are ignoring the 40 per cent of the people there whose votes they got. I find it unbelievable that in this parliament the government can totally ignore people in an electorate that is not a Liberal held electorate.The problems that have existed at the University of Newcastle are well known in this House. They are problems that the minister has chosen to ignore. The University of Newcastle has three campuses: two in the Hunter and one on the Central Coast, the Ourimbah campus. I recently attended a meeting at the Ourimbah campus. That is in the electorate of the member for Dobell. I was really surprised when I found out that he was not in attendance at that meeting. Those young people attend an institution in the electorate that he represents, and I have not seen him standing up in this parliament fighting for that university to be assisted in its time of trouble.The third electorate-specific issue I will quickly touch on is Energy Australia Stadium, the home of the Newcastle Knights—a stadium that the Howard government has continually refused to support in any shape or form. It is interesting that it can find money to support a stadium at Penrith, a perceived marginal electorate, in the lead-up to the last election, but it totally ignores the needs of the people of the Hunter—people who are absolutely football mad, devoted to their team—and is prepared to let them have a second-class facility. It is very selective. Once again, it is a government that looks after its mates but totally ignores all other Australians, and I will go through a few issues here that will highlight some of my concerns.I started my contribution by saying that this is a budget of missed opportunities. It is a budget that ignores the fact that its answer to solving the skills shortage has been to import 20,000 workers from overseas. The problem we have had with the skills shortage has been in existence for some time. Towards the end of last year, I spoke on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill. In my contribution to the debate on that bill, I highlighted how the government’s inaction over a long period of time had resulted in this enormous skills shortage. I went through a report prepared by the Australian Industry Group which highlighted the shortages that existed in the Hunter and how small to medium businesses were having a great deal of difficulty in attracting the kinds of workers who had the skills to address the shortage.This situation has been allowed to develop over a long period of time. The government has actively allowed our training system to run down. One of the first acts of the Howard government was to rip money out of the TAFE system in all states. The result of this is a situation where you have fewer and fewer people able to access training.In this contribution, I have referred to the DEWR skill vacancy index of 2003-04 to look at some of the areas where there are skills shortages and some of the occupations where vacancies just cannot be filled. There has been a 38 per cent increase in the number of vacancies in the electrical and electronic trades. There has been a 21 per cent increase in the number of vacancies in the metal trades, a 45 per cent increase in vacancies in the printing trades and a 17.9 per cent increase in vacancies in the construction trades. That is an enormous increase in the number of vacancies that cannot be filled. It was also appropriate at that stage—and it is appropriate to do so again—to put on record that there has been an 8.9 per cent increase in vacancies in the last 12 months. In the Hunter, 61 companies reported a total of 805 vacancies in 2004, and 85 per cent of the companies surveyed were experiencing severe skill shortages; 633 vacancies were recorded at a trade level and above.I put that on the record because I think it goes to the core of the problem that we see before us. I believe that the budget that was brought down does absolutely nothing to address that issue. The government will be importing 20,000 skilled workers from overseas, but really we need something a little more proactive and a little more far-reaching. We do not need a government that will continue to attack our universities. We need a government that will ensure that every child that has the ability to attend university has the opportunity to do so. Currently under this government a situation is evolving where it is not your ability to attend university that determines whether you manage to go there; rather, it is your ability to pay. I do not think that is good enough.I know so many young people within my electorate who would really like an apprenticeship. I have actively pursued apprenticeships for some of them. I have contacted employers and contacted unions, and in a couple of cases I have been successful. However, generally speaking, the support that employers need in order to offer apprenticeships just is not available.While I am talking about skill shortages and issues relating to employment, I will put on the record a conversation that I had at one of the shopping centres in my electorate last Saturday morning. An employee of one of the Job Network providers came up to me on three occasions because she kept thinking of issues she needed to bring to my attention. She said that she was very worried about the government’s philosophy; she was very worried about the availability of places, of suitable jobs; and she was very worried about the government’s proposed changes in the area of disability support pensioners and single parents. She highlighted that there were not enough child-care places, there were not enough out of school hours places—I acknowledge the fact that the government provided more out of school hours places in the budget, and that is very welcome within my electorate—and there were very limited training places.She said that Job Network providers are having a lot of pressure placed on them to breach job seekers, and she found that particularly hard. She said that they are being asked to jump through more hoops more often and that the hoops are being raised higher and are more frequent. She said that, when they are working with job seekers, they go out of their way to create a relationship based on trust and that this pressure tended to undermine that. She also highlighted workload issues and how the breaching of job seekers adds to their workload and prevents them from doing the job that they are being asked to do, which is to find jobs for workers.When she was talking about people on disability support she highlighted to me a case of a 59-year-old woman whom she had managed to place three times. This woman was deaf. It took three failed placements before she realised that people with hearing impairment need special support. I can support that as well. Before I became a member of parliament I worked as a rehabilitation counsellor. My occupation required me to assist people with disabilities to enter the work force. The first point I need to make is that the way to get people to enter the work force is not to punish them but to give them a lot of support.I worked with hearing impaired jobseekers and I know how difficult it is to place them successfully and then to enable them to keep that job long term. I worked with one young woman for 10 years. We placed her in a job and even as a member of parliament I intervened a couple of times with her employer to give support and to negotiate to ensure that she maintained that employment. Finally, when there were some management changes she lost her job and is now unemployed. She is a very intelligent young woman but she has problems that are very specific to people with hearing impairment. Any member of this House who spoke to this young woman would see a very intelligent young woman with a lot to offer. However, when it comes to the placement in the workplace, it is not as easy as members opposite think.Another issue that was raised with me was casual work and requirements for casual workers on Newstart to actively seek a job. Someone working casually has to go out and look for a job as well and attend job training seminars et cetera. I was given the scenario of someone who works at the Job Network provider and delivers a session on job seeking in the morning but in the afternoon is required to go and attend the same session because she is only a casual employee. The issues of lack of stability and the inability to obtain finance to buy a house or to plan for the future were also highlighted.While I was at that shopping centre a gentleman came up to me and spoke about his young grand-daughter. He went to ALDI to collect an application form for a job for her. When he got there, they were out of application forms. There was one job and 5,000 people had already applied for it. That is why I believe that the government needs to be realistic about where it is going with these reforms. The government’s welfare to work changes are very punitive. The government is not fully aware of the issues that surround people with disabilities. It is just another way of creating a different category of people who are, to use government terminology, on the dole. It will result in peoples’ incomes being slashed by up to $215 a week.If you have a disability, you have special needs. Quite often you are taking medication. The government’s policy will just add to their hardship. It will make it more and more difficult for people with disabilities to even afford to look for work. If you have a disability and you decide to look for work, there is a risk. If you fail, where do you go from there? You could end up a lot worse than you were before you made the attempt to enter the work force.As for supporting parents and single parent families, I believe that the government is once again attacking some of the most disadvantaged people in our community. The member for Sydney gave an example that I thought was very good. She described a woman who is getting extra money through the family tax benefit because she is a stay-at-home mum. On his way home from work one night, her husband has a motor accident and is killed. Then she is a single parent and she has the family tax benefit reduced. I do not think that is fair, I do not think that is caring and I do not believe that the government has the real interests of people at heart.I looked at some figures today on the break-up of people on disability support pension, and that answered some of the questions for me. The 20 electorates that had the least people in receipt of disability support pensions were all government held electorates. So I suppose that members on the other side of this House feel that, if it is not going to affect the people living in their electorates, they can afford to attack those people who are most vulnerable and most disadvantaged within the community.I would like to mention quickly a paper released this week by St Vincent de Paul which highlighted the great divide between those people that have and those people that have not. This questioned the statistical data that was being used by the government and highlighted the fact that there is greater inequity within the community now than at any other time in Australia’s history. The divide between those people that have and those people that have not is getting greater. This shows that it is harder and harder for people on low incomes to survive. With the cost of living constantly increasing, those people at the bottom end of the income scale are constantly disadvantaged.The only thing that this budget delivered to age pensioners was an increase in the cost of their medication. As of this year, pensioners—and everyone else for that matter—will have to pay for an extra two prescriptions before they reach the safety net. I highlighted pensioners and veterans because they are two groups that are more reliant on prescriptions and medication than other people in the community. I was speaking to some partners of veterans today, and they are absolutely disgusted about the carers allowance. They are staying at home looking after their veteran partners who are extremely disabled, but they are ineligible for the $1,000 carers payment because they are not on the carers allowance. They feel they are being discriminated against. The other area as far as veterans’ affairs is concerned is the fraud that the government is putting out into the community. There is no new money. All the money in the budget in the area of veterans’ affairs is natural growth. In fact, there is an $82 million saving with the toughening up of the safety net.This is definitely a budget that ignores those people in need. I do not know how the member for Dobell can go back to his electorate and tell the majority of his constituents that they are getting a tax cut of $6 a week while he is getting $65 a week. I do not know how he can go back to his electorate and say to all those people on disability support pensions and single parent pensions that he is not going to support them or fight for them. And I do not know how he can say to all those young people who attend the University of Newcastle that he is not going to fight for them and for their futures.

351,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Smith, Anthony, MP","00APG","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—I will happily place on the record that the member for Shortland, who was listened to in boredom and silence, was not interrupted at all for 20 minutes. If she wishes to stay here and interject, that just reflects on her. I would have thought that on the budget, where we have a 20-minute speech, it would be possible for people to express their views without the member for Shortland losing control and without her trying to drown out people who have a different opinion to her. That might be something she is used to in the Labor Party. I would have thought that on a budget bill it would have been possible to have a calm discussion and to deal with some of the facts at hand.I point out again that she failed to mention interest rates, failed to mention the fact that the budget is in surplus and failed to mention any of the issues on which the Labor Party failed so tremendously when they were last in government. I can understand why she would want to do that. She wants to forget what Labor did when last in office. She wants to forget the fact that we had the recession we had to have and she wants to forget the fact that under Labor the budget—these very appropriation bills—looked very different. We were not talking about surplus budgets and we were not talking about budgets that were able to fund key responsibilities. That is what these appropriation bills do. They fund important national priorities, they fund reform that is needed to sustain the Australian economy in the years ahead and they plan for the future. I will address some of those in detail as I go.To give a budget speech and fail to mention the past and fail to acknowledge Labor’s past failure says one of two things: it says that either the Labor Party are ignoring their own history or the member for Shortland is ignorant of it. I am not sure what the answer is. Those opposite would have a better idea. For the sake of the record I will go through how things have changed in these appropriation bills compared to the last set of appropriation bills presided over by those opposite.For a start this is a surplus budget. We have grown used to surplus budgets under the Howard government and under the treasurership of Mr Costello. But of course in Labor’s day surpluses were rare things. In fact, they were so rare they were often spoken about in the latter years but never delivered. The last five years of the Labor government were the horror years for Australia in terms of fiscal mismanagement. In the entire period from 1900 until 1990 Australia had run up a debt of $16 billion. In the five years from 1990 debt rose from $16 billion to $96 billion. When you look at the figures and the budget outcomes you can see how that happened. We are talking about consecutive budget deficits of $11.5 billion, $17 billion, $17 billion again and $13 billion. In the final year of the Keating government the Leader of the Opposition, who was then finance minister, said this on 1 February 1996 in the middle of the election campaign, as quoted in the Age:We’re operating in surplus, and our projections are for surpluses in the future.What was the budget outcome? It was not a surplus but another deficit of $10 billion. That quote and that outcome will rightly haunt him as long as he is in politics, because it demonstrates one of two things: either in the election campaign he had no idea what the budget was doing and what the outcome was, how the so-called projected surplus had slipped into deficit—that is, he was ignorant—or, as the member for Cook knows, he knew all along. I will let him make the choice of which one it was. It was either ignorance or dishonesty. In that five years government debt went from $16 billion to $96 billion. This budget will take government debt down to $6 billion. Nine years of reform, difficult decisions on the budget and fiscal responsibility have seen that Labor-Beazley legacy of debt finally paid down to $6 billion. It has been a $90 billion improvement.What does that mean, tangibly, for the budget and for Australians? I can tell you: it means a great deal. The cost of servicing the interest on that debt was monumental. Every year, an interest bill came for the Commonwealth to service that debt. I want to take the time to go through those annual bills one by one. In 1995-96, when government debt was $96 billion, it cost $7.8 billion. I will go through the forward years from 1995-96: $8.4 billion; $7.3 billion—it starts to come down as the Howard government begins paying off debt—$6.9 billion; then $6 billion, as it comes down. Today the cost of servicing the much smaller debt is $2 billion. The difference between 1995-96 and today is a saving of $5 billion. That is $5 billion every year that now does not have to be spent on servicing the debt that was run up by former Prime Minister Keating and the current leader of the Labor Party, Mr Beazley; that is $5 billion more that can be spent on services like education and health—on the sorts of things the member for Shortland was talking about. That has made a tangible difference.As I said at the outset, this is a budget which has provided a surplus, is a down payment on Australia’s future and has managed to fund the important national priorities. The member for Shortland spoke about skills but neglected to mention that this budget funds 24 new Australian technical colleges. It funds important areas right across Australia. As I said, it funds reform such as welfare to work—important reforms that have to happen.Those opposite know that these reforms have to occur. The former leader, the now departed member for Werriwa, knew that was the case. In every utterance he could make before he became leader of the Labor Party he spoke about the problem Australia has with the number of people on disability pensions. But, of course, once he became leader of the Labor Party—as always seems to happen; whether they pass through some force field, I am not sure; the member for Cook might know—he became quite opportunistic. After writing more articles and speaking more from his backbench position than any other member of parliament, the member for Werriwa, when he became Leader of the Opposition, conveniently and opportunistically took the opposite position.This budget funds $21 billion worth of tax cuts—important tax cuts for all Australians to reward effort, to restore incentive, to basically give the economy that boost into the forward years that has to happen. I have mentioned skills and training and the technical colleges. Compared to 1996, the government is spending roughly double the amount on health—on pharmaceutical and Medicare benefits, new drugs being listed, important announcements in the budget on cancer and improved cancer care, important announcements on a national awareness for skin cancer, an important youth campaign discouraging smoking, funding for dementia, additional funding for carers and, importantly, the establishment of a future fund that will operate at arm’s length. They are all the sorts of issues that the member for Shortland and previous speakers opposite have conveniently ignored.I would like to mention how these benefits do not just accrue nationally but also fund in a tangible sense important things in the Casey electorate. The Roads to Recovery program was created by the Howard government. It funds roads through funding local councils directly. That program has been very successful and has made a tangible difference in the electorate of Casey, which straddles the outer suburban and rural areas of the outer east in Melbourne, the Yarra Valley and the Dandenong Ranges. We have seen $8.3 million for local roads in the region over recent years. This budget continues that Roads to Recovery program. It has been extended for another four years until 2008-09, and it is going to provide additional funding of vital need in Maroona and the shire of Yarra Ranges.The black spots program, again commenced by this government, recently has provided funding for two important projects in Croydon and in Lilydale, where traffic lights are being updated. That program has operated right across Australia. I am sure those opposite, in moments of candour and fairness, would say it has been a very good program. Aged care is a big long-term cost to the budget that the government is funding. We have seen an increase in high-care places, low-care places and specific places relating to dementia. We have seen that roll-out of the additional resources that we need.I mention all of these because these sorts of things were not easily possible in the Labor years. The choice to fund them meant a bigger deficit. That is where the run-down in aged care services, roads and some of the other important areas began to occur. I would like to take the time on some of the specific issues in the budget that also deserve a mention. The budget provides a surplus to fund these important areas. When you look at the financial changes that have occurred in the last five or six years, it is hard to imagine how they could have been funded in the Labor years, when we had those five consecutive deficits that I mentioned—an $11 billion deficit, two deficits of $17 billion, a $13 billion deficit and a $10 billion deficit. How would the budget of the years 1990 to 1995 have coped with the Asian financial crisis, the billion-dollar fund for the tsunami, the war on terror and the funding that has been needed for defence that was not foreseen before September 11? Between 1990 and 1995 that would have meant those deficit figures that I just read to the House would have increased. But we have been able to fund those things, meet those big challenges that are unforeseen but always around the corner, maintain increased spending in areas of priority and maintain a budget surplus that is the best guarantor of future prosperity and future funding of all these issues.I would like to mention in the remaining minutes some important local issues that I did not mention before. Nationally, as I said, we have doubled funding for health. In Casey the national policies that have been introduced by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, are having a good impact. They are very much welcomed by the electorate. On top of those there are some specific areas of funding that go directly to the Casey electorate, particularly the funding of a new after-hours GP clinic. Where the service will be based is still being determined, but it will be of major benefit to the Casey electorate and to the surrounding electorate of McEwen. Another service that is to be based in Boronia will service parts of the Casey electorate as well. On top of that there has been new Medicare funding for MRI equipment at Box Hill Hospital, which will benefit the entire eastern suburbs of Melbourne. We have had some important funding recently for the Small Business Enterprise Culture Program, which is helping small businesses and traders in Mount Evelyn, a town right in the heart of the Casey electorate that is really moving forward and moving ahead.There has been a massive increase in capital funding to both government and private schools over the last couple of years. The out of school hours child-care program, invented by this government, has proved to be very popular and a great success. It is something of increased importance to people in electorates like Casey where, more often than not, both parents are working and often travelling long distances. It is about a 40-kilometre trip into town. So that program is very popular and the extension of it is going to be very welcome indeed.There has been a massive increase in the number of apprentices in training. As I mentioned, there will be 24 technical colleges across Australia. It has already been determined that one of those will be in the outer east area in the electorates of Deakin, Casey, Aston and La Trobe. That will be of major benefit to my electorate, where trades are so important. Since 1996 there has been a massive improvement in the national unemployment figures. When the Howard government was elected in March 1996 the unemployment rate was 8.2 per cent; it is now 5.1 per cent, the lowest it has been in 28 years. In the Casey electorate, that rate has fallen, as you would expect. Casey’s unemployment rate is actually lower than the national average, which shows that the area really is moving ahead and that there is a demand for jobs. In 2004 the unemployment rate in Casey was 4.1 per cent, compared with the national average, which is a bit higher.This is a budget that provides opportunities to families and small businesses right across Australia. It is of great benefit to the Casey electorate. Importantly, it lays the foundations for future continued growth. The last five budgets handed down by those opposite were in deficit, which created a fiscal nightmare and a debt nightmare. Unfortunately, their approach in opposition has been to get in the way, to be a collective roadblock. We are seeing that at the moment with the tax bills. The opposition are now in a situation where they have to make a decision on whether they will move to disallow the tax schedules. The small businesses of my electorate and the small businesses of Australia wait for the Labor Party to make a decision. If they decide to disallow those schedules, they will not stop tax cuts, they will merely delay them. If they decide not to disallow them, it will mean absolutely that the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer have gone full circle and they will have egg all over their faces. We wait to see them make a decision. They decided a week ago not to make a decision. The small businesses of my electorate and the small businesses of Melbourne and Australia wait for the Labor Party to make a decision.The superannuation surcharge, which will be abolished in this budget, is another example that I will mention in winding up as an illustration of the confusion and hypocrisy of those opposite. That surcharge was a measure that we introduced to help pay off the deficits of Labor. When we introduced it, the Labor Party opposed us. Now we are abolishing it and they are going to oppose us. It is another illustration of their utter confusion and their economic muddle-headedness.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[11]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
352,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Garrett, Peter, MP","HV4","Kingsford Smith","ALP","N/A",179,"—This debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006 and cognate legislation is really one about equity. Great changes are taking place in the Australian political landscape, in the social landscape and in the economic landscape, but from the point of view of those of us on this side of the House ultimately the debate in this parliament over the past week or so on the budget has been a debate about equity.Whilst the government has finally delivered some tax relief to low- and middle-income earners—it left these people out last time—our contention is simple: the latest round of tax cuts is too focused on high-income earners. As a matter of record, the latest census information shows the average wage and income for Kingsford Smith residents—the electorate that I represent—is $39,826. So it easily falls into the $6 a week tax cut that the Treasurer has announced. When you compare that tax cut of the average worker in Kingsford Smith to someone earning, say, $130,000, the difference is large. A Kingsford Smith resident will most likely get $6 a week while someone on $130,000 will get $65 a week. That is why this debate is about equity and fairness.Labor members have consistently pointed out the implications of the budget. For an ordinary family on a combined income of about $90,000 a year most if not all of this tax cut has already been written off by the latest interest rate rise. On a $300,000 mortgage, which is about the norm in Kingsford Smith, an average family has had to fork out an extra $48 per month, so the tax cut goes. But on top of that, families are experiencing pressure from increases in the cost of living, such as the rise in petrol prices, increased costs for child care and of course the government’s broken promise over the so-called Medicare safety net. So the proposition that we put goes to the core of who benefits most from the tax cuts announced by the Treasurer, and the simple answer is that it is not the majority of Australian taxpayers.The budget is also under our scrutiny not because of the past record of the government but because of the likely future consequences of the surplus of the budget, the sequestering of money into the future fund and the likelihood of inflationary pressures embedded in that budget—inflationary pressures which, if you only get $6 a week, will impact heavily upon some seven million Aussies.Scant regard has been paid to the terms of Australia’s trade. It is very clear from media reports and reports from various departments and research organisations that we have a serious problem with our terms of trade. Our export growth is not good. There is something seriously amiss when we have ‘achieved’ 39 consecutive months of trade deficits, when net exports do not really contribute significantly to economic growth and when our current account deficit—now 7.1 per cent or so of GDP—continues to rise. Today we had figures coming out that our foreign debt bill is about $423 billion to $424 billion. There is no question that commentators, economists, those in the parliament and others of interest recognise that large current account deficits and foreign debt levels inevitably put upward pressure on interest rates, particularly in the event that economic turbulence arises down the track. The OECD recently noted:Australia has had a history of relatively balanced government finances but a persistent current account deficit, resulting in higher real rates.This links to skills, to the question and the issue of building an innovative export sector. But it also leads to the question of the long-term stability of the Australian economy. The current account deficit is of real concern and is something that was not addressed in this budget. Interestingly enough, when the Treasurer spoke about bringing down the budget, he spoke about sustainability, and I will come back to that later as I speak. But there are structural issues at play which the budget does not address. In respect of the current account deficit, CS First Boston estimated that our current account deficit would be more than 10 per cent of GDP if we had not had the current commodities boom. A figure of 10 per cent of GDP is a truly preposterous and clearly unsustainable figure.On the issues of welfare, the government’s welfare to work initiatives are really churn and burn policy failure. Changes to the disability support pension will mean that new entrants will be about $77 a fortnight worse off. When the budget seeks to address issues of welfare, namely by moving people from so-called welfare to work, what it really does is move people on a disability pension to a payment, Newstart, which has a high withdrawal rate. Changes in the way people are assessed do not take into account illnesses, such as mental illnesses, that many of these people have where symptoms can change over time.The government’s changes to single-parenting payments are, we believe, unfair and unworkable. By making single parents look for part-time work when their youngest child turns six, the government seems to be punishing sole parents. There does not appear to be much proper assistance to enable them to move from welfare to work. How many workplaces will be willing to provide flexibility so parents can get their children off to school in the morning and then pick them up in the afternoon? What about when kids are unwell and cannot go to school? The problems multiply.Then there is the question of employing people with disabilities, Madam Deputy Speaker. Even the Australian government has not managed to employ large numbers of people with disabilities—the rates in the figures available to us show that since 1996 the percentage of Australian Public Service employees with a disability has fallen from 5.6 per cent to 3.8 per cent. If the government will not employ people with a disability then how can they expect other employers to do so? A person with a disability who does not earn any private income currently receives around $482 a fortnight, but after 1 July 2006 on the new Newstart allowance this same person’s income falls to about $399 a fortnight. A single person on the current disability support pension who earns $500 of private income a fortnight receives $830.90 at present. From 1 July this same person’s total income will fall to $655.30. That is a significant decrease in the income available to these Australians who are amongst the most disadvantaged in our community.I want to refer in this speech to the St Vincent de Paul Society report which was released on Monday. It makes for interesting reading and it backs up some of the comments that have been made on this side of the House that the government in this budget is really allowing inequality to increase. The report, named The reality of income inequality in Australia, says:Contrary to recent assertions by the Government and certain researchers, income inequality in Australia is growing.What that report shows is that real mean incomes for low-income earners grew at 12 per cent between 1994-95 and 2002-03. For high-income earners real mean weekly income rose by 16 per cent. What this shows is that the government really has said to us that poor people are going to be better off—A division having been called in the House of Representatives—Sitting suspended from 8.18 pm to 8.33 pm","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
353,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Garrett, Peter, MP","HV4","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—As I was saying before the division, the real effect in terms of income inequality amongst Australians is shown in a report from the St Vincent de Paul Society called The reality of income inequality in Australia, which was released on Monday this week. It says:Contrary to recent assertions by the Government and certain researchers, income inequality in Australia is growing.The statistics that this report refers to show that real mean income—that is, average income—for low-income earners grew by 12 per cent between 1994-95 and 2002-03 but that, for high-income earners, real mean weekly income rose by some 16 per cent. Clearly there is a discrepancy. The statistics do not look too bad until you follow them through, when you see that the increases equate to an actual increase of $32.28 for low-income earners and $156 for high-income earners. There is a vast difference, and the issues of inequity that lie behind our opposition to the budget can be seen clearly in these figures.I note that the report is also critical of the government’s budget. It says:... there is no doubt that income inequality will grow even further once the tax cuts and welfare reforms are implemented.The debate about infrastructure, the predominance of those discussions within the House and the lack of real attention in the budget to infrastructure issues are one of the key features I want to address tonight. We can make the claim that the government is dropping the ball with regard to funding for infrastructure in Australia. The Deputy Prime Minister made a lunchtime announcement recently that the federal government would be taking over the ports of Australia. As the member for the electorate of Kingsford Smith, which houses one of the most important ports, Port Botany, I can inform the House that this was news to the port authorities, the local councils and the state government.Nevertheless, I think the real issue with the budget is that, because of the surplus that has been generated from the tax that has been taken, particularly through the minerals boom, Australia has never had a better opportunity to ensure that we set a platform for long-term sustainable growth. But when we look at the budget we cannot see any substantial initiatives about what that platform might be. We have a future fund, which I will refer to later, but otherwise there are no substantial initiatives to deal with what has been called a bottlenecked infrastructure crisis. There is no real sense that this is being considered by Treasury or by the Treasurer.When we look at the sketchy details that have been given to us about the future fund, we see that the premise of the future fund is a false one—that is, to pay ongoing superannuation obligations. The Productivity Commission, the government’s own Intergenerational report and long-term cost reports show that the public sector superannuation liability will be declining as a share of GDP over the next 40 years; and it is clear that, even with surplus budgeting such as the Treasurer has projected, those liabilities will be met. So there is a question about what will happen to the future fund, to what ends it will be put and who will benefit from participating in it. I notice with interest an article by Alan Kohler in the Financial Review of 11 May where he says:... the Future Fund (that is, gaining the effect of compound interest by locking up the money in the RBA bank account, investing it a bit better and reinvesting the income) could produce decades of Liberal Party hegemony.He is saying that it could greatly assist the Liberal Party over the coming decades. Whether this is true or not, we do not know. What we do know is that we have not got a sufficient amount of information in the parliament to enable us to have confidence that the future fund, as proposed by the Treasurer, is an appropriate use of those future surpluses.Australia is gripped by drought. The country is literally drying up as we watch. Farming communities are experiencing great stress, and there is an intolerable burden upon them, particularly those in marginal areas, as they seek to maintain the productivity of their land without any rainfall. I said in my first speech in the House that climate change is the most pressing issue that this country and the global community face, and I restate that tonight. We are in the warmest autumn, I think, on record. Three of the last 10 years were the driest years that this country has faced. If ever there was a challenge that Australia really had to come to grips with, it is the challenge not only of climate change but also of the impact that drought will have upon our farming communities and ultimately upon farm exports.There was not much provision in this budget for drought relief—although I do note, and welcome, that that has in part been addressed subsequently. More importantly, no consideration was given in the budget to long-term issues of sustainability—the sustainability of our use of landscape, which ultimately is the sustainability of our economy. Nowhere do we see something that is quite common in company reports—that is, triple bottom line reporting. We do not have any reporting in the nation’s accounts that gives us an indication as to the impact or cost that the national economy has upon those things which are not costed—namely, the natural capital of this country: the air, the water and the soil.As members would know, triple bottom line reporting, or sustainability reporting, is an attempt in the nation’s sets of accounts to put a value on environmental and social externalities and, by so doing, to provide a more accurate representation of the country’s overall health. Wealth becomes health. A number of institutions, eminent academics and governments have argued for some time for the need to increase the level of environmental and social reporting—and, in fact, some parts of Europe have begun the process.Speaking as someone who has recently come into the parliament, who has a passionate concern about the environment and about the long-term sustainability prospects for this country, I am astonished that it is not addressed in the national budget. After all, we rely on that environment for our economic as well as our social and environmental wellbeing.The European Union, the Australian Collaboration, Environment Business Australia—numerous authorities and academic institutions have proposed something akin to triple bottom line reporting. There are a number of good reasons to do it, not least of which is that many people consider that the environment is as important as the economy in determining their quality of life. There are various opinion polls around, but I refer to a European Union study which shows that about 88 per cent believe that environmental concerns should be taken into account when economic or employment policy is developed.It is true that environmental awareness and concern in terms of poll figures here in Australia may have plateaued in the late eighties and early nineties, although, as with all polling, it certainly depends on the question that is asked. For instance, the Lowy Institute recently reported a large-scale poll on Australia’s international obligations. It asked people what they rated as the most important issues that Australia should take into account for foreign policy. Equal numbers of people believed that the environment—as well as job, employment and security issues—ought to be dominant. In the absence of strong environmental leadership, though, there is no doubt that the public concern may wax and wane somewhat.But underlying these remarks is the fact that environmental wellbeing is absolutely critical to our economic as well as our social health. The closest thing that we have to an integrated report to consider the environment in Australia is the Australian Bureau of Statistics project called MAP—Measures of Australia’s Progress. It contains economic, social and environmental indicators, but the project only provides us with summary information, and it is only intended to be used in conjunction with other reports like the budget; whereas really it should be embedded in the budget.Before I came into the parliament, I was involved with something called the Australian Collaboration, which was a collection of churches, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, aid organisations, a conservation organisation and others. Amongst their deliberations and recommendations was an identification of the need to establish a comprehensive, regular and independent reporting procedure for trends in human wellbeing. I think people are calling out for this. It is important for us as parliamentarians to understand the economic jargon that is associated with bringing down a budget as best we can and it is important to communicate to the public about it—but so are issues which go to people’s wellbeing, and the environment is certainly one of them.I note that the Australian Collaboration recommended a number of initiatives which would help to bring into place independent reporting procedures for trends in human wellbeing. They include regular, comprehensive and independent national reporting of social, environmental and economic trends. At present, where that reporting exists, it is in disparate places and is not drawn together in one easily accessible or comprehensible strain. The recommended initiatives include annual preparation of a new set of composite indicators that provide continuous measurements so we know how we are going. Nowhere could this be more important than with climate change or evaporation rates, for example, in our dams and rivers at present. The Australian Collaboration also recommended the introduction of comparable reporting regimes in all states so that we can form a national snapshot of the environmental state at a given point in time. And, of course, it recommended that government agencies assist this by publishing triple bottom line reporting and that public corporations, universities and community organisations also publish triple bottom line reporting—and already a number of them do that. Progressive corporations understand that there are environmental and social responsibilities, and it would be very important to see those in this budget.

354,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Pyne, Chris, MP","9V5","Sturt","LP","Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing",183,"—Today, in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006 and cognate bills for the following financial year, I want to comment on three areas that the Minister for Health and Ageing has been kind enough to give me since the election that have caused a bit of concern since the budget was handed down. In three areas some misinformation has been raised in the community and in the media, particularly by the shadow minister for health. They include community concern over the Codex, community concern over the country of origin labelling issue and the concern raised by the shadow minister for health over spending on mental health. In the appropriations debate tonight, I would like to put to put to rest the three concerns that have been raised.Mental health is a shared responsibility between federal, state and territory governments, business and consumer groups alike, consumers and carers. Mental illness is not discriminatory; it affects everyone either directly or indirectly. With one in five Australians suffering from a mental health disorder in any one year and three-quarters of all mental health problems beginning before the age of 25, it becomes every Australian’s concern.To help combat these alarming statistics, the Australian government has done a great deal over recent years. Between 1995-96 and 2001-02, the Australian government’s own expenditure on mental health care increased by 47 per cent in real terms, from $770 million to $1.145 billion. This included funding for the medical benefits schedule to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and funding provided under the National Mental Health Strategy to facilitate further mental health reform for the first and second national mental health plans. Through the Australian health care agreements of 2003-08 the Australian government is providing funding of up to $331 million to all states and territories to facilitate further mental health reform under the National Mental Health Strategy. A further $66 million in Commonwealth own-purpose outlays funding has been allocated for national reform activities.The federal Labor Party have not been able to get their minds around the complexities and diversity of administering mental health in Australia. The recent scare campaign run by the opposition health spokeswoman, the member for Lalor, about mental health funding and the better outcomes for the mental health program showed us what a shallow wading pool the Labor frontbench has emerged from in recent years. Madam Acting Deputy Speaker Bishop, it certainly is not the frontbench that was in office when I first came into parliament in 1993, when you had already been here for some time.These days, Labor are more concerned with scoring cheap political points than considering for a second the real concerns their scare campaign might have caused amongst mental health groups and those suffering from mental illnesses. In fact, it is an indictment on the Labor Party. It is interesting that the member for Lalor, who came to parliament only in recent years, could be their spokeswoman for health, a very important area of government policy, and also the Manager of Opposition Business in the House. I am sure it frightens many long-term Labor supporters, members of parliament and former cabinet ministers to see the Labor Party sunk to the depths that they have unfortunately sunk to in recent years, although on this side of the House we welcome the position of the Labor Party. It makes it much easier for us, but it is sad for public policy when people of such limited public experience can be as important in the opposition as the member for Lalor is these days. Federal Labor remain an empty vessel when it comes to mental health. They are without ideas and without policies or even a vague intention of announcing any and have recognised that mental health is an excellent whipping boy for cheap political stunts and scaremongering.On the other hand, the coalition government continue to champion the cause of mental health in Australia. We named and shamed the state governments who have neglected their state mental health systems for so long, and now we see mental health becoming targeted spending areas in state government budgets. The coalition have put mental health back on the agenda and made it a priority for state government spending. It will horrify members of the House to know that, after deinstitutionalisation in the late eighties and early nineties at the state level, for every $6 the states had spent on institutionalisation in mental health, $5 was returned to state government coffers and $1 was spent on community support for the mentally ill.From that decision of the states back in the late eighties and nineties and from their failure to support the mentally ill in the community have come many of the woes that the mentally ill are experiencing in Australia today and that we trying to ameliorate at the federal government level. Remember that, in fact, the federal government has no constitutional jurisdiction in the area of mental health, and yet one-third of every dollar spent on mental health in Australia comes from the Commonwealth.The Australian government’s Better Outcomes in Mental Health Care program has assisted GPs with education and training to help them deliver care to patients with mental health problems. We are reaffirming the Australian government’s commitment to the prevention of, and early intervention in, mental illness in the community and we have committed $228.5 million over four years to 2008-09 for the best practice management of patients with mental health. The $228.5 million is available to continue to fund the better outcomes in mental health initiative, with $102 million committed in the budget and $40.5 million for the expansion of the initiative announced as part of the government’s mental health election commitment. This additional funding will increase access to allied health professionals and allow greater focus on rural and remote primary mental health care through better outcomes in mental health. In addition, there is $86 million for a new Medicare chronic disease item including patients with mental health problems.The highly successful national initiative on depression beyondblue also continues to raise the awareness of depression at the same time as breaking down the stigma of this insidious illness. I think it is no secret to members of the House that having Jeff Kennett, the former Premier of Victoria, as chairman of beyondblue has dramatically raised the profile of mental illness in Australia. He often says to me that, yes, he has raised the national consciousness about mental health but, in lifting up that rock and exposing the slaters, centipedes and snails that exist underneath, he has highlighted the problem and now governments have to try and fix it. That is what we have been trying to do.To that end the Australian government has provided a further $40 million over five years to expand the work of beyondblue. You would remember, Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, that beyondblue began as a Kennett government initiative. Sadly, Mr Kennett lost the election, but Mr Bracks picked up the idea as the Premier of Victoria and, to his credit, put money into beyondblue. Every state followed suit except New South Wales—the state from which the Deputy Speaker comes. They started their own group called Black Dog. It is unusual that New South Wales needs to have their own group; I do not know why. But they have their own organisation. These days beyondblue is largely funded by the Commonwealth government, with the states’ support, and we are very pleased to fund it. The funding supports early intervention, encourages research and improves information about depression. The funding will also assist beyondblue to establish a national postnatal depression screening and follow-up program for new mothers.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

356,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Pyne, Chris, MP","9V5","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","—The honourable member for Blair says hear, hear and well he might because, in fact, beyondblue did an excellent research program into postnatal depression as one of its key signatures in the last couple of years. Now, with our support, that is being expanded into a service delivery program so that the research does not just sit there—so that it does not just get talked about at conferences and forums and evaluated et cetera but actually becomes a real program for new mothers about postnatal depression.We are also helping beyondblue to target workplace depression by continuing to provide a voice on care and treatment matters. The organisation beyondblue works with many different partners across Australia, including the Alzheimer’s Association, the Australian Football League, the Australian Rotary Health Research Fund, the Centre for Adolescent Health, Jeans West, Inspire Foundation and Lifeline.When left untreated, mental health problems like depression and anxiety lead to serious alcohol and substance abuse problems. Half of all young people with alcohol and substance abuse problems can directly attribute them to untreated or poorly treated mental health issues. Three-quarters of all mental health problems begin before the age of 25.Young people with mental health problems will benefit from the Australian government’s $60.9 million election commitment to boost funding over the five years from 2004-05. The initiative will support the health care system in the detection, early intervention and management of young people with mental health problems, including those with complex mental health needs related to substance abuse. The initiative will also improve access for young people to appropriate services and ensure better links and coordination between services for young people in their local areas. The youth mental health initiative is something that the Minister for Health and Ageing and I are working on right now, with a view to making announcements later this year about exactly how that money will be spent and on what it will be spent.Mental health and suicide prevention are obviously linked. While the government continue to invest and develop policies targeting help for those with depression and other mental health problems, we are also investing in suicide prevention measures. Under the National Suicide Prevention Strategy the Australian government has committed approximately $10 million since 1999 for addressing suicide prevention in a range of population groups across their lifespan, including young people and other groups identified as being at risk. The two largest spikes for suicide across the lifespan are the youngest people and the oldest people. Before 1999 the government’s program was to in fact target young people alone. I am glad to say that since 1999 we have expanded the policy across all age groups. I was in New Zealand recently meeting with the minister who is responsible for suicide prevention in New Zealand. This year, in 2005, they have just adopted our strategy of dealing with a whole lifespan rather than just young people. So it is good to see the government program being exported across the Tasman, where they do not need to recreate the wheel but can pick up some of the work that we have been doing.Implementation of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy is guided by LIFE, a framework for prevention of suicide and self-harm in Australia which provides a strategic framework for national action to alleviate suicide and promote mental health and resilience across the Australian population. Over 170 community based initiatives totalling over $22 million are being funded across states and territories according to locally identified priorities. The Australian government is currently considering recommendations put forward by the National Advisory Council for Suicide Prevention for funding under the National Suicide Prevention Strategy until June 2006. All the above activities represent a long-term investment in the social and emotional wellbeing of Australian communities, but they also have the potential to achieve cost savings for the community.We have lots of friends that work with us tirelessly on the mental health crusade, and we would not be able to make any headway without them. We thank our friends at beyondblue, SANE and Lifeline; all the members of the Mental Health Council of Australia, the Australian Divisions of General Practice and the Psychological Society; and all the GPs and allied health services. In the academic world, the college of psychiatrists and general practice keep the training going. There are many others who relentlessly work to support those suffering with a mental illness, particularly their families and friends. We acknowledge their strong commitment and the extraordinary effort that they make to help their loved ones have as normal a life as possible and, quite frankly, to save the government and the Australian taxpayer vast amounts of money through the unpaid care which they provide to their children and to their friends.There are two other issues in my area of responsibility that do not touch on mental health but that I would like to touch on tonight. One is Codex and one is the country of origin labelling issues, both of which have come up with some drama in the last couple of weeks. On the matter of Codex, in Australia vitamin and mineral supplements are regulated as complementary medicines under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989—as you would know, Madam Acting Deputy Speaker Bishop, having had some experience in the area of complementary medicines over your political lifetime. They are required to meet the same standards of quality and safety as other types of complementary medicines, and the TGA is responsible for the regulation of these medicines in Australia. In some other countries these products are regulated as foods and are subject to the standards and guidelines that apply to food.The Codex Alimentarius Commission was established in 1963 by two United Nations organisations: the Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation. Its main purpose is to protect consumer health and to ensure fair practices in international food trade through the development of food standards and guidelines. Codex standards and guidelines are developed by committees of the commission, which are open to all member countries, including Australia.The Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses has developed draft guidelines on vitamin and mineral food supplements. The draft Codex guidelines on vitamin and mineral food supplements specifically state that they apply in countries where vitamin and mineral supplements are regulated as foods. As these products are regulated as medicines in Australia they will not be affected by the proposed Codex guidelines. The TGA is aware that many consumers have expressed concerns that the draft guidelines on vitamin and mineral food supplements, as developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, will have an effect on the regulation of vitamin and mineral supplements in Australia. The proposed Codex guidelines on vitamin and mineral supplements will not apply in Australia and will have no impact on the way these types of products are regulated in Australia.I can assure all those people who are genuinely concerned about the role of the Codex Alimentarius Commission in the regulation of our vitamin and mineral supplements that the Codex guidelines will not apply in this country for the very simple reason that we do not regulate vitamin or mineral supplements as foods; we regulate them as medicines. As a consequence, the Codex guidelines—for all, I am sure, their great benefits—will have no impact at all on the way our vitamin and mineral supplements are regulated in Australia. So all those people who keep emailing me, particularly from Queensland—may I say to the honourable member seated here—do not need to continue to do so because I can assure them that they have nothing to be concerned about.There has been a similar level of public interest in the country of origin labelling issue. Food Standards Australia New Zealand works to protect the health and safety of people in Australia and New Zealand by maintaining a safe food supply. It is a bi-national, independent statutory authority that develops food standards for composition, labelling and contaminants—including microbiological limits—that apply to all foods produced or imported for sale in Australia and New Zealand. FSANZ has recently sought public comment on the Draft assessment report: proposal P292—country of origin labelling of food. FSANZ was seeking to amend the current requirements for the country of origin labelling of food to bring the labelling requirements for unpackaged foods into line with the general labelling provisions of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code and to address the inconsistencies between the current transitional standard of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code and Australia’s World Trade Organisation obligations.FSANZ sought public comment on its proposed changes to country of origin labelling. It proposed that, where foods are sold unpackaged, the standard require that displayed with the food, or provided or made available to the purchaser on request, is a statement identifying the country of origin of the food or a statement indicating that the food is imported. Obviously Australian consumer and industry groups were concerned that giving retailers the option to make the country of origin information available only upon the request of the purchaser might create a less transparent system, making it more difficult to be sure you are purchasing good Australian produce. Currently the code requires that there be identification of the country of origin on imported unpackaged food or an indication that the food is imported.The coalition government have already indicated that we will not support any dilution of the current code and that we wish to ensure the clear display of the country of origin on unpackaged food at the point of sale. We continue to support the mandatory labelling of imported produce because we believe consumers have the right to know when they are buying imported produce. Public consultation is part of the FSANZ process. It is required to go through public consultation when it is reviewing standards. I wish to assure all members and their constituents that there is no enthusiasm at all in the federal government for us to remove the requirement for consumers to be able to know clearly at point of sale if they are buying an imported product or a domestic product.For all of the Australian producers of fruit, vegetables and other unpackaged foods, we believe it would be a radical and unhelpful departure for consumers to have to request information from the retailer as to whether the product they are buying is imported or domestic. We believe it is important that, when a consumer purchases products, they can look directly at the point of sale and note whether they are buying an imported or a domestic product. I want everyone in the House and all of those people who have emailed me about this on a regular basis to know that, again, as with Codex, the government do not intend to depart from our previous policy.

357,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Gibbons, Steve, MP","83X","Bendigo","ALP","N/A",189,"—I am glad to see my good friend and parliamentary colleague the member for Hinkler in the chamber tonight. The Treasurer’s 10th budget represents yet another budget of lost opportunity, especially for central Victorian motorists who use the Calder Highway between Melbourne and Bendigo. The government continues to walk away from its commitments to this project and blame the state government for delays in completing the construction when the real cause of these delays is the federal government’s failure to adequately fund its 50 per cent share of the construction.The Calder deception has involved the federal government constantly shifting the goalposts. The Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads confirmed this last Thursday when he told a deputation from Bendigo that the state government should finance the rest of the construction and the federal government might—and I emphasise the word ‘might’—provide its 50 per cent share at some stage over the next 10 years or more. Can you imagine a building construction company accepting a contract from the Commonwealth government to build a building in the hope that it might get paid some time over the next 10 years? I am sure you cannot. I do not know any company or business that would be silly enough to accept this proposition and the Victorian state government is no exception, especially with this government’s sorry record of honouring its commitments.An article prepared by the Bendigo Advertiser and published on 25 May 2005 said that the Bendigo electorate was amongst the poorest in Australia, with an estimated 15,500 people living below the poverty line. Bendigo city has unemployment levels varying between nine per cent and 12 per cent. A La Trobe University study showed an economic benefit of close to $500 million and potentially an additional 2,700 jobs for the region when the Calder project is completed. The highway in its current form is experiencing vast increases in traffic volumes and is becoming increasingly dangerous, with many accidents occurring in non-duplicated sections. The Liberal Party have promised to match the state government’s funding for this project for the past two federal election campaigns, but the federal government is currently $82 million short of its full commitment. The state government has now allocated its full 50 per cent share towards the completion of this project.It was the Howard government that first granted the Calder Highway its road of national importance status in 1996, qualifying the highway for joint Commonwealth-state funding. Now, because it suits the government’s political agenda, the Calder Highway is no longer a road of national importance. However, the Scoresby and Pakenham road projects retain their RONI status. Why? Because it suits the Howard government’s current political strategy.The Howard-Costello government have always played political poker with Victorian road funding, declaring and then abolishing Victorian roads of national importance—or RONIs—to suit their political agenda of the day. Mr Costello deals all of the cards in the game of political poker, and he has allocated another $120 million for the Scoresby project in this budget when he knows that it will never be needed. The state government has made other funding arrangements for Scoresby and no Commonwealth funding is required. The Treasurer has not the slightest hesitation in using people’s lives as pawns to advance his personal self-interest. Mr Costello has several federal Liberal MPs whose seats surround the Scoresby corridor to protect, especially when he needs every Victorian MP’s vote he can secure for a future tilt at the prime ministership. Playing political poker is one thing, but using people’s lives as the stakes is just beyond comprehension. And this man, this Treasurer who has no hesitation in using people’s lives as pawns to get what he wants, aspires to be Prime Minister of Australia.The Howard-Costello government’s announcement of an increase in the threshold for claiming the Medicare safety net completes a series of broken promises since the 2004 federal election. The average central Victorian family budget has received yet another substantial hit since the October federal election because of the government’s backflip over its absolutely rock solid, ironclad commitment to keep the Medicare safety net in its original form. The backflip is bad enough but, in what can only be described as criminal, the government also spent a massive $20 million of taxpayers’ money in a media blitz in the run-up to the federal election telling us how the Medicare safety net policy was carefully crafted and fully costed.This latest example of this dishonest government’s willingness to say and do anything to get through an election campaign completes a sorry picture of deceit and broken promises since the October election. First we had the election promise to keep interest rates low. The Reserve Bank then lifted interest rates by 0.25 per cent, cementing Australia’s place as having one of the highest interest rate regimes in the Western world. At the same time they approved massive increases in health insurance premiums of between eight per cent and 19 per cent, after promising that their policy of the 30 per cent Medicare rebate would drive down health insurance costs.Then we had the pre-election commitment not to send more troops to Iraq, yet there are now an additional 450 soldiers on duty in southern Iraq. And now we have the increases in the Medicare safety net threshold, after what the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing said during the election campaign with regard to keeping the Medicare safety net in its original form. At a Sydney press conference on 8 October 2004, the Prime Minister said, ‘Well, I commit to keeping it in place.’ Mr Abbott, in an interview on 6 September 2004, said, ‘That is an absolutely rock solid, ironclad commitment.’ This arrogant government is clearly showing nothing but contempt for the Australian political process and the Australian people. Average central Victorian families are paying up to $339 extra per month because of this government’s deception. At a time of rising petrol prices, families are under increasing pressure. The last thing Australians need are John Howard’s and Peter Costello’s porkies adding pressure to the family budget.The Liberals talk about sound economic management. Sound economic management Liberal style means hitting families with rising interest rates, rising child-care costs and rising medical costs. The Howard government can only manage to provide a miserable $6 by way of a tax cut for most Australian workers. The attitude of the Liberals shows that they have no understanding or respect for the plight of most Australian working men and women. Since the 2004 election the Howard-Costello government have displayed utter contempt for Australians. It has been proven that they will say and do anything to get elected—untruth after untruth hitting Australian families. The sad truth is that the Liberals perpetrate untruths and Bendigo working families pay. In the six months since the 2004 election John Howard and Peter Costello have broken six of the very promises on which they were re-elected and this budget provides very little by way of relief to average wage and salary earners.No. 1, John Howard and Peter Costello broke their promise that interest rates would not rise. Their $66 billion spending spree and their neglect of the nation’s skills and infrastructure needs put upward pressure on interest rates. This has added another $579 per year to the cost of servicing a $300,000 mortgage. No. 2, Peter Costello and John Howard’s broken promise on the Medicare safety net has added $200 to health costs every year for average income families whose out-of-pocket expenses reached a new threshold of $500. For singles and higher income families the threshold was jacked up by $300 to $1,000. No. 3, John Howard and Peter Costello broke their promise to families with kids in child care to introduce an uncapped 30 per cent child-care rebate from 1 January 2005. No rebate will be available until July 2006. For a typical family with a child under five years of age in full-time day care this means that they will be $1,557 worse off this year because they will have to wait until January 2006 for any rebate.No. 4, Peter Costello and John Howard broke their promise to single income families to increase the maximum rate of family tax benefit part B by $300 from 1 July 2005. The cash bonus available in 2005-06 was reduced to $150. In other words, that was $150 less than they promised at the election. No. 5, the Howard and Costello government broke their 2001 election promise that the private health insurance rebate would reduce health insurance premiums. And that has been broken again, with an average eight per cent increase in premiums since March this year. That has added $164 per year to average premiums for a family with hospital ancillaries cover. No. 6, as I said before, the Howard and Costello government said before the election that there would be no further addition to the number of troops deployed in Iraq. Now there are an additional 450 troops serving in that part of the world under extremely dangerous circumstances.Australia’s current interest rate of 5.5 per cent is among the highest when compared with those of other advanced economies around the world. Australians are already paying among the highest interest rates when compared to other economies that Prime Minister Howard and Treasurer Costello like to compare Australia with. In the United States, the federal fund rate is about 2 per cent. In Europe the Central Bank’s key interest rate for Euro economies is around 2 per cent. The Bank of Canada’s overnight rate is 2. 5 per cent. In Japan the official discount rate is just 0.1 per cent.If you want to look at housing loan interest rates in 2005, you will see that the reality is that Australia’s rates are also among the highest in the Western world, significantly higher than those in the US and the UK and more than double that of Japan’s. This completely buries the myth peddled by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that the coalition will always preside over lower interest rates. Another 0.25 per cent interest rate increase would mean the standard variable rate would increase from 7.3 per cent to 7.55 per cent, resulting in an additional $48 per month on an average monthly mortgage repayment for a $300,000 loan over 30 years. That is what Australian working families have to look forward to.National statistics show that sales of new houses and home units fell a further 4.5 per cent in January to a new four-year low. Housing Industry Association new home sales figures show that fear of interest rate rises continues to impact on the new home market, with house sales down 1.5 per cent and unit sales down a massive 21.2 per cent. The Prime Minister and Treasurer are constantly trying to portray the coalition as the government of low interest rates when in fact Australia’s interest rates are among the highest in the developed world.Regional Victorian motorists have paid a staggering $198 million more in petrol taxes since the introduction of the GST, with central Victorian motorists contributing a massive additional $22 million to the Howard-Costello government’s fuel tax rip-off. The Howard-Costello government claimed the GST would lead to a drop in some indirect taxes, but when it came to petrol taxes the GST was used to conceal a grotesque petrol rip-off. The fuel fraud was revealed at a national trucking convention in Newcastle where my parliamentary colleague the shadow minister for regional development and roads, Kelvin Thomson, proved that, if the government had stuck to pre-GST fuel taxes, it would have reaped $41 billion in the past four years. Instead, it was estimated that it collected more than $44 billion.Spread evenly across the nation, this made regional Victoria’s share of this secret windfall around $198 million. I suspect our true share of that vile amount is even more than the $198 million, given that country people pay more per litre for their fuel and, according to transport economists, make more long car trips than city motorists. Country people are even more affected by the secret taxing because of the transport costs component in absolutely everything they consume. The country transport industry has every right to feel angry about this.In his address to the Australian trucking convention, the member for Wills said that in 2000-01 total petrol tax revenues were $8.38 billion. In 2004-05, it was estimated the tax take would be $9.32 billion, almost $1 billion more than in 2001. By the end of this financial year, the federal government will have collected an estimated $44 billion in petrol taxes since the GST came in—$36 billion in excise and $8 billion from the GST. If the government had stuck with the pre-GST petrol tax arrangements, it would have collected $41 billion, or $3.31 billion less during this period. Even allowing for the 1.5c per litre cut in March 2001 and for revenue forgone as a result of the nonindexation of petrol excise, the Howard government is still over $3 billion better off in petrol taxes since the introduction of the GST.The Howard-Costello government’s approach was to walk away from its responsibility to fund and maintain Australia’s national highway network while its AusLink strategic regional roads component was used as a $93 million slush fund in coalition held or targeted seats during the last election campaign. The miserable $6 tax cut for most Australian wage earners will disappear when they fill their vehicle with fuel each week. The Howard-Costello government admitted in Senate estimates on 14 February 2005 that most of the AusLink strategic regional project funds established by legislation currently or recently before the parliament were dished out during the election campaign without following any application or assessment processes. The coalition ignored the commitments in the AusLink white paper of June 2004 that there would be an application process, a call for submissions, and project development and assessment guidelines, which would then be published in late 2004. The government admitted in Senate estimates that this simply did not happen—it did not happen before the election and it has not happened since.The Liberal and National coalition government has turned AusLink into yet another slush fund for the government’s political benefit, which would explain the coalition’s appalling record in inadequately funding the Calder Highway development. Legislation setting up new discretionary funds is currently before the parliament, and Labor has referred the AusLink bills to a Senate committee for scrutiny. The coalition committed almost $100 million out of a total of $150 million allocated on the AusLink strategic Regional Partnerships program during the election campaign. The Department of Transport and Regional Services conceded in Senate estimates that there would be no cost-benefit analysis of the projects. Despite having committed almost two-thirds of the money as election commitments, Minister Lloyd still saw fit to tell the Australian Local Government Association national general assembly on 10 November 2004 that the AusLink regional strategic fund was:...based on competitive applications, so the enlistment of your local Federal Members—and get this—Coalition and Labor to advance a well documented case for serious projects is keenly awaited.There were not too many Labor projects funded, let me tell you. This raises more serious questions about the way the government do business. They promised a more strategic approach to land transport planning under AusLink but went ahead and used the money allocated to engage in old-fashioned pork-barrelling in the run-up to the recent federal election.This budget contains $11.1 million for the Australian Defence Force for assistance in the Boxing Day tsunami affected regions. The Prime Minister in his usual fashion has exploited this tragedy for his own self-promotion. He has certainly got his $11 million’s worth of value from this commitment. Prime Minister Howard has virtually admitted that he made the men and women of the HMAS Kanimbla spend useless time at sea so that he could seek the glory of welcoming the ship back home after it had concluded its duties in the tsunami ravaged regions. The PM has been caught out playing politics with Australian service personnel who are crew members of HMAS Kanimbla.The ADF people on Kanimbla had performed an outstanding tour of duty in Aceh, where they were confronted with almost unimaginable death and destruction resulting from the Boxing Day tsunami. They finished their task and were headed home when they were turned around to assist in the aftermath of the second earthquake off the Indonesian coast. Faced with a catastrophe of enormous proportions in Aceh and given that they had lost nine of their colleagues in the tragic Sea King accident during the second tour of duty, they should have been given every opportunity to get home to their families at the earliest possible time. A simple study of the cruising speed of the ship and a comparison with the officially reported time it arrived in Townsville showed that the Kanimbla could have arrived in Sydney as early as the Thursday, two days before its Saturday arrival. What makes this appalling matter even worse is that Prime Minister Howard told the John Laws radio program yesterday that, while he had not ordered the ship to wait, that was certainly the understanding that the commander of the ship expressed. When a commander of the ship gets a request from the Prime Minister that he would like to be there to welcome the ship, that is taken as a paramount order; and that is what happened. Certainly that is the understanding from at least one unnamed officer on the Kanimbla, who told the same radio program, ‘We were ordered to slow our ship down to arrange our arrival for shortly after the Prime Minister’s flight was due to land home from Greece.’The simple facts are that the Kanimbla arrived outside Townsville Harbour—and you would be well aware of that, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, because that is part of your region—at 6.55 am on Tuesday, 26 April. Townsville Harbour is approximately 1,080 nautical miles from Sydney Harbour. The RAN web site states that the Kanimbla travels at 20 knots per hour. One thousand and eighty nautical miles divided by 20 knots or nautical miles per hour equals 54 hours, or 2¼ days travel. Kanimbla could very easily have arrived at its base at Garden Island on or shortly after midday on Thursday, 28 April. She arrived home on Saturday, 30 April around 1 pm. The Prime Minister is reported to have arrived home in Sydney at midday on Saturday, the same day. John Howard has been caught out in a vain grab for glory at the expense of military people who had already been asked to do so much and who had already made substantial sacrifices. It was opportunistic, shabby and shameful, and he should admit his arrogance and apologise.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
358,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Jensen, Dennis, MP","DYN","Tangney","LP","N/A",194,"—All this criticism of the coalition’s economic policy is interesting, particularly on issues such as interest rates, when all one has to do is have a look at the records to see who has a better record as far as economic management is concerned. Labor has decided to oppose the tax cuts theoretically, as a matter of principle. Let us reiterate this: Labor does not want to give any Australians tax cuts at the moment. Labor is proposing a tax cut regime whereby Australians would get their tax cut in 2008. Clearly, that is not a situation that we should seriously consider.It is worse than this. They are causing confusion for business as far as tax schedules are concerned. The schedules have been tabled but there is no word as to whether the schedules will be disallowed or not. This has thrown businesses into confusion. The crazy thing about this is that there is really no hope of achieving anything. The tax cuts in the budget will be passed in the new Senate and all they can do is delay things. This opposition to tax cuts is simply spoiler tactics to make the Leader of the Opposition look tough, but it is to no avail. It is a case of Labor putting politics before the national interest or the individual interests of Australian taxpayers. God help us if we should get a Beazley government, where politics would be the primary issue of importance and politics would completely override policy.As I said, the opposition leader is attempting to look tough. This move clearly demonstrates that he is trying to walk both sides of the street yet again. The opposition leader knows that he cannot stop the tax cuts in the medium term, so he sees this as a risk-free strategy for Labor: all care, no responsibility. On the one hand, he cannot stop the cuts, which deep down he knows are in the national interest; on the other, he believes that he will appear to be a leader of principle. What principle?The Labor position is one that is entirely damaging to all concerned—apart from Labor’s perception of political advantage. It is stopping every Australian taxpayer from getting a tax cut that they so richly deserve and therefore it damages the financial position of many households. Maybe the $6 tax cut does not mean very much to the Leader of the Opposition, given that he is sitting on a very comfortable pay packet, but it means a great deal to many people waiting for tax relief. The Leader of the Opposition can afford to play fast and loose with tax relief; he can afford it. But many Australians cannot afford the unprincipled game playing that Labor are embarking on to try to gain some political credibility for the Leader of the Opposition. Newsflash for the Leader of the Opposition: you gain credibility by doing the hard yards and generating some real policy; you do not gain credibility by playing games with people’s pay or adversely interfering in business operations in a damaging way just to try to gain perceived political points. This clearly demonstrates why Australian voters did not, and do not, consider Labor fit to govern. Labor are far too fickle in playing politics over the national interest.I notice that the member for Kingsford Smith is here. I am sure that he, being very environmentally aware, would be interested in my next subject: Australia’s water crisis. Water is a precious resource. In Australia, the driest inhabited continent on the planet, we cannot afford to take it for granted. Australia’s prosperity depends on a secure water supply for our houses, farms, environment and industry. A growing population and degrading river systems have shown why the nation needs new and better ways to secure water for the future. Mandatory water restrictions are now in place across each state in Australia. In Sydney, for example, as at Thursday, 26 May this year, the available water storage in Sydney’s water supply reservoirs was a mere 39.7 per cent of capacity. In my own state of Western Australia, water storage in the dams on Monday, 30 May was a meagre 25.1 per cent of total capacity.There are a few different ways that you can attack the problem of the dwindling water supply. One way is to simply move people to where the water is. However, this is a case of social engineering, and social engineering in this sort of way never works. You cannot force people to live where they really do not want to. Another way is to reduce water consumption. Of course, we have water restrictions in the capital cities, so clearly this is an avenue that is being tried, but it will only work to a certain extent. It is limiting and it clearly does not help farmers. We can use grey water recycling, but once again there is limited scope for use of this method. A method that is popular, it would appear, with the Western Australian Labor government and also with the New South Wales Labor government is desalination. However, there are significant environmental and energy costs. I do not believe that they have been anywhere near adequately evaluated.The method which we really need to look at is getting water to where it is needed. The first thing to do is to identify the best site where there is water. Twenty per cent of Australia’s rainfall flows into the Ord River catchment. There is a fantastic proposal that a constituent of mine has proposed that clearly shows out-of-the-square thinking, which is to pipe water from the north-west to Perth and the other major capital centres of mainland Australia. The cost would be about $55 billion to $70 billion. However, this is a cost that would not be borne by the taxpayer. The cost of delivered water would be between 18c and 23c per kilolitre in constant 2005 dollars over a period of 50 years. In effect, the cost of water would, in real terms, be reducing over this period.As I said, this system, at essentially no cost to the taxpayer, would from the outset be in public hands. How is this achievable? The idea is to sell water rights to farmers and other interested parties for a period of 50 years for around $8,500 per megalitre. This would give owners of the land that the pipe crosses approximately $22,000 per kilometre right of way for easement. Water supply to water rights owners would be charged at about 3c per kilolitre to provide funds for ongoing operational expenses. The water rights would be a tradeable commodity for the water rights owners—in other words, the farmers.The idea is that about 80 per cent of the water rights would be marketed for agriculture and about 20 per cent would be for urban use, which would obviously help with the urban dam situation. The pipe length would total about 7,200 kilometres. About 15 per cent of this would go through land that is suitable for irrigation. If you work on a lateral distance of up to 25 kilometres from the pipe, as far as irrigation is concerned, you can then determine the total land area. Using this, you can see that there would be a very significant economic benefit to all of Australia.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is an issue that you brought up in a speech, if I recall correctly, about two months ago.Domestic utilities would be able to sell the additional water that they get at about 45 per cent above cost. The water cost to the agricultural sector would be cheaper than it is for irrigation purposes now. Let us have a look at the state of affairs on this. In 1975, an acre-foot of water cost approximately $35. Currently, it is approximately $326. Clearly, looking at this, we can see that water rights would be an appreciating asset.How will farmers afford water rights? Reliable water will increase the value of the land, as I have stated. The idea is that in order to gain a loan from the bank, the landowner will purchase, in effect, an intention to purchase a water right for a cheap price, whereafter the farmer can go to the bank with a strategic business plan and obtain a loan. There is potential, as well, for any excess water—and as the member for Kingsford Smith said, there is variability in the rainfall in the areas; there is variability everywhere—in the years where there is an abundance of water. It could be purchased and fed into the Murray-Darling catchment, with the potential to assist farmers in the catchment area as well and still enable the Murray-Darling system, particularly the Murray, to have a healthy flow at the mouth of the Murray River.I commend this proposal to the House. I believe it is an excellent proposal to consider, given that, as I mentioned, there are a few different methods in which you can attack the water problem. As I have said, I do not think that moving people to where the water is will work. Reducing water consumption clearly works, but there are limitations. As far as recycling is concerned, it can only be used to a certain extent—there are limits—and with desalination there are significant environmental and energy costs. In terms of the Western Australian proposal, you are talking about 10 per cent of the base load electricity, which will be used for the desalination plant in addition to the chemicals that are put in the front end and are going to go into Cockburn Sound, which is not a well-flushed waterway. In conclusion, the way to do it is to get water where it is needed. I believe that this is an excellent proposal that really deserves consideration in terms of helping to alleviate Australia’s water crisis and to give many farmers some surety as far as water supply is concerned.","Second Reading","APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2005-2006","/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1/speech[15]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
365,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Tanner, Lindsay, MP","YU5","Melbourne","ALP","N/A",196,"—This budget sees the end of the Howard battlers and the triumph of the Costello silvertails. The government is awash with money; it is literally drowning in revenue. Spending is out of control. It has delivered tax cuts that are heavily skewed to high-income earners, and it has made virtually no serious hard decisions on spending or on tax reform. There are punitive changes regarding the disability pension and sole parent pension, and there is a very limited strategy towards seriously lifting work force participation. There is an entirely unnecessary future fund which effectively involves the government borrowing to play the stock market, a new, subtle socialist strategy on the part of the Howard government—government ownership by stealth—to tackle what is really a minor problem: public sector superannuation obligations into the future. There is minimal action to address very serious structural economic problems such as capacity constraints and infrastructure difficulties; investment in education and training; excessive borrowing and consumption, which are clearly underpinning to the current growth we are experiencing; declining non-commodity exports, which are a crucial component of our soaring current account deficit; declining productivity; and the absence of any serious reform agenda on competition and productivity.The Howard government is literally drowning in money. It has had the good fortune to be in office during a demographic peak. We reached a point—roughly about 2002-03—where about 47 per cent of the population were in the work force, but after about 2010 that will start to drop dramatically. It has also had the good fortune to experience an enormous commodities boom, which has had a massive impact on tax receipts, and, of course, it continues to benefit in varying degrees from bracket creep.Since the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers in December, we have seen that the projections for company tax for the forthcoming financial year were upgraded by $5 billion and the projections for income tax upgraded by $2 billion. That is just within six months. To give a more stark illustration of the massive increase in projected revenue, the 2003 budget projection for company tax proceeds for the 2005-06 year was $36 billion. That has been upgraded in the 2005 budget for the same financial year to $47 billion. There has been an $11 billion upgrading of the assessment of company tax revenue for that financial year. Had there been no new policy initiatives after the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers in December last year, the surplus in the forthcoming financial year would be $15 billion, not the $8 billion that is projected. So in effect the government in this budget has given away a further $7 billion on a giant spending spree that started in the 2004 budget and of course was continued during the election campaign.In 2004 the Howard government had a 10.75 per cent real increase in its own-purpose spending, which is the fastest growth rate for federal government spending since 1983. It was fuelled, of course, by the notorious 1982 budget, which just happened to be the last budget with John Howard as Treasurer—but at least he had the excuse of being in the middle of a recession and the need to pump prime the economy. So there has been a giant increase in federal government spending. Roughly three-quarters of the revenue windfall that the government is experiencing as a result of this economic good fortune is effectively being given away over the forward estimates period.Add to that fact that all recent budgets except the 2001-02 budget have hugely underestimated the revenue and cash balance outcomes, what that amounts to is a picture of a government literally drowning in money. There has been virtually no action on spending in this budget. The only significant spending reductions have been the backflip on the Medicare safety net and minor tightening of the PBS safety net, saving in effect only an average of $400 million per annum over the forward estimates years. There has been no action regarding the outrageously wasteful and politically driven Regional Partnerships program, nor the vast array of similar spending programs that are politically driven that are using enormous amounts of taxpayers’ money for naked political purposes.This budget has rightly been described by ANZ Chief Economist Saul Eslake as involving ‘the biggest budget giveaways in history’ and creating a ‘distinct possibility of further interest rate increases’. The budget is leaving the Australian economy enormously vulnerable to the prospective impact of future falls in commodity prices, which will have a significant impact on taxation receipts, capital gains tax receipt reductions and things of that nature. Added to that we see very wasteful new spending that is completely off the track in terms of the appropriate structural reforms required, such as the absurd technical colleges proposal—the government directly invading areas that are the province of the states.The government has used its largesse to shower tax cuts on the better off. If you look at Budget Paper No. 1 on page 1-10, you will see that over the three sets of tax cuts in 2003, 2004 and 2005, some of which come into effect in 2006, for those earning between about $60,000 a year and $100,000 a year there is an effective 12 per cent reduction in their income tax burden. But for those earning around $40,000 to $50,000 a year over those three budgets there has been only an effective three to four per cent reduction of their income tax burden, a very serious skewing of the distribution of tax cuts in favour of higher income earners.The budget papers also suggest that a lot of this is simply the returning of bracket creep. If you look at Budget Paper No. 1 on page 10-9 you will see that revenue from income tax is projected to grow from $111 billion in 2005-06 to $133 billion in 2008-09, effectively a 20 per cent growth or five per cent per annum. By 2008-09 it is projected that income tax collections will in fact be a slightly higher percentage of GDP than they are projected to be in the immediate future. In other words, the tax cuts are trimming cream off the top but not really restructuring the tax system, except to shift the burden away from higher income earners and in effect increase the burden on lower income owners. That is what this is all about.The government’s response to this is to talk about the politics of envy. That phrase is what you hear when there is a rich person’s hand in a poor person’s pocket. It is the last refuge of the political scoundrel. If the economy deteriorates and we need serious surgery on the tax scales, if there is a serious need for fiscal repair, you can bet your life that the Howard government will not be reimposing the burden on higher income earners who are benefiting from its largesse. It will hit people lower down the scale.The budget does nothing serious to deal with the participation issue, which is one of the biggest challenges facing the Australian economy. We have nominally record levels of participation in our work force but, when part time and full time are factored in, it is at a much more modest level. We are still only 12th in the OECD with work force participation rates and we are below the OECD average for people over 55. We need a real effort to make it easier for people to get into the work force. Instead, we have had a nasty punitive assault on those on the disability support pension and sole parents, punishing them and diminishing their entitlements.The tightening of the disability test for DSP applicants means that we will now have three categories of people on the DSP: those who have been on it previously, those who go on to it between May 2005 and June 2006—to whom a 30-hour work availability test will apply at the start and thereafter a 15-hour test—and finally those who apply for the disability support pension after June 2006. Those who are already on it will have an enormous incentive not to look for work or take work because, if they do, they will be taking an enormous risk: if they take a job and then lose it or they find they are unable to cope, they may not be able to get back on the disability support pension.There is a range of other changes of very dubious purpose. Sole parents whose children are above the age of six will be forced on to Newstart and, therefore, will face a substantial increase in their effective marginal tax rates from 40 per cent to 60 per cent. There is a $504 million increase to Job Network for welfare to work purposes, but it is counteracted by a $457 million cut to general Job Network funding. The criteria for the highest level of Newstart assistance have been made tougher. Wage subsidies are being reintroduced for disadvantaged job seekers, which—as has been the case in the past—will be wide open to employer rorting and churning. The different indexation arrangements between pensions and other entitlements will mean that the gap between Newstart, on the one hand, and the disability support pension and sole parent pension, on the other, will continue to grow, making the problems I have referred to previously even worse. We will see sole parents losing access to the pensioner education supplement. There is very limited new child-care money, most of it coming on stream only in 2008. We will see nothing new for long day care funding and only about 20,000 training places for the hundreds of thousands of DSP and sole parents whom we aim to get into the work force. There is minimal action on the biggest problem in the Australian taxation system: the effective marginal tax rates. Labor’s alternative proposes a serious assault on that problem.The budget proposes a future fund, which effectively involves the government borrowing to play the stock market. To keep the bond market alive, the government is refusing to repay government debt. That is similar to what has been occurring with the government having had enormous amounts of money on deposit at the Reserve Bank—up to $16 billion in recent times earning 5½ per cent—while at the same time paying similar amounts and in some cases higher on outstanding government debt. Keeping the bond market alive, for whatever is the government’s purpose, would have to qualify as perhaps the most bizarre industry assistance scheme Australia has ever seen: an employment creation scheme for bond traders. The future fund proposal is effectively the equivalent of a person getting a substantial pay increase and, instead of paying off their mortgage or paying for their kid’s education, putting that money away in a bank account to cover their next 30 years of council rates. That is the equivalent of what is happening with the future fund.The public sector superannuation issue is a minor problem. It cost the public purse $3.4 billion in 2003-04, which is less than two per cent of total outlays. It can easily be carried on a pay-as-you-go basis and it will decline over time. There is no doubt that eventually, sooner or later, The Nationals will get their grubby paws on the money in the future fund and it will be there as an additional pork-barrelling source. The money should be given back to taxpayers and in the most effective way, which is into individual occupational superannuation accounts. That means that the money would go into investment and not consumption. In addition, because fluctuation in future surpluses is unavoidable, it is not locked in as a permanent tax cut. It would help fill the retirement savings gap and could become a permanent part of the reform of superannuation tax.This budget does very little to tackle the enormous structural problems in the Australian economy: capacity constraints, skill shortages, excessive consumption, household debt, deteriorating export performances and declining productivity. There are many worrying signs of these problems in the budget papers. For example, there is the absence of serious new skills and education initiatives, with the exception of the absurd and wasteful federal technical colleges proposal. The OECD data in Budget Paper No. 1 at 4-24 shows that Australia is lagging the OECD very seriously in post-secondary non-university education—that is trade and TAFE. We are well below the OECD average.Demand growth has been 5.6 per cent over the past three years while GDP has averaged only 3.1 per cent. In other words, we are spending the largesse that the terms of trade change have delivered to Australia; we are not investing it. Since 2000, the vast bulk of the increase in nominal household wealth has come from housing prices rather than productivity improvements, compared with between 1992 and 2000, where it was the reverse. From the figures for 2004-05, the year we are about to complete, we can see that GDP growth has been contributed to more by household consumption and public expenditure than it has by business investment.We have a serious current account deficit problem that is well known. It is running at seven per cent plus for the first time since 1951-52 and the government’s half-baked justifications about the ratio of debt servicing simply do not address the key structural problem, which is our abysmal recent exports performance. Exports as a percentage of GDP are falling sharply. Imports are soaring. And it is predicted that we will have a seven per cent growth in exports in the forthcoming year, off the back of a prediction this year of eight per cent when the outcome is going to be two per cent. There will be virtually no changes in volumes. The explanations in the budget papers for the appalling export performance in manufactured exports and services exports are thin. They talk of the Australian dollar appreciation, the maturing of some of Australia’s manufactured exports, more intense competition from China and other countries, and health and security concerns re international travel.When we look at the actual evidence though we see that there are a lot more serious concerns here. The Australian dollar appreciation only gathered pace in late 2003, early 2004. The trade weighted index only managed to get back up to the June 2000 level in early 2003, so in fact we had several years of very positive position with the Australian dollar. It was lower than it had been in 2000 for nearly three years. Australia was highly competitive during that period of global slowdown. Disaggregating the data for elaborately transformed manufactures, simply transformed manufactures and services shows big variations across specific categories which are not explained by the government’s excuses. There are big drops in exports of precious stones, basic non-ferrous metals, textiles and yarns, and the total drop in simply transformed manufactures over the four-year period from 2000-01 to 2003-04 was from $12.2 billion to $9.5 billion. There was a similar experience with elaborately transformed manufactures, big drops in non-metallic mineral manufactures, big drops in office and telecommunications equipment and in machinery and transport equipment. The total drop in elaborately transformed manufactures was from $20.5 billion in 2000-01 to $18.1 billion in 2003-04. Services exports have been pretty static over that period.It is significant that the Commonwealth Bank’s analysis of the budget states that in the past five instances of recovery from bad current account deficits the bulk of the recovery has come from higher export volumes. In a classic piece of understatement, the Commonwealth Bank says, ‘A rise in export volumes is elusive’ and, ‘Progress in sorting out the current account deficit problem will be slow.’ Contrast the budget papers where it is suggested that the problem is a saving problem. We have an exports problem and the government is doing very little about it. If we do face a very serious economic correction as a result of the giant structural imbalance in the global economy caused by the US current account deficit there could be a major problem for Australia, possibly even a serious recession. The prospect of that is gradually mounting, as the OECD has warned, and indeed even the budget papers acknowledge it. It is unclear what the implications would be for Australia but, because of our huge current account deficit, our very weak export performance, our big consumption and debt overhang and the huge increases in government spending, we are seriously exposed to some very negative consequences if that global realignment occurs.Now is the time for serious action on productivity and participation, not the cosmetic touches and ideological crusades that we have in this budget. As Saul Eslake correctly pointed out, the budget has ‘no comprehensive productivity growth agenda’. Productivity is now declining, which means real wage costs are increasing, even when wage growth is constant. Since 2002 we have fallen behind the OECD average on productivity after outperforming it from the early 1990s until 2002. Since 1998 our percentage level of productivity compared with the US has been declining. It hit 86 per cent; it is now back to 81 per cent, which raises a big question about how effective the Peter Reith industrial relations reforms have been in increasing productivity.Tackling exports and productivity decline is fundamental to grasping the emerging opportunities that Australia faces. To do this, we need a serious economic reform agenda. We should not waste the best opportunity Australia will ever have in the current benign circumstances, as the Howard government is doing. Instead of out-of-date ideological obsessions such as imposing individual contracts on low-paid workers, we need serious reinvigoration of competition reform and fiscal consolidation. Nothing is happening on these issues. That is why exports have stalled, that is why productivity is going backwards and that is why government spending is soaring.My challenge to the Howard government is to develop and implement a serious economic reform agenda to do the things it should have been doing over the past few years. It should broaden the income tax base and lower the rates by eliminating concessions and deductions, by tackling the effective marginal tax rates problems and by integrating the payment system and the taxation system. The government should slash wasteful government expenditure, in part to help it to finance serious tax reform on superannuation taxes. It should invest the fortuitous surpluses that it has been gaining and pay them into individual occupational super accounts rather than the absurd future fund. It should accelerate the roll-out of broadband, which is an absolute disgrace in Australia. We are way behind most of the developed world, and this is the economic foundation for the 21st century.The government should seek a total realignment of the federal and state divisions in health, education, aged care and various other responsibilities to eliminate the enormous duplication and waste that characterises those areas. The government should use drought assistance to ensure genuine reform of farming practices—where farms are located and which land is farmed. The government should institute sweeping genuine competition reforms in the areas that nobody talks about—telecommunications, so we have stricter regulation of Telstra and stricter separation of its functions; broadcasting, to accelerate the uptake of digital television and radio by sweeping deregulation; aviation, so we can have genuine competition for Qantas on the LA route. Qantas is happy to play the little Aussie battler when it seeks protection from competition but is all about exporting Australians jobs. Qantas wants a global labour market but protection from global competition. We need more competition for pharmacies, with the PBS growing to nine per cent per annum on real returns. We should invest seriously in R&D and develop a major participation strategy to ensure that we have genuine work force reform.
