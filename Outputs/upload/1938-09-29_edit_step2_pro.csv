Honorable members will remember that towards the end of the statement, I referred briefly to a communication from Mr. Chamberlain to Herr Hitler making further proposals. This note was sent on Tuesday, the 27th inst. It contained positive proposals designed to ensure to Germany the substance of its requirements in the way of the cession of Sudeten areas containing a substantial proportion of Germanspeaking peoples, and at the same time to avoid the immediate entry of German troops into those areas. I can assure honorable members that Mr. Chamberlains communication was a positive and most helpful contribution which may yet prove to contain themeans of peaceful solution of the crisis.In addition to this communication, Mr. Chamberlain yesterday addressed another message to Herr Hitler, the substance of which was as follows : -  I am ready to come to Berlin myself at once to discuss arrangements for the transfer with you and representatives of the Czech Government, together with representatives of France and Italy if you desire.I feel convinced we could reach agreement in a week. However much you distrust the Prague Governments intention, you cannot doubt the power of the British and French Governments to see that the promises are carried out fairly and fully and forthwith.As you know, I have stated publicly that we are prepared to undertake that they shall be so carried out.I cannot believe you will take the responsibility of starting a world war which may end civilization, for the sake of a few days delay in settling this longstanding problem.The Commonwealth Government decided yesterday afternoon to send a cablegram to Mr. Chamberlain suggesting that, even at this late hour, there might be some possibility of averting war by a personal appeal to Signor Mussolini. We intimated that we considered there was no other individual who might be able to influence Herr Hitler towards a peaceful solution. We suggested that if Mr. Bruce, the Australian High Commissioner in London,could be of any service by flying to Rome to bear a personal message from Mr. Chamberlain to Signor Mussolini, Mr. Bruce would bo available.Mr. Chamberlain replied thanking the Commonwealth Government for its suggestion, and saying that he was at the moment considering action of this nature.I may add that we called Mr. Chamberlain out of his bed in the early hours of the morning in order to discuss this matter with him and to express our view.His Majestys Ambassador in Rome was in consequence instructed to communicate the following message from Mr. Chamberlain to Signor Mussolini: -  I have to-day addressed a last appeal to Herr Hitler to abstain from force to settle the Sudeten problem which I feel sure can be settled by a short discussion and will give him the essential territory, population and protection for both the Sudetens and the Czechs during the transfer. I have offered myself to go at once to Berlin to discuss arrangements with the German and Czech representatives, and, if the Chancellor desires the representatives, also of Italy and France.I trust that Tour Excellency will inform the German Chancellor that you are willing to be represented and urge him to agree to my proposal which will keep all our peoples out of war. I have already guaranteed that the Czech promises shall be carried out and feel confident that full agreement could be reached in a week.Advice has now been received to the effect that Signor Mussolini has informed the German Government that he hoped that Herr Hitler would see his way to postpone action, which was to have been taken at 2 p.m. on the 28th September, for at least 24 hours.At the conclusion of his speech in the House of Commons yesterday, Mr. Chamberlain received and read to the House ;i message from Herr Hitler inviting him, together with M. Daladier and Signor Mussolini, to a conference in Munich to-day. Mr. Chamberlain indicated that lie would, of course, accept the invitation. I am sure that honorable members will agree that this invitation from Herr Hitler gives grounds .for hope that a way will be found out of the present difficult situation by negotiation and without recourse to force, and that all members of the House will be united in their appreciation of the notable services which Mr. Chamberlain has rendered in the cause of peace. la conclusion I should, like to assure honorable members that we have been in constant communication, both by cable and by telephone, over the whole course of the last fortnight, with Mr. Chamberlain and with Mr. Bruce. We have been kept in hourly touch with the situation and with the many communications that have passed between the Prime Minister of Great Britain and Herr Hitler, and the heads of other states concerned, in or affected by the crisis. We have made such suggestions as we believed would bo I iel pf nl, and which we believe have been helpful at various stages of the dispute.We feel that we can say to honorable members and to the people of Australia that there is distinct hope in the developments which have taken place in the last twelve hours, and we pray that the superhuman efforts of Mr. Chamberlain may bear fruit.I have just received a communication, through the Acting High Commissioner for the United Kingdom in Australia, from the Secretary of State for the Dominions indicating, as we also probably appreciate from the news in the press to-day,  that the position is greatly cased , and that the feeling in London is that the possibility of immediate emergency no longer holds.","Czechoslovakia","INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

76,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CASEY, Richard","JWE","Corio","UAP","Treasurer",338,".- I move-That the bill be now read a second time.The grants for which approval is sought in this bill are those recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission to be paid to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania during the financial year 1938-39. The recommendations of the commission are contained in its Fifth Report, which was tabled on the 21st September. The proposed grants, compared with those paid during 1937-38, are as follows: -N/ABefore explaining the basis of these recommendations, I submit for the infor- mation of honorable members a statement showing the trend of these grants during the past ten years, which I believe will be of some interest. The grants paid for 1934-35 and the following years are those based on the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The statement is as follows : -N/AWhen legislation for the grants which were paid to these States during earlier years was brought down, honorable members were informed at some length of the general principles upon which the recommendations of the commission were based. I do not propose, therefore, to enter into a full and lengthy discussion of the principles involved in connexion with this bill. These are set out very clearly and fully in the commissions fifth report, which I commend to the attention of honorable members.Whilst I do not propose toweary honorable members with a lengthy explanation of the commissions methods, I think it desirable briefly to refer to a few important features which affect, the recommendations of the grants for this year. Honorable members will remember that in the past the Commonwealths attitude generally has been that there exists some degree of obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to render financial assistance to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania by way of compensation for disabilities due to the effects of federation or the operation of federal policy. It has, however, been found impracticable to. measure the financial effects of these factors on the States. Moreover, it would be necessary to assess also the value of the advantages accruing from federation and federal policy. The commission, however, has given very careful consideration to this aspect, and in earlier reports has expressed the opinion that the necessity for grants to these States is in no case due to any appreciable extent to the operation of federal policy.","Second Reading","STATES GRANTS BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

78,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CASEY, Richard","JWE","N/A","N/A","N/A",339,"- No. That phase dealt with in the reports of the commission.As has been explained in earlier years, the commission has evolved a plan whereby the grants to the State are arrived at on the basis of financial needs. The commission recommends grants to bring the claimant States up to what it considers to be a fair Australian standard which the commission fixes in relation to the financial experience of the non-claimant States, namely, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. It considers that the grant should be sufficient to enable a State in difficulties to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States. The State is required to make some effort itself in this regard.Honorable members will appreciate that the adoption of a basis such as this, which requires a careful comparison of the budgetary results of the claimant States with those of the non-claimant States, presents considerable difficulty; but a perusal of the commissions fifth report will, I think, convincehonorable members that this comparison has been carried out carefully and equitably.The accounts of all States are not compiled on a uniform basis and it was necessary for the commission, as in previous years, to make certain adjustments of the figures in order to place the budgetary results on a comparable basis. Having arrived at the amount that is required to raise the claimant States to the budgetary standards -of the non-claimant States, the commission proceeds to make certain adjustments which it considers necessary, after a comparison of the relative severity of taxation in the various States, differences in the costs of social services, costs of administration, and other relevant factors.This year the commission has introduced a now feature into its work. It considers that in times of prosperity a claimant State should take action to improve its financial position which it cannot take in less prosperous years, and ihat it should not incur expenditure which is unjustified or uneconomic. It therefore examined the finances of the claimant States for the year 1936-37 in the light of the general improvement of economic and financial conditions. In the exercise of its general judgment, it has made a nominal adjustment in each case to draw the attention of the claimant States to their duty in this respect. Items particularly examined were in the case of South Australia, the failure to recover debts due to the Crown; and in that of Western Australia, the expenditure of loan moneys on unreproductive projects. As the financial position of the Tas.manian railways is growing steadily worse, and there was some evidence qf unnecessary expenditure, the commission made a nominal adjustment to draw attention to the urgent necessity for a reduction of railway losses in that State.I do not propose to comment upon these special adjustments. The commission was set up as an independent body to investigate the claims of the States for financial assistance, and there is ample evidence that it has discharged its duty with thoroughness and in a wholly impartial manner. The Government therefore feels that it must accept these special adjustments as a bona fide attempt on the part of the commission to ensure that grants of financial assistance to the States are based on sound principles.I shall now refer very briefly to the variations of the grants proposed for the current year. I remind honorable members that the basis adopted by the commission renders it necessary for grants to be assessed by an examination of the budgetary results of the latest year for which complete data is available. In this case the basic figures are those for the financial year 1936-37.The grant proposed for South Australia is £1,040,000 which is a reduction by £160,000 of the grant recommended and paid last year. This reduction is mainly accounted for by an improvement of that States finances in 1936-37, the year of comparison. In that year South Australia had a surplus of £139,000. Coupled with this fact, the relative burden of taxation in South Australia has decreased.The grant recommended for Western Australia is £570,000, or £5,000 less than last years grant, hut actually the normal grant now recommended is a substantial increase on the normal grant of £439,000 paid last year. There was added to the normal grant that year a special advance of £136,000 on account of drought, to be adjusted in 1939-40. This brought the total sum to £575,000. The normal grant recommended for this year is £614,000, from which is deducted a special advance of £44,000 made in 1936-37 to be repaid in this financial year. The normal grant recommended this year is therefore, in fact, £175,000 greater than the normal grant of last year.","Second Reading","STATES GRANTS BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

80,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CASEY, Richard","JWE","N/A","N/A","N/A",340,"- I take it that it did so, and that because of the effects of a drought on the State finances in 1936-37, an increase of £175,000 is now being recommended over the normal grant for last year. The State finances showed a deficit of £371,000 in 1936-37, as compared with a surplus of £S8,000 in 1935-36.The proposed grant to Ta.sma.nia is £410,000, which represents a reduction by £165,000 of the grant paid last year. The principal cause of this reduction is the reduced burden of taxation in Tasmania for 1936-37 in relation to the other States. The commissions report indicates that in 1935-36 and 1936-37 there was a considerable increase of Tasmanias community income, due to a great improvement in business activity generally. As a consequence the relative taxable capacity of the State increased very appreciably, and Tasmanias index of severity of taxation has fallen from 107 to 93, due mainly to increased taxable capacity, low rates of income tax, low motor taxation, and low local government imposts.Although the facts that I have just stated broadly explain the variations of the grants now proposed from those which were paid last year, the added fact that in the case of two States the grant is reduced to a degree which, perhaps, might not appear in accord with their present budgetary trend, calls for some further comment. As I have already said, the grants are arrived at by a comparison of the budgetary results of all States. Consequently, the grants should normally be reduced when the relative budgetary results of the claimant States improve and should be increased when the relative budgetary results of the claimant States show some retrogression. As the commissions calculations are based upon the financial results of the year 1936-37, there is what is now generally described as a.  time lag  of two years ; and, as the commission points out in one of its earlier reports, if conditions are changing rapidly in the States concerned, the grant recommended may prove to be out of harmony with the needs of the State for that particular year. The error, if any, is not cumulative, and the differences will balance out over a term of years.It might be argued in some quarters that the conditions which the States are facing this year do not justify any reduction of the grant. The grants recommended, however, are the automatic effect of the application of the commissions principles based on the results of 1936-37, and it would not be possible to depart from the procedure which has now been followed for four years without, to a large extent, nullifying the principles laid down by the commission and accepted by the Government.The Government has not hesitated to accept the recommendations of the commission during the last four years. In the first two years of that period the commission recommended an appreciable increase of the grants, notwithstanding that the finances of the States concerned were generally improving. Following the same policy, the Government now feels that it is quite reasonable to adopt the recommendations of the commission for reduced grants this year, even though in some quarters it may be felt that the present financial position of the States concerned does not appear to justify such a reduction.","Second Reading","STATES GRANTS BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A proper appreciation of the effect of the commissions recommendations can be obtained only by taking a long-range view. If the grants recommended by the commission over the last five years, including the grants now proposed, are examined in comparison with the State finances for the same period, I think it will be agreed that the grants are in accord with the general trend of State finances.The commissions recommendations are based upon known facts in relation to the actual financial results of the States. The most serious objection to this method is, of course, that the. effects of important, changes in State finances are not reflected in the grants until two years after. This objection, however, is far less serious than the objections that would necessarily follow any attempt to assess grants in any year on the basis of the estimated results for that year. As honorable members will agree, estimates are not always reliable. On the whole, it is much more preferable to base grants on actual results.","Second Reading","STATES GRANTS BILL 1938","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A few days ago that measure was discharged from the notice-paper. I now reintroduce it.The Supplementary Estimates which have just been tabled cover items of expenditure for the year ended the 30th June, 1937, for which no specific approval has yet been given by Parliament and which has been met temporarily out of the provision for Treasurers Advance ponding submission to Parliament in the form of the Estimates now before the House. As honorable members are aware, parliamentary authority for this expenditure was included in a lump sum appropriated in the Estimates-in-Chief for the year 1936-37 under the heading  Advance to the Treasurer . It has been the custom to make this provision so that the Treasurer may make advances to the various departments of such sums as are necessary to meet urgent and essential unforeseen expenditure. Particulars of such expenditure in the form of Supplementary Estimates are now submitted to Parliament for covering appropriation. As copies of the Estimates are being circulated amongst honorable members, I do not propose to refer to the items in detail at this stage. The amount voted for advance to the Treasurer for 1936-37 was £2,000,000; of that amount £988,583 was used for ordinary departmental services and war services payable from revenue, whilst £535,619 was used for additions, new works andbuildings, for which I shall submit shortly Supplementary Estimates. Parliament is now being asked to appropriate £988,583, but the total of the original Estimates has been exceeded by only £72,261. This is because, in many cases, these new charges being made contingent upon savings of a like amount in other items. In other votes straightout savings were possible. The result is that the net increase over the amount previously approved by Parliament is only £72,261 and not the amount of just under £1,000,000, which is the subject of this measure. Full details of the expenditure now submitted have already been furnished to Parliament in the Estimates and budget papers for 1937-38. In the 1937-38 Estimates, the expenditure for 1936-37 is set out alongside the amounts voted for 1937-38. The budget statements record the full expenditure. The details are also shown in the Treasurers financial statement for the year 1936-37.It is the practice to await the report of the Auditor-General on the accounts for the year under review before submitting the Supplementary Estimates to Parliament. The Treasurers financial statement was forwarded to the Auditor-General on the 23rd November, 1937, and his report was presented to the Treasurer on the 6th April, 1938, and was laid on the table of this House on the 27th April of this year.I commend to the House the Supplementary Estimates for ordinary services.Debate (on motion by Mr. Curtin) adjourned.","Second Reading","SUPPLEMENTARY APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 2) 1936-37","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

105,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CASEY, Richard","JWE","Corio","UAP","Treasurer",344,".- I move-That the bill be now read a second time.I think that I need not tell the House that the explanation I made in respect of the last bill is relevant to this bill.This bill provides for an appropriation of £535,619 for items of expenditure under Additions, New Works, Buildings, &c.,which have been met from the vote  Advance to the Treasurer  during the year 1936-37.When the Supplementary Estimates for ordinary services were presented, I informed honorable members of the reason for and the procedure adopted in connexion with bills of this nature.Although the amount provided for by the bill is £535,619, that sum does not represent the net amount expended on works and buildings in excess of the original Estimates. Actually, the provision in the original Estimates was exceeded by only £146,222, increased expenditure under post office and railways being offset by savings under other services.The chief items making up the total are as follows : -N/AOf the sum of £494,910 for telephone services, £300,000 was represented by a transfer of expenditure from the Loan Fund in the following circumstances : In consequence of the difficulty of raising loan moneys for the services of all Australian Governments - had . there been any honorable Premiers of the States present now I am sure that they would be glad to hear the remarks which I am about to make - and acting on the principle which has been followed for a number of years of leaving the loan field as free as possible for the States, the Commonwealth Government decided to charge more of the necessary expenditure to revenue. The transferred expenditure was covered by the vote for Treasurers Advance until parliamentary appropriation could be obtained. The amount of £300,000, out of the total supplementary appropriation of £535,619, has been counterbalanced by a saving of a similar amount under the loan appropriation. The loan market has been relieved to this extent, the States have been similarly advantaged, and a consequential saving of interest will result. An additional £194,910 was required to meet the demand by the public for increased telephone facilities.The necessity for the extra provision of £22,023 for the Trans-Australian railway was due to the speeding up of the ballasting of the line; the additional expenditure in 1936-37 is being offset by reduced expenditure in subsequent years.Debate (on motion by Mr. Curtin) adjourned.","Second Reading","SUPPLEMENTARY APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL (No. 2) 1936-37","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

108,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GREEN, Albert","KF9","Kalgoorlie","N/A","N/A",345,".- Honorable members are aware, in con sequence of telegrams received from Wau, that a protest has been raised with regard to the site of the new capital of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, and also the road proposed to be constructed from Salamaua to Wau.Four parties are engaged in surveying the route, and, no doubt, the Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Hughes) will furnish the House with details of the work being undertaken. The first suggestion, whichwas most in favour up to the middle of the present month, was the Buangs-Snake River route, which is usuallytraversed by the aeroplane running between Salamaua and Wau, by way ofBulwa on the Bulolo River. For 25 miles the last part of the road is already constructed along the banks of the Bulolo River, from Bulolo to Wau, and the total length of this route is 75 miles. Recently, however, Mr. M. W. Bergin, one of the surveyors working in the Bitoi-Francisco district, discovered a route almost direct to Wau. It is called the Middle Bitoi route, and the distance from Salamaua to Wau by it is said to be about 50 miles, of which 44 miles would have to be constructed. The surveyors say that a road from Wau by way of Bulwa - the Buangs-SnakeRiver route - would cost £164,000, although for 25 miles a road has already been constructed, as I have already shown, from Bulwa to Wau, but a road by the Middle Bitoi route would cost £150,000, which is £14,000 less, andwould reduce the distance by 25 miles. Therewould be 12 miles of river fiats, representingeasy formation, and about 14 miles of easily constructed grades, varying from 1 in 10 to 1 in18. For 10 miles there would be steep side-slopes, with grades of 1 in 15 or 1 in 25, and 8 miles of definitely difficult country. This road would come out at the mouth of Sandy Creek, not far from Wau, and would not rise higher than 5,000 feet. Although these grades may seem steep to some, I remind honorable members that for a considerable distance on the road to Edie Creek the grade is 1 in 9, and the motor trucks negotiate it comparatively easily from Wau to No. 1 Kunai, where, in 4 miles, the road rises 1,800 feet.The third suggestion relates to the Markham Valley route, and there is a good deal of objection to it, particularly by the peoplewhom it is intended to serve. This runs from Salamaua towards Lae, and then along the Markham Valley, in the vicinity of Wampit Valley, viaBulwa, to Wau. The argument in its favour is that it would be a developmental road, and, no doubt, it would open up country suitable for the production of copra. The objection to it is that it immensely lengthens the road from Salamaua to Wau from a possible 50 miles, as in the Middle Bitoi route, to 113 miles from Salamaua,whichwill be the port of the territory, no matter where the capital is situated. My strong objection to this is that the cost of freight to Wauwould be loaded for all time by an unnecessary 125 per cent. Vehicles using the Bitoi routewould go directly to Wau, a distance of 50 miles - say 2½ hours travelling - thence to Bulolo,Bulwa and Sunshine - 3½ hours. Using the Buangs route they would get to Bulwa and Sunshine in 2½ hours and Wau in 3½ hours. There would be much more freight for Wau and Edie Creek than for Bulolo, Bulwa and Sunshine, and the Bitoi route would give it a shorter track. The people mostly concerned in Wau have the best interests of the mining industry at heart. They are also anxious about the development of the timber industry, which promises to grow to considerable dimensions in the near future, the possibilities being almost unlimited. They are strongly and unitedly of the opinion that the road should go direct from Salamaua to Wau. If it is necessary to open up the territory by a road along the Markham Valley, that could be done later by a road from Bulwa.These residents are anxious also that Wau should be the capital of New Guinea. Several sites have been suggested. The honorable member for Parkes (Sir Charles Marr) advanced the claims of Madang, but I understand that the people at Madang are not anxious to have the capital there. The residents of Lae wish it to be established there and a good deal can be said in its favour. Generally speaking, allowing for the claims of Salamaua and Lae, Wau would appear to be far the most suitable site. It is free from earth tremors. Some may be of the opinion that it is very difficult of access, but that is the reason why provision was made for the construction of a road, the cost of which was guaranteedby the Commonwealth Government in a bill which was passed by Parliament last year. Wau is some distance from the coast and that is one reason why the site on which Canberra is built was selected. Generally speaking, the climate in New Guinea is particularly trying on the coast and as the principal industry is the production of copra, which is carried on largely on the sea coast, those engaged in the industry have to submit to more trying conditions than those living on the high lands. The temperature on the sea coast is more severe, and in some places malaria and blackwater fever are fairly prevalent. Moreover, children do not always thrive there after they have reached a certain age. Wau is about 3,500 feet above the sea level and the climate there is similar to that in Simla in India. In that country the official work is not undertaken to any degree in Calcutta, Madras and similar cities, and the principal Government offices are situated on the high lands. Moreover, Wau has all the amenities of civilization, including good hotels, swimming baths and a telephone service, a large European hospital, a native hospital and schools. The climate there is such that at night the use of blankets is often necessary. Although extensive mining development is being carried on, it is only reasonable to assume that the industry will not flourish indefinitely, but doubtless the mining industry will be the means of establishing a permanent settlement as it has in some parts of Australia. The timber industry ought to be a permanent and important one if reafforestation is possible. I trust that the request submitted by the people of Wau will be seriously considered by the Minister, and that the direct route will be adopted and the road constructed at the earliest possible date. I suggest that members interested should glance at the map of New Guinea to follow the route of the road I have indicated.","New Guinea: Site of Capital: Salamaua-Wau Road","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
