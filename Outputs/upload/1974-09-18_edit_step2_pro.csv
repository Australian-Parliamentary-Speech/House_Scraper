3,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SNEDDEN, Billy","DQF","Bruce","N/A","Leader of the Opposition",1447,"- I move:That the Government be censured for its avoidance of the processes of debate in the House of Representatives when the country is alarmed about unemployment, industrial strikes, vacuum in leadership and properly expects that these issues be debated.The Government ought to be censured. The censure motion ought to be supported and will be supported by everybody on this side of the House. If there were any members on the other side of the House who had the slightest commitment to the parliamentary system, they also would censure the Government. Notice of my motion was given on Friday, 23 August. For reasons as yet unexplained- it was said that it was a brilliant stroke of strategy on the part of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in Cabinet when all about him were saying that he could not have his way on economic matters, he decided that he would like to try to have his way on some sort of minor piece of strategy. So he decided that he would call the Parliament together for one day. That one day sitting was for the purpose only of passing the Trade Practices Bill and the Roads Grants BUI. In the middle of the highest number of strikes on record since the Depression, in the middle of the highest inflation rate we have known for over 2 decades, in a vacuum of leadership and with the whole of the Australian people confused and uncertain and not knowing where we are going, the Prime Ministers contribution to that days debate was 11 words. Those 1 1 words were: Mr Speaker, I ask that questions today be placed on notice. That was the contribution he made. I would be quite surprised if he said anything more in the Caucus orCabinet meetings in the building up of this Budget that was brought down last night. In fact, he clearly abdicated from any sense of leadership in the economic affairs of the country. The poor Treasurer (Mr Crean) has been completely steamrollered. Only one man, Dr Cairns, with the support of his Caucus mates, bears the responsibility.The normal procedure is for a censure motion to be debated immediately. That is what we expected. It is now quite clear that the Government was prepared to accept this notice of motion as a censure motion in the terms of the standing order, as the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) has said. Can anybody possibly reconcile the attitude of the Leader of the House today when he says that he accepts the censure motion in the terms of the standing order when on 23 August, when notice of the motion was given, the Leader of the House refused to accept it and refused to allow it to be debated? Because he refused to allow it to be debated I moved:That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the immediate debate of the notice of motion given by the Leader of the Opposition on 23 August.Every member of the Government voted against that motion We wanted to bring the matter on for debate there and then. Every member of the Government voted against the proposal. Now they come along today and say: Let us have the debate. Earlier on that day, 23 August, the Prime Minister had, as I said, abandoned question time. It was a very unhealthy precedent for the Parliament to be assembled and the Government to protect itself by abandoning question time. He knew the significance of it; he knew it very well. I think he felt ashamed, as he ought to have, depriving the Opposition of question time.","Motion of Censure","WHITLAM GOVERNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is just a question of judgment. The Prime Minister certainly ought to feel shame The only issue is whether he feels it. Any other man would be ashamed of himself. The abandonment of question time on that day was an act of self protection so that the Prime Minister could avoid answering questions. It was an avoidance of responsibility. Also he wanted to protect some of his Ministers from answering questions. It was an abdication of accountability of the Government to the Parliament.That same morning I raised a matter of public importance in accordance with the StandingOrders. I did it in a perfectly proper way. I wrote a letter to you, Mr Speaker, as is the appropriate method, and said that a matter of great public importance had arisen. Under the Standing Orders it should have been debated for 2 hours. The matter was:The alarming decline of confidence in the community arising out of the Governments inability to handle the deteriorating economic situation which has been created by its own policies, and contributed to by the conflicting statements of Ministers, the Prime Ministers abdication of leadership and the rapidly worsening employment situation.The Leader of the House moved in and proposed the motion that the business of the day be called on to stifle debate on the very issue which I had raised. First we had a matter of public importance and that was stifled. Then we had the notice of a motion of censure and a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders to enable the motion to be brought on and that was stifled. The aim was to stifle debate. This was the day on which the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) was having his row with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. On that day the Australian Federation of Air Pilots said that it would not carry a Labor Minister by aeroplane in Australia and it certainly would not carry any Ministers out of Canberra. The Leader of the House then came over to our side and said: Look, if you fellows want to talk, if you want to have the temerity to use the Parliament as a debating mechanism, if you want to talk about national issues, do you not realise that you will keep everybody here in Canberra forever? We said that we would not be intimidated and that we would carry on with the debate. We then had the debacle where you, Mr Speaker, were not in control of the House though you said yesterday you were in control.","Motion of Censure","WHITLAM GOVERNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

26,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SNEDDEN, Billy","DQF","N/A","N/A","N/A",1448,"-On that day, 23 August, every time we tried to debate the issue the Government stifled our efforts. It used its numbers because it wanted to protect itself. The Government knew that it was in danger. It knew that the people of Australia felt angry, as has been shown by any poll one wants to look at which has been conducted since. The people of Australia are very angry. The Prime Minister stifled debate on our side of the House and stifled debate on his own side of the House. Quite clearly the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) wanted to get up on 23 August and complain about the state of affairs in Tasmania. He had every right to get up and complain about the state of affairs in Tasmania. The honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Duthie) wanted to get up and complain about the state of affairs in Tasmania where there was unemployment. The whole State is going down and transport to and from the State is in very serious difficulties. The freight rate has risen.Of course, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Davies) wanted to do that too. He, poor chap, at question time yesterday when the Minister for Transport was talking in the most deprecating terms about Tasmanians and Tasmanian affairs and declaring the Labor Government of Tasmania to be ineffective and avaricious in putting up its rates, was not in the House because he was worried about the problem and was on the telephone talking about it. Why was he not given a chance on 23 August to explain how concerned he is for the interests of Tasmanians. Surely the Minister for Northern Development (Dr Patterson) wanted on 23 August to have the opportunity to say that the only primary in dusty in good shape at present is the sugar industry, provided growers can cut the cane and get it to market. Surely he wanted to explain that to the House. I am perfectly certain that the Minister for Overseas Trade wanted on 23 August to tell the Australian people whether he did mean that we would have a relaxation of the credit squeeze or whether we would not. He received favourable headlines by saying that the credit squeeze was going to be relaxed. Then he received favourable headlines for saying that the credit squeeze would not be relaxed. Surely he wanted to tell the Parliament on that occasion what he felt about the relaxation of the credit squeeze. I am sure that the honourable gentleman wanted to explain to the Parliament why he thought unemployment was an option available to the Government to tackle inflation- for he said that. Earlier he had said that unemployment was not an option for the Government; then he said it was. When we heard the Budget last night it became perfectly obvious that the Government has chosen unemployment as an option. But unemployment is not even an option to get rid of inflation, because what we are now going to get is inflation and unemployment. We wanted to talk about these matters on 23 August while there was still a chance to influence the formulation of the Budget. That is why we wanted the debate then. But that was what the Government was determined we should not have.What I wanted to draw attention to was the growing rate of unemployment. The Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) had announced that he felt that unemployment was going to grow to massive proportions. Of course, it is true that it now has. In fact, on seasonally adjusted figures, the number of unemployed is now 134,000- the highest it ever reached in the period when I was Treasurer of the McMahon Government, in 1972, and the present Minister for Labor and Immigration was saying: Beware! Unemployment will reach a quarter of a million.  The Minister for Labor and Immigration, as he now is, and the present Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition as he then was, were saying: We will get an unemployment figure of a quarter of a million. The highest rate of unemployment that occurred at that time in actual terms was about 128,000. In seasonally adjusted terms the highest level of unemployment was 1 17,000 in August 1972. Today, on the same basis, and not taking the figures that have been changed which show an unemployment figure of 1 10,000, we find that the actual unemployment figure is 134,000.Last night, using the latest technological advances in the electronic field, I in Canberra participated in a television program together with Mr Hawke who was in Melbourne. Mr Hawke acknowledged the truth of the fact that seasonally adjusted figures for unemployment today reveal an unemployment level of 134,000 as compared with the highest level of unemployment when we were in office, which was 1 1 7,000. The level of unemployment under this Government has already exceeded the highest level under the former Government, and done so handsomely. Last night, Mr Hawke said: Unemployment will get worse before Christmas. Mr Hawke went on to make this interesting remark: Not only will unemployment get worse, but if unemployment gets to 3 per cent the trade union movement will require the Government to present a supplementary budget. That supplementary budget will require the Government to increase Government spending even more and will require the Government to relax the credit squeeze, put more money into the community and reduce interest rates.What I want to know is this: If that is what the trade union movement is going to do when unemployment reaches 3 per cent of the work force, why does it not require that to be done now? On the admission of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Labor and Immigration and the Minister for Overseas Trade know- in fact, any member of the Labor Party or the Labor Government who knows B from a bulls foot knows- that unemployment in Australia will increase. They know that. Why is not action taken now? Why is there an acknowledgement by the President of the Australian Labor Party, the same man being President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, that this Budget will not reduce the level of unemployment; this Budget will increase unemployment; and this Budget will create greater inflation- inflation of at least 20 per cent? Why do the Australian people have to go through this state of affairs just for the sake of political dogma on the part of the Government? Why do the people of Australia have to go through it? When this motion was moved on 23 August all the history of this Parliament would have required the Government to bring the matter on for debate then. Instead of that, the Government let it go and did not even bring it on at the first opportunity.Mr Speaker,you have just warned me. If you intend to throw me out for this I will have to take it, but the fact is that you moved immediately against the honourable member for Mackellar when this House reassembled. The Government left it until today- a day after the House reassembled to bring on my censure motion. Why did the Government do it? Because it wanted this spurious Budget, this Budget like a wolf in sheeps clothing, to be brought down first. Then today the Government wanted to avoid any questions. Is the Prime Minister prepared to give me an undertaking now -","Motion of Censure","WHITLAM GOVERNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Will the Prime Minister give me an undertaking now that we will have question time at the end of this debate? There is a matter of public importance to be raised by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Malcolm Fraser). It appears on todays program and it reads as follows:The failure of the Government, in formulating the terms of reference for the royal commission into alleged indemnity payments involving maritime unions, to include-1 ) Charges that the Minister for Transport had approved the indemnity payments 12 months ago.The silence of the Minister for Labor and Immigration and the Minister for Transport from 26 July to early September when publicity was given to indemnity payments.They were silent even though it was happening -The failure of both Ministers to take appropriate action under the law.The indemnity payments admitted to have been made to the Waterside Workers Federation.I ask the Prime Minister by interjection- I am sure you will forgive him, Mr Speaker- whether he will give me an undertaking that that matter of public importance will come on to be debated today. There is not an answer.The reason this censure motion has been brought on now is that the Government wants to use it to avoid question time and this matter of public importance. That is the reason for it. Mr Speaker, the plain fact of the matter is that everybody in Parliament, Jerry on the front door- I am so glad to welcome him back and to see him in good health- every attendant in this House, every person around this place, every honourable member, every senator, the Clerks and Hansard know that there was no possibility of having yesterdays program made clear to us yesterday. Then this morning we were told that there was to be a certain program. It was like an episode of Blue Hills in the party room this morning with messages coming back such as: Daly is in Caucus. He cannot get out. He thinks this is on. He thinks that is off. He thinks this is on.  It was supposed to be a threat against the Opposition, saying: Unless you behave we will bring on your censure motion. What an extraordinary thing to do. The Opposition wanted it to be brought on. It wants to expose the Government for what it is and that is that honourable members opposite could not raffle a duck in your electorate, Mr Speaker.We were supposed to debate the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Bill today. Now the Government does not know what it is going to do with that Bill. It is in so much mess that it cannot debate it today. We were going to debate the Australia Council Bill. The Opposition prepared for it. It is ready to go ahead with the Australia Council Bill. But information has been given to the Opposition by persons close to the power centre such as the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young). He is close to the power centre. He is next to the red light. The anger, the fury, the pretended looking! He said that the Australia Council Bill will not come on for some time into the future. We are ready to go on with it. Why are we not going to debate it? It is very important. It is important to the people who have been here this week talking to me and my colleagues about it. But the Australia Council Bill has just drifted off. Why? I want to know. We are very anxious that a lot of things should be done in the arts field. There is a tremendous number of people who thought that the Labor Party had the answers on arts and who are now totally disillusioned. And expressions of the sort that it is reported the Prime Minister used in the Caucus yesterday in relation to artists are quite surprising for people who thought that they could trust his interest in their welfare.Wheat stabilisation has gone. We could not know what was going to happen. What we wanted to do on 23 August was to debate the economic issues. Strikes: The figures we had at that stage were 4 million man days lost for the first 5 months of the year- the greatest loss of man days since the Depression.","Motion of Censure","WHITLAM GOVERNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He was then asked what price rises there are going to be. There is a 20 per cent inbuilt Budget inflation? The average weekly wage earner is going to get a 22Vi per cent wage rise and he is going to have 20 per cent price inflation, which leaves him a narrow band of 2Vi per cent. Out of that 2Vi per cent he is going to have to pay State tax increases and his own income tax increase, which is to go up by 46 per cent- 46 per cent extra tax.

These are the things we are going to talk about today. These are the things we are going to talk about in the debate on the Budget when it comes up. We have got these positions which are quite clear. We want to debate the economy; we want to disclose what a sham the Governments policy is; we want to disclose that the Budget is an inflation Budget; we want to expose that the Budget is an unemployment Budget. It will increase inflation, it will increase unemployment. We want it to be known that the leader of the trade union movement, the President of the Australian Labor Party, has said that if unemployment gets to 3 per cent he will require of the Government that it bring down a supplementary Budget. If the Government had been sensible enough to listen to our debate on 23 August it would still have had time to save itself from the Budget it has brought in. That is what we wanted to do on 23 August. To protect itself the Government said: We will not have the debate. We will not let you talk about it. Today, to serve its own interests, the Government has permitted debate on this censure motion to proceed. Presumably one can only take silence from the Prime Minister as meaning yes or no and he did not even nod his head when I asked him whether we would have question time this morning. I did not hear any noise from him at all. I did not hear any noise even when he shook his head. I repeat: Is there to be a question time today? Why is the Prime Minister protecting his Ministers from answering questions?Yesterday the Minister for Transport, Charlie Jones, gave the State Labor Government of Tasmania to use some terminology- a nice old serve. Yesterday the Minister for Defence was sitting in this House feeling desperate.

He looks quite different today but he could not have enjoyed the proceedings yesterday.Is the Prime Minister protecting his Ministers? Has he decided not to have question time in order to protect the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) from answering questions ? He is the man who will be Acting Prime Minister  of this country for 10 or 1 1 days. Is this to enable him to be protected from answering the question that was posed yesterday by my friend and colleague, the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes) the shadow Minister for Defence, who spoke about the inability of the armed forces to sail ships, put aircraft in the air or to have the tanks moving because of a fuel shortage? My colleague said yesterday that this was a disgraceful situation. The Minister for Minerals and Energy, who is to be the Acting Prime Minister of this country, said they were not going to have fuel because the Government did not want to have any industrial disturbances. The Minister said he does not want any industrial disturbances but he has industrial disturbances at a higher level than they have ever been since the Depression.","Motion of Censure","WHITLAM GOVERNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

35,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WHITLAM, Gough","6U4","Werriwa","ALP","Prime Minister",1452,"- Mr Speaker,the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) was as empty as the motion. The motion was seconded by the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony) who had his wits so much about him that you, Mr Speaker, had to call twice to ask if the motion was seconded. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition had to be taunted on 23 August to put his motion at all. He had nothing to say then and in the intervening weeks he still has not collected anything to say. The motion was tough and it was offensive. One thought the Leader of the Opposition was rearing to have a go at the Government but he has just filled in half an hour, wasting the time of the Parliament and the people. He had nothing to say on 23 August and he has had nothing to say today.When a censure motion is moved it is usually moved at the outset of the days proceedings. In those circumstances, 2 things can happen: Either the Government accepts the censure motion forthwith and suspends all other business till it is disposed of or it forthwith adjourns the House till the following day when it deals with the motion in priority to all other business. The Leader of the Opposition did not give his censure motion at the outset of the sitting day on 23 August. He did it later that day after wasting a couple of hours. Surely it was not expected that yesterday morning, with the condolence motions and the Budget coming on, we should suspend the days proceedings. We have taken this censure motion in the ordinary way- at the first available sitting. The Leader of the Opposition, of course, did not realise he had left his motion on the notice paper. He could have taken it off yesterday or he could have taken it off before yesterday. He did not realise until the blue paper was circulated an hour before we sat that he had still left this footling motion on the notice paper. In an hour the Leader of the Opposition could not make up for all the lost days since 23 August when he put this motion on the notice paper. He had nothing to say then, he has nothing to say today. The only memorable thing I suppose is that he was trailing his coat, gyrating in his seat and taunting you, Mr Speaker, in his usual manner. He was trying to become a martyr by being offensive to the Chair. He is a man without matter; a man without manner.The normal procedure with a censure motion is for the man who seconds it to follow the mover immediately. The Leader of the Country Party did not follow immediately. He apparently had to be reminded that he was the seconder. Accordingly I have the opportunity to follow immediately and then to get on with the business of the Parliament- of the Government elected to rule the country- in the terms of the notice paper and the blue program sheet which has been circulated. There is enough business on the notice paper and on the blue sheet to keep us fruitfully engaged for the rest of the day, the rest of the week and the rest of the year.What an extraordinary motion is this motion which the right honourable gentleman was taunted to put in writing on 23 August. What an exquisite sense of timing he showed when he moved it. Honourable members will recall the circumstances. This House had been recalled for a special sitting to deal solely and specifically with 2 Bills of tremendous importance- Bills which had been victims of Senate obstruction. They were the Trade Practices Bill and the National Roads Bill. The Trade Practices Bill contained crucial and highly necessary improvements to legislation which the Leader of the Opposition himself introduced as Attorney-General 7 years before. The Bill could have been passed and been in operation a year ago. It was necessary to set the legislation in operation as soon as possible. It now is in operation. The National Roads Bill is a redemption of promises to take the first steps towards a national highways program. These were promises I made before the election in December 1972. This Bill was to replace legislation which expired at the end of June this year. It was legislation which would have been enacted but for the double dissolution and it was necessary to deal with it promptly to justify the continued granting of moneys to the States which had been receiving those grants in anticipation of the legislation passing. The Government acted promptly at the earliest point to deal with the amendments which the Senate had made to these 2 vital pieces of legislation. Because of Senate obstruction we had to recall this House for that special purpose that day.The Leader of the Opposition on that occasion said that he wanted to discuss the economy. He has repeated that same phrase today. He did not deal with the economy in general. He did not deal even with the specific terms of his censure motion moved on 23 August. Are they no longer relevant or are they still relevant? If they are no longer relevant he should have acknowledged that fact. If they are relevant he should have gone in and blasted us. The special sitting took place in the very week that Cabinet was meeting to frame the Budget. The Budget was delayed for a month by the election forced by the Opposition, caused by the unprecedented refusal of Supply by the Senate. The Budget was delayed because of an election which the Opposition lost and in which the people of Australia once again confirmed their support for this Governments program. Had it not been for that election the debate on the economy which the Leader of the Opposition wanted last month on 23 August would already have been in full swing. The Budget would have been introduced 10 days previously. We would have been having a debate on the economy and on the Budget in the proper place, in the proper manner and at the usual time. We would even have had by that time- 3 days before he moved this censure- the benefit of his own speech on the Budget. This is a speech for which we are now all waiting with bated breath but we have to wait 6 more days and 6 more nights. By allowing this motion to proceed today we thought we would do the Leader of the Opposition a favour by giving him a trial run for next Tuesday night. We have heard it and he has had it. The Parliament and the nation have had the opportunity to know how empty he is, how vapid are his views and how phoney is the policy of the man who did not lose the last election.I assume that by moving this motion last month the Leader of the Opposition wanted the Government, then in the middle of its prejudge discussions, to have the benefit of his views. Can anyone doubt after hearing him today that we would have been wasting our time? Of course, a number of other interesting things were happening that week in August. It was, for instance, the very week that the Mainline Corporation crashed. The Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Country Party in their speeches on the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders to debate this motion on 23 August warned us about the terrors of the terrible things that our socialist policies were supposed to be doing to the economy. I suppose Mainline is an example. Last Sunday night the Managing Director of Mainline, Mr Baker, blamed his failures on socialistic policies- that in some way our attitude to free enterprise was responsible for Mainline s collapse.In the same breath this spokesman for free enterprise blames the Government for not giving Mainline $3 5m of the taxpayers money to prop up this company in which the principal shareholders are die largest life assurance societies in Australia and the nominees of the largest banks in Australia. The top business people in Australia make a mess of this vast company and they now suggest that they need $35m of the taxpayers money to prop them up. That is sturdy free enterprise for you. I remember the remark of the Minister for Education (Mr Beazley) that the policy of the Country Party is to capitalise the gains and socialise the losses. Now we have an extension of that philosophy- the Government should bail out a company destroyed by its own mismanagement or misjudgment, its cupidity or stupidity.I mention the Mainline affair because there is no doubt that its collapse contributed in a thoroughly damaging way to an atmosphere of panic and confusion which was being deliberately created in the first weeks of August by the Leader of the Opposition, by some sections of the Press and by rumour mongering in business circles. Certainly throughout the Mainline affair the Australian Government -","Motion of Censure","WHITLAM GOVERNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Australian Government was interested in keeping the construction activities of Mainline going, both because of our position as a customer and because of our concern for the economy, the workmen and sub-contractors involved, but we cannot accept the attitude that when gambles of the sort that Mainline embarked upon fail to come off the Government suddenly acquires obligations to save entrepreneurs from the consequences of their own folly. I assume that the great free enterprise Party opposite endorses that attitude.Three days after the Leader of the Opposition gave notice of this motion I made a national broadcast, not because of his motion or anything he or anybody else had said but because of the delay in bringing down the Budget. I said: . . . the Budget, like our whole program, is based on certain principles. There are 4 very important ones . . . we are not going to resort to mass unemployment. Secondly, we will protect the weaker sections of the community . . . Thirdly, the most help will be given to those most in need. Fourthly, where we seek restraint we shall seek it from the strongest, from those best able to share the load.The Budget brought in last night by the Treasurer (Mr Crean) adheres firmly to these principles. In broad and in detail, it implements them. I also said in my broadcast: ... the Budget is not intended to be some grand design for solving all the nations problems. It is not in itself a blueprint for the future. It is only part of our ongoing program and it is only part of our ongoing light against inflation.The Leader of the Opposition is constantly resorting to cliches. This is the only speech- I must give him credit- in which he has not used the phrase an economic package. He is the only person in the world who claims to have the complete answer to contemporary and universal economic problems. I really wish he would not be so coy in revealing them.","Motion of Censure","WHITLAM GOVERNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In his top of the head statement last night the Leader of the Opposition claimed that the Budget would not prevent unemployment. That is manifestly untrue. It will stimulate employment opportunities; it will reverse the unemployment trend. Further, for employees we have reduced taxation on all but the very highest incomes. We have ensured that there is incentive for personal exertion. Above all for employees we have ensured a rise in their real standard of living as members of the Australian community, as members of families, as parents, as city dwellers, as public transport users and as road users.","Motion of Censure","WHITLAM GOVERNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He is a man who takes 3 days to go 60 kilometres in an Avis car to his own property from the nearest aerodrome. Quality and equality of services are now provided or denied by the community. Individuals- even the wealthiest- can no longer provide them. For business we have laid the foundation for renewed business confidence; confidence that the economy will continue to grow. For the States we have provided massive increases in grants of all kinds. They will receive the largest increase in both direct and special purpose grants ever. They will receive 36 per cent of the total outlays in this Budget. The Budget provides for a 32.4 per cent increase in total expenditure, and 39.5 per cent of that increase will be in payments to the States. Therefore, in these 3 fundamental respects the Budget provides the soundest possible and the strongest possible foundation for real restraint, for real responsibility, for real co-operation, for real confidence.Let me elaborate in these 3 great areas employee confidence, business confidence and community confidence. I take it that the State governments still belong to the Australian community. It is easy enough to identify the need for wage restraint if we are to combat inflation effectively. Draconian measures, conventional measures, the Liberal measures of Fadden, Holt and Snedden, measures to create massive unemployment, might, of course, achieve some retarding of the rate of inflation. Too many of those who advocate such a course really want to break the back of the trade union movement. This Government will not have a bar of such a course. It is absurd to place the whole blame for the present inflation on employees. Price increases cause wage increases just as much as wage increases cause price increases. The Government is acting on both prices and wages simultaneously. In order to break the wage-price spiral it is very much in the interests of employees to cooperate with us in this attempt. Inflation threatens jobs, particularly in industries which compete with imports. It also threatens jobs in industries which are so uncertain about future costs that they are reluctant to invest. Inflation destroys the value of employees savings. It undermines the quality and availability of community services which are the very foundation of a better, more equal society. Inflation causes uncertainty and even fear from which few members of the community can be exempt, least of all employees and their families. So there is every reason for co-operation from employees and their organisations and associations.We have provided in this Budget a good basis for that co-operation. The Treasurer acknowledged last night that there has been considerable uncertainty on the part of business about the future, but there is growing evidence that business has in fact over-reacted. In order to combat demand inflation which we inherited, the Government introduced over a period of time a series of flexible measures to remove excess demand pressures. As the Treasurer said last night, we have largely succeeded in removing those pressures. If we had not taken the steps which we did- every step opposed or criticised by the Opposition- inflation would be much worse than it now is. Partly because of over-reaction there are signs of slack entering into the private sector. The tax cuts and new expenditures in the Budget are designed to take up that slack. The Budget ensures that increased unemployment already in the economic pipeline will be quickly contained and reversed.From the day we were elected the Government has acted consistently to improve real living standards. Some of our measures, such as support for a substantial increase in the minimum wage, have already improved those standards outside the context of the Budget. The Budget itself reinforces these policies. Substantial pension increases are proof enough of how much the real standard of living of pensioners has improved under a Labor Government. When we took over the pension was worth 20 per cent of average weekly male earnings. It is now worth 24.5 per cent. The home mortgage interest tax deductibility scheme which now comes into operation is graduated to benefit lower income groups. Further measures were announced in the Budget. The income tax schedules will be altered to reduce taxation on lower and middle income groups, with the largest benefit for incomes of $6,000 a year. The Treasurer also announced substantial concessions for low income and single income families. We have given substantial benefit to breadwinners, whilst withholding the concessions from others who happen to be in the lowest income tax scale, that is, the second or third income earners. Furthermore, in this Budget we have abolished broadcasting and television licence fees- a poll tax and even more regressive than indirect taxes. The redistributive effect of the Budget is reinforced by the nature of expenditure.Beyond the substantial improvements to welfare services many areas of expenditure are specifically geared to maximise benefits for low income earners. Our major innovations are based on the principle of need. The most is given to areas where people need it most. This is the principle for the allocation of funds for schools under the Schools Commission program, for child care, for local government under the Grants Commission, for community health centres and hospitals, for welfare housing, for area improvement programs, for the Australian assistance plan and for Aboriginal advancement. A major objective of the Budget is to indicate clearly to the people of Australia that when the Government calls for restraint it expects the first and main burden of restraint to be accepted by those best able to bear it.","Motion of Censure","WHITLAM GOVERNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

All that the Leader of the Opposition is left with is pious cries about leadership. He is a great adherent of the Fuhrerprinzip. He is always calling for a national conference. A national conference would be fine if it were a realistic means towards national co-operation.What we have done in the Budget is something far more meaningful than a mere national conference, whatever that really means. We have established the conditions for national cooperation. What possible hope for national cooperation or national restraint would there be if we had adopted the method that the Leader of the Opposition and previous Liberal and Country Party Treasurers adopted designed to create mass unemployment? What possible basis for national co-operation would there be if we were to indulge in the sort of union bashing which is our opponents stock-in-trade? What possible basis for national co-operation would there be had we not been prepared to call for some sacrifices- they are certainly not punitive ones from the very strongest and wealthiest in the community? What possible basis for national cooperation would there be if we were to punish the vast majority of Australians who will benefit under our community and welfare program?What possible basis for national co-operation would there be if, in the name of fighting inflation, this Government had chosen to break the promises it has twice made to the Australian people; if this Government were gutless enough to destroy the program which the people of Australia have twice endorsed and demanded?As to the idea of the Leader of the Opposition on leadership, all I can say is that it would be a damned sight easier for this Government to give leadership in our area of responsibility, governing Australia according to the program on which we were elected, if he were able to give some leadership in his area of responsibility. If he could control his wild men in the Senate, if there were one Liberal Party in this Parliament instead of two, this Government would be much better able to get on with the job for which it has been twice elected and much better able to carry out its program which has been twice endorsed.As the Treasurer said last night, we share with all our major trading partners problems of economic management unparalleled in modern times. We are doing as well in coping with inflation as most of them and better than any of them in preventing unemployment. But I venture to say that not one comparable democracy has to deal with the obstruction, the pettiness, the unpredictability, the time-wasting energy consuming nonsense which this Government has suffered at the hands of the Leader of the Oppositions nominal followers in the Senate. We could live with this more readily if we could at least identify some principle behind their conduct or the conduct of their nominal leader. But the sheer cussedness which allows Liberal and Country Party senators to impede legislation which their parties have themselves proposed on trade practices and off-shore minerals, the Australian Industry Development Corporation and the Superior Court, which opposes legislation twice and thrice endorsed by the Australian people, which causes the needless time wasting of the Joint Sitting- dragging out the inevitable to the bitter end- is beyond rational explanation. Before the Leader of the Opposition can credibly talk about leadership, let him serve his apprenticeship. Let him do some on-the-job training, or better still, some adult retraining.The fact is that the delay in the Budget caused by the elections, the interruption of normal parliamentary processes, the turbulence and obstruction of the Senate during the special session during which 18 Bills were rejected, the continuing attempts at disruption of proceedings of this House, are all contributing to a loss of faith in the parliamentary system and thereby contributing to and deliberately creating public uneasiness and confusion. All this must be laid at the door of the Leader of the Opposition. He condones this conduct because he cannot control it. It is his responsibility; it is up to him to show some leadership. It comes with the job and if he cannot do it, he should find somebody in his Party who can. Where on earth he should look defies even my ingenuity. In the meantime, let us get on with our job. Let us, the Government and the people of Australia get on with the job of fighting inflation, restoring full employment and building a better Australia. The Budget is a mighty good start. I commend it and I reject the Leader of the Oppositions frivolous motion.Motion (by Mr Nicholls) proposed:That the question be now put.","Motion of Censure","WHITLAM GOVERNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This is supported by rulings in the House that it is not in order to discuss the proceedings of a royal commission or matters coming before it, and that the Chair would be failing in its duty if it allowed any discussion about matters which had been deliberately handed to the commission for investigation. In the light of these rulings I have considered the matter proposed by the honourable member for Wannon. While I consider that parts (1) and (3) do not come within the terms of reference of the royal commission I consider that part (4) is covered by paragraph ( 1 ) of the terms of reference. Accordingly I rule part (4) of the matter submitted by the honourable member to be out of order. I now call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion on the matter in the form that I have determined to rise in their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places) -Motion (by Mr Daly) put:That the business of the day be called on.

107,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FRASER, Malcolm","QS4","N/A","N/A","N/A",1463,"- I was coming to the point that the Prime Minister himself had given a good argument for the suspension of Standing Orders at this time, because in relation to the censure motion against himself and his Government he argued that this morning was the first time such a motion could have been properly and adequately debated. While we do not accept that, if that argument has any validity this is certainly the first time that this matter of real substance could be debated. The Government is doing everything it can to prevent such debate. It is important that these matters be debated adequately. It is also important to debate these matters before the royal commissioner begins his inquiry, which he has not yet done. I suggest that the sub judice rules do not apply until the inquiry has begun.","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","ALLEGED INDEMNITY PAYMENTS INVOLVING MARITIME UNIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is imperative that this matter be debated before that occurs; so my remarks do relate to the suspension of Standing Orders. We want to bring this matter on for debate before the inquiry begins so that the matter can be adequately debated without the strictures that apply to honourable members once the inquiry has begun. It has not yet begun. The Minister for Transport is nodding his head indicating that he agrees the inquiry has not yet begun. Until the inquiry starts to take evidence how can it be said that the inquiry has begun? It is important that Standing Orders be suspended to enable this matter to be debated. It is especially important since there has been complete silence from the Minister for Labor and Immigration for a period of 6 to 8 weeks- silence over a much longer period, possibly over a year, if the allegations of Mr Elliott of the Seamens Union are correct. This again creates urgency with respect to the suspension of Standing Orders.

116,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FRASER, Malcolm","QS4","N/A","N/A","N/A",1464,"- The first and major reason is that it is important that this matter be debated by this House at the first opportunity in this sitting because these events occurred and they came to public notice when the House was not sitting. There was an effort made to cover up the matter, and it is a necessity that this House be given a proper opportunity for debate. I suggest that the Government appointed the royal commission to prevent debate in this Parliament. I suggest that the terms of reference were drawn by the Government, as the Government has drawn them, to prevent the truth of these matters being disclosed and the involvement of the Minister for Transport, who has had specific allegations made against him, being brought out. The Opposition wants to give theMinister for Transport and the Minister for Labor and Immigration an opportunity to clear their names in relation to this matter. The suspension of Standing Orders will provide that opportunity to them.The motion for the suspension of Standing Orders ought to be carried and ought to be supported by the Government. If the Government had any sense of responsibility for its integrity and for decency in politics it would do so. The Minister for Labor and Immigration said quite plainly that the only thing wrong with the extortion, with the indemnity payments, was the direction of the funds. If the direction of the funds had been different he would not have minded the indemnity payments being made. That again emphasises the need for the suspension of Standing Orders to enable the Minister for Labor and Immigration to clarify these matters. I suppose he does not mind some part of the direction of the funds, because some part of them went to the Labor Party for election purposes.","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","ALLEGED INDEMNITY PAYMENTS INVOLVING MARITIME UNIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Waterside Workers Federation of Australia is not included. The statement made by the Prime Minister mentioned the maritime unions alone; it did not mention the Waterside Workers Federation. One of the Press reports states that the Minister for Transport has given a guarantee that the Waterside Workers Federation and Mr Fitzgibbon would not suffer any action against them as a result of indemnity payments made to Mr Fitzgibbon or the Waterside Workers Federation. Therefore it is utterly critical that there be specific mention of the Waterside Workers Federation in the terms of reference of the royal commission.Failing that, the only thing that could meet this case, which the suspension of Standing Orders would give an opportunity to the Government to provide, would be a clear statement by the Government that the Government agrees with your ruling that the Waterside WorkersFederation is involved, that the indemnity payments- almost $400,000 is mentioned in the newspapers in connection with the Waterside Workers Federation- will also be the subject of this inquiry. The suspension of Standing Orders, which I hope the Leader of the House will support, will provide an opportunity to have this matter clarified.","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","ALLEGED INDEMNITY PAYMENTS INVOLVING MARITIME UNIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Yesterday the opportunity was given to the Opposition to move a motion if it was important. It was not taken advantage of. Today it has been brought in after we have discussed a censure motion, which the Opposition knows takes precedence as the business of government must continue. We all know that the purpose of moving for the suspension of Standing Orders today is to make a speech on a matter that was prevented from being discussed in the interests of the Parliament and to get around that decision by debating it here today. That has been proved in this debate, Mr Speaker, because you have constantly had to call honourable members opposite to order when they have wanted to debate details of the matter which the House decided would not be discussed but that the next business would be called on.I and other honourable members on this side of the House are completely unmoved by these phoney attempts by the Liberal and Country Parties to circumvent decisions of this Parliament by trying to put over a case which they have been prevented from putting. I point out to the members of the Opposition that the previous Government applied standing order 399 against the then Opposition. Deliberate attempts are made to move frivolous motions of this nature to hold up the business of the Parliament. If this continues, in the interests of good government it may be necessary for us to adopt for once the infamous policies of those who now sit opposite. Far be it from me to do so, but if the Opposition continues on the course it is following it will leave the Government no alternative. No self respecting government can tolerate the delaying of the business of Parliament by frivolous motions moved for political purposes, in an endeavour to hold up the business of this Government in this Parliament where we legislate for the welfare of all people.The motion deserves to be defeated. It should never have been moved. Honourable members opposite who spoke on it ought to remember that the reason why there is a limitation of time on speaking to a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders is that honourable members are expected to speak to the motion. I will bet that the honourable member for Wannon or the honourable member for New England (MrSinclair) do not realise that when I sit down in about 30 seconds the motion will be automatically put. Only about 25 minutes are allowed for these debates. Very few members of the Opposition know a standing order and do not even know how to break them properly, but they try to get around the Standing Orders they do not know under the guise of putting up a great public stand. The Government would support this motion if it were worthwhile doing so, but we have no intention of doing it today. Consequently, I ask that the motion be rejected.","Discussion of Matter of Public Importance","ALLEGED INDEMNITY PAYMENTS INVOLVING MARITIME UNIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[19]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They are a consequence of arrangements for the marketing of the 1974-75 wool clip that have been approved by the Government and agreed to by the Australian Wool Industry Conference. Our intention to introduce them was announced by the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) on 29 August.Wool tax is currently levied at the rate of 2.75 per cent. At this level, it represents wool growers  contributions towards the financing of programs of wool research and promotion and the administration of the marketing functions of the Australian Wool Corporation.The additional tax proposed by these Bills will be imposed at the rate of 5 per cent thus bringing the total levy up to 7.75 per cent. The 5 per cent increase will apply from 2 September 1974 to 30 June 1975 and the revenue from it will be appropriated for use by the Australian Wool Corporation to meet any losses it may incur during the 1974-75 wool selling season from the maintenance of a firm floor price of 250 cents per kilogram clean for 21 micron wool in the wool market. Legislation will be introduced at the first opportunity to provide for the creation of a separate fund for this purpose.The date from which the increased rate of tax will apply coincides with the date of the resumption of auction sales for the 1974-75 wool selling season. Tax will, therefore, be collected at a common rate for all wool sold since the introduction of the minimum floor price. The Wool Tax Act (No. 1 ) imposes a tax on shorn wool produced in Australia and sold by a wool broker. The other Acts ensure that where shorn wool is not sold by a broker it is subject to tax at some other point. The need for 5 separate Acts arises from a constitutional requirement that laws imposing taxes should deal with one subject of taxation only. I commend the bills to the house.Debate (on motion by Mr Street) adjourned.That in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969-1974, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the Committee has duly reported to Parliament:Proposed redevelopment of Tennant Creek Hospital.","Second Reading","WOOL TAX BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I say that with reservations because Tennant Creek is in an isolated area. The transport situation in the Northern Territory being as it is, I hope that the proposed work can be completed in the estimated period of 3 years. If the conditions that we experienced this year are repeated and the railway line and the roads in South Australia, particularly the northern areas of South Australia, and Central Australia are subjected to the conditions that they have experienced this year, I am afraid that the completion date will slip back. If the rate of inflation in Australia is to increase at an estimated 20 per cent or so, as the Treasurer (Mr Crean) and the Government seem to accept, the cost of the redevelopment of the Tennant Creek Hospital will increase beyond the present estimate of $4.83m.

I hope that the Government will do something about seeing that it does not fall behind in the time schedule and that the Government will not just throw up its hands in the way it is doing about the economic situation in the country today. Since you ask me, I tell you this. I see that there is to be a staff of 27 or so at Tennant Creek. I do not know where they are going to be housed. In the civil works program there are proposals for some flats and houses but in Tennant Creek at this moment there are seven school teachers under a cloud. They do not know if they are going to stay there or not because there is no government accommodation and the Government has done nothing whatsoever about it. I believe numerous requests have been made to the Minister for the Northern Territory for him to go there and answer those questions, amongst others, which are going to be put in the town tonight. No doubt they will be overjoyed to hear of the hospital. There are millions of dollars of improvements to be built in Tennant Creek but I do not know who is going to staff them, because there will be no houses there for the people to live in. So while we are grateful to have a hospital, it is unfortunate that the Government has done nothing about the housing position in Tennant Creek during the time it has been in office. If you look at the civil works program you will see in the proposed works that there are houses to be built. How long it will take to build them I do not know.I am glad the hospital is to be started. The history of medical services in Tennant Creek has been a very checkered one, not only in the time of this Government but for all the time I have been in the Territory. It has always been in doubt whether there would be one doctor or two doctors, a dentist, or any medical facilities at all in Tennant Creek. As you know, it is 320 miles north of Alice Springs and it is quite ridiculous to consider going down there to have a tooth filled or to get minor medical assistance. This hospital is certainly not before its time and I hope it will be completed in something like the estimated period.","Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act","TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Private builders will not go to Tennant Creek unless they have a contract worth more than $2m. The contract for the housing requirements was worth a lot less than $2m. I was told by locals in Tennant Creek that it is for that reason- I rely on their word- that contractors will not take on work at Tennant Creek. How that fact can be twisted and responsibility for that situation be laid at the feet of the Government I do not know.I turn to the other specious issue the honourable member for the Northern Territory raised about the costs of building rising. I think he plucked some figure out of the air. He referred to a cost of $6m or $5m- some weird figure derived from a simple arithmetical calculation in a very complex situation. It is absolutely fallacious to say that the completion date is date X, that building costs are rising by 20 per cent per annum and that one should increase the base figure by that percentage over the period it takes to construct the building. I invite the honourable member for the Northern Territory to speak with officers of the Department of Housing and Construction and to get his arithmetic correct.There is another side to the equation. What in fact happens is that because of clauses in the contract, any rises and falls that occur after the contract has been let are calculated rises and falls. They are calculated on the basis of award increases in wages- not sweetheart agreements and on the increased cost of materials. These take place as progress payments are made and such payments diminish as the work proceeds because work has been done. To take a simple increase of 20 per cent and add that to the original estimated cost of $4.5m and say that it will now cost $5m or $6m is like trying to compare a horse with a cow- both have 4 legs but there the similarity ends.The other fallacy in the argument is that while costs are rising so is income rising. Whilst it may be true that on todays values the building is worth $4.5m or $4.83m, the volume of money available is at that level at this time but at the time the building is completed more funds are available, so the relativity remains. No relativity is lost. The honourable member for the Northern Territory tries to confuse the community and the House by quoting only one side of the equation. He quotes the side where costs are rising and ignores the side where incomes are rising. If he is the arithmetical genius he is trying to prove himself to be, I suggest he do the sort of calculation I have mentioned and perhaps explain the position later. If the relativity between costs and income remains, I suggest he should apologise. He should not take figures and multiply them so that they become larger in total or grander in scale and say it is bad, because that is only looking at one side of the picture and it gives a distorted view. One could be tempted to think this was some sort of dishonest argument.The proposed works undoubtedly are needed, as would be recognised by anybody who had seen the hospital at Tennant Creek. I do not think the hospital ran down in the last 2 years; it has been running down for a long time. The buildings are in a deplorable state. Some were erected as early as 1914. They are still standing and are being used. There is a need to build a new hospital at Tennant Creek. In fact there has probably been such a need for a long time. The need has finally been recognised. The Public Works Committee went to Tennant Creek and took evidence from citizens of the town and from the client department and the constructing department, deliberated on the matter and came to a very firm conclusion that the hospital ought to be built and work should proceed. I point out that it is only some weeks- in fact, in terms of sitting days of this House one could almost say it is only some days- since the report was presented to this House. I commend the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson) on coming back so quickly with the expediency motion. It shows his bona fides. It shows his integrity and its shows that he believes that the hospital ought to be built as quickly as possible.Both the Public Works Committee and the Minister have honoured their obligations. The Committee has brought in the report and the Minister has brought in as quickly as he could the expediency motion so that the works can proceed. I commend the works to the House. I could not conceive of any argument that could be put forward by anybody in this House, including the honourable member for the Northern Territory, that the works should not proceed. Yet if anybody were to oppose the expediency motion that is what he would need to say. If he did not say that he would be using this debate only as an opportunity to put a point of view about something that is not relevant to the construction of the hospital at Tennant Creek. I commend the motion to the House.","Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act","TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

However, I trunk I should at least say something about some of the remarks of the honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson). He commenced his remarks, I think, by congratulating the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder), saying that this is not the place and the time for making political speeches. I do not know of any place where one should make a political speech more than in this place. After all, this is what we are here for. But in his very next breath the honourable member for Burke attacked my colleague, the honourable member for the Northern Territory, by saying that he had been in the Northern Territory himself on more occasions than had the honourable member for the Northern Territory. In fact, the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson) who is at the table said that he thinks that even he has been in the Northern Territory more than the honourable member for the Northern Territory. They are all snide remarks that ought to be exposed and refuted.The honourable member for the Northern Territory said that he supported strongly the motion before the Chair; he said that there is a need for the hospital, as I recollect his remarks. He also said that there is a need for some accommodation up there to house the people who are associated with the hospital. So I think it is important to join issue with the Government at least on that point and also to make the point that we have no intention of injecting politics into the debate; we did so on the last occasion. The honourable member for Burke mentioned building costs.

In the previous debate I asked the Minister at the table whether he would be prepared to have portion of the Committees transcript incorporated in Hansard but he would not give us permission to do that. Three schools were the subject of the previous debate. I have forgotten where they were to be constructed, but 3 schools were involved, the estimated cost of which was just over $lm. The estimated tender price has risen in 12 months to more than $2m. It was that escalation which made it necessary for the Minister to bring the matter before the House. The Minister may remember that debate which took place only two or three months ago. It will be found from the transcript of evidence that building costs are escalating at this rate in the Northern Territory.","Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act","TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He represents a pocket handkerchief electorate one could ride a bike around before breakfast. I pay a tribute to the service that the honourable member for the Northern Territory gives to his electorate. I know of no one else who wears himself out in the service of his people as the honourable member for the Northern Territory does. I am ashamed to hear the honourable member for the Northern Territory attacked as he was by the honourable member for Burke, just because he did not attend a particular committee hearing, when he was almost certainly on the job somewhere else. I do not think that that is the kind of comment that should come from a member of the Committee.There are several things that could have been said quite usefully. The report we are debating is a two-barrelled report. This matter was referred to the previous Committee under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Fulton), and I was a member of the subcommittee that investigated it. But because of the chaos that was caused by the double dissolution, a report could not be brought into the House and the matter was referred back to the Committee. But some comment ought to be made about the matter. I know that the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Les Johnson) would want me to say something. The proposed work involves the use of village type accommodation. When both the Minister and I were members of theCommittee we had a good deal to do in activating this procedure. It is an interesting development in accommodation and the members of the Committee would have done themselves more credit if they had spent some time looking at the principles behind this proposal instead of making half-baked political attacks. It is said that we should not mention housing. The Committee itself mentions housing in the report. For the benefit of the Chairman of the Committee I refer to the report that he himself signed:The representatives of the Tennant Creek Town Management Board expressed some doubts about the successful recruitment of staff to man the new hospital. ... To assist in attracting staff required for the efficient operation of the hospital, the Committee consider that care should be taken to ensure that accommodation of sufficiently high standard is available.That is what we said in the report. This is what the honourable member for Burke signed but then he castigated the honourable member for the Northern Territory and said that the honourable member for the Northern Territory should not have referred to it.","Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act","TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

One other question- it is an important point- is whether the Committee should refer in its report to the cost of a proposed work. When the matter first came before the Committee, the estimated cost of the work was $4.5m. The second time it came before the Committee the estimated cost was $4.83m. We heard evidence from officers of the Department of Housing and Construction that the work is likely to go to tender at $6m. We would then know that the rise and fall clauses would apply in the meantime. One matter on which I would like the Ministers guidance is whether mention should be made in the report of the amount at which it is expected to go to tender.

I have been taunted from across the chamber about whether that was done when I was the Chairman of the Committee. It was well within the power of the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Fulton), who was then the Vice Chairman of the Committee, to insist that it be done. When the previous Committee discussed this matter and divided on it, which was the first time I had ever known it to divide on party lines, I said that I felt that it was a function of the Public Works Committee to advise the Parliament of the estimated cost of the work when it goes to tender. I think that it is a proper function of the Public Works Committee to do so. Irrespective of whether it is done in the report, I think it is proper that the Committee should find out the amount when it hears evidence on the proposed work. The Chairman of the Committee would know that the Committee has been following that practice. He has been quite responsible in his chairmanship and has made no attempt to stop the Committee from finding out.Surely it is a function of the Public Works Committee to tell the Parliament as near as it can what the work is going to cost. It is not sufficient to tell the Parliament what it has been estimated that it will cost when it goes to the Committee because more than one stage is involved. This proposed work is a comparatively small project, but it will take 10 months to document it and 27 months to do the building. By that time the cost of the project will have increased. I am not trying to make political capital out of this matter. I am just trying to measure the increased cost. Is it or is it not a function of the Public Works Committee to advise the Parliament of the cost of the work when it goes to tender? There are many other things that could be said about this matter. It would have been better if we had concentrated on the principles behind the work and the problems of starting and completing it in the area as well as all the problems that are inherent in the escalation of costs that make it so difficult to plan for long term progress in the area. We have to recognise that as being a fact of life until we can bring the problem of inflation under control. Everybody recognises that there is a problem. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) recognises it today. Everybody knows that we have a problem. Until we overcome the problem of inflation it is the job of the Public Works Committee to advise the Parliament- not the Government, which is a servant of the Parliament- of the estimated cost.","Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act","TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Everybody ought to be aware of them. They should not be brought into this Parliament with an intended element of surprise. The economy is buoyant. In the more remote areas it has become more difficult to attract tradesmen. There have been instances of a contemporary nature where the Government has been unsuccessful in attracting tenders even. Someone can criticise that situation if he likes. He may prefer a more depressed economic situation. He may prefer to have workmen waiting at the door and equipment stacked up and contractors lined up and ready to dance to his bidding. I know that is the philosophy that has been upheld in Liberal-Country Party components of the political spectrum in Australia for a long time. This Government just does not choose to do it that way. One of the consequences of our kind of emphasis is that sometimes in these difficult or remote areas of the Northern Territory there are some problems and these are reflected in cost acceleration. There has been cost acceleration. I have referred to it in presenting the motion. It is no secret. No one has to be ashamed of it. It is a fact of life in Australia and all over the world. It was in the light of this fact that the previous Committee examined this proposal and the estimate was $4.5m. Then the present Committee looked at it and the estimate at June 1973 prices was $4.83m.I know that the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Kelly) has another idea about prices. Some members of the Opposition like to cause prices to look as high as they can possibly make them look. I noticed that he expressed an opinion by way of a motion moved in the Committee to the effect that the final cost could rise to $6m when tenders are called. Whether he was right or wrong I am not prepared to speculate but I know he did not have the numbers to have that motion accepted. So the majority of members of that Committee apparently decided that his estimate was wrong.","Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act","TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I hope that knowledge will give somebody satisfaction. I give it with my compliments for what it is worth to them. Costs are rising in the Northern Territory and that is one of the problems that we encounter. So I hope all those gentlemen who get agitated are placated by that acquiescence in which I have indulged.The other matter is a minor one but it is worth mentioning. I think from the remarks of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) the House would get the impression that the Government had been completely derelict in its responsibility for housing at this hospital. That is not the case. As the honourable member for Wakefield has indicated, some exotic provisions of the type which never used to be made have been made. This is a very contemporary innovation. We now provide high standard accommodation wherever we carry out a Government project whether it is for servicemen, students or nurses. The honourable member for Wakefield and I, and also the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) and some other honourable members, can claim some credit for causing a break-through in this. We have lifted the whole standard. I thought the honourable member for the Northern Territory would have known a bit more about this. We have pioneered this in the Northern Territory especially; we have certainly adopted this policy for the community college and a number of other projects in the Territory. The project for the Tennant Creek Hospital is a very real and effective initiative being taken by the Government. In it we will provide a village for nurses accommodation with 24 motel-type units. They will be air conditioned and similar to the standard already established at the Alice Springs Hospital. They will be bed-sitter type units with self-contained facilities such as toilets and cooking arrangements.","Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act","TENNANT CREEK HOSPITAL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In addition to this village complex to be set in a park like surrounding will be an old ward of the hospital which is being turned into 3 self-contained 2- bedroom fiats for paramedical personnel. There will be 3 residences on the site, one each for the secretary, the medical superintendent and the senior officer of the hospital. Two of these residences already exist and the third is being built as pan of the project. So quite a generous amount of consideration has been extended to accommodation matters.Unquestionably there are accommodation problems in Tennant Creek. Maybe the honourable member for the Northern Territory can use his influence among the Legislative Councillors in the Territory to carve up the cake in such a way that Tennant Creek will get more of the Housing Commission allocation than it is getting at present. Quite frankly I think the time has come when a serious look should be taken at the need to fulfil hostel accommodation requirements in the Northern Territory for employees of my own Department, for employees of the Postmaster-Generals Department and for other employees who perform duties of a governmental nature. I was intrigued to hear several times today the old political cliche that the Opposition wants to socialise its losses and capitalise its gains. We find that this applies to housing activity which is claimed to be the prerogative of private enterprise. But when housing is required at places which are incapable of attracting a dividend to shareholders and where high profits cannot be made, as is the position in Tennant Creek and many other parts of the Northern Territory, honourable gentlemen opposite are quick to say that this is not a private profit making situation but is an obligation for the Government. They want to turn the rough stuff over to the Government but they never want to see some effective public enterprise that will cause taxation to be reduced.The proposition to build the Tennant Creek hospital has been talked about for decades. It has been needed for decades in an outpost of empire where some of our most valuable mineral exports are produced. The people in this area are pioneering and enterprising. The Government already has extended to those people many embellishments to their living arrangements which they never enjoyed before. Many public initiatives are being taken in the area including a new health centre, a new primary school and high school, a new power station and sewerage in the town. Here we have yet another milestone in this cavalcade of achievements for the Northern Territory which have been introduced in the short time that the Labor Government has been in office.

208,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ROBINSON, Ian","YI4","Cowper","CP; NCP from May 1975","N/A",1476,"-This Bill seeks to abolish the broadcast listeners and television viewers licence system. The licence fees have become relatively expensive to collect. In fact in 1 973-74 it cost $3.4m to collect the fees throughout Australia. According to calculations another $llm was not collected despite the activities of some 2,400 inspectors policing the licensing system. Another feature of the history of this matter is that last year 23,000 people were prosecuted for not possessing a broadcast listeners or a television viewers licence.The Opposition believes that the move to abolish the licences will be welcomed by the community. The Opposition also believes that at this stage of sophistication of administration the costs of administration, the costs of collecting revenue and the costs of policing the system run into a situation of imbalance. I believe, and I am sure that many other honourable members believe, that the Government must realise that it should not restrict this kind of thinking to only this area. It is very strange that the Government has expressed a firm view in very strong words that a business undertaking should be financed by receipts and be related to the expenditure required for its operation. It has indicated its principle in relation to post and telegraph charges. It has indicated it in relation to many other charges. Yet we have the curious situation where it selects this area for a different approach and in fact states that it cannot be treated as an operation that can be qualified as a business operation. Had the revenue situation continued the collections for the remainder of this year would have been about $50m or, in a full year, $67m- a very considerable sum of money.Let us think of the considerations that must arise in this matter. We are on the eve of the advent of colour television in Australia. There will, of course, be a great disparity in the matter of those who are privileged to have the opportunity of seeing colour television and those who will not. Yet had the fee continued everyone would have been paying the same licence charge. On that ground alone there was a need for some consideration of the matter. Undoubtedly, if the revenue aspect had been continued, the Government would have been increasing the licence fee. So, taking all this into account, at least some of the anomalies are being overcome by the one action of removing the licence fee. The anomalies, of course, are those in which we find an increasing number of listeners and viewers who are not privileged to get a satisfactory reception of one kind or another, where there is an increase in the expenditure, so far as the cities are concerned, and a loss of those standards in the more distant parts of Australia.So, the action of the Government is to be commended in this respect because it creates a situation of equality in the matter of the required enforcement of a charge. Perhaps it does not produce complete equality in terms of expenditure when it is related to who pays in this instance. Of course, it will now be the taxpayer. The situation is interesting when one looks at the day to day needs of the running of a great national service which provides our national radio and television media in this country. The costs must be escalating at an enormous rate. Yet under the privileges that have been followed for a considerable time a statutory body of the sort that is involved here is not required to reveal the full details of its budgeting and the full details of its expenditure in terms of a breakup that gives a picture of what is being spent in what area.We recall the great issue that arose some two or three years ago when the previous Government sought to have a closer look at what the budgeting and the expenditure might be. Before it could even get this off the ground there were protests in all directions, led by those who now sit on the Treasury benches. I am one who has always been in full support of those who want to get the best standard and give leadership in the provision of a national service. I think it is essential that they be given support to perform their task in the national interest. But it is a strange contrast indeed, in what we now are told is open government, when we still do net have a situation where the full details are made known to Parliament and made known to the public in the community at large.I just want to express this comment. I hope that the removal of the licence fee will not be an open order in certain directions for the provision of a national service or for expenditure to escalate without regard to what it means in terms of the drain on the taxpayer. After all, to some extent a limitation was imposed in the past through the revenue limitation in terms of collections from Licence fees. This was supplemented to some extent from other sources such as tax revenue. Now we have the situation where there is no restraint of that kind. This Bill contains nothing which indicates that there will be some kind of control mechanism. I hope that what I am about to say will not be regarded as a statement that criticises in any way the action being taken to remove the licence charge; on the other hand, I hope that it will be regarded as a responsible comment on the administration of what is one of the most vital services provided to the public. I am bound to point out that there is as a consequence of this action an even greater disparity in what is paid for by taxpayers or through the revenue coming to the Government for public service provisions- in other words, services to the community and what is regarded as a business undertaking and which therefore necessitates revenue to cover its expenditure. So, I mention again telephone services. In very many Australian homes the number one requirement is a telephone. Radio and television services rank second to that requirement. This is because there are people who are dependent on that kind of link between their home and the outside world. These people live in a situation where the telephone is their one means of defence and security -","Second Reading","BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION BILL 1974","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

211,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ROBINSON, Ian","YI4","N/A","CP; NCP from May 1975","N/A",1477,"-I bow to your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will certainly link up what I am saying with the legislation before the House. I might say that I am a little surprised that the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) should take that point because undoubtedly the aspect to which I have referred is one that concerns a basic consideration in the removal of the licence fee. It is apparent that henceforth a cost of approximately $75m- undoubtedly this amount will escalate to $ 100m- will be imposed on the Budget as a consequence of this action. I suggest that that is an important consideration. I believe it is right and proper that I should refer to its relationship to other matters that touch upon the community. This relationship is regarded by the Government, in the terms expressed in the second reading speech, as the justification for its actions. So, I am bound to say that in the total scene a need is present to look at the rationalisation of or the relationship to those services which are important to the community. I repeat that this is an important matter but there are others. I hope that this will be a first step in a move to give the community the kinds of benefits that those who depend on these community services really need in this period of inflation, cost escalation and economic mismanagement. I think I would be failing in my duty if I were to say less than that.It is important that the Government should take a fresh look at what is happening in relation to the national service provided by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. With the rapid growth of population, particularly along the eastern seaboard, circumstances have been created in which very many radio listeners are still restricted to the reception of one effective radio channel. As a consequence, the listening opportunities for these people are affected and the standard of service likewise to these people is lower. If we were to refer to an assessment that has been made in quite recent times, this disparity is pointed up very clearly indeed. It is fair to say that even the broadcast of parliamentary proceedings, whilst not the most popular session on radio, is certainly listened to by a number of Australians. But there are very many people in many electorates in our country who will tell one very clearly that they are not able to listen to the parliamentary proceedings because they cannot pick up the radio signal through which this broadcast is made available to radio listeners.Similarly, for reasons that are quite apparent and understood by many people television viewing opportunities are restricted. There are great limitations in the coverage that is provided by the national service. The decision to introduce colour television in Australia was made comparatively recently. Once that decision was made, a great cost factor was introduced into the provision of those services and the provision of the means for people to be afforded an opportunity to view colour television through the national service. The same situation applies to commercial television operations. I believe that if there is to be real equality- that is undoubtedly the objective of this measure to remove the licence fee- that equality must be quickly extended to provide equal viewing opportunities to all sections of the community- not just to capital cities, metropolitan areas or the suburbia of Sydney and Melbourne, but to the rest of Australia.If this is to be the pattern, I hope that it will be done on a fair and equitable basis. I hope that we will not see a repetition of what has been perpetrated through the administration of the Department of Minerals and Energy with respect to the gas pipeline among many other aspects where what might be regarded as a very good relationship between commercial enterprise and the government sector has been wiped aside and something else- a totally government operation has been put in its place. I hope that this proposal does not mean that henceforth a policy will be perpetrated seeking real nationalisation of the media. If that is what is intended, it would be very wrong indeed. If the only justification for such action is that the public will be paying for these services through Budget provisions as distinct from a licensing system, that would be an even worse approach. We certainly do not want to see that happening.I return to the precise provisions of the Bill which seeks the abolition of the broadcasting and television licence fee paid by listeners and viewers. The removal of this charge certainly will be welcomed by every Australian who owns and uses a radio set and/or a television set. I think approximately 3.5 million Australians are licence holders. Those who receive some concessions in respect of these services- I think half a million pensioners are involved- in future will not be required to pay any charge whatsoever. They certainly will welcome this move.We support the measure on the ground that it is action in a direction which seems to make very good sense. But we hope that its whole import will be related to that principle and not to something else. There is no doubt that one of the intricacies of this matter- and of course it is the Australian attitude that is important -","Second Reading","BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION BILL 1974","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

213,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ROBINSON, Ian","YI4","N/A","CP; NCP from May 1975","N/A",1478,"- The Minister is suggesting that there is some need to hurry this debate through. It is all very well for him to get excited, but there are justifications for the Opposition expressing its points of view. Opposition members have the right so to do and I think that we will stick to that right, if the Minister does not mind. I was referring to the precise principle which this initiates. I hope it is the forerunner of many more things based on this worthy principle and is not used as a vehicle to make inroads in another direction. In saying that, I have in mind the many statements we have read in the last 12 months about attitudes to the media, how the media should function, opportunities that should be given for a certain style of media in this country. There have even been suggestions that there should be an Australian Government media service. There is a lot of obscurity about what has been said, but I think it has a very direct relationship to the measure now before the House. So, in welcoming this measure I make the observation that I hope it is not a move that will create by stealth an entirely different system, an entirely different attitude, an entirely different premise upon which the Government, through existing instrumentalities or others it may create in the future, will manage the control and the opportunities for the operation in this country of the style of media we have become accustomed to, a national service and a commercial service, because both have been important in the past. They are obviously of a standard today that is a credit to them. We have no criticism of the national service and we have no criticism of the commercial service in terms of generalities. Certainly there are areas one can examine and find grounds for criticism.I must not conclude without reminding the House of action taken in the last few weeks by the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison), who is sitting at the table. That action was to make a very vicious attack on one section of the community in relation to advertising. If my memory serves me correctly, a commission of inquiry was appointed to investigate the television advertising of soap.","Second Reading","BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION BILL 1974","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am not terribly impressed with an interjection I think I heard from the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) that he wants to rush this Bill through. Though I would like to support the principle, at the same time I support my friend and colleague, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Ian Robinson), in the comments he has made. I compliment him on his speech in view of the very short notice he had to prepare for it. I am sorry there has not been an opportunity for more honourable members on this side of the chamber to speak on the subject. I agree with the honourable member that we are not opposing the Bill as such, but I believe this is an opportunity for us to ask a few simple questions. What is the real reason for this measure? I have read the comments the Treasurer (Mr Crean) made last night and I have read the Ministers second reading speech. To be frank, I do not think they explain the reasons for the legislation. Last night the Treasurer said that the national broadcasting and television service is a service provided to the community as a whole and the Government believes that the cost of the service should therefore be met from general taxation revenues rather than through a licence fee. That is all right, but how do you associate that with the measure introduced last night by the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) in relation to increases in postal and telegraph charges? If one is a service, so is the other. The Minister said that from 1968 to 1971 under a Liberal Party-Country Party Government the fees raised met something like 75 per cent of the expenditure of the national broadcasting and television service and if we were to recover a similar percentage of expenditure today we would have to increase the fees by 50 per cent. I do not dispute that, but it seems rather odd that on the one hand we would have to increase fees to maintain the status quo but we will delete them, whereas on the other hand, when it comes to general telephone and postal charges, because we are running short of chips we have to increase them.To return to my original point, what is the real motive behind this? An amount of $50m or so in revenue will be lost. What effect will this have on the service provided by the various national television and radio stations? If we are going to reduce the service then I regret having to support the Bill. It is very easy for some honourable members to suggest that we are advancing tremendously in this field and that colour television is just around the corner. There are numerous places throughout Australia which have not got black and white TV, let alone colour TV. I venture to say that there are many places receiving reasonable TV coverage today which will not receive colour TV when it is introduced. What effect will the reduction of the income of the Department have? Can we have an assurance from the Government, from the Minister, that despite the reduction of $50m in income the service will continue? With the honourable member for Cowper, I support this issue, with a certain amount of reservation. If it is good enough to have a reduction in one section of the Postmaster-Generals Department on the ground of service to the community then it is good enough to have it in another section. Instead of having an increase in postal and telephone charges there ought to be a reduction by perhaps a similar amount.Question resolved in the affirmative.Bill read a second time.That the Bill be now read a second time.","Second Reading","BROADCASTING AND TELEVISION BILL 1974","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
218,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"LYNCH, Phillip","KIM","Flinders","N/A","N/A",1479,"-I welcome the opportunity, before so many interested honourable members from both sides of the House, to speak to the Asian Development Fund Bill 1974. This Bill seeks parliamentary approval for a contribution of $18. 15m to the Asian Development Bank, the specific purpose of which is the establishment of an Asian Development Fund. The Opposition Parties support the passage of the Bill. It is consistent with the priorities of successive Liberal-Country Party governments for programs of economic and technical assistance in developing countries. The Asian Development Bank, otherwise known as the ADB, was established in 1966 to provide practical expression to the policy initiatives of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East.From its quite recent beginnings it has developed rapidly and provided a major stimulus to economic development in the Asian region. It operates as an autonomous international development institution, pursuing goals that complement rather than replace other existing assistance programs, such as those of the World Bank. Like the World Bank it has been designed to provide both technical and financial assistance.The dimensions of the Asian Development Banks loan facilities clearly illustrate the importance of this organisation to the overall pattern of Asian development. The Bank commenced lending in 1968, and by the end of 1973 it had lent us 1,376m. This sum represents approximately one-third of the total amount lent by multilateral agencies to the developing countries of ECAFE. If the comparison over the same 6 years period is made on the basis of lending from ordinary capital resources, the Asian Development Banks contribution of us 1,056m equalled some 50 per cent of total funds allocated. The Banks steadily increasing loan facilities, together with a recent 150 per cent increase in authorised capital, indicates clearly that the Bank will continue as one of the principal agencies of development assistance in the region. The Bill before the House represents a commitment to the objectives and purposes of the Asian Development Bank, which is shared by all parties in this Parliament.The purposes of the Bill are to provide funds for the establishment of the Asian Development Fund. It is proposed that this Fund should have an initial working capital of US$525m which is to be provided by contributions from the developed member countries of the Asian Development Bank. Australias proposed contribution is approximately 5 per cent or $ 18.5m, to be paid in Australian dollars, at a parity with the American dollar fixed in November 1973 The loan will be provided on terms of an issue of non-interest-bearing promissory notes, to be enc a shed on demand when the funds are required. Payments will be made in two stages: Two-thirds by 30 June 1975, committed by 31 December 1974, and the remaining US$9m committed by 30 June 1975 and paid over by 3 1 December 1975.The funds so provided will be used to finance loans at less than ruling commercial rates of interest. There is, of course, an urgent need for such concessional financing, particularly at present. In most of the developing member countries, assistance on conventional terms has entailed, and continues to entail, a growing problem of debt financing. In several member countries, in fact, the debt service ratio already exceeds 20 per cent of export earnings. Softening of lending terms is therefore a matter of great urgency. In recognition of this need, the donor countries of the Asian Development Bank agreed in principle during 1973 to the establishment of the Asian Development Fund. This Bill proposes to give formal ratification to that agreement.In supporting the Bill, the Opposition Parties are also in agreement with the Government that the funds should be granted unconditionally, and not constrained on a tied grant basis. Unfortunately, there is an increasing world trend towards development assistance on a tied grant basis. It has been difficult on occasions to distinguish some countries aid programs from their export promotion policies. Grants and loans are too frequently made for specific purposes, and have been tied to the purchase of goods and services in the donor country, so as to create no charge in that countrys balance of payments. Such action, of course, greatly reduces the flexibility of programs and restricts the policy options open to developing countries.The acute needs of most Asian countries for economic assistance have been exacerbated by the worldwide spiral of inflation. The real value of development expenditure has been rapidly eroded by inflationary forces. In addition, the net effect of the change in parities of major international currencies has contributed to worsening terms of trade. For these problems there appears to be no ready or immediate assistance. Indeed, they have been aggravated by the worldwide liquidity problem, created by the failure of world monetary reserves to expand on a pro rata basis with the increase in world trade. These recent monetary phenomenons make solutions to age old problems of under-development, mass poverty and unemployment even more difficult to find in the present circumstances. They give greater exigency to programs of development aid, which have long been recognised as an important international obligation of the Australian Government.In 1972 the former Government spent $228m, or 0.59 per cent of the gross national product on foreign aid. The Labor Government in 1973 spent $202m or just 0.44 per cent of gross national product. As inflation grew by 13.2 per cent during 1973, Labors aid contribution, in real terms, was substantially lower than these figures suggest. There was, in fact, an implicit inflationary erosion in the real value of aid of almost $27m, compounding the impact of the $20m cut in actual expenditure. Given that a high proportion of Labors 1973 aid had already been committed by the former Liberal-Country Party Government as part of Australias ongoing contributions, Labors foreign aid performance has clearly been insufficient and totally inadequate. It is incompatible with the Governments specific policy pledge to work towards the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance.The present Labor Administration, notwithstanding its loose claims for support for and cooperation with our Asian neighbours, has, in real terms, failed to honour its promises. It has failed to deliver the goods in this area. The clear fact is that in terms of gross national product for the calendar year 1973 Labor cut Australias economic assistance program by more than $20m. Budget Paper No. 9 1974-75, dealing with projected outlays for Australian external aid in the current financial year, goes to great lengths to defend the Labor Governments foreign aid performance. Upon analysis, however, the Governments attempt to justify its past record is far from credible. The Budget statement indicated that net expenditures on multi-lateral aid programs are estimated to increase to $10,891,000 or 73.8 per cent to a total of $25,648,000 in 1974-75. In prima facie terms, this increase may appear a salutary response in an area of past neglect. But it must be realised that this increase represents nothing more than a belated, if much needed, attempt to restore Australias multilateral aid commitment, in percentage terms, to the level achieved by the past Liberal-Country Party Administration in 1972.Given the massive impact of the energy crisis on virtually every developing Asian nation, with the exception of OPEC member nations, and the increasing incidence of social and economic instability created by war and famine, the current level of Australias multi-lateral aid must still be deemed to be very much inadequate against the whole context of need in the countries concerned. Economic and social conditions in most developing nations have suffered a marked deterioration since the Liberal and Country Parties were last in power. I believe therefore, as do all members of the Opposition parties, that Australia must clearly accept its international obligations in these changed circumstances and provide far higher priority to its foreign aid commitments. A holding action at this stage is simply not adequate, both in terms of the past record and, more particularly, against the obvious pressing and overriding needs of the countries concerned.The Liberal and Country Parties believe that the expansion of Government spending in the field of foreign aid is certainly justifiable. This is not one area of expenditure which falls within the ambit of our proposals for a moderation in the overall rate of growth of Federal expenditures. Foreign aid expenditure will not aggravate domestic pressures of cost inflation. Nor is its quantum effect on total Budget outlays likely to have significant repercussions. Clearly there is considerable scope for expansion of Government spending in this specific and significant area of overall Budget policy. Support for the expansion of Australias multi-lateral aid commitments is, of course, in this context not inconsistent with the Oppositions policy of overall moderation in the rate of growth of Government spending as the net impact of such commitments has a virtually negligible impact upon domestic stabilisation policies. Rather the Oppositions support for such worthwhile schemes as the Asian Development Fund is a reflection of our continuing concern for the problems of our Asian neighbours and is consistent with our parties long-term commitment to the principles of foreign aid over all regional development. In one of the most comprehensive surveys of Australias foreign aid policy the then Minister for Foreign Affairs in the last Liberal-Country Party Government, the Honourable Nigel Bowen, said in 1972:Aid is more than simply a question of money: It is a complex process of marshalling resources, technical, human and administrative as well as material. It is important that the quality and effectiveness of aid should be as high as possible.The Opposition parties subscribe to this view and by support for the establishment of the Asian Development Fund we believe that this view will be given continuing and practical expression. We support the Bill before the House.","Second Reading","ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL 1974","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
219,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PEACOCK, Andrew","MI4","Kooyong","N/A","N/A",1481,"-The DeputyLeader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) has indicated to the House that the Opposition supports the Asian Development Fund Bill which seeks parliamentary approval for a contribution by Australia of $18. 15m, which is approximately US$27m, to the Asian Development Fund recently established within the Asian Development Bank. It is appropriate at this stage to recall the background of this measure. The Asian Development Bank was conceived by the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East- better known as Cafe- and established for the purpose of lending funds, promoting investment and providing technical assistance to developing member countries and, generally, for fostering economic growth and cooperation in the Asian region. It was formally opened on 19 December 1966. Membership of the Asian Development Bank is open to members and associates of Cafe and other regional countries and non-regional developed countries which are members of the United Nations or any of its specialised agencies.The Asian Development Banks lending activities are divided into ordinary operations and special operations. From the commencement of operations until 31 March 1974 the Asian Development Bank approved 177 loans for 156 projects in 21 developing member countries totalling Us 1,467.043m. Projects financed by Asian Development Bank loans cover such development activities as construction of highways, processing of agricultural products and development of fishery fleets, industrial plants, water and power supply, ports, airports, multipurpose development schemes, irrigation, medium and small industries through national . development banks and other intermediary institutions, education and telecommunications- a very broad spectrum of activities. Ordinary operations of the Bank consist of loans made at near commercial rates of interest and financed out of ordinary capital resources. Ordinary capital resources comprise mainly subscribed capital and borrowings. The original authorised capital stock of the Asian Development Bank has been increased on different occasions. As at 31 March this year total authorised capital stock was Us3, 366m, of which US$2, 725m was subscribed by the Asian Development Banks 40 member countries. Special operations are loans made on concessional or soft terms for projects of high development priority in developing member countries. These projects are financed out of special funds.Under the Asian Development Banks charter it may accept contributions to special funds which it may administer on terms agreed upon with the donors, provided the purpose is consistent with the objectives and functions of the Asian Development Bank. Special funds must be held, used, invested or otherwise disposed of entirely separate from the ordinary capital resources of the Asian Development Bank. Under the Special Funds Rules and Regulations adopted by the Board of Directors in 1968, the Asian Development Bank established 3 special funds: Firstly, the Agricultural Fund, secondly, the Multi-Purpose Fund; and thirdly, the Technical Assistance Fund. On 22 May 1973 the Asian Development Bank merged the Agricultural Fund with the Multi-Purpose Fund. However, later in 1973 it was decided to replace the Multipurpose Fund with a single unified fund known as the Asian Development Fund to create a more appropriate and effective framework for financing concessional lending, and it is that fund with which we are dealing under this Bill today.The Asian Development Fund, which is multilateral in character, is designed to service the primary source of future concessional lending operations by the Asian Development Bank. Previously, concessional loans were financed almost entirely out of the Multi-purpose Special Fund. However, according to the Treasurer (Mr Crean) in his second reading speech on the Asian Development Fund Bill on 1 6 July this year, contributions to the Multi-purpose Special Fund had dwindled to the extent that in the absence of early steps to replenish Special Fund resources concessional lending by the Asian Development Bank seemed likely to grind to a halt.The proposals for the Asian Development Fund involve the mobilisation of $US525m in contributions from developed countries in 2 stages. Under the first stage US$350m will be contributed, and the balance of US$1 75m will be contributed under the second stage. I understand that stage 1 recently became effective, and the Asian Development Fund is now firmly established. Australias proposed total contribution to the Fund is US$29m or $A18.5m. In line with the overall arrangements for financing the Fund, it is proposed that Australias total amount be committed in 2 stages over 18 months or so. The Treasurer has indicated that, consistent with past practice, Australia will use the promissory note technique of payment, which will limit the budgetary impact of the contribution.According to the 1973 annual report of the Asian Development Bank, when the Asian Development Fund is substantially operative, the Special Fund s resources of the ADB will become a fully effective counterpart of its ordinary capital resources, and the financial structure envisaged for the ADB at its inception will be complete. The report continued:With these additional resources at its disposal, the Bank will be in a position to mount an organised program of concessional lending for the economic and social advancement of its least developed member countries, rising from the 1973 level of 118. 16m to S200m in 1974, and to $250m in 197S. No less important, the Bank will be in a position to extend this assistance on terms which more fully recognise the financial burdens that these countries have to bear, and on conditions that are more flexible and responsive to their needs. This is a challenge the Bank will readily accept. Whether it will have an opportunity to do so depends now upon the ability of the Banks developed member countries to come forward with the contributions authorised by theBoard of Governors within the time frame envisaged in the resolutions.That was stated in the annual report of the Australian Development Bank last year at pages 28 and 29. We are meeting our commitment and our undertaking with this Bill. It is a very real challenge to Australia. I want to make some remarks not just related to the Asian Development Bank as such but to aid programs in the broad. After all, this is part of Australias aid assistance to developing countries. I am not particularly impressed with the record of this Government in that field. Despite the fact that there has been a sizable increase in this Budget, allegedly, for aid programs, it will be recalled if one examines Appropriation Bill (No. 1 ) that the actual expenditure last year fell well below the amount that was allocated in the Budget. The Government in fact stands condemned for the way it went about its aid programs in the last 1 8 months. The amount of money given by way of aid programs in the calendar year 1973- of course they are covered neatly by the Budget, because we are operating on a financial year- was less than the amount given by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government in the 1972 calendar year.","Second Reading","ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL 1974","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

To fall below the 1972 amount in 1 973 is in itself enough.","Second Reading","ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL 1974","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

224,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PEACOCK, Andrew","MI4","N/A","N/A","N/A",1483,"-I am grateful that you have expressed your ruling in that way, Mr Deputy Speaker. The fact that I may express remarks on this matter during the Budget debate or on the Estimates has nothing to do with the fact that theAsian Development Bank Bill is part of the overall aid program. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not prevented from alluding frequently, as you have requested me to do, to the assistance we are granting under this Bill and how it relates to other aid programs.I am most grateful for that. When one listens to the people who hold themselves out as espousing the cause of the international brotherhood of socialists, one would think that the benevolence that exuded from the policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in 1972 would have been transmitted into action. But in fact, the amount fell below that which the previous Government funded for developing countries overseas. It is right and proper that under this legislation we should be making the contribution for which we gave undertakings. We are executing those undertakings. This aid has to be looked at not merely as a contribution through the Asian Development Bank but also as part of our aid program. It is true that this measure comes in as a Treasury Bill but the Government also claims it as part of its aid program, so the fact that the Treasurer and not the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this House, introduces this measure, does not detract from Australias aid program. I compliment the Government for executing its duty to the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank by introducing this Bill, but I draw the valid point that Australias aid contributions fell below the amount allocated in the Budget. Any person who took an interest in aid programs over the last 6 months would know that the Government has been shovelling money out like a man with a dozen arms trying to get up to the amount that was allocated. Even then the Government could not do it. But at least in this Bill the Government is meeting the contribution that it undertook to make to the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank.The point I was raising, before the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) interposed with a few remarks, was that not only did aid fall below the amount allocated in the Budget last year, but also its performance in the calendar year 1973 fell below the amount allocated under the previous Liberal-Country Party Government. But the important point for people in this Parliament and those interested in aid programs to remember it is often difficult when measures such as this are brought in by a Treasurer- is. that the effectiveness of an aid program is what counts. It is not the actual amount of money that one gives, it is where that money goes. So although we are executing our duty under the Asian Development Bank, it is the way in which the money is spent which is of primary importance. I will be turning to that point in a moment.Mr RobertMcNamara, the President of the World Bank, has repeatedly given a warning. I shall cite his words, as I have done previously in this House. He said that the benefits of growth are not equitably reaching the poor, and the poor are not significantly contributing to the growth. In other words, in the poorest countries economic growth is least, population growth is fastest and the effects of escalating prices for oil and fertilisers can wipe out economic gains. As aid recipients, poor countries often fail to show improvement in living standards commensurate with the amounts they receive from donor nations. If 75 per cent of development assistance goes to only 40 per cent of the people- this is generally agreed upon- and frequently that 40 per cent is that percentage of the population which needs it least, then the purpose of aid is largely negated. The underdeveloped world faces a crisis which calls for urgent action and not lengthy deliberation by advisory councils and bureaucratic reshuffles, as we have seen to date with the working of the aid agency in this country.Any government which is using the taxpayers money, as we are doing with this measure, to assist developing countries must, regrettably, always take cognisance of political realities. One would like to divorce from political realities the need for developed countries to be able to give money to developing countries. But if a particular country, for whatever reason, were in disfavour with a majority of, for example, Australians it would be a very brave government which then sprang to its assistance with massive financial or other aid. Therefore education within the donor country is necessary. It is, after all, people and not governments that aid programs seek to assist. The needs of those people need to be fully explained if aid programs are to be pursued with the active support of most Australians. Australians also want to know how their financial or other aid is being used. They want to know whether it is getting through to the people who need it and for whom it is intended. Similarly they want to be sure that their aid is not allowing to be syphoned off to other projects funds that normally would be spent on foodstuffs, medical programs, buildings and so on. Those remarks do not relate specifically to what the Asian Development Bank is doing. Its record has been applauded by both sides of this Parliament, and ought to be.A country in our region which has a member of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank is India. It is in the context of what I have been talking about concerning community reactions that I want to mention India which, as a member nation, has a representative on the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank. It is in that context that the recent nuclear explosion by India could do much harm. India is now answerable for the further proliferation of nuclear weapons by countries which do not yet possess them. We all know that enormous sums are necessary for nuclear research. So inevitably people will start asking where India found the money and whether it would not have been better off spending those hundreds of millions of dollars to alleviate other problems.I stress that it is not for us to tell India how to run its affairs- or to tie down our aid and assistance with unacceptable conditions. On the other hand, India must realise that from a public relations point of view, if for no other reason, the recent nuclear tests make it that much harder for those of us who believe in and encourage strong aid programs to get our point of view across. It also gives extra comfort to those people- we must recognise that they exist in great numbers in every developed country- who say that aid begins at home and should end there. What is true at a government level also holds true with voluntary agencies. Thousands of Australians are actively engaged in raising money and goods for various private assistance programs. Those people depend upon the goodwill of every Australian. To a large extent that goodwill is fostered by the image that Australians have of a particular country and its needs. That image in turn is most often shaped by the media. If the media starts to question the actions of a particular country those questions soon raise doubts among the general public. It is not that the members of the general public become less generous; they simply become more selective in their generosity. I regret having to cite a country as critically as I have. I have cited India only because it is the most dramatic and recent example of a situation that affects us and could occasion some rethinking.There is no doubt in my mind that Australia is poised to play a dominant part in aid and assistance programs during the next few years. This will not be so much in the amount of assistance we give but rather in the manner in which we offer it. We must be innovative rather than reactionary. We must be flexible enough to change direction if events dictate change, yet pragmatic enough to realise that our assistance will not always be greeted with wide acclamation or even be seen to receive the recognition that it should. Our satisfaction must be in what such assistance contributes to the overall development and stability of a particular country or region. In other words- the Government could well take note of this- our play should not be to the grandstand but should be an investment in the future of the human race.It is in that spirit and in that context that we support this Bill, which seeks to provide funds to the Asian Development Fund itself. We trust that the good work of the Asian Development Bank and, through it, the Development Fund will continue. I have made these specific criticisms because I am concerned about the growing criticism in the community of that country which exploded a nuclear weapon without having due regard either to the consequences of further proliferation in other countries or to the pressures on the developed countries, such as our own, which wish to give further funds by way of aid programs but which receive criticism for doing so.","Second Reading","ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL 1974","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
225,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WENTWORTH, William Charles","DB6","Mackellar","N/A","N/A",1485,"-I have only one point to make in this debate, but I believe that it is an important one. I am amazed that it was not made earlier. Foreign aid, whether it is provided through the Asian Development Bank or anything else, has to be paid for through our foreign funds. We have, it is true, sizeable but rapidly dwindling reserves. We are now in the red to the extent of $2,000m a year in our foreign funds. Whatever aid we give has to come out of those funds. We will be giving $ 1 8m. We will be giving it really in the long run not from our own resources but from our overseas creditors  money.The Bank to which we are subscribing has as a program a contribution by member countries of US$525m. That is a small amount but there is another source of money available. The wealth situation has changed.In the foreign exchange business we of the Western world used to think of ourselves as being the rich people who are doing the giving. We are now the poor people. The wealth is now to be found in the oil countries. The oil countries, which received help previously, have some kind of relationship or consanguinity with the people who need help. The oil countries have received a windfall of an extra $30,000m a year. It is from them that the subvention should be now coming. They are the rich countries, not the poor ones. We are the poor countries in international exchange, not the rich ones. There should be a complete rethinking on this aspect. The oil countries, which have received a windfall of tens of thousands of millions of dollars a year, should be coming to the party for their cousins- we are giving it to their cousins- and they should be doing so not with a miserable US$525m but should be thinking in terms of providing ten or twenty times as much per year. They should be helping their cousins from their windfall.I say that we should be putting the hard word on the Shah of Iran when he comes to Australia and telling him that from the immense riches that have come to him through the oil windfall through the monopolistic manipulations in which he has engaged- he has a moral responsibility to find not a small amount of money, as this is, but a large amount of money for not one year but every year for the people of Asia- he is an Asian- whom it is his first responsibility to help. I support, as does my Party, this token. But I repeat that we are not really giving our own money; we are giving our creditors money because our foreign balances are dwindling and on current account we are now going into the red to the extent of $2,000m a year. We are not giving our own money. We are like, as it were, the directors of the Mainline Corporation making a tremendous gift to the arts in Australia- not giving their own money but giving their creditors money. This is what we are doing and we are making big fellows of ourselves for doing it.While this is happening there is money available. The world has changed. The old concept of the poor countries and the rich countries has changed. We have lost; they have won. They are up about $30,000m every year. While necessarily they will use a great deal of this money for the support of their own people and the raising of the living standards of their own people they owe it to the world to take a sizable slice of this and use it for raising the living standards of their own neighbours, the people for whom this Asian Development Bank was founded and whom it is trying to help. I say that next week when the Shah is in Australia we should put the hard word on him and see that the Shah realises his responsibility from his overflowing coffers now to allocate some thousands of millions of dollars every year for the support of his less fortunate Asian neighbours who do not happen to have oil.Question resolved in the affirmative.Bill read a second time.Message from the Governor-General recommending appropriation announced.","Second Reading","ASIAN DEVELOPMENT FUND BILL 1974","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

230,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PEACOCK, Andrew","MI4","Kooyong","N/A","N/A",1486,"-The Opposition is not opposing these Bills. They form part of the movement towards independence for Papua New Guinea. As I understand it, they give legislative authority to what has been existing by way of delegation from the Minister for Foreign Affairs as the authority under the appropriate legislation, who delegated his authority to the Minister for Mines in Papua New Guinea to handle off-shore mining within the area described by the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill as an adjacent area. There are 2 Bills under consideration. The first is the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill which provides for the repeal of the provisions of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act that extend to Papua New Guinea. In other words, this amending legislation exercises reference to Papua New Guinea in the Act. Having done that, the second piece of legislation- the Papua New Guinea Bill amends the principal Act by transferring to the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly the power with regard to off-shore mining. This is necessary to ensure that there is no doubt that the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly has absolute power over legislation in respect of offshore mining.I am not altogether impressed with the legislation that has been presented to the House, but I want to pose a question to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Matters Relating to Papua New Guinea (Mr Morrison). I would be grateful if the Minister would answer it. In repealing that part of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act which refers to Papua New Guinea, the amending legislation refers, of course, to the areas designated under the legislation. As I recall, the legislation arose from agreements reached between the Commonwealth and the States. If one examines the report of the Senate committee which examined this matter prior to the legislation being enacted, one finds that there is annexed to that report the agreement which was reached between the governmental bodies, State and Federal. Clause 6 of that agreement indicates that there should be no amendment without the consent of a State concernedIn this instance, Papua New Guinea and Queensland share a boundary. I speak not of the Papua New Guinea-Queensland boundary but of the areas designated in the legislation. In the legislation they are referred to as adjacent areas. As I understand it, clause 6 of the agreement provides that the State of Queensland ought to be advised of the amendments which are covered by the legislation which is before the House tonight. I would ask the Minister whether that State has been duly advised. I do so not merely because it is a term of the agreement reached between the Commonwealth and the States but also because we have at the present moment a very sensitive issue to deal with. It is not merely the .sensitive issue of the movement of Papua New Guinea towards independence but the sensitive issue of the border between Papua New Guinea and Queensland. I would not like to think that the feeling between the Commonwealth and the Government of Queensland is exacerbated in any way by this Government not advising the Queensland Government that it is taking this move. I would have thought it would have been a prudent step, whether or not it is covered by the agreement, to advise the Queensland Government. But from a formal sense it appeared to be prima facie that there was a necessity in clause 6 of the agreement to advise the Queensland Government. I would be most grateful if the Minister could advise me before he concludes his reply on this legislation whether in fact that occurred.The second matter to which I wish to refer is the speech made by a former Minister for National Development, Mr Fairbairn, who was then and is now the honourable member for Farrer. It is recorded on page 1945 of Hansard that he said on 18 October 1967 in his second reading speech on the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill 1967:While dealing with adjacent areas I should make brief mention of certain agreements which have been reached in relation to the adjacent areas of Queensland and Papua and to some small islands and their continental shelves in the Coral Sea. Prior to the commencement of these negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States, Queensland and Papua had issued adjoining exploration permits with boundaries conforming to the boundary between Queensland and Papua. These permits have been accepted by the companies in good faith and work has been going on in the areas concerned. When it became necessary to consider these boundaries from the point of view of this joint legislation it was found that the application as between Australia and Papua of the median line principle would have resulted in part of one permit and something like half of another permit which has been issued by Papua being brought under the jurisdiction of Queensland, thus resulting in a reduction of the area of continental shelf under the authority of the Territory.The Government considered that any transfer of part of these titles back to Australia- no matter how justifiable in terms of logic- might be misunderstood in Papua and New Guinea and in any case that such action would be inconsistent with the high sense of responsibility which Australia displays in working to bring this Territory towards self government.He went on to say at a later paragraph:The foregoing arrangement is, we think, a sensible one and as a result I am glad to say that both the Commonwealth and the Queensland Governments are agreed that the boundaries of the existing permits issued by Papua will be left undisturbed.There is an important principle involved here. You have a contentious boundary between Papua New Guinea and Queensland- a matter on which the Government of Papua New Guinea has expressed itself in very forcible terms, particularly individual Ministers in that Government, indicating that the boundary between Papua New Guinea and Queensland ought to be moved south. The Queensland Government must be involved constitutionally in any change to that border. The Constitution states that if borders of States are to be changed the governments of those States or the people of those States have to give agreement. If the border is to be changed they must be involved therefore under the Constitution. You have a situation here giving power to the Papua New Guinea House of Assembly over an area that is not consistent with the boundary between Papua New Guinea and Australia. It ought to be borne in mind what was agreed to in 1 967- as was said by the then Minister for National Development that there is now a variation in the capacity at law of the Papua New Guinea Government to grant permits for off-shore mining, and that the area designated for it to do so is different from the boundaries between the 2 countries. Because the Government of Queensland agreed with this area when the agreements were reached in 1967, the Opposition is not prepared to oppose the legislation.So I would like firstly to be assured that the Queensland Government has been advised that this legislation was coming into the House, and I would like to think that what had been agreed to before is in the minds of those who are concerned with the border between Papua and New Guinea and that the legislation does not place in jeopardy any of the negotiations over the border itself. I say that because the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), when he first came to office, sought unilaterally to move the border between Papua and Queensland or, as he put it, Papua New Guinea and Australia. I have pointed out that he has no constitutional right to do that, and I trust that he will not use any of this legislation as an argument against the government of Queensland. It was indicative, of course, that Queensland was agreeing to matters solely within the province of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill. So, delinquent and all as this Government has been in many areas, I would assume that it would not break the spirit of those agreements that related to specific measures covered by that Bill. I will return to that matter, though, before I conclude tonight.I have said that the Opposition does not oppose the legislation because it is part of the transition towards self government and independence. Self government, of course, was reached in Papua New Guinea on 1 December last year. The distinction between self government and independence is broadly that when an administered area reaches self government it is responsible for all the domestic legislation and control of its own affairs within its own borders at that date, but there are certain powers that devolve and remain existent in the metropolitan or controlling power- the administering authority, if you like- and that is the Government of Australia. In the broad they are in 2 areas foreign affairs and defence. But some powers were not transferred on the date of independence, and we are dealing with one of them now. I thought that we would have heard more of the negotiations between the Government of Australia and the Government of Papua New Guinea in regard to these 2 specific areas of foreign affairs and defence before any likely date of independence was announced.This Government, of course, has been accused by the Constitutional Planning Committee of Papua New Guinea of forcing the pace of independence. It is interesting that the Constitutional Planning Committee should accuse the Government of that, because it is described in the terminology of Papua New Guinea as a radical body, but it has felt that this Government has forced the pace somewhat. I do not enter into that argument at all. I think that overall the Government has responded to the wishes of Papua New Guinea, but it seems to me that it would have been wise to settle all areas prior to independence so that on independence the Papua New Guinea Government would not just in fact be governing in all areas but would be doing so at law.I am concerned at what will happen when Papua New Guinea achieves independence, whether it be April or May of next year or whatever date the Government of Papua New Guinea has in mind. I would like to feel that matters which are outside the province of the Minister for Science, who is the Minister in charge of Papua New Guinea affairs and the former Minister for External Territories, and which are primarily matters within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) will be put to us clearly and unequivocally. We have heard little from theMinister for Defence apart from frequent apologies for not being able to do other than say that negotiations are taking place. I will not develop that matter, so the Minister for Science need not take any point of order. I just wanted to flag the fact that I am concerned that for almost 20 months now I have been standing here asking for information about the defence arrangements between Papua New Guinea and Australia, and I ask for it again in the course of this debate because the Minister himself has said in his own speech that this legislation is part of the movement towards independence. I am concerned that we will reach independence and we will not know clearly what the role of Australian forces seconded to the Papuan New Guinea defence force will be.I return now to the matter I was talking about earlier, the border between Papua and Queensland. Equally, too, am I concerned that we may reach the date of independence some time next year, with our blessing, at the request of the Government of Papua New Guinea, without resolving the dispute over the border between Papua and Queensland. I have stated my own position, and I will not regurgitate that tonight. It seems to me to be totally wrong both to deny the constitutional provisions of this country and to seek to act unilaterally, to find that you are bashing your head against a brick wall because the State Government of Queensland is vested with the right of an exercise of power in this area and to do little or nothing about this matter so soon before independence. As I understand it, officials of the Commonwealth Government, the Queensland Government- I do not know about representatives of the Torres Strait Islanders, although they are Australian citizens and ought to be involved- and officials of the Papua New Guinea Government have been meeting to talk about the border. We have heard nothing from this Government about that meeting. We just hear things obliquely. I have warned previously in this Parliament that it is one of those issues that I feel, after independence, will be raised within the United Nations if the Commonwealth Government has not acted fairly in consultation with the Government of Queensland and the Government of Papua New Guinea. Perhaps the Minister could advise me on this matter.I do not want to go into the matter in great detail. The Minister himself showed respect to the House by keeping his speech relatively brief, but I have covered the matter of the agreements entered into in 1967 and the questions that arise out of the prima facie reading of clause 6 of those agreements as they apply to the State of Queensland. I have not asked the Minister for Science to give me any answers, but I have asked the Minister responsible for defence matters to advise us at some stage very shortly about defence arrangements between Australia and Papua New Guinea. This self-proclaimed party in government which is so interested in keeping white faces out of Asia and the Pacific is prepared to allow a minimum of 600 Australian servicemen to be seconded to the Papua New Guinea defence force and not even state a role for them. The Minister need not worry: I will say no more in regard to that matter. I just flag it. I have asked for some indication as to what is transpiring in negotiations on the border between Papua and Queensland. All these are relatively delicate matters and I understand that if they are the subject of negotiations at least the Minister could tell us that.. The other delicate matter is the actual transition to independence. It is delicate in the sense that no matter what country in the world is moving from an area where it is an administered power to becoming an entity internationally in its own right, there will be divergences within its community as to the timing. We can only act on the basis of the advice of the leadership group elected by the people of Papua New Guinea in this instance. Members of both sides of the House have spoken of the gradual movement towards self-government and independence. I put in the caveat tonight by indicating that the Constitutional Planning Committee itself was somewhat concerned last year about the pace that is being forced by the Commonwealth Government. I hope that the Government will not continue to force the pace and that it will respond primarily to the wishes of the Papua New Guinea Government. I would hope that this is so, but the transition to independence is at a delicate stage and it is a stage where we should be ensuring that the utmost assistance is forthcoming when it is requested from Papua New Guinea. According to the Minister, Papua New Guinea has agreed in the exchange of correspondence or by some other means to abide by the agreements on the environment and on restricting itself to the adjacent areas of Queensland and Papua New Guinea which is confined to the territorial sea and the continental shelf within the areas designated as adjacent areas. So it appears that this is, as the Minister has said, a further step on the way towards self-government and independence.I would like to be able to feel that in so responding to requests for assistance from the Government of Papua New Guinea we could do more than we actually did in the budgetary provisions last night to meet our obligations to that country. It appears to me that a fact that has been neglected is that although the largest single increase in this years aid allocation to Papua New Guinea is for employment termination and retirement benefits for Australians leaving Papua New Guinea, the amount involved is more than double the total increase in aid to Papua New Guinea. In other words, a good deal of the so-called aid to Papua New Guinea will find its way to Australia. My cursory examination of the documents revealed to me that $43m of an amount which was provided last year for a wide variety of functions that were transferred to the Papua New Guinea Government- a transfer of functions is involved in this legislation; that is why I have referred to this matter, Mr Speakerwas not required under the items for the transfer of functions and that it has not been re-allocated or that very little of it has been re-allocated to Papua New Guinea itself but has gone elsewhere. It may well be that there have been other demands. There is a desperate need throughout the world for assistance from the Australian Government. But our special responsibility at this time is to Papua New Guinea. We have placed it as a priority item in all our aid giving. It seems to me to be most unfortunate that money is being used elsewhere at a time when it is required in Papua New Guinea. I should imagine that it has been requested that additional funds be granted to Papua New Guinea. The $43m which was made available for formal requirements in the transfer of facilities last year has been spent in other parts of the world.The actual amount- the real amount- given to Papua New Guinea by the Australian Government has been exacerbated by inflation anyway, and Papua New Guinea itself has grave inflationary problems. I do not know whether the actual amount given in real terms has been reduced, but I do know that in reality its value certainly has been reduced. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) has reminded me that there will probably be a reduction in aid to Papua New Guinea, especially when the effect of inflation are taken into account. It is clear that the Australian Labor Party is in many ways paying only lip service to the expansion of aid to Papua New Guinea. If the termination and retirement benefits of Australians are excluded the amount of aid to Papua New Guinea has undoubtedly declined. That is unacceptable to me but it is in accord with Labors well known double standards in so many areas of international affairs. It seems certain that the total aid in 1974 will be again far below the Labor Governments promise of 0.7 per cent of the gross domestic product following a dismal performance in 1973, as confirmed by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.I have said and the Minister himself said in his second reading speech that this is all part of the process of gradual independence. I have qualified that to some extent by saying that bodies in Papua New Guinea have criticised the present Government for forcing the pace.

I am sure that they give the current minister the same satisfaction in response to his questions as was given when I was the responsible Minister. It is nice to see them here. I was saying that we had hoped that the process of independence would be gradual- not gradual in the sense that it necessarily would be slow but that it would be smooth and not a sudden break from one status and set of rep on sib i li ties to another, which are words that will be familiar to some in this House- so that when Papua New Guineas independence came it would signify the last step in a long process that had been taken and that a whole series of changes would not be occurring overnight. I am somewhat troubled by the way in which special committees in Papua New Guinea, particularly the Constitutional Planning Committee, have criticised that movement. I had hoped that if we had had our way the gradual movement and actual movement towards independence would contribute greatly to the post-independence period by establishing a government that was practised in governing and a government that could call on the resources, human and otherwise, that are a necessary part of an orderly and developing nation. I think the Minister in fact used words to that effect when he concluded his remarks on this piece of legislation. He said:Although the function of Papua New Guineas foreign relations is reserved to Australia, the policy of the Australian Government has been to involve fully Papua New Guinea and to exercise that function only after the fullest consultation with and advice from the Papua New Guinea Government. Consistent with this policy Australia has encouraged Papua New Guinea to take its place in the international community and one example of Papua New Guineas increasing involvement in this community was its participation in the recent Law of the Sea Conference in Caracas.That, of course, related specifically to the Bill in the sense that it would now be responsible to an area outside its own land mass. I said at the start that I was a little troubled by this legislation. I think I used the term sloppy to describe it. That may be a strong word to some. All I was doing was posing questions about adjacent areas and then moving on to other questions and perhaps the question of the Papua-Queensland border. The reason I said that it was sloppy was because my understanding of the boundary mentioned in the Schedule to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act is that the boundary is in fact inaccurate, that it was drawn in 1967 and that maps subsequent to that date which I recall having seen reveal that part of the description in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act in fact covers the land mass of Papua New Guinea.","Second Reading","PAPUA NEW GUINEA BILL 1974","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The description which is used in the Act that applies at the present moment and which we are excising by this piece of legislation is in fact a reference to a portion of the Papuan land mass. It is an extraordinary situation when one considers that we are talking about submerged land. So I should have thought that the Minister would have introduced a Bill which ensured that that area was properly designated. I am surprised that he has not done so. I can only question why he has not done so. It must be that he feels that he cannot give me an answer to the questions I have posed about the Papua-Queensland border. Perhaps he feels that things are going to be so bogged down and become part of negotiation and discussion later on that he dare not change the area. But it does seem strange to me that the Government should introduce legislation referring to an area which updated techniques have revealed does not apply solely to submerged land but in fact applies to a land mass on which people live.","Second Reading","PAPUA NEW GUINEA BILL 1974","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As a matter of fact it would fit the normal description of a land mass rather than that of submerged land, to which this Bill applies. I think the Minister would do well before the Bill goes to another place to have a look at this to see whether the description can be changed so that we are not legislating in inaccurate geographic terminology. We are supposed to be legislating with precision here, so I would hope that would be looked to.I am sorry that I have detained the House to the extent that I have but it appears to me there are inaccuracies in the boundary. They ought to be rectified. There are matters to be clarified between Papua and Queensland. They have to be rectified or Papua New Guinea clearly will take the Papua-Queensland border dispute to the United Nations. In rectifying the matter the Queensland Government will have effectively to be involved. The other matters to which I referred in the domain of the Minister of Defence I shall not raise again in this peroration. I simply hope that the Minister for Science will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Defence in the hope that this House and the people of Australia will be fully informed as to the role of Australian servicemen in that area.Subject to those caveats and those questions that I have raised this evening- hopefully they will be answered- we do not oppose the legislation as it is part of the transition towards independence which has our blessing. But we wish that this Government would be more precise in the nature of the legislation it introduces and ensure that where there are anomalies in the geographic areas it would seek to clear them up rather than bury them amongst the morass of material that is discussed between the governments of Queensland, Papua New Guinea and Australia.","Second Reading","PAPUA NEW GUINEA BILL 1974","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I well recall a debate in which from both sides of the House there were expressions of concern that correct action would be taken and that there would not be a movement towards an extension of the transfer of powers ahead of the capacity of the legislature of Papua-New Guinea to accept proper responsibility. I think that up to this point of time there has been no evidence of stresses or strains in any direction. But this measure has one rather intriguing feature about it, that is the absence of any precise reference to Queenslandthe absence of any indication of the concurrence of Queensland. Of course, the State of Queensland has sovereign rights which must be observed and acknowledged by this Parliament. Yet in the second reading speech of the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison) there is no mention whatever of this important consideration. Therefore, I support very strongly what has been said by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) which was so ably presented and which poses for the Government the responsibility of ensuring that this House is properly advised in this matter.The honourable member for Kooyong is well equipped to present the case he has presented. As a former Minister for External Territories and now shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs in this Parliament he is not only experienced but is perhaps also the most capable member of the House in matters of this kind. I submit that as members we are entitled to something which is a little more precise than what has been presented. The Minister has acknowledged this and I hope that indicates that he intends to give some further explanation. That being the case, I do not propose to take undue time or to pursue the same course as the previous speaker. Suffice it to say that an issue of this kind if cleared up now can avoid, in the long term, very difficult consequences consequences of a kind which neither this Parliament nor this nation would want to see arise in the relationship between either the Australian nation or the State of Queensland and the newly developing country of Papua-New Guinea.Every possible precaution must be taken to ensure that there is no misunderstanding or confusion and that we do not fall into the trap of passing over to some international jurisdiction the responsibility of clearing up something that ought to be cleared up here in Australia. It ought to be cleared up by this Parliament which has the prime responsibility in the matter. I hope that there will be no blemish in this legislation. We are all well aware of the controversy surrounding the off-shore jurisdiction- the controversy which has gone on for such a long time in the matter of the territorial seas and submerged lands. We do not want to see major constitutional issue develop concerning our relationship with Papua New Guinea in this matter. So whilst I support the principle and the objective of a smooth passage of the handing over of powers to Papua NewGuinea I emphasise the importance of this necessary precaution. Accordingly, I support the Bill but with that proviso and in the hope that a proper explanation will be given by the Minister and if there is any impediment at all that the matter will be returned for consideration by this House and any necessary adjustments made.","Second Reading","PAPUA NEW GUINEA BILL 1974","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It would be to state the obvious to say that it involves an area of very great contention. Regrettably the view is held outside the Parliament that those who come to Parliament come with no other motive than material profit. I speak for myself, and I hope that I speak for the members of all parties, when I say on the basis of nearly 20 years experience in this Parliament that I have apprehended no visible sign of that motive whatsoever. In point of fact, to put it in vulgar, homely language, ex-members of Parliament do not cut up well for probate. This resolution and the resolution which precedes it on the notice paper relate to the establishment of a registry of pecuniary interests of members of Parliament.

The simple truth of the matter is that it involves an area of political reflection and contemplation which should not be looked upon casually at all.I want to make my own attitude quite clear. I speak among friends, even though I speak among political antagonists. For myself I have no material accomplishment in this world of any great sense at all.

Sir Robert Menzies thought it was named after him until I pointed out there was a Ming dynasty before his. I have a strong sense of Irish optimism which, God willing, I will command until the end of my days. That is the record I have.If any person were to ask me what was the greatest thing that I command, I would say the fact that I hold a seat in the House of Representatives in Canberra where I can speak without fear or favour and where my arguments can be treated with contempt, ignore or, occasionally, with acceptance. That to me- materially speaking, even though it is a difficult notion to understand is the thing that I regard with the greatest sense of pride. I should explain that I am a trustee for some friends and for my family- I think it is five hundred or six hundred shares in Kathleen Investments. That is the lot. I do not think, to the best of my recollection, there is anything else at all. What is involved when members of Parliament are asked to disclose their pecuniary interests? It predicates, I suggest, that members of Parliament are in some way essentially different from the main stream of society. With very great respect to my friends on both sides of the House who may take a view mildly different from mine, that is simply not true. If we reach, in the Anglo-Saxon tradition, the stage where members of Parliament are treated with such contempt that they seek to enter Parliament for no other reason than to serve themselves, Parliament has had its day.I am reminded, not merely when I am down in the dumps but when I seek to be exhilarated, of one whose works I turn to constantly- Edmund Burke. He says it is a very shallow notion that people seek to serve in Parliament for no other motive than parliamentary perk and pension. In the nearly 20 years that I have been here I have seen a great number of people on both sides of politics who have sought to give of their intellectual, nervous and physical efforts and resources what they understood to be in the interests of the Parliament. Now, to come to our mut tons, as it were. These 2 motions seek to set up a registry. The first one seeks to approve of the registry that members of Parliament should declare what their pecuniary interests are. I want to invite my friends on both sides of the House to contemplate what is meant by a pecuniary interest. Honourable members should not think this is a matter of shallow academic contemplation, because it is not. The truth of the matter is that the Strauss Committee in the United Kingdom in 1969-1 shall refer to the Committee s report in a few moments- took the view that the definition of a pecuniary interest was one which was utterly elusive. If honourable members say that the Committees report was that it was elusive, it should be ignored and they should take the more pragmatic attitude. The United States of America, I think in the same year, set up registers both for members and candidates for both Houses of the Congress. They have run into nothing else but trouble ever since.The point I want to put to the Parliament is a very short one. If we have people disposed towards dishonour, no collection of registries will contain them. If we have a person who comes in on either side of the Parliament and says: I am going to take the opportunity of my place in this Parliament to garner to myself the material accomplishments that I may see before me, no set of registries will serve as a halter to that form of enterprise. This is a matter of very great antiquity to those who walk in the Anglo-Saxon tradition of parliamentary association. It was in 1811 that Mr Speaker Abbott in the House of Commons laid down that no person who had a pecuniary interest should vote upon any matter and any person who had a pecuniary interest should declare it to the House in which he speaks. Mr Speaker Cope, it is 100-odd years since this took place. That ruling of Mr Speaker Abbott has not been greatly disturbed at all. It has been reflected upon. It has been added to. It has never been disturbed.In 1969 the mother of Parliament, the House of Commons, set up a committee to look at this very precise question. It was not a committee composed of what one might describe, with great respect, as parliamentary acolytes. It was composed of members of the House of Commons with very considerable parliamentary experience. For example it was presided over by Mr Strauss himself. Those who have known him would hesitate to describe him as being a man of milk and water political conviction. He held tenaciously to the views that he expounded on behalf of his Party. Other members who served on the Committee- a few of them I have had the very great privilege of having known- were Patrick Gordon Walker, Sir Derek WalkerSmith and Sir John Vaughan-Morgan. These were people who had a feel for parliament, an instinct for parliament. They concluded that the notion of a registry would not meet the outstanding concern of members of the public that there was something awry with parliament. Their report- if I may describe it as being the Strauss report- is a very closely reasoned report. If I may, without impertinence, I would commend it to all members of Parliament before we adopt a definitive attitude to this. It is a very closely reasoned report.Five years later, in May of this year, the House of Commons turned to the Strauss Committees report in one way or another and voted for the establishment of a registry. Immediately after having done that- predictably, I suppose one might say- members of the House of Commons voted for the establishment of a select committee to find out how the registry should operate. What I seek to do on behalf of the Opposition is to invite the House in its corporate sense to agree to the proposition that we should have first of all in Australia a Strauss style committee. There are too many people on the Government side of the Parliament who know my weaknesses. I do not seek to disguise them. I do not seek to explain them. But I do have a great feeling for Parliament as an institution. What I have the deepest anxiety for is to see explained in this country the position of members of Parliament and the fact that those who come to Parliament have no intemperate anxiety to profit in material sense, that they come to Parliament with a gentle sense of pride and with a firm sense of determination to try to profit the country. Therefore, in respect of this motion, I move:In paragraph 1, omit on the arrangements to be made, substitute whether arrangements should be made.I invite my friends and I invite the House to acknowledge what this amendment involves. There will be a committee of inquiry. The maximum opportunity will be given to all members of Parliament and to all members of the public to put before that committee their views. There will be an opportunity also to give to the Parliament and to the country the fact that those who sit here do not take the narrow, pinched, constrained, impoverished view that Parliament is composed of rogues.","Proposed Joint Committee","PECUNIARY INTEREST OF MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

260,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"JENKINS, Harry","DRW","Scullin","N/A","N/A",1495,"-I wish to speak only briefly to this motion. With regard to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen), I find myself, probably in common with some other honourable members, in some confusion as to how to consider the amendment. The amendment in itself may have been better dealt with by considering Order of the Day No. 7, consideration of which has been postponed. I cannot very well debate the subject matter of that motion. I think the honourable member for Moreton would admit that there is some room for argument and discussion as to which motion could have been taken first and whether what he seeks to attain might not have been better dealt with in a consideration of the postponed motion dealing with the pecuniary interest of members of the House of Representatives.I believe that the honourable member for Moreton has commented fairly on some of these matters. My own experience in investigating these sorts of aspects occurred with the Statute Law Revision Committee of the Victorian Parliament when the matter before that Committee concerned the pecuniary interests of local government councillors. Admittedly the position of a local government councillor is not a salaried one. But traditionally, I think in all States of Australia, a requirement exists for the declaration of pecuniary interests when matters affecting such pecuniary interests arise at local government level. So it has been that there have been variations in what has been put forward over the years.If I recall correctly, at one stage in New South Wales aldermen or councillors were required to register their pecuniary interests with the town clerks of their municipalities. It may not have been a requirement but it was the tradition that was certainly followed by the Sydney City Council to protect those aldermen from speaking on issues in which they had unwittingly a pecuniary interest and so risked disqualification. I can agree with the honourable member for Moreton that one of the important aspects is the classes of pecuniary interest that should be put forward. With some humour, the honourable member mentioned his pekingese.","Proposed Joint Committee","PECUNIARY INTEREST OF MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

262,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"JENKINS, Harry","DRW","N/A","N/A","N/A",1496,"-I must admit that my material assets are somewhat less even than the honourable members. My prize is a budgerigar. But the classes of pecuniary interest must very carefully be considered. For instance, in a rural local government area there may be only one hardware merchant for miles around. The municipality may have to purchase its supplies of nails or shovels from that merchant, for convenience sake. That merchant would be precluded in those circumstances from taking part in local government because of his pecuniary interest. The same sort of situation could apply at both Federal and State levels. These classes will need to be spelt out. This motion provides the opportunity for classification of the types of pecuniary interest. How registrations should be completed is also an aspect that allows a great deal of investigation and variability. Other questions which arise include: How is the register to be maintained? To whom is it available? What details are included?One other matter- I do not think the honourable member for Moreton mentioned this- concerns what classes of persons, if any, other than members of Parliament, ought to be required to register? That is a fairly wide category to consider. It could be seen to apply to the immediate families of members. In local government, where at times there have been members who have not quite shown that desire to serve their community, the tendency has been to shift assets and to have them appear under other names and only investigations of the direct or indirect family have shown them up. I do not wish to push that point too hard,, but it is a consideration that would have to come before such a committee. It is something to which the House must give consideration.I do not want to enlarge on what the honourable member for Moreton has said about the situation in the United Kingdom. He mentioned a ruling there 100 years ago of a former Speaker. He has referred to the Strauss Committee which has studied this matter. Other countries have looked at it in the same fashion. I have no doubt that recently many honourable members have read of the nomination for Vice-President of the United States of America of Nelson Rockefeller and of the sorts of requirements that exist there for the examination of his pecuniary interests.","Proposed Joint Committee","PECUNIARY INTEREST OF MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There are circumstances in which doubts exist whether people may have been influenced. There was an occasion in Victoria: The Minister in charge of one authority was also a substantial shareholder in a company that supplied drink machines at suburban railway stations. Whether that was a proper and ethical parliamentary practice was open to some question. I did not want particularly to mention that type of thing. The Minister for Health (Dr Everingham) mentioned another incident in his State. I do not particularly want to spell them out at this stage, but I think we have to admit that the possibility exists and we ought to look at it and think about it. I have no doubt that the great majority take the attitude that they are here to serve their electorate, but we have seen one very vital incident recently of a very prominent politician who reached one of the highest positions that is politically possible in the world today and who completely and unethically and immorally sold the principles of his country down the drain. I do not think we can disregard that sort of thing going on.I support the concept of having a committee. I have some sympathy with the thoughts put forward by the honourable member for Moreton. I just wonder whether his suggestions might not have been better applied to the other resolution which preceded this one, but that is a matter for his judgment I do urge the House not to let discussion and examination of this matter go by the board.","Proposed Joint Committee","PECUNIARY INTEREST OF MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It violates a very basic principle that I regard as being of paramount importance, the basic principle of human rights, of personal freedom, the right of the individual to privacy in personal matters. Just because a person chooses to serve his community by becoming a member of this Parliament, it should not deny him as an individual the right to personal privacy. If that principle is violated in regard to politicians, where does it end? If members of Parliament are to be subjected to this form of public scrutiny, then why not the judiciary? Or are they men of honour and members of Parliament men without honour? Why not public servants? Surely they would need to be publicly scrutinised if this were necessary for members of Parliament. It could be that they had a pecuniary interest or a vested interest in policy advice, in policy administration, and indeed in their dealings with the public. Why not the personal staff of Ministers, of members of Parliament? Why not doctors? Who is to say that a surgeon may not have a pecuniary interest in the life of a patient? Why not trade union officials? As the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Bryant) said, why not journalists? Why not have those who sit in the gallery above this Parliament subjected to the same sort of inquiry? Let us go a little further. Why not the man in the street? Why not every person in the community? Why not index every man, woman and child so that we can put a tab on everybody? Why not earmark our population as we earmark sheep so that we can put them into their grades, into their yards, where we can scrutinise and label them?","Proposed Joint Committee","PECUNIARY INTEREST OF MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I see this move as a first step towards intruding upon the personal lives of people. If the move is one to establish a register, to acknowledge and record the shareholdings of members of Parliament in public companies then I would not be opposed to it in principle. After all, this information is available if you take the time to collect it. It would perhaps be easier for those who wish to know which members of Parliament have an interest in public companies if there were a separate register, but this goes much deeper than that. If pursued it will lead ultimately to the enforcement of the disclosure of private and personal assets and liabilities of a private member, of his wife, of his family. I say sincerely that if the Government is serious and sincere why does it not apply its own medicine to its Ministers, who are the policy decision makers? Why apply this to the private members of this Parliament who play no real part in policy decisions? Perhaps they assist in policy formulation but they are not the decision makers. Surely that is not necessary. As the honourable member for Moreton said, surely there is honour among the men and women who serve in this Parliament. Surely it is not necessary to destroy an important human principle that is essential to a free and democratic society. We are a Common Law country enjoying a system that has evolved over centuries, a system that protects the individual, a system that provides for those who violate the law or abuse their power or their privileges. Why is it necessary to assume that those who sit in this place are not honourable members, are a bunch of rogues, are men who cannot be trusted. What an indictment, that men should need to have their confidential private financial affairs disclosed to public scrutiny. I see it as an infringement upon the privacy of the individual, although that individual may happen to serve his community as a member of this Parliament.I find it repugnant that we should be asked to contemplate a system that enables, indeed invites, the public to gaze into the hitherto confidential area of an individuals life so that the public may know how much he owes on his ouse or his car, so that the public may know how much he owes his brother, so that the public may know how much jewellery his wife has. I see it as a threat to individual freedom. As I said before, how long will it be before it ultimately spreads from the Parliament throughout society? How long will it be before we will have to disclose our bedroom secrets to the Clerk of the House so that he can make the information available to the public.","Proposed Joint Committee","PECUNIARY INTEREST OF MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Perhaps it is that sort of cynicism that has developed this approach to the honour that should live among us here. I do not oppose the principle of a parliamentary committee being set up to inquire into this matter, but I do oppose the contention that such disclosure should be an accepted practice. The honourable member for Moreton referred to the report of a committee of the House of Commons which was inquiring into a similar idea. Paragraph 78 of that report, at page 24, states:For all these reasons Your Committee are unable to recommend any form of register of Members private interests. In so doing they have not relied on legalistic or technical objections- though it would be possible to list even more than were given in evidence. Their objections are ones of principle. Witnesses favouring a register agreed that there are bound to be loopholes in every scheme and evasions in the spirit and in the letter, but contended that this is no excuse for not tackling the problem. Your Committee believe that the real choice is either to establish a cumbrous inquisitional machinery which is likely to be evaded by the few Members it is designed to enmesh or to improve and extend the traditional practices of the House.I think that quotation sums it up, because if a man were roguish enough there would be no committee or no system that would enmesh him. All this principle would serve to do would be to create a precedent where the freedom of the individual and the privacy of the individual could become a matter of public property.","Proposed Joint Committee","PECUNIARY INTEREST OF MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins), on the Ministers side of the House, outlined the difficulties of this exercise yet the Government sets out to pre-empt this proposed committee. I believe- I speak for myself and for a great many other members from this side- that there ought to be a register of members interests. However this whole exercise has been proposed in such a way that there is little option but to oppose the motions as they stand. The first motion contains the words communications which a member might have with other members. How wide and how vague these words are. It refers also to a members communications with servants of the Crown. Could this relate to every Post Office employee? There is reference to indirect interests. Surely that expression needs denning. It refers to interests of whatever nature. Is that not ridiculously broad?The motion refers to interests that a member may have had. Do honourable members really believe that anyone is competent to research his affairs back far enough to ascertain any interests that he may have had but which he does not have now or which he may have in the future? The Government has set up this exercise in such a way that there is little option but to oppose the motion. Those of us who would support a register of members interests must oppose the motion as it stands. However I would support it in its proposed amended form because then there would be a committee competent to make investigations and perhaps put some workable proposal before the House.I have had enough experience of the Australian Labor Party to know the way its propaganda runs and it is not difficult to see why this exercise has been set up in this manner. It is to deny us the opportunity to support the idea of a register. I personally support the idea of a register because among other things it would limit the opportunity for accusation that a member of Parliament was unduly influenced by his pecuniary interests. It would be easy to establish at least what are some of the more obvious pecuniary interests. We have opted for public life. It does not offend me that details of assets should be known to the public. I entered public life and accept this fact. However, it was not the intention that this should be the case when the Government proposed these motions.It is necessary not only that a member be above suspicion in these matters but also that he be seen to be above suspicion. It is necessary to know, when a member does have an interest, what effect that interest should have upon the members rights, privileges and obligations. For instance, is he to be debarred from speaking? Is he to be debarred from voting? Is it sufficient that his vote and his voice be judged in the light of the public knowledge and the knowledge of other honourable members that he has such an interest? These are the sorts of questions that the proposed committee must report upon and until we have the findings of the committee we are not competent to judge. I put it that the Government is not serious in this matter and it wants to see the motion opposed.","Proposed Joint Committee","PECUNIARY INTEREST OF MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
275,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ADERMANN, Evan","ID4","Fisher","N/A","N/A",1498,"-This, for me, is a rather academic exercise because I have only one job and only one salary. I have no other property deriving other income. I also have a tolerant bank manager but I do not have a pekingese or a budgerigar. I am pleased that the Government has permitted order of the day No. 8 to precede debate on order of the day No. 7 because it should do so. I am pleased also that the amendment has been moved because I think it is necessary. The crux of the whole question is whether arrangements should be made. I do not oppose the setting up of a committee. I do not oppose that committee investigating whether it would necessarily make us more honest or more fit to represent people in this place if we made such revelations as it feels it might be wise for us to make.For order of the day No. 7 to have preceded this order of the day, I think, would have been a travesty of justice because I think the contents of that order of the day should come as a result of a committee report. I think we should know and have the benefit of the deliberations of a committee concerning what are pecuniary interests, what ought to be revealed, just how available that information ought to be and whether consideration should be given to persons other than members of Parliament, because this principle could be taken further and could be applied to those who handle the affairs of people and who could probably be in a position similar to that of members of Parliament. It could apply to members of the judiciary, to public servants and to municipal and shire councillors. It could apply to a whole range of people. The proposed committee should consider these aspects.Paragraph (a) of order of the day No. 7 should be more specific. It talks about pecuniary interests, direct or indirect, that a member may have had, may have or may be expecting to have. Naturally I cannot accept that proposal in its present form. However I can accept order of the day No. 8 as it is proposed to be amended. I can accept that a committee be set up to look into all aspects of this matter including whether there ought to be a register, what form that register should take and what it is necessary to record in that register. We need to know the purpose of that register. I think this is the correct order of tilings. I hope that the Government will accept the amendment and I hope that it will see that this matter ought to precede Order of the Day No. 8.I disagree with the point of view expressed by the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins) in this regard. I want to know, for instance, what information ought to be available to the public, as well as in what circumstances and for what purposes it should be made available. Details of holdings in public companies are available to the public now. If one goes to the proper place and one pays ones $1 one can obtain details of all the shareholdings in every public company. Information in relation to land dealings is also available now to any person who goes to the right place and pays the fee. I can readily understand, for instance, why a Prime Minister from either side of politics might require to know the holdings in various companies and the various interests of his Ministers. I would think that is the practice in most parliaments and in most governments. If that practice is to be widened let us set up a committee to find out how it should be widened and exactly what ought to be put in such a register.I believe that when we enter this place we lose our privacy to a degree. When a person becomes a member of this Parliament he has very little private life. That is not a complaint at all; that is something that we expect and we accept. But I think we ought to have some rights of privacy. Therefore, if the proposed committee were to look at this matter responsibly it would come to the Parliament and say: These are the reasons that we think these things ought to be registered and ought to be made available. This is the nature of the thing. This is how it should be presented and this is how it should be made available and these are the people to whom it should be made available. If that is done we will have things in their proper order. I think the Government would find that it would receive the cooperation of this side of the House if things were done in that order.I appeal to the Government to consider that aspect, because in that context Order of the Day No. 7 is out of place. We are presuming something about which we have no evidence, no advice and in relation to which we have conducted no investigation. We would be setting up a committee more or less for the purpose of filling in the names at the top of the columns, because that is the order in which these matters appear on the notice paper.I do not want to take a lot of time but I do think this matter is so very important. I hope the amendment will be accepted because we ought not to presuppose things in the way in which Order of the Day No. 8 does. Order of the Day No. 8 reads:I ) That a Joint Committee be appointed to inquire into and report on the arrangements to be made . . .I think that Committee ought to report whether arrangements should be made and then give us the nature of the arrangements that it recommends. Then we can have a look at the deliberations of that Committee. We find that such committees of the Parliament are an asset to the Parliament. We find that parliamentary committees achieve very much on a non-partisan basis. We find that committees are very rarely divided on political lines. We find that the deliberations which take place at such committees result in the enrichment of the legislation that comes out of this Parliament. I think we want this legislation, but we want good legislation. If we want legislation which will be fair to the men who come to this place to represent the people, this is the way to do it. Therefore I support the amendment and ask that the Government give consideration to taking the course of action suggested.","Proposed Joint Committee","PECUNIARY INTEREST OF MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
276,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ELLICOTT, Bob","YF6","Wentworth","N/A","N/A",1500,"-The matter under consideration is a very basic one, and it is one that raises a very important aspect of parliamentary procedure. For that reason it should be approached in a bipartisan manner and in a way which will lead to the question of pecuniary interest being dealt with in all its aspects. I would suggest to honourable members opposite that there is a deep need to go into the question on a broad ranging inquiry. For that reason I support very strongly the amendment proposed. We need to get this matter into perspective because as you will be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have a standing order which deals with this matter. If I might remind honourable members of what it says, standing order 1 96 reads:No member shall be entitled to vote in any division upon a question (not being a matter of public policy) in which he has a direct pecuniary interest not held in common with the rest of the subjects of the Crown. The vote of a member may not be challenged except on a substantive motion moved immediately after the division is completed, and the vote of a member determined to be so interested shall be disallowed.I have not checked this, but no doubt that standing order has been in the Standing Orders since the Standing Orders of this Parliament came into existence. Of course, that standing order puts into words the ruling of Speaker Abbott, to which the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) referred. That ruling was expressed in 1811. It appears therefore that we do have a ruling. I would imagine that if the Clerk of the House was consulted he could tell honourable members that it may have been invoked occasionally, but not very often, since this House first met. Indeed, that appears to have been the experience in the United Kingdom. On page 5 of the Strauss report the Clerk of the House of Commons gave some evidence. In paragraph 16 he said:Mr SpeakerAbbotts ruling has been at once so comprehensive and so well observed that there is only a single recorded instance of the votes of members on a public matter being disallowed- namely, in 1 892 on a motion for a grant in aid in connection with a projected East African railway.That evidence was given in 1969 but it does tell us that this is not a matter which often arises. It is also a matter which can be considered coolly. It is a matter that ought to be considered on a bipartisan basis and on a broad basis. The terms of reference of the Strauss Committee were simply these:To consider the rules and practices of the House in relation to the declaration of members interests and to report thereon.They are very broad terms, yet they led to a statement of view that there ought not to be a register. Whether there ought to be a register and the problems that can arise in relation to it have to some extent been ventilated by honourable members who have preceded me in the debate, and I do not propose to go into them at any length. However, one does need to ask the question: Is there really any need to define the meaning of pecuniary interest? Indeed, is it desirable? The view that the Strauss Committee expressed was that under English parliamentary practice it was better that the phrase should remain undefined. Of course, this has been the practice of the common law, and it has been a practice which has been found apposite to those of us who practise the common law because we know that a broad phrase like that is capable of being applied to instances as they arise. If one starts to define such a phrase the danger is that instead of being broad it will be restricted. Indeed, the question does arise whether standing order 196 in itself is not an appropriate standing order to retain and whether it does not do justice to the problem of pecuniary interest. We on this side of the House, of course, support a broad ranging inquiry. I would urge on the Special Minister of State the willingness to co-operate that has been expressed in this debate. I would urge on him the desirability of either accepting our amendment or, if he finds it difficult to accept it at the moment, of adjourning this debate so that the matter could be considered by the other side of the House.There have been inquiries in other places. There has been an inquiry in Victoria and an inquiry in Canada. All sorts of matters arise once this question is examined. Let me read to the House the principles, the guidelines that were expressed in the Green Paper that was presented to the House of Commons in Canada. The principles may indicate to honourable members on both sides of the House the need for a wide ranging inquiry in order to deal with this matter properly. The Green Paper states:A Member of Parliament is a trustee of public confidence and must perform and appear to perform his duties in a manner reflecting the highest degree of concern for the public interest. Moreover, a Member of Parliament must at all times ensure that his actions do not detract from the dignity of Parliament, and the respect and confidence which society places in it.That is a very basic principle, and so far as I am concerned it is one that always has been observed by members of this Parliament. The Green Paper further states:Members of Parliament should make every reasonable effort to avoid even the appearance of those conflicts of interest that are not inherent in a representative democracy.Where possible, the rules on conflict of interest should be formulated so as not to restrict unduly candidacy for the Canadian House of Commons or unnecessarily prevent any group in society from holding membership in the House of Commons or Senate.That is a very important principle, as well. One needs to consider the effect that restrictive rules on declaration of interest may indeed have on possible candidates. The Green Paper continues:The rules on conflict of interest should attempt to provide the public with that information which is relevant to the question of conflict of interest while safeguarding the individual Members right to privacy regarding information which the public does not require.The honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) has quite rightly referred to the question of privacy and human rights. It is a matter of considerable importance that the privacy of members of Parliament be preserved. Every one of us is subjected to public scrutiny in one way or another and indeed it is proper that we should be, but at the same time we are entitled to live our private lives and there ought to be a balance between public interest in disclosure and the right of privacy of the individual to which every member of Parliament ought to be entitled, consistent with his duty to the public. A committee properly appointed with broad terms of reference would be able to consider that matter over a period and reflect upon it. The Green Paper goes on:The right of members of the public to equal access and impartial treatment by government officials should be respected at all times.The rules on conflict of interest of Members of Parliament should assume the form most appropriate to their application and to the general problem area. Those rules which are capable of precise definition and which can, therefore, be objectively tested should usually be set out in legislation. Those rules which can only be stated in subjective language, and must rely for their application on the individual circumstances of each situation, should be set out in a less formal manner.There lies a very important matter because, if it is to be dealt with, it may require legislation. That may be the constitutional view which is taken that if a register is to be set up it has to become the subject of legislation. Of course if one is to consider legislation then one has to consider the form it is to take, the breadth of it and the narrowness of it and the need to take into account the matters that the Canadian Green Paper expresses in rule 6. The Green Paper continues:The public should be granted a limited avenue to initiate investigations into apparent violations of the statutory provisions regarding conflicts of interest.Through a process of continuing review Parliament should ensure that the legislation and the rules governing conflict of interest are relevant to changing situations.So in the Canadian Green Paper, 8 rules are set out which indicate that this is a matter which requires a broad approach. The Strauss report in England indicates it, and we on this side of the House would strongly urge honourable members opposite to accept the amendment. If they cannot accept it tonight, would they please consider adjourning this debate so that they can consider what we on this side of the House have put to them in our speeches tonight.","Proposed Joint Committee","PECUNIARY INTEREST OF MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
277,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GILES, Geoffrey","KB8","Angas","N/A","N/A",1501,"-Having heard the speech by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott), I can only say that I regret having to follow immediately after him in this debate. I entirely concur with the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for Wentworth, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) and the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen). However, I think there are two rather more pragmatic matters that the House would do well to consider. The first one I wish to mention is the matter of elections and the second is the selection of candidates. Let me deal with the first point. Depending on the findings that the committee of inquiry hands down and how this House accepts those findings, there could arise a ludicrous situation which would be against the democratic process. I use for the purpose of example the honourable member for Scullin (Dr Jenkins). I know he is a doctor. I know that he is a learned man who won his way through educational institutions on scholarships. I know that he is a sincere member of Parliament. I do not know whether he has had time in his rather brilliant career to cam funds that he can salt away. This is the honourable members prerogative and not mine to inquire into. Say, for the sake of an example, that he had been so brilliant in his particular sphere and had worked so hard that he had salted away a property in the Dandenongs. When he stands for election as a member of Parliament, as part of the democratic process, this man can be blackguarded and pilloried by mean minded candidates who happen to be standing against him. This is not a process that would help democracy. This would be totally unfair to many members of this Parliament who have had the capacity to achieve something in the community. I remind the House that there are severe disadvantages that I hope any committee of inquiry will be quick to pick up. These disadvantages would react against the democratic process and against the capacity of the democratic machine of all major political parties to nominate candidates for election to Parliament. I do not believe that the Australian nation would be served by too blatant a description of assets. Such a description would work to the disadvantage of the current system.Let us look at the candidates themselves. I do not think that it is any secret that all the major political parties in this House try frantically from one year to the next to find the best candidates they can to contest seats for them. I do not think that any political party in this House is always satisfied with the quality of the candidates that it can find to contest seats for it. There is a crying need in this nation for better candidates, no matter which party one is thinking of. Does the House seriously think that the process of finding good quality candidates will be improved by the thought that any man who deigns to stand for preselection for a political party will be subject to undue inquiry into his privacy? Does it think that that would serve the path of democracy properly for the future of this nation? I think that those are just 2 matters that we would do well to consider in an entirely pragmatic and commonsense fashion.We on this side of the House do not object to a properly constituted committee of inquiry examining this matter. I think that it needs some research. But I would consider it my duty to my electorate to point to the 2 aspects- I think they have been properly taken- of whether the community and the nation at large would be properly served by denying to members of parliament the privacy that the community today wishes to retain in so many areas. Those 2 points are of much concern to me. I agree entirely with the 3 very good speeches on this matter that I have heard from this side of the House. I support the amendment. I have every confidence that a committee of inquiry would come to proper conclusions in relation to this matter.","Proposed Joint Committee","PECUNIARY INTEREST OF MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
278,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MACKELLAR, Michael","0I4","Warringah","N/A","N/A",1502,"-As honourable members on both sides of the House have said tonight, this is a most important matter. I think it is of additional importance in this time of turbulence in the Australian community, particularly as it pertains to the standing of politicians, whether they be at a federal, State or local government level. It disturbs me that there should be such an attitude towards politicians and it disturbs me that this proposition in fact gives some indication of a feeling of concern towards the propriety of politicians. It seems to me that this, coming from the proposition that has been put before us, will seek to demonstrate that there is a degree of malpractice within the ranks of the membership of the Federal Parliament and that this course of events will discover it, or that there is malpractice and that this may stop it.I believe that members of the Federal Parliament have shown themselves over the many years in which the Federal Parliament has been in existence to have a very fine record in respect of allegations of malpractice. I think that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) stated the position very clearly when he said that people who become members of this House do not do so for pecuniary gain but do so through a deep sense of commitment, no matter to which Party they belong. I agree with those honourable members on this side of the House who have suggested that if people do not come into this House with this sense of commitment and if people are not of the honourable nature that we believe all members of Parliament should be, no amount of legislation will stop their malpractices. I believe that what we are seeking to do is to bring about a situation in which, if one can slightly expand the expression, justice can not only be done but also be seen to be done.I believe that honourable members on this side of the House are fully in agreement that some form of investigation should lay down some directions on whether a register should or should not be instituted. We believe that it is wrong to lay down a set of criteria and then form a committee to investigate them. I, along with other honourable members on this side of the House, sincerely ask the Government to look very closely at the form of the amendment and, if it cannot accept the amendment in the form presented tonight, at least to adjourn the matter so that it can come forward again for discussion. Matters of great substance are involved, including the privacy of members of Parliament, the need to think very deeply about the form that any proposed legislation should take, the question of how far the register should go if it is instituted and whether it should stop at just members of Parliament or should be extended to the judiciary, members of unions or wherever. I believe that this is a matter of great moment. I do not believe that it should be hurried through the Parliament. I believe very strongly that it is worth while considering it in great detail, in great depth and with some consideration. I sincerely ask the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen), who is sitting at the table, if he cannot agree with the amendment moved by the Opposition at least to adjourn further discussion of this matter until the suggestions have been deeply canvassed.","Proposed Joint Committee","PECUNIARY INTEREST OF MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
279,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BOWEN, Lionel","ZE4","Kingsford Smith","ALP","N/A",1503,"- I wish to speak to the amendment, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank honourable members for their contribution to the debate. I want to make clear the position as seen by the Government. The Government believes that honourable members should disclose their pecuniary interests. That is the purpose of the proposition in relation to which further discussion has been stood over, that is, Order of the Day No. 7. It is felt, firstly, that the principle that such interests should be disclosed ought to be clearly understood. The idea behind Order of the Day No. 8, which it has been agreed should be debated first, is to have ascertained by a proposed joint committee how and in what manner pecuniary interests should be disclosed and by what people.The contribution to the debate by honourable members opposite has ranged from those who have been quite friendly to those who have been quite vicious on the basis that the Government has some ulterior motive for seeking the disclosure of such interests. That is not the position at all. I can well understand the impecuniosity of my good friend the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen). In fact, I am wondering whether he is close to bankruptcy and we will lose him altogether. I have welcomed the debate tonight. Everybody who has made a contribution to it has seemed not to have any assets. I can understand that. The only exception I took to the contributions to the debate was to that by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Hyde), who is a new member of this Parliament. He said that he thought this was a political manoeuvre. It is not. If he wants to hang onto his seat he should be anxious about ensuring that this proposition is carried because, if it is not, his opponent could be prone to say that he was frightened about disclosing his interests. That is a well known tactic which is used to defeat a politician.","Proposed Joint Committee","PECUNIARY INTEREST OF MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

281,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BOWEN, Lionel","ZE4","N/A","N/A","N/A",1503,"-I listened to what the honourable member said. He said that it was a political opportunist action on behalf of the Government. To that extent I object to what he said. We wish to make it clear, as is set out in the proposition, that pecuniary interests are disclosed as a must. Let me make it clear that we are not seeking to get honourable members to do anything that they are not already obliged to do.We are now obliged to do it. That is the law. So no umbrage should be taken to the proposition contained in Order of the Day No. 7, even though my good friend the honourable member for Moreton felt that he wanted to deal with Order of the Day No. 8 first.I want to make it clear that this matter was discussed in the House of Commons and there was a lot of doubt and uncertainty as to how best to interpret pecuniary interest. It had difficulty in doing so but it did arrive at the conclusion that it should be disclosed. It said that if it was relevant in one s mind one should make such a disclosure. That is what Order of the Day No. 7 says and that is what standing order 1 96 says. Let me refer to section 44 of the Constitution, which is what should be looked at. It states that any honourable member will lose his seat if he has a direct or indirect pecuniary interest. That is laid down in the Constitution brought down by our forefathers. If a member does not disclose such interests he will be subject to a daily penalty which would certainly send him bankrupt. The whole issue is whether in the past it was thought there had to be something called a direct or indirect pecuniary interest. It is very difficult and perhaps almost impossible to define. Nevertheless, it was felt that it ought to be disclosed. Obviously the onus is on the individual to do it and there should be no objection to anybody doing it.In the course of a reasonable debate the objection may then follow as to whether one should disclose the whole of ones private assets and whether they would be blazoned over every newspaper, as they probably would be. My good friend from Moreton referred to probate. Of course ones assets are disclosed then for everybody to see, but at that stage one has passed on and is not worried. But they are disclosed. If one is ever in the witness box and my friend the honourable member for Moreton is cross-examining he might ask one to disclose all ones assets and they also would be printed. But we are not going into that detail except in relation to the very valid point as to why only members of Parliament must be involved in such a requirement. Perhaps it should cover a wide number of people. Perhaps there are many people who have held office in the Public Service who have gone out to take directorships in private companies. One would be anxious to know whether there was some earlier motivation for that sort of action.I do not want to delay the House but we are concerned with the part of the amendment which proposes that the words be altered to say whether any arrangements should be made instead of reporting on the arrangements that would have been involved in the passage of Order of the Day No. 7. If the committee reports that no arrangements are to be made nothing will be done by way of disclosure. But in fairness to the honourable member for Moreton and in the interests of this Parliament- I respect all members and I know that it is a very honest Parliament and the only criticism comes from people who are not really involved with members or do not know enough about them and how they work- the real issue is whether we are to accept an amendment which would mean the defeat of the principle in Order of the Day No. 7. 1 would reject such an amendment. But I have an understanding and perhaps an undertaking from my honourable friend that Order of the Day No. 7 can remain on the paper and be debated.","Proposed Joint Committee","PECUNIARY INTEREST OF MEMBERS OF THE PARLIAMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[22]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I foreshadow an undertaking to accept the amendment on the basis that leave is given for me to move for the insertion in paragraph 12 after the word period the words not later than 90 days after the members of the committee are appointed.

I suggest that the Minister did not listen to very much that was said.Mr LIONELBOWEN (Kings ford Smith Special Minister of State)- With the indulgence of the Chair, may I say that I was misrepresented to the extent that the honourable member for Moore said that I did not listen to what was said.

286,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WENTWORTH, William Charles","DB6","Mackellar","N/A","N/A",1504,"- I take this first opportunity available to me to put on record the sequence of events on 23 August. I would have preferred to do this sooner and to do it at a time when the proceedings were being broadcast. I know that what I am going to say will not be easy to follow except by those who know the procedure of the Parliament. But I think that it is important that it should be put on record and made quite clear in Hansard. This is important not for me but because I believe that the proper adherence to the forms of this House and the rights of members is something which we should all guard.I turn now to the events of 23 August. I should like first to compliment Hansard on the accuracy of its report. There was a great deal of disturbance in the House at the time and it cannot have been easy for Hansard to get the report accurate.I believe it has succeeded in so doing. I turn to the events on that afternoon. At about half-past 3 I was told that in the Australian Broadcasting Commission broadcast of proceedings some improper references had been made to me. When I heard this I went to you, Mr Speaker. I mentioned that I had been misrepresented and you, as is right and proper and as is your custom, said you would give me an opportunity to make an explanation. At about 10 minutes to 4 o clock I did endeavour to do this. There was some misunderstanding, which I can well understand in the confusion. Although you gave me the call I did not have a chance to proceed. Instead, the motion of the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) took precedence. He moved that the House at its rising adjourn until Tuesday, 17 September, and that motion was duly carried. So the House at that stage decided when it would meet after its rising for the adjournment. Later in the day I again endeavoured to put the misrepresentation and you will see that on page 1 166 of Hansard. But once again I did not succeed in doing so because the Leader of the House moved That the House do now adjourn. He spoke for some 10 minutes on that question and concluded with these words:Having said so much I move:That the question be now put.You, Mr Speaker, very properly refused to take that motion at that time saying quite accurately:I promised to deal with a personal explanation pertaining to matters outside this House.You then called me and I made my explanation and you, Sir, were good enough to support what I had said in regard to the misrepresentation saying that the ABC broadcaster had been instructed that in future he was not to repeat the performance. This is all recorded in Hansard.I turn now to the crucial page of Hansard, page 1 168. If you will look at Hansard, Sir, you will see that having supported me in the misrepresentation you then said, quite properly and quite accurately:The question is that the House do now adjourn.The previous question, the gag, had not been put, even much less carried by the House. I rose as was my right to speak on the adjournment. This is the undoubted right of every member. But I got in only 6 lines in Hansard when you, Sir, ordered me to sit down. I say that at this point you were wrong because there was no power in the Speaker to do this. It would have been entirely contrary to the practices of the House for the Speaker to prevent a member from making a speech on the adjournment when there had been no gag carried, no motion carried by the House that the question be now put. At that stage, Sir, you went- if I may say so with all respect- wrong and the Hansard shows it. It is shown at page 1 168 of Hansard. But, Sir, you not only did that. Hansard records you as saying:","The Parliament- Defence- Cities Commission- Steel","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

You know it is not an honest thing that he has done. Let me go further. At that stage, Sir, my right to speak on the adjournment had been wrongfully taken away from me. I have never known any comparable procedure in this House where a member is speaking on the adjournment and has a right to speak on the adjournment. We have a situation in which a member speaks for 6 lines only and the Speaker without any authority from the House sits him down, puts the question That the House do now adjourn, and proceeds straight on to a decision on the matter.Sir, Ithink that you could understand my indignation at this stage. I had been trying, as you know, for all the day to raise the major questions of the economic and industrial difficulties which were then facing the country. They were and still are momentous. But at that stage the industrial difficulties were so bad that there was no transport to take members home by the normal aircraft and we had to resort to VIP planes to get back to our electorates. What was happening to us was perhaps of small moment except insofar as it was indicative of what was happening to other people in greater numbers and perhaps where more important things were involved and greater inconveniences were being suffered.Sir, Ihave endeavoured to put the actual sequence of events as I saw them and I think you can understand my indignation. You had adjourned the House, and the House having been adjourned it is true that I went on to speak. Sir, I felt that in honour I could have done nothing else.","The Parliament- Defence- Cities Commission- Steel","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Mr Speaker, the honourable member talked about his indignation at the way he was treated, or allegedly treated, by your good self. I would just like to remind the honourable member of the indignation of all members of the Parliament at the way in which he abuses the Standing Orders with regularity and obstructs the business of the House I refer to the Joint Sitting as a classic example, when he moved the suspension of Standing Orders on unrelated matters so that he could grab the limelight on a day when the Parliament was televised. We have had to suffer this kind of behaviour week in and week out. The honourable member has taken frivolous points of order. He has pursued points of order with the Speaker to the point where the Speaker has on many occasions demonstrated his leniency towards him. It is unfair for the honourable member for Mackellar to come into the House during the Adjournment debate and raise matters of the kind he has raised tonight, when the Speaker does not have the right of reply. The honourable member traversed ground which was traversed yesterday during discussion on the motion of no confidence in the Speaker which was defeated by this Parliament.The honourable member talked about his indignation. We all suffer quite a lot with him. The honourable member has used these obstructionist measures since 1972 when he went onto the back bench of the Opposition. The managers of his own side of the House are often distressed by his frivolous actions in the House and his constant disruption. So if we are talking about indignation I would like the honourable member for Mackellar to consider you, Mr Speaker, on more occasions than in the past and also to consider members on this side of the House and other members of the Parliament who feel that they are elected to say something in this Parliament at odd times and particularly during the adjournment debate. The honourable member for Mackellar should not monopolise the adjournment debate on most nights of the week.He has taken advantage of the fact that at the commencement of the adjournment debate the Speaker calls a member from the Opposition side first and then a member from the Government side of the House. Because of the limited time for debate more Opposition speakers than Government speakers get the call. Therefore on most occasions the honourable member for Mackellar gets an unfair advantage over most members from this side of the Parliament. I think that most members from this side of the Parliament feel that they also have a right to speak on the adjournment and to raise the matters of importance to their constituents or their el eco rares. I ask the honourable member for Mackellar to consider other members of this House before he gets up to justify himself again.Mr WENTWORTH(Mackellar)-I wish to make a personal explanation.","The Parliament- Defence- Cities Commission- Steel","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

295,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"DRURY, Edward","KCU","Ryan","N/A","N/A",1506,"-I wish to speak briefly tonight on a defence matter. As a matter of courtesy I sent to the office of the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) a telephone message to let him know that I was proposing so to do. This afternoon I received some very disturbing news from Brisbane which indicates a further downturn in the effectiveness of our defence forces. I am informed that a large mobile army exercise known as Latin Forum and involving troops from New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Malaysia, which was scheduled to take place today in the Charleville-Quilpie area of Queensland, had to be cancelled at short notice owing to insufficiency of fuel. I ask the Minister for Defence- perhaps the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) would be good enough to convey this request to him- whether he will at the first opportunity advise the House whether he has any information that he can give regarding this report.The incident- assuming that the information I have received today is correct, and I have no reason whatever to doubt its authenticity- is the latest development in what can only be described as a steadily deteriorating state of affairs affecting the safety and security of Australia. I believe the Minister himself- knowing him well as I do- must be concerned, along with many other members of this Parliament, and indeed with a great many other Australian citizens, representing virtually all shades of political opinion except the extreme left wing unions and those who support the revolutionary socialist left which, as we all know, is dedicated to the complete overthrow of our present social order. In a Press release dated 9 September 1974 the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes), who is the shadow Minister for Defence, mentioned that a few days earlier he had been in Darwin and several Fills and a squadron of Mirages had been prevented from returning to their home bases in Queensland and New South Wales.Australia, as we all know, has a very long coastline. I think it is about 12,000 miles. Now it is more unprotected than ever because Royal Australian Navy patrol boats based in Northern Queensland are unable to exercise proper surveillance. I was speaking recently to a naval officer in Sydney at a private gathering. He told me that, because of industrial disputes, several RAN vessels could not be dry-docked for refitting and repair because of the actions of certain left wing maritime unions. Clearly, militant extremists in Australia are sabotaging our defences. I appeal to the Minister and to the Government to take strong steps to deal with the industrial lawlessness which is weakening and undermining the safety and security of millions of decent, law-abiding Australians.","The Parliament- Defence- Cities Commission- Steel","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
296,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GILES, Geoffrey","KB8","Angas","N/A","N/A",1507,"-Last night I made some remarks about the appointment by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren), who is at the table, of a Mr Mundey to the Advisory Committee of the Cities Commission. I pointed out at the time that Parliament had agreed to the appointment to this Committee of 2 people trained and qualified as environmentalists and conservationists. To allow for those 2 appointments Parliament agreed to an amendment moved by myself on behalf of the member for Higgins (Mr Gorton) to increase the number on the Advisory Committee of the Cities Commision by two. I read out last night the names of the 3 persons who had been appointed by the Minister. I have no intention of repeating them. The first one and the second one have no claim to any expertise in the fields of environment or conservation. The third one the Minister appointed was a man called Mr Mundey.I hasten to point out that the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James), who spoke later, was entirely accurate when he said that I could not have checked my facts and that Mr Mundey was no longer a member of either the Advisory Committee or the Cities Commision. I checked today and I found out that the honourable member for Hunter was quite correct in his impression that 2 months ago Mr Mundey resigned from the Advisory Committee after attending 2 meetings. I can only think that he retired because he realised that the appointment in the first place was entirely wrong. He was not at any stage to be considered an expert in the fields of either environment or conservation. But I do not think that is the point. The honourable member for Hunter, I am sure, would hasten to agree with me. The point I made throughout my speech last night was that it was a wrong appointment. I am glad the honourable member for Hunter is nodding agreement, because it was a wrong appointment. Parliament accepted the amendment I moved that the number of members of the Advisory Committee should be increased from eleven to thirteen to provide membership for 2 people properly trained and competent in the field of environment and conservation.As I said last night I am sorry that I did not advise the Minister that I was about to bring this matter up. I am very glad that the Minister is at the table tonight. There is a great deal for which he has to answer to Parliament in relation to these appointments. I do not think anyone would accept that one should properly think that this man, Mr Mundey, is anything other than an enthusiastic amateur. He has been misguided in some of his aims and certainly he did not conform with the definition put down by Parliament when it accepted the amendment I moved. As I said last night, and I repeat, I think Parliament, not the Opposition, deserves a proper answer from the Minister as to why he appointed this man. If this man did not conform with the definition that Parliament imposed in the appointment of 2 extra people, Parliament is left with little other way of thinking than that the Minister appointed him on a personal buddy-buddy relationship, which is exactly what I said last night.I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in relation to this matter. I take the first available opportunity, as I said I would do last night, to apologise for the fact that my information, although it was checked out, was not entirely up to date. My checking out was done at the tail end of the last session of Parliament. What I said last night was in accordance with the facts that I obtained at the end of the last session. My incapacity to re-check was responsible for the error. I am not concerned tonight to point out what political party Mr Mundey belongs to or does not belong to. I do not know what faction of his political parry he aims to represent. That is not the point that I am getting onto tonight. I think it is very important that the people of Australia should know about the sort of people that Ministers appoint and why they are appointed. The Minister cannot have appointed Mr Mundey because he thought he was a properly qualified man in the two fields specified in my amendment and accepted by Parliament. That cannot have been the reason. We want to know the reason. We want to know why there is such a close association between the left wing of the Labor Party and people like Mr Mundey. I do not really care whether he is a fascist, a communist, a Marxist, a Leninist or anything else. But I think the people of Australia are entitled to know why the Minister appointed him to the Cities Commission. I would like to know also by what method of ministerial machinations or mental processes the Minister arrived at the incredible solution that when Parliament empowered him to appoint two additional members to the Advisory Council of the Cities Commission, who were to be two trained and competent people in the fields of the environment and conservation, it empowered him to appoint this man to that job. By what torturous process did he reach that decision? On any definition, Mr Mundeyis not qualified to hold that job, in accordance with what Parliament provided.My interest in this matter, which I think is well known in this House, goes back to the problem of the inauguration of the regional growth centre of Albury-Wodonga. I can remember, unfortunately I suppose, delaying the Minister for some time 10 months ago on this matter. I delayed the Minister because I have a very real and grave concern for the people of South Australia, for the towns of Renmark, Loxton, Berri, Barmera, Murray Bridge and Mannum, all on the Murray and all in my electorate and also because of the fact that the Government of South Australia has not written into any indenture agreement whatsoever minimum pollution levels that should apply for the protection of South Australia which uses, I believe, 70 per cent now of waters from the Murray to sustain its growth, its industries and its current population. That water is important to South Australia.Perhaps this aspect is removed from the main point in my speech, but I think that the South Australian Government is negligent for not having written into any indenture agreement properly quantified pollution levels above which the people of South Australia would have some comeback against the Federal Government and the River Murray Commission to protect the future livelihood of their State. This has always been the point that I have taken in the House. My interest in the appointment of 2 properly qualified persons expert in the fields of environment and conservation stems entirely from a belief.I find myself in the position that I know of the Ministers last 3 appointments. After 2 meetings, Mr Mundey for one has resigned. I do not know whom the Minister may have in mind to appoint to this important position which could have a lot to do with the environmental factors of the River Murray and which could protect South Australia in the areas that I have already mentioned. I beseech the Minister to tell us tonight when he will conform with the provisions of the amendment moved by me, agreed to by the Parliament and by him as the responsible Minister, to appoint 2 properly qualified people to that advisory board. I think the Minister is fair enough to acknowledge that Parliament is entitled to a proper answer on this matter. I hope that I have explained to him in my speech the sort of thought process which has motivated me tonight in regard to this matter.","The Parliament- Defence- Cities Commission- Steel","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have tried not on one occasion but at least on several occasions to try to educate this dull man from the other side of the Parliament. Action was taken by this Government to try to create some form of decentralisation in this nation. In the 23 years in which the Government of the Party which the honourable gentleman opposite, who represents a rural seat, supports was in office, the proportion of the Australian population resident in non-urban areas fell from 31 per cent to 14.7 per cent. This Government is trying to reverse that situation. To try to make our decentralisation policy work, we will draw greatly from the experience that has been gained in Canberra in seeking not to pollute our water systems. At present under construction it will be in operation in about 2 years- is a water treatment works at the junction of the Molonglo and Murrumbidgee Rivers which will purify water to such an extent that one can drink the water as it is released after treatment of the sewage. Even the nutrients are taken out of the water. The same systems will be used in the development of the Albury-Wodonga scheme.Dealing with the question of the environment, I point out that no government in Australias history has really tried to look at the problems of the environment as this Government has done. Tomorrow I will be tabling the report of the inquiry conducted by Mr Justice Hope of the Supreme Court of New South Wales into the national estate. That report is quite revealing. It is damning and critical of the previous Government for allowing the human environment of this nation to go into decay in the way in which it has.

Not only do I say that, but such a great Australian as Patrick White, when asked to nominate the man he thought was the greatest Australian, said that in his view Jack Mundey was that person. He has taken positive action on many occasions to save many beautiful things in Australia. We find people from all walks of life, people from the middle class, from the wealthy sector of the community, when they cannot stop a building being destroyed, saying that they will have to connect with Jack Mundey and the Builders Labourers Federation. Why do we find such reputable organisations as the National Trust of Australia agreeing with and aligning themselves with such people as Jack Mundey, or find members of the conservation groups, whether they live in Hunters Hill or on the North Shore of Sydney or in remote sections even of Brisbane or in other places doing the same thing?

332,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"KING, Robert","KET","Wimmera","N/A","N/A",1511,"- I do not wish to talk about the environment, and I hope when I resume my seat the Minister will not call me a humbug. He has implied that all members on this side of the House are humbugs. The subject I wish to bring before the House could be classified as one I should apologise for even introducing. It may appear to some people to be minor and of little effect for the future of this nation but by the time I conclude my comments I hope I can convince such people that the contrary is the position. Some months ago I wrote to the Minister for Manufacturing Industry (Mr Enderby) on behalf of one of the municipalities in my electorate which was receiving a lot of complaints from primary producers in its area who could not secure supplies of steel points for agricultural machinery. As I said, this may appear to be an insignificant issue but to the primary producers who are desirous of securing these steel points for their agricultural machinery it is important.I shall quote from the letter I received only today from the Minister. I apologise to the Minister for not notifying him that I intended to raise this matter. In his letter he wrote:Enquiries by the Department of Manufacturing Industry confirm that despite increased production, local manufacturers have been unable to fully meet the demand from primary producers for steel points and have had to introduce quotas on deliveries to distributors. The major causes of the shortfall in supply have been, I understand, the very substantial increase in demands for these goods over recent times, and the inability of the manufacturers concerned to obtain increased supplies of the specialised steel for their production.That is not good enough. The Minister refers to a substantial increase in demand. Why is there a demand? This is not a type of item that primary producers hoard. The demand exists because such articles cannot be purchased. The demand has been aggravated for 12 to 18 months. The Ministers letter continues:As you will be aware, there is a general shortage of steel products in Australia at this time. You will be aware that the Government has no powers to direct any industry to give preference in supply to particular customers or markets. However, the Government is in continuing contact with local steel producers and has received assurance that cases of genuine hardship are receiving special attention in respect of supplies. The industrys response earlier this year to the special needs of primary producers in flood devastated areas for fencing wire and steel fence posts is an example of priority being accorded in special circumstances. I assure you the Government is sympathetic to the needs of primary producers.With the aim of supplementing local supplies with imported products, the Australian Government has eased the criteria by which by-law entry into Australia is governed and has, where appropriate, authorised entry under by-law of goods for which such application has been made to the Department of Customs and Excise, so enabling raw materials and manufactured foods which are in short supply to be imported free of customs duty. Approvals have been granted to import certain categories of steel under these provisions.This is much appreciated, but it is not the answer. The letter concludes:I regret that I am unable to indicate more precisely when steel supplies will improve to the extent of resolving the associated shortages of steel points. It does seem, however, that the Australian steel industry is doing all it can to meet demand with available resources and that supplies are being allocated on an equitable basis. There have been some recent indications that the present high level of demand for steel may moderate in the near future.I am not blaming the Minister for not being able to supply steel points for, basically, wheat farmers. I am raising this matter tonight because I believe the issue goes far beyond the question of steel points. K goes far beyond the shortage of barbed wire, fencing wire, fencing posts and other commodities which are in big demand throughout Australia. One cannot buy materials.

Why is this the position? I believe there are several reasons. I am somewhat inclined to direct my criticisms initially at the Prices Justification Tribunal which is very quick to point out that certain companies are making too much profit on certain goods and is knocking back applications for price increases. Naturally I think immediately of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Ltd. There are plenty of people who say: Think of the millions of dollars profit BHP made last year.  That does not mean a thing to me. I am not interested in its profit unless I know how its profit is related to the capital invested in it. I wonder what sort of dividend BHP is paying in relation to the total capital invested in it. I wonder how that dividend compares with present-day interest rates.I suppose if there is any one reason for a shortage of material it can be attributed to limited production. But why is there limited production? I suggest it is because there is a lack of confidence in certain sectors, including BHP, in expanding at a reasonable pace to maintain supplies. It is all very well to say that we can import goods but what we want is manufacturing in Australia. If anyone disputes my comments about lack of confidence by BHP one has only to read tonights metropolitan Press and references therein to the share market. For the first time for many years BHP shares have fallen to a value below $5.","The Parliament- Defence- Cities Commission- Steel","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Not many weeks ago the Treasurer (Mr Crean) said that he believed that BHP shares would be a good buy at $8. Today they are worth $4.88. It is just as well that not too many people listened to the Treasurer on that occasion. Unfortunately many of us had to listen to him last night. However in a period of about 18 months BHP shares have dropped from $14 to less than $5. This is a reason for steel shortages throughout Australia. I have raised the matter of steel points for agricultural machinery but my comments are not limited to agricultural machinery; they relate to many aspects of steel production. If the Government continues on its present lines we will continue to find ourselves in a position where we will not be able to purchase the steel we require.As I said earlier, I apologise for not notifying the Minister that I intended to speak on this subject tonight. Nevertheless I. do not expect an answer from him because, after all, he had carried out a certain amount of investigation. However I repeat what I said a moment ago: This is not a case of easing import restrictions or bringing goods in under customs by-laws free of duty. That is not the answer. In Australia we need to develop industry and the only way this can be done is by creating confidence. I have mentioned BHP. It is a firm whose confidence should be encouraged. Lest any honourable member is critical of my comments and suggests that I am trying to protect BHP I hasten to assure such member that that is far from being the fact. I am not personally interested in BHP but I am interested in making sure that manufacturing industries, including BHP and other firms, have sufficient confidence to enable them to expand to meet the demands of our expanding production.","The Parliament- Defence- Cities Commission- Steel","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

354,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"WHITLAM, Gough","6U4","N/A","ALP","N/A",1514,"- The answer to the honourable members question is as follows:Stabilisation of Meat PricesRecommendation (i)The Government rejected the recommendation for an export tax on beef. Following an examination of the position with regard to supplies and prices, the Government directed the Bureau of Agricultural Economics to investigate the costs involved in the marketing of cattle, sheep and pigs. Special reference was made to the composition of the margin between the prices paid to primary producers for animals slaughtered and the retail prices paid by consumers for meat products. A report on the investigation was tabled in Parliament on 2 April 1 974.The Consumer Price Index shows that the price of meat has fallen in recent months.Recommendation (ii)The Government decided to hold in abeyance the recommendation that the meat industry be requested to restrict voluntarily beef exports. In fact there has been no need for restraint on beef exports owing to the poor demand from overseas markets. In JanuaryJuly 1 974 shipments of beef were little more than half those in the corresponding period of 1 973.Recommendation (iii)This recommendation is no longer relevant as United States livestock producers ceased withholding stock from the market following the lifting of the U.S. beef price freeze on 9 September 1 973.Recommendation (iv)The representative body of the pig industry has indicated that it wishes to undertake promotion of the industrys products with funds based on a slaughter levy and has approached the Government seeking legislation for the introduction of such a levy. The Government has announced that it will introduce the necessary legislation.Recommendation (v)The Minister for Agriculture has announced that he intends to review the composition, powers and functions of all marketing boards, including the Meat Board.Recommendation (vi)The recommendation to establish a Government sponsored and financed consumer organisation is under consideration.Recommendation (vii)In order to obtain information on sales under forward contracts the Australian Meat board held discussions with the Australian Meat Exporters Federal Council and approached a number of major exporters regarding the collection of such data. Data have been collected from exporters but in the past six months the poor export demand and low level of forward contracts has meant that such information is of little value. The Board will continue to maintain its contact with exporters so that when business returns to more normal levels a better assessment will be possible.Import Prices InquiryThe following references are to paragraphs in the chapter on Findings and Recommendations in the Committees Report No. 1. First recommendation is numbered (vi).Recommendation (vi)On 18 February 1974 the Minister for Transport wrote to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Prices. He pointed out that the overseas cargo shipping provisions of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1971-72 related only to outward trades. This is still the position under the Trade Practices Act 1974. Nevertheless, enquiries have been made overseas on the manner in which liner freight rates on imported cargoes are adjusted when currency relativities alter. In the United Kingdom, Europe and Japan shipper bodies negotiate these arrangements with the Conferences concerned. They have agreed on the application of currency adjustment factors to the tariff which are calculated to ensure that shipowners neither profit nor lose by changes in costs and/or revenues due to fluctuations in the relativity between the tariff currency and the currencies in which costs are incurred. In the United Kingdom to Australia trade, for example, a monthly review of this adjustment factor has been mads since late 1972 by the British Shippers Council and the Conference. In the trade from the United States of America to Australia, where there is no shipper body, the regulatory authority, the Federal Maritime Commission, adopts a similar policy. It makes every endeavour to limit currency surcharges to amounts no greater than are required to maintain the integrity of the carriers basic rate structure.Recommendation (vii)The practice by which associations of timber importers recommend prices and profit margins to their members (referred to in paragraphs 66-69 and 74 of the report on import prices) was referred to the Commissioner of Trade Practices under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1971-72. The Trade Practices Act 1974 includes provisions that cover this practice more clearly than the above Act.Recommendation (viii)The possible need for legislation to give effect to the recommendation that information be obtained on products in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is currently under investigation.The Department of Health is, however, continuing to seek information on actual costs and other relevant financial information from pharmaceutical companies.Price of MeatmealRecommendation (i)The practice by which some meat meal manufacturers consult on the establishment of list prices for the industry was referred to the Commissioner of Trade Practices.Recommendation (ii)Subsequent to the Joint Committees report, the power of the Australian Government to regulate the export of meat meal under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations has been applied more stringently, primarily to ensure that the domestic market continues to have priority in the use of available supplies.On 20 February 1974 the Minister for Agriculture announced that his Department would not issue further permits for the export of meat meal until such time as shortages on the domestic market were overcome. Since that time the outlook has altered; protein meals have become more readily available on the international market; supplies of substitute protein meals have been taken up by local users; the price of meat meal on the domestic market has generally declined and limited exportable surpluses have developed in most States. In these circumstances limited exports of meat meal have been approved but, in view of the relatively low levels of livestock slaughterings and meat meal production, market circumstances will be kept under review and the export restrictions will be applied as necessary.d ) Price of Carpet TilesThe Trade Practices Act 1974 includes provisions designed to bring about a more competitive climate in retail pricing as well as in other areas. In addition the Trade Practices Commission provided for in that Act is able to inform the public of the kinds of benefits obtainable by comparative shopping.The major company mentioned in the report has been contacted by the Department of ManufacturingIndustry and advises that it no longer issues recommended prices to retailers unless specifically requested.The Committees report has also been brought to the attention of members of the Textile and Apparel Industry Advisory Panel and the Interim Commission on Consumer Standards.","Department of Education: Foreign Aid Functions (Question No. 139)","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[5]/answer[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

However, my Department has from time to time undertaken studies of industrial absence in this country. The most recent was a survey of absence attributed to sickness and accidents undertaken for October 1973, the results of which will be published shortly in the Personnel Practice Bulletin. The survey covered 1,065 establishments in a range of industries throughout Australia. For statistical reasons, entirely reliable conclusions cannot be drawn from the survey concerning sickness absence in Australian industry generally. However, a rough approximation can be arrived at by relating the survey findings on absence rates for Industry groups to the industrial distribution of wage and salary earners in the Australian labour force and deducting estimates of time lost through industrial accidents and diseases. On this basic, the total number of hours lost through absence attributed to sickness in 1973 is estimated at about 360 million.

In March 1974, the Board decided that enough trials were running to enable a full evaluation to be conducted before moving to the introduction of flexible working hours on a permanent basis. No new trials are therefore being approved which involve settlement periods of longer than one day.The evaluation proposed by the Board requires the cooperation of the departments and the staff organisations. The proposals have been tested with departments and discussions have taken place with the staff organisations but the agreement of the staff organisations on the ways and means of evaluating the trials has not yet been obtained.The purpose of conducting experiments in new patterns of working times was to enable assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of various different patterns, in comparison with each other and with standard working hours. Until a full evaluation is made, the Board is not able to give a firm view on the advantages and disadvantages of flexible working hours, particularly as regards the efficiency and productivity of departmental administration. It is, of course, clear that there are considerable advantages in flexible working hours to individual public servants, who are able to combine better their official and their private commitments.Individual departments have reported on trials as they have been running. Some of the advantages claimed were improved morale and better co-operation among staff, increased productivity, reduction in absenteeism and provision of services to the public over a wider span of hours. On the other hand, some of the disadvantages claimed were communication and supervision difficulties, unavailability of staff outside core-times and administrative complexity.The Government wants to see flexible working hours tested as thoroughly as possible, having regard to the interests of the Government as an employer and of the many employees who may benefit.","Australian Public Service: Flexi-time (Question No. 468)","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[25]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As soon as advice is received that this work is complete, the site is referred to either the Waiting List Pool or the Builders Pool for immediate allocation to individuals and builders respectively.A pool of blocks is maintained in both of these areas so that a reasonable selection is available from which those eligible to take up a lease can make a choice.Australian Capital Territory: Spec Builders (Question No. 487)","Australian Capital Territory: Land Lease Procedures (Question No. 485)","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[26]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The average price of all residential leases sold at that auction was $10,560 and for group blocks alone $15,101.The average price of leases allocated under the new scheme up to 30 June 1974 to both individuals and freelance builders is $5,583. Under this scheme there is no separate provision for group allocations(c) and (d) Leases of sites for flats and town houses permit some flexibility in the number of units to be built on each site. The average price per block does not provide a useful means of comparison. However the average price paid per residential unit for such leases was $6,56 1 at the one auction held after 1 July 1973 and $4,407 for all leases allocated from that time up to 30 June 1 974.","Australian Capital Territory: Leases for Residential Housing (Question No. 488)","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[27]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

410,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"BRYANT, Gordon","JSU","N/A","ALP","N/A",1524,"- The answer to the honourable members question is as follows:(a) and (b) Since October 1973 leases have been granted to freelance builders and to people registered on a waiting list at prices equal to the rating value of the lease as at I January 1973 less 30 per cent. Those people eligible to register on the waiting list have been voluntary transferees from the old rental housing waiting list, persons who had never previously held an interest in land and, more recently, those who live and work in the Australian Capital Territory and have not held title to land in the Australian Capital Territory during the past five years. A deposit of $ 100 is required from people registering on the list.Applicants reaching the top of the waiting list are offered a choice of land on hand. After making a selection they are given one month in which to confirm the availability of building finance before they are required to pay for and take up the lease.Freelance builders have each been given a quota of leases based on their building performance in the Australian Capital Territory over the past three years or proof of their capacity to complete homes within the specified period. They can nominate the time when they wish to take their allocation and are given as wide a choice as possible having regard to the number of serviced blocks on hand.Builders are given three months in which to have building plans approved and to pay for and take up the leases. When a house has been completed the builder is not permitted to transfer the lease without obtaining approval of his selling price. This is aimed at ensuring as far as possible that the lease is passed on to the end purchaser at a price no greater than was paid for it by the builder.Control over the price at which leases may be transferred is maintained for a period of five years in respect of leases granted both to individuals and to builders.1 ) (c) and (d) Since October 1973 the practice has been to invite tenders for leases of sites for residential flats and town houses. A reserve price is fixed in the same manner as for ordinary residential leases, that is, the rating value as at 1 January 1973 less 30 per cent. A lease is offered to the applicant who offers the highest amount providing this is not less than the nominated reserve price.Home-seekers interested in medium density type housing have been invited to form or join co-operatives which, upon registration, can be eligible to seek the grant of a lease of a site for flats or town houses. Leases are available to these cooperatives upon payment of the reserve price calculated in the manner explained above.Prior to October 1973 standard residential sites were offered at public auction in restricted, unrestricted and group categories with reserve price calculated to return overall the cost of providing serviced land, but weighted to reflect the rating values placed on individual sites.Sites for residential flats and town houses were also offered at public auction with reserve prices fixed at 75 per cent of the assessed current market value.","Australian Capital Territory: Allocation of Land (Question No. 489)","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[28]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
