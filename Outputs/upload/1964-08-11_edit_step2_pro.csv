6,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MENZIES, Robert","N76","KooyongPrime Minister","LP","Prime Minister",4,"- Since we met last, India has lost a very distinguished Prime Minister and the world has lost a most famous and significant statesman. Mr. Nehru was the political founder of the Republic of India and its Prime Minister for many years. It was a remarkable experience to sit with him, as I did many times in a Prime Ministers Conference, and to realize some of the things that lay behind his presence and gave such weight and significance to whatever he said.I well remember Sir Winston Churchill saying of him on one occasion in conference that he had conquered many things, including fear itself. This was profoundly true. It was from time to time quite possible to disagree with him. But it was never possible to deny him the respect due to a man who may properly and without any exaggeration be described as one of the makers of modern history.His international activities are well known and will be well remembered. But one of his most remarkable achievements, somewhat less well known, was in the domestic affairs of India. In this House we all know of the numerous problems that arise in the course of the government of Australia. Yet every one of us was born into a community long versed in parliamentary democracy - a community in which the general nature of democratic government and the organisation of parties and the spirit of the community had long been established. But India, when it came to its sovereign independence, was a great group of principalities, communities and localities totalling something like four hundred millions of people. It was a gigantic task to produce out of all those elements some political structure and coherence on a democratic basis. It is, I think, proper to believe that nobody but Mr. Nehru could have performed it.If democratic self-government persists in India - and we all hope and believe that it will - it will be primarily due to the life work of Jawaharlal Nehru. He had been through every conceivable political adversity, but he retained his standards. He achieved not only wide fame in his own country, but immense moral authority. To hundreds of millions of people he was India.His successor, Mr. Shastri, to whom we would all wish to extend our warmest good wishes, has inherited an immense task. He will be strengthened in the performance of that task, not only by a pride in his predecessor, but by an understanding that the things for which Mr. Nehru stood must be carried on so that in due course the nation of India will develop its resources, its standards and its strength.On the last occasion on which I had very long personal discussions with Mr. Nehru, he was deeply affected and, indeed, vexed by the attack made by China along the Indian frontier. After all, nobody had done more than he had to keep up his bridges with China and to interpret, so far as he could, China to the rest of the world. He seemed to me to be not unnaturally depressed by what he regarded as a failure.Yet, I feel bound to say here, as I said to him then, that he had made great contribution to a general understanding of the proposition that while international tolerance still remains a matter of prime importance, it does not involve an acceptance of aggression or a refusal to assert the rights of all nations to live their own lives in their own way.I am taking the unusual course of moving this resolution because I think it should be made clear to the Government and people of India that there is an understanding in Australia of their problems, a profound sympathy for them in their tremendous loss and a resolution to cultivate a spirit of friendship and encouragement.I move -That this House records its sincere regret at the death of Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India, places on record its admiration for his devotion to and achievements on behalf of the people of his own country, and for his unceasing and positive interest in international affairs, expresses to the people of India its profound regret at the loss they have suffered, and tenders its deep sympathy to his relatives.","N/A","DEATH OF JAWAHARLAL NEHRU","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
7,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CALWELL, Arthur","BV8","Melbourne","N/A","Leader of the Opposition",4,". - Mr. Deputy Speaker, the Opposition desires to pay its tribute to the late Pandit Nehru, who was one of the few really great men of our time. Born of a wealthy family and educated at leadingEnglish universities, he qualified as a lawyer; but he deserted his opulent surroundings and embraced the cause of Indian freedom. The strength and influence that he possessed in world affairs owed nothing to military might or force of arms. He was a man who had gone to gaol for his convictions. He was a man who had learned the strength and influence of moral force. His strength certainly was a moral one, and he wielded it powerfully and devotedly in the cause of world peace. He was unique among the statesmen of his time in the degree to which his words and ideas carried weight with all the nations of the world, including those infinitely more powerful than India.Nehru was, above all, a great and dedicated Socialist. He recognised Democratic Socialism as both the moral imperative and the practical necessity for India. Like his illustrious predecessor, Gandhi, Nehru defended the policy of neutralism for India. He was criticised for that. He was attacked because of his stern defence of that policy which was the only policy that India could have pursued in the light of her poverty, her caste system, all her differences of dialect and all the rest. He had no patience with people belonging to prosperous and advanced Western democracies who would say, unctuously: It is the job of governments to try the free enterprise solution to help individuals help themselves . To him that was the counsel of despair and irrelevant to the problems of his vast country, with two-thirds of its inhabitants hungry all of their lives, from the cradle to the premature grave. The experiment of Democratic Socialism in India is succeeding, although the pace of progress is painfully slow. It is imperative that the experiment should succeed, because failure in India undoubtedly would mean the end of democracy and the hopes of democracy almost everywhere in the world. The fact that democracy has survived in India is due almost entirely to this one man whose memory we honour today. The measure of his success is the smoothness with which the new Administration of Mr. Shastri has been able to follow his.Mr. Nehru was invited by the late Mr. Chifley to come to Australia. Unfortunately he never came. That is our misfortune. Nehru once said that the only epitaph he wanted was that he was one who loved India and who had been given in return the love of the Indian people in abundant measure. But his range was not restricted to India. Although he ranks as one of modern Indias two greatest statesmen, he belongs to all humanity.","N/A","DEATH OF JAWAHARLAL NEHRU","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
8,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MCEWEN, John","009MB","Murray","CP","Minister for Trade and Industry",5,". - I should like to associate the Australian Country Party with the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies) and the speeches made by him and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Calwell). Mr. Nehru was truly one of the very great men of our day. Surely no man could have assumed a more difficult burden or greater obligations than the establishment of the government of a country such as India is and was at the time that he assumed these tremendous responsibilities. It is a tribute to his force of character and his sagacity that he was able to attain a stable government in a country tormented by so many problems, as India was and has been tormented. He established a truly democratic form of government in a country where there was no uniformity of thinking, and it is a miracle that he achieved such a personal authority as he did. I think no head of state had a greater personal authority than Mr. Nehru had; yet at the same time he sustained the substance as well as the appearance of a true democracy.It might well have been enough for him to have confined his activities to thinking through the problems of his own country. He did this as well as any man could, but at the same time he made his contribution during his day to world affairs, and made it in such a manner that it was heeded. His views were not always agreed to, but, as the Prime Minister has said, they were always respected because of the sheer integrity of the man. I believe it is proper that in this exceptional case the Parliament should express itself in the way that is proposed.Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places.","N/A","DEATH OF JAWAHARLAL NEHRU","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
9,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MENZIES, Robert","N76","KooyongPrime Minister","LP","N/A",5,"- Mr. Deputy Speaker, I have now to refer to the death of Sir John Latham,, which occurred very recently. He was well known in this House over a long period of years. He had a remarkable record of public service. I do not propose to go into the details of his public career, because they are pretty vividly in mind. But it is quite clear that his death represented a very great loss to this nation. True, he had reached a great age and had reached it without any failure of his remarkable faculties or any diminution of his constant desire to render service not only to Australia but to the world.His career was indeed a remarkable and versatile one. He was a philosopher and a teacher. He was a distinguished member of the Bar. He was a notable Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. Under very special circumstances he became our diplomatic representative in Japan. He was the Leader of the Opposition during a period of great political difficulties. He was a great political fighter, but at all times he commanded the respect and, as I believe, the affection of his political opponents.Some time after he went out of politics he became a highly successful Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. He bad a mind which was at once keen, analytical, eager and constructive. After he retired from the position of Chief Justice he continued in many ways, and through many organisations, to contribute his ability, his experience and his wisdom to good causes in our country.In the course of his life, he sustained grievous losses, grievous family losses, of a kind which would quite readily have broken a lesser man. But his spirit was never broken and his enthusiasm never diminished. It is more than commonly appropriate that in this Parliament, in which he was a great figure, we should place on record some tribute, however inadequate, to his character and his work.On the personal side, I may be permitted to say that I speak of him with close knowledge, for he was one of my teachers when I was studying the law. I saw a lot of him in the course of practice at the bar and I had the rare privilege of succeeding him as the member for Kooyong and as the Attorney-General of Australia. I mention these matters, not merely with some feeling of personal satisfaction, but because they enabled me at all stages to get to know someone out of the ordinary run, a man whose immense record I have endeavoured sketchily to recall, a man who made a contribution to Australian development and life which will, I believe, not be forgotten. I move -That this House expresses its deep regret at the death of the Right Honorable Sir John Greig Latham, G.C.M.G., formerly a member of this House for the division of Kooyong, Minister of the Crown, Leader of the Opposition and Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, places on record its appreciation of his long and distinguished public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his relatives in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONORABLE SIR JOHN GREIG LATHAM, G.C.M.G","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
10,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CALWELL, Arthur","BV8","Melbourne","N/A","Leader of the Opposition",6,". - John Greig Latham, whose passing we mourn, and to whose memory we desire to pay tribute, was the most distinguished of a family of brothers all of whom, in various ways, achieved prominence and distinction, and who made their own contributions to the well-being of the Australian community. They were the sons of a man who had nothing in the way of worldly goods with which to endow his children. He was a tinsmith. In later life the father of Sir John Latham became secretary of the Tinsmiths Union in Victoria.By his own perseverance and determination, and by other qualities which he had inherited, John Latham won scholarships which took him through the University of Melbourne. Each new goal he set himself was another challenge to great achievement, and in the course of his life he aquitted himself brilliantly in many fields - as a lawyer, as a parliamentarian, as a Minister of State, as a diplomat and later, and last of all, as Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia.Even after leaving his high and exalted office Sir John Latham neither retired nor restricted his great range of activities. The close of one phase seemed always to mean the opening of another. After leaving the High Court he engaged himself in the task of developing and fostering AustralianAmerican friendship, he delivered lectures of great merit, and he acted as the mentor and confidant of many in varied walks of life who found profit and pleasure in his engaging conversation and voluminous correspondence.I hoped, at the time, that his retirement from the Chief Justiceship might lead to his appointment as Governor-General but, unfortunately, that did not happen. He would have been a dignified and very successful Vice-Regal representative. He leaves a proud name and a noble memory behind him. Australia is the richer for his life, and the poorer through his death.","N/A","DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONORABLE SIR JOHN GREIG LATHAM, G.C.M.G","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
11,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MCEWEN, John","009MB","Murray","CP","Minister for Trade and Industry",7,". - I wish to associate the Australian Country Party with the motion proposed by the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Calwell). It was my good fortune to know Sir John Latham. I can speak of him, as can everyone else who knew him, as an upright and honorable gentleman and as one whom one could instinctively trust and respect. He was a man of wisdom and integrity - a man who had always an air of dignity about him. He served this country very well indeed throughout the whole of his life, and in a variety of ways. He was a naval officer when, as one of the advisers to the then Prime Minister of Australia, he attended the conference which led to the signing of the peace treaty of Versailles in 1919. He then entered this Parliament and had a very distinguished career in it! As the Prime Minister has said, he was Leader of the Opposition in difficult days and in circumstances in which, perhaps, had he preferred his own promotion to what he conceived to be the public weal, he could well have become Prime Minister of Australia at that time. He served this country well as Leader of the Opposition and also as deputy to the late Mr. Lyons.In due course, he became Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. Later, at a time when I was serving, as I do now, in a government under the leadership of the present Prime Minister, it was my lot as Minister for External Affairs, to ask Sir John Latham if he would step down temporarily from the office of Chief Justice and become the first Australian ambassador to Japan, with the rank of Minister to Japan. Conceiving this to be an act of duty, he readily acquiesced and, in very difficult days, he served as our diplomatic representative in Japan, endeavouring to the best of his ability to have our circumstances comprehended by the then government of Japan and to translate to our Government here the views of the Japanese Government. However, as history shows, the results that we had hoped for were not achieved and Sir John Latham found himself in Japan at the outbreak of war.It was quite some considerable time before he was able to return to this country. When he came back, he resumed his office as Chief Justice and in due course, heretired. But, hot content with his long period of service, he then, as Leader of the Opposition has reminded us, devoted himself to what he conceived to be of great importance - achieving- a better understanding between the people, the commercial interests and the governments of Australia and the United States of America. For a number of years, he was President of the Australian-American Association, and, in that office, rendered not the least of his services to this country. I think the House does well to remember and to respect Sir John Latham.Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places.","N/A","DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONORABLE SIR JOHN GREIG LATHAM, G.C.M.G","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
12,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MENZIES, Robert","N76","KooyongPrime Minister","LP","N/A",7,"- On Wednesday 22nd July of this year, the death occurred of Mr. C. W. Frost, who was very well known to a number of us in this House, not only as Minister for Repatriation and Minister in charge of War Service Homes - positions that he occupied from 1941 to 1946 - but also, of course, as the honorable member for the Tasmanian electorate of Franklin from 1929 to 1931, and from 1934 to 1946. He thus had an extensive period of service in this Parliament. During that time, Charles Frost was a member of the Australian delegation to what was then called the Empire Parliamentary Association, which visited England in 1935. He was a member of the Joint Committee on Public Works from 1937 to 1940, and a member of the Rural Industries Committee from July 1941 to November 1941. After he went out of the House he was Commissioner - an office we now call High Commissioner - to Ceylon from 1947 to 1948. and then High Commissioner from 1948 to 1950. He has left behind him a wife, two sons and a daughter.Those of us who were here with him in this Parliament will, I think, always remember him very vividly, not because he was a complex character or a difficult sort of man - one does occasionally remember difficult men - but because he was a man of the most rugged simplicity of approach and simplicity of character. I like to put it in this way: That he brought a great deal of humanity into politics and into political controversy. He had an engaging quality about him which produced, if my experience counts for anything; instinctive affection for him. He served his electors well, he served his party well, he served this Parliament well and he served this country well. Not always can you say those four things about the one man. I remember him with great pleasure and I share with thousands of other people a profound regret at his death. I move -That this House expresses its deep regret at the death of the Honorable Charles William Frost, a former member of this House for the Division of Franklin, and a former Minister of the Crown, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE CHARLES WILLIAM FROST","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
13,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CALWELL, Arthur","BV8","Melbourne","N/A","Leader of the Opposition",8,". - Charles William Frost came into this Parliament in 1929 by winning the seat of Franklin in Tasmania. Defeated in 1931, he recaptured the seat in 1934 and held it until 1946. Very few members now in this House will remember seeing him, but those who knew him remember him as a tall, powerfully built man with a cheery smile and a fund of good humour. An apple grower in the Huon Valley, Charles Frost knew the needs and wants of that particular industry as well as any man, and he knew and championed the claims of other primary producers while he remained a member of this Parliament. He was elected to the first Curtin Ministry in October 1941 and was appointed Minister for Repatriation, and held that portfolio until he failed to gain re-election to Parliament five years later.I have always thought that Charles Frost, like the late Claude Barnard, his successor in the portfolio who was defeated in Bass in 1949, was defeated because of the impatience of many people who wanted a complete and quick return to normal life and immediate adjustment of all repatriation claims just after the war had ended. Of course, this was impossible to achieve, and Charles Frost paid a penalty he might not otherwise have had to pay had he not held what was at that time a most difficult portfolio.After serving as our High Commissioner in Ceylon, Charles Frost settled into a long and happy retirement on his property in Tasmania. It is pleasing to record that he survived long enough to see his son, a former prisoner of war of the Japanese, elected to the Parliament of Tasmania a few months ago. There are few members of the first Curtin Government still living. Like them, Charles Frost saw much history made in those dark and terrible days and, like them, he made his own contribution to that sad but glorious chapter of Australian history.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HONORABLE CHARLES WILLIAM FROST","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is an incident of history that Mr. Frost first came to this Parliament in replacement of Mr. Mcwilliams, who was the first leader of the Australian Country Party. As honorable member for Franklin, Mr. Frost was a man who always held the respect of both sides of the Parliament throughout the whole of his service.

16,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MENZIES, Robert","N76","KooyongPrime Minister","LP","N/A",9,"- Mr. Deputy Speaker, I think the House would wish me to make some appropriate reference to the fact that since we last met three former senators, well known to most if not all of us, and a former member of this House have died.The death of ex-Senator Critchley has already been referred to fairly fully in the Senate. I would like to recall at this time that he had experience not only in the South Australian Parliament but also, of course, in the Senate as a senator for that State, having taken his place in the Senate in 1947 and having been re-elected in the Senate elections of 1951 and 1953. He was very greatly regarded by friend and foe alike in the Senate.Only in the last few days I have read with great satisfaction the remarks that were made about him in that place.The late Senator Wardlaw, from Tasmania, died at the age of 75 on 28th June of this year. All honorable members probably remember him well. He was a man with a great instinct for public service both in war and in peace. He commanded deep friendships and, dying at a ripe age, he has left behind him a very fragrant memory. We would like to have that known to his widow.The late Senator Clothier, who died this year, was in the Senate at a somewhat earlier stage than Senator Wardlaw. He entered politics in 1933 when he won a seat in Western Australia. He was elected to the Senate at the general election of 1937, and was a senator until June 1950. Bob Clothier was tremendously popular. In fact, in my relationships with him I found myself wondering occasionally whether he was on my side or not. He had a considerable genius, I think, for a warm and friendly human approach. He has left a daughter, and those of us who knew him, as many of us did, would like her to know that we have the happiest possible recollections of him.Finally, Sir, I come to Mr. Donald Cameron, who was member for Lilley in the last Parliament, having been elected at the end of 1961, and having suffered defeat in the election of 1963. He died recently at the very youthful age of 47. This seems to have been a deplorable event. However, those of us who sat in the last Parliament know that throughout the period for which he was with us he suffered from recurring ill health. It is regrettable that that has now taken him off.All of these gentlemen, in their own ways, made a contribution to this Parliament. Though some future historian may be tempted to talk about the history of a great democratic parliament like this in terms of a few highlights or of a few particularly well known people, the truth is that the character of the Parliament has been contributed to, and will be contributed to, by a lot of members who have not been very much in the headlines, but who have made their contribution to the general quality of this institution. So we remember all these former members with gratitude and note their deaths with regret.","N/A","DEATHS OF FORMER SENATORS AND MEMBER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
17,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CALWELL, Arthur","BV8","Melbourne","N/A","Leader of the Opposition",9,". - Mr. Deputy Speaker, Senator Critchley was a member of the Parliament of South Australia before he came to the Senate. Others before him were members of the South Australian Parliament, became members of the Senate and later went back to the South Australian Parliament, but he came into Federal politics towards the end of his life. Though he never became a prominent member of this Parliament, he was always a popular one. He was a very happy man. He exuded friendship and goodwill and he was greatly esteemed by all who knew him. People not only in the Parliament but also outside it were sorry when he retired from active politics a few years ago. We on this side of the Parliament shall miss him. We knew him best, for he was a member of our party. Every now and then, when I went to South Australia, I telephoned him in order to renew our friendship and to enjoy a happy few minutes of conversation with him.Senator Wardlaw was of a different political loyalty, but he, too, was a happy, genial man who made friends with members in both Houses of this Parliament and on both sides of politics. When he left the Senate, he seemed to be about to enjoy a long and happy retirement, and I was shocked when I read of his death.I should like to associate the Opposition with the tribute to Senator Critchley and Senator Wardlaw and with the expressions of sympathy that are offered to the widow of each and to the members of their respective families.Senator Clothier has left a daughter, and we wish her to know that we are sorry at the demise of her father. Bob Clothier was a man who had a unique personality. He was elected to the Senate in 1937 with the late Senator Cunningham and the late Senator J. M. Fraser. At that election, Sir George Pearce was defeated. Others, too, were defeated, including Mr. Tom Marwick, who was at the time filling a casual vacancy in the Senate and who later became a member of this House. Each of the three senators that I have mentioned boasted that he was the man who had defeated Sir George Pearce. That seemed to give great satisfaction to each of them and to Labour people in Western Australia. Not that I wish to derogate in any way from the reputation or the fame of Sir George Pearce. But that was one of the foibles of each of these three members who entered the Senate at the same time. Each remained in the Parliament for a considerable period,  with the exception of Senator Cunningham; who died in 1943.When I saw Senator Clothier a couple of years ago during the course of an election campaign he told me that he hoped to come back to Canberra on a visit. He enjoyed remarkably good health. His family told me that until his fatal illness he had never been ill. He had been very active in the trade union side of the Labour Party in Western Australia. We who knew him will remember him with the same kindly feeling that he always exhibited towards us.It only remains for me to pay a tribute to the memory of Donald James Cameron, who served in this Parliament for only one term as the honorable member for Lilley. He was a veteran of World War II, but after the war he never enjoyed good health. From the time he was elected until his defeat his health was indifferent, but he struggled with devotion and courage to discharge his duties as an elected member of this Parliament should. However, the struggle was an unequal one. During the last election campaign his failing health prevented him from conducting his activities with the vigour and determination that he would have wished to employ.We who knew him deplore his loss and offer our sympathy to his widow and children. We shall miss his genial disposition and his quiet temperament. His courage was greater than his frail figure could support. He died too young, and he has left not only his family but also his many friends from both sides of this House and from both Houses of this Parliament to mourn his loss.","N/A","DEATHS OF FORMER SENATORS AND MEMBER","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Senator Henty has been appointed Minister for Civil Aviation and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Mr. Fairbairn Minister for National Development.These changes have led to two new appointments to the Ministry: Mr. Howson becomes Minister for Air and Senator Anderson Minister for Customs and Excise. The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. McMahon) has been appointed Vice-President of the Executive Council. Mr. Hulme and Mr. Fairbairn have been included in the Cabinet.The changes have made it necessary to vary some of the arrangements for representation of Ministers in the other chamber. The arrangements, as varied, are as follows: In this House the Minister for Housing (Mr. Bury) will now represent the Minister for Customs and Excise. In the Senate, Senator Paltridge will represent me, except in matters relating to education and research.

I think administrative difficulties, the fact that small units were out in the field and other factors would have prevented the payment of the increases to a few people. To the best of my knowledge, everyone else would have received the increases. Several factors affect the amount of the take home pay. One is rent and another is taxation, which is pro rata to salary.The honorable member referred to payments to the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund. It may well be that an officer approaching retirement who received a rather sharp salary increase would have less take home pay because of increased payments to the Fund. On the other hand, of course, he would be making a big contribution to increased retirement benefits. Provision is made under the Act for such an officer to come to an arrangement if the increased payments cause hardship.

41,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FAIRBAIRN, David","KDT","FARRER, NEW SOUTH WALES","LP","Minister for National Development",13,"- The search for phosphate has been carried out in Australia for a considerable time. During the last war an active search was mounted, but without any satisfactory results being obtained. During the mid-1950s the New Zealand Government and the Australian Government agreed to mount a search of the islands to ascertain whether anything could be found to replace the Nauru, Ocean Island and Christmas Island deposits when they cut out in an estimated time of just over 20 years. The only worthwhile discovery was in the Solomon Islands on a small island known as Bellona. After a careful examination of this area it was decided that the relatively small deposits of some four million tons were not worth developing.Since 1957 the Bureau of Mineral Resources has been instructed to search for phosphate on the mainland, and it has located two phosphatic areas. One is at Rum Jungle, where closer inspection proved the deposits to be of low quality with odd spots of high quality, but again not adequate for development. The Bureau has recently located a very thin but high grade ore body in the Amadeus Basin in the south-west of the Northern Territory. I understand that there are a couple of other deposits on the mainland. The Government has decided that the rate of search for phosphate in Australia should be increased, and it is now considering ways of encouraging private industry to engage in this search. Already there have been signs of companies becoming interested in the search for phosphate. We hope that this trend will intensify. It will certainly be encouraged by the Bureau of Mineral Resources.","PHOSPHATE ROCK DEPOSITS","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1[6]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This has proved a very complex job. As is the case with many such investigations, it has opened out as people have become involved in it. However, I had a discussion the other day with the chairman of the committee, who came to see me about this matter and who gave me a further estimate of the time the committee would take to complete its inquiries. This estimate is confirmed by Sir John Crawford, the vicechairman, whom I saw later. That estimate indicates that we should have the report in October. The committee has admittedly taken longer than we had expected it would, but I believe that its report will be all the more valuable when it comes to us.

Undoubtedly this is partly the result of the assistance given by the Commonwealth Government by way of a bounty on superphosphate. In fact, the usage this year is 17 per cent, greater than it was last year.I should think that the increase of 17s. a ton in the price of superphosphate is due partly to the increased cost of phosphate rock and partly to the freights charged for transporting surpluses from other States to assist the users of superphosphate in New South Wales. There has been a review of the price in recent days, and as a result it is to be reduced by 3s. 6d.. a ton. So, instead of being 1 7s. greater than the original figure, the price will now be 13s. 6d. greater.As honorable members know, A.C.F. and Shirleys Fertilisers Ltd. is extending its works considerably.

As a result, our industry has not been obliged to press its meat on the United States market.

95,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HASLUCK, Paul","ZL6","Curtin","LP","Minister for External Affairs",20,"* - by leave - Honorable members will already be aware of the events in the Gulf of Tonkin on August 2nd and 4th but I am taking this early opportunity after the re-assembling of the Parliament to place these matters on record and to inform the House of the views of the Australian Government on the situation.On 2nd August, the United States destroyer  Maddox  which was on routine patrol in the Gulf of Tonkin, was attacked, some 30 miles off shore, by three North Vietnamese fast patrol boats using torpedoes and machine gun fire. The attack was deliberate and made in daylight on the high seas. The  Maddox  returned the fire and disabled one vessel. Subsequently the President of the United States issued a statement announcing that the Navy had been instructed to continue the patrols with two destroyers instead of one; that the destroyers would be provided with air cover; and that they had been ordered to attack any force which attacked them. North Vietnam was warned of the consequences of any further incidents.On the night of 4th August the  Maddox  and a second destroyer,  C Turner Joy , were attacked about 60 miles off the coast by a number of vessels under cover of darkness. This attack was planned and deliberate. It was beaten off, two of the attacking vessels being sunk and two damaged.In pursuance of the warning previously given, President Johnson announced that repeated acts of violence against the armed forces of the United States  must be met not only with alert defence but with positive reply. Yet, he said, the response for the present would be  limited and fitting . It is well to place on record the Presidents words -We Americans know, although others appear to forget, the risk of spreading conflict. We still seek no wider war.Aircraft of the United States ships  Constellation  and  Ticonderoga  attacked the bases from which the North Vietnamese craft operated. Some 25 motor torpedo boats were destroyed or damaged and an oil depot was in large part destroyed. Since that action on the night of 4th August there have been no further incidents. The United States has deployed greater strength into the area.At the same time as he announced these actions, President Johnson instructed that the matter be raised immediately and urgently before the Security Council of the United Nations. This has been done and the Security Council has commenced discussion of the question.On 6th August the United States Congress was put in possession of the facts and the Senate and the House passed a resolution, both parties supporting it, approving the Presidents actions. This resolution is of such historic importance that I quote the operative paragraphs in full:The Congress approves and supports the determination of the President, as Commander-in-Chief, to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attacks against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression.The United States regards as vital to its national interest and to world peace the maintenance of international peace and security in South-East Asia.Consonant with the Constitution and the Charter of the United Nations and in accordance with its obligations under the South-East Asia Collective Defense Treaty, the United States is, therefore, prepared, as the President determines, to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any member or protocol state of the South-East Asia Collective Defense Treaty requesting assistance in defense of its freedom.This resolution shall expire when the President shall determine that the peace and security of the area is reasonably assured by international conditions created by action of the United Nations or otherwise except that it may be terminated earlier by concurrent resolution of the Congress.I commend a study of that resolution to honorable members. That expression by a great power, through the voice of the representatives of its people, is a signal that will hearten those who resist aggression throughout the world.Most Australians clearly recognise that, in a world where there is aggression, peace can be established and the principles of the United Nations Charter applied only after aggression has been made to fail. The Government, the Congress and the people of the United States of America have gained our respect and honour for their acceptance of the great responsibilities that come with great power and for their sober, determined but restrained use of their power for the peace and security of other peoples. Do not let us forget that the immediate gains in security out of these incidents have been greater for the people of the South-East Asian region than for the peoples of North America.Immediately on receiving news of the events I have just recounted I issued a statement on behalf of the Australian Government reading in part as follows -The Australian Government believes that the United States Government could do no less than take the necessary military measures to protect its naval vessels from attack in international waters. The action by the United States in defence of its forces and in defence of the principles of the freedom of the high seas - a matter of paramount importance to Australia - has obliged the United States, in the words of President Johnson, to take action against certain supporting facilities in North Vietnam which have been used in these hostile operations. The Government believes that this action was completely justified as North Vietnam could not be left undisturbed in its capacity to launch and renew such attacks.The Australian Government notes that the action being taken by the United States Forces against North Vietnam bases and supporting facilities was described by President Johnson as limited and fitting and that the United States was seeking a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the situation today.In confirming that statement I should like to remind honorable members of the fact that the incidents in the Gulf of Tonkin are part of a long sequence of aggression in South East Asia. They should be viewed in the context of danger throughout this region and not as an isolated event. Although all of us hope fervently for peace and for good relations with our neighbours, let none of us be blind to the realities of power. North Vietnam, which possesses the largest army on the South-East Asian mainland and which has behind it the even greater power of mainland China, has been active in war, infiltration, terrorism and subversion in South Vietnam and Laos. This is the fact that shakes the stability of the region, threatens the political independence of nations and prevents its people from enjoying the social and economic progress that could otherwise be their lot. In the face of events, the Australian Government is convinced that, whatever posibilities the future may hold for a genuine settlement in the region, there is no current alternative to the effort of assisting in South Vietnam to preserve its independence and there is no current alternative to using force as necessary to check the southward thrust of militant Asian Communism. Our own defence measures and such aid as we have been able to give to neighbouring states are influenced by this realisation. It is our hope that the restrained but determined actions of the United States will have a strong deterrent effect on the aggressor and lead to second thoughts by those who seek peace only by crushing free nations.In seeking peace as the final objective of our policy, we recognise the need at the present time for the deterrent effect of power, and we ourselves within the limits of our capacity are determined to stand with our allies in S.E.A.T.O. in the defence against Communist aggression in South East Asia. Our own security in Australia is inseparable from the security of the region. We cannot profess to be concerned with the one without being ready to do something about the other. Although we continue to watch events closely and with deep concern, there is at present no reason to assume that the conflict will extend. Wc will continue to use every diplomatic opportunity that presents itself to seek peace and we are confident that is also the purpose of our allies. The firmness and promptness shown in meeting hostile action have been matched in the past and will be matched in the future by our allies by firmness, patience and restraint in the face of more subtle threats to peace.Australia will make its own decisions from time to time in keeping with its responsibility to the Australian people and its commitments to its allies, and we will make our own judgments and offer our own comments on the changing world scene. Our support in this case was considered and not automatic. At the present juncture and dealing with the incidents now under notice we do not qualify in any way our plain statement to the United States and to the world that we support the action of theUnited States and believe it to have been justified by the circumstances that provoked it and by its effect on the endeavours to bring peace to South East Asia.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
96,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CALWELL, Arthur","BV8","Melbourne","N/A","Leader of the Opposition",22,". - by leave - There is no such thing as a bipartisan foreign policy in this country. The Americans may have such a thing, but we in Australia have not. Earlier I suggested to the Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Hasluck) that he might make this statement tomorrow, after which we could have a real debate on what Australias attitude ought to be in the light of the Vietnam crisis, in the light of the Malaysian-Indonesian crisis and in the light of Cyprus. But we certainly cannot have a debate on it tonight. I could speak now and perhaps go until a quarter to six, but nobody else could take part in the debate after that for the obvious reason that the Budget is to be presented at 8 oclock.There is only one thing for the Minister to do, now that he has refused my request that he delay his speech until tomorrow, and that is to ask somebody on his side of the House to move:  That the House take note of the paper. The debate could then be resumed on Thursday. Thursday might be a better time because there is enough work before the House to keep it occupied tomorrow. We are most anxious that we should have an opportunity to state our case. Our quarrel with the Government - I make this observation now so that Ministers may think about it - is that our commitments to these various trouble spots are made without any treaty obligations on our part or on the part of anybody else. We do not desire to see another eighth division of Australian troops sucked into an Asian jungle or swallowed up by the quicksands of Asia. If we are to be committed, we ought to know the extent of the commitment. The commitment cannot be made piecemeal - 23 men to South Vietnam as instructors one day, SO another day, and so on.We want a more definitive statement than the Minister has presented. We would not mind another statement being made to the House; we would welcome it. But we would like it to be as full as possible - much fuller than the statement that the Minister has just made. His reasons for making that statement are his own. TheDepartment of External Affairs may think it desirable that a statement be made immediately the Parliament resumes. Maybe foreign diplomats want to know what the Government is thinking. I do not think anybody would get much information on where the Government is going or what it intends to do from the statement that has been made today. To us it sounds like a propaganda statement, full of pious platitudes. The lives of Australians will be involved in these South East Asian troubles. Therefore somebody - perhaps it should be the Minister for External Affairs, for whose integrity and capacity I have a great respect - should make a statement.The extraordinary point about this matter is that the Vietnam trouble exploded eight days ago and we have not yet heard one word about it from the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Menzies). The Minister for External Affairs made a statement on the night the trouble between the North Vietnamese and the Americans erupted; but the Prime Minister, who is so glib in telling us about the new arrangements with the United States in regard to an extended Fulbright scholarship scheme, is as silent as the grave on this issue. The Prime Minister of Australia ought to come out and say what is the attitude of his Government on all these matters. He should not leave it to the Minister for External Affairs, no matter how competent the Minister is.I ask that after this debate is adjourned the Government consider whether it will make a wider and fuller statement on all the issues involved. Immediately after the Minister has made that statement the Government should permit the Parliament to debate all these issues over a period of a day. A day is not too long to spend on foreign affairs. What happens in the trouble spots in Asia is much more important to Australia and Australias future than what will be announced in the Budget tonight. There will be all sorts of publicity for the Budget; there will be great displays about it in the Press. But the statement made by the Minister for External Affairs will receive the scantest notice in the Press of Australia tomorrow. The Treasurer (Mr. Harold Holt) will make his Budget Speech to-night, and the affluent, greedy and avaricious sections of the community will scan the newspapers to see how much more they are to be asked to pay for the defence of this nation and to enable us to honour our treaty obligations.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

164,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HOLT, Harold","009MC","HigginsTreasurer","LP","N/A",31,". - I move -That the Bill be now read a second time.In speaking to this motion, it is my privilege to present the Budget proposals of the Government for the financial year 1964-65. By way of background to these proposals, I should first like to talk briefly and generally about the condition of our economy and about the possibilities ahead so far as we can see and judge them.Altogether, 1963-64 was a year of notable economic achievement for Australia. Admittedly we had a fair share of good fortune. At home, the seasons stood to us again. Abroad, the prices of a number of our main exports rose and some commodities, like wheat and sugar, found wider markets than we would normally have expected. Conceding that, however, I think it fair to say that the economy put up a good performance in terms of enterprise and effort and output. As opportunities showed up, industries and the people who work in them responded quickly and effectively.To take a few main points from the record - civilian employment increased in the twelve months to the end of May by 142,000 or 4.3 per cent, and unemployment fell by 33,000. At the end of June, the total of registered applicants for jobs was a little above 1 per cent, of the work force. Most of the very large number of young people coming forward for employment in the year were speedily and satisfactorily absorbed.Over the year there was a big increase in production as a whole and in all its main branches. A good many industries set up new output records; hardly any failed to show some improvement on the year before. Building and construction started the year high and kept on rising. Activity in transport, communications and the service occupations generally ran high. The volume of trade rose steadily and there was a further great rise in motor vehicle sales.On preliminary figures put out by the Commonwealth Statistician, wages and salaries increased last year by 9 per cent., company income by 10 per cent., farm income by 26 per cent, and gross national product by 9 per cent. The big rise in exports had, of course, a lot to do with this.Externally, the results of the year were quite spectacular. Exports ° reached £1,374,000,000 which was £309,000,000 above the high total of the previous year. Even though imports rose strongly in the later part of the year, our receipts from abroad greatly exceeded outgoings and our overseas reserves increased by £228,000,000 to a total of £854,000,000. By a considerable margin, that is the largest amount of overseas reserves we have ever held at the end of a financial year.Yet, notwithstanding all this rise in incomes and activity and expenditure, and despite considerable increases in wage rates and earnings, consumer goods prices remained stable until the later part of the year, when they began to show a rising trend. In the June quarter of this year the consumer price index was 1.7 per cent, higher than in the June quarter of 1963. Ii is noteworthy also that, while the exceptional rise in exports had added greatly to incomes, the disturbing effects which in other times it would probably have had have so far been fairly successfully contained.In this condition of high domestic activity and great external strength, we have moved into 1964-65. To state very broadly our expectations for the year, we think that there can be, and will be, a further considerable rise in employment, production and general activity but that, for sheer physical reasons, this can hardly be expected to equal the rather phenomenal results of 1963-64. Labour, if nothing else, is likely to be a limiting factor. There will be an increase in the work force this year - in fact a substantial increase. It may even be somewhat greater than that of last year. It will come partly from local sources - the excess of young people taking their first jobs over the number of older people leaving the work force for one reason or another - and there will be a considerable gain from migration, which is running strongly. But the difference is that, unemployment being now so low, there could scarcely be any great back flow of people to jobs from that source, such as occurred in 1963-64 when unemployment was reduced by 33,000. Besides, overtime working is already very high and it is probable that employers have already called quite heavily on the body of people in the community who normally take jobs only in times of strong labour demand. There have, of course, been shortages of some types of skilled labour for a long time past and these are getting more serious. Now, in some industries and areas, there are shortages of unskilled labour as well.Plant capacity seems generally adequate as yet and it is being increased all the time; but it must by now be much more extended than it was some time ago. Similarly as to materials - there are few signs of shortages but sources of supplies are being called upon more and more heavily.While the possibilities of increasing output are thus clearly limited, demand, in the shape of both current and capital expenditure, has been, and is, strongly on the rise, Last year, personal consumption expenditure increased by 6 per cent., public authority current expenditure by 13 per cent., private fixed capital expenditure by 11 per cent, and public authority capital expenditure by 11 per cent. All this adds up to a very formidable rate of growth in demand and there is every sign that it is continuing to increase. In particular, consumer spending, which is by far the largest element and which has shown the slowest increase so far, seems certain to rise as employment and earnings increase. The recent basic wage increases alone will add something like £100,000,000 a year to wage and salary incomes.Concurrently, there has been a,.jj-eat growth in the volume of money. Through 1963-64 the total of bank deposits, notes and coins available to the public - already high when the year began - rose by no less than 12 per cent. Savings bank deposits alone rose by £268,000,000. Besides this cash in hand, the business world and people at large are in a position to draw upon large overdraft limits established with the trading banks. In addition, of course, there is a great wealth of consumer credit facilities available.To put the position briefly, then, we have every reason to expect a further good increase in production this year. But there is also a strong likelihood that demand for goods and services will increase further and faster than supplies, at least in some quarters. Of course, we are in a position to afford more imports if we need them and there is no doubt that imports will in any case rise considerably. But we cannot readily get from overseas anything and everything we want and some of the things we do get are likely to be more costly than local products.Hence, our problem is very much one of keeping things in line. Employment and production, we can be sure, will continue to grow at a quite high rate. What we have to ensure is that demand does not rise excessively. Should it do so, there could soon be over-strong competition for goods and labour and materials. Costs and prices would be driven up. Speculation could break out again. Imports could rise excessively and lead to a greater rundown of our overseas reserves than we would care to see. That would be the end of the stability which has meant so much to the Australian economy and its people over the past several years.","N/A","APPROPRIATION BILL 1964-65","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We have also had to give serious consideration to the trend of defence expenditure and its significance for the Budget. I do not think anyone seriously questions what we are doing to step up defence preparations but the fact must be faced that defence preparations are costly - costly in terms not only of money but of resources. The £297,000,000 provided for this year amounts to an increase of £99.000.000 or 50 per cent, over expenditure in 1960-61, four years ago. That increase is strongly reflected in this Budget. But since much the greater part of our defence spending takes place in Australia, this also represents a heavy additional call on manpower, material- and equipment.

So far as income tax is levied this year on the incomes of individuals, companies and other businesses derived in t963-64, it will reflect the generally buoyant conditions of that period. There is perhaps one offset to this worth mentioning. The amount of provisional tax debited last year to taxpayers subject lo provisional tax was comparatively large and since, in this year, it becomes a credit in the assessment of those taxpayers, it will diminish revenues collected from them.","N/A","REVENUE AND OTHER RECEIPTS, 1964-65","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[21]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

This Bill contains those appropriations for which, in the opinion of the Government and its legal advisers, a good case can not be made out for the view that they are for the ordinary annual services of the Government. During these intervening months, further consideration has been given to this classification of appropriations. Discussions on this question are continuing and pending their completion, no alteration has been made to the form of the Bills which was adopted in May.The main points regarding the proposed expenditures contained in this Bill are dealt with in my Budget Speech.

It is estimated that this increase will produce additional revenue of the order of £6,250,000 in a full year and £5,000,000 for 1964-65.

327,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ADERMANN, Charles","JLR","Fisher","CP","Minister for Primary Industry",84,". - I move -That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill provides for the raising of loan moneys amounting to £4,500,000 for war service land settlement in the States of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania during the 1964-65 financial year. As honorable members are aware the Commonwealth is responsible for the provision of the whole of the capital moneys required for the scheme in those three States. It is anticipated the money will be made available in the following amounts -N/AAs I pointed out when introducing a similar bill to Parliament last year repayments which were formerly paid to the credit of the Loan Fund and became available for reuse are now being paid to the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The amount of £4,500,000 is, therefore, the gross amount required for grants under the States Grants (War Service Land Settlement) Act 1952-53.In Western Australia only minor development work has still to be completed and nearly all the money provided will be required for making advances to settlers for working capital, including replacement stock and plant. It is a basic principle of the scheme that lack of capital by an applicant is not a bar to participation in the scheme. In fact, most settlers have borrowed their full financial requirement, any private capital they had being required to meet costs associated with the move to and the furnishing of their new homes.As security for the advances made to settlers, a mortgage over the lease is taken with collateral bills of sale, and so on, over stock and plant. Consequently, the settlers usually have no acceptable security to offer to those institutions normally operating in the field of rural credit. While the Commonwealth has no desire to compete with these institutions, there is no alternative to providing the reasonable requirements of settlers for credit until they reach a stage of financial solvency which will justify some security documents being discharged.In South Australia there is still some development work to be completed on holdings on Kangaroo Island, mainly on those in the Hundreds of Ritchie, Gosse and Borda towards the western end of the Island. It is also estimated about £100,000 will be spent in respect of farms in the Loxton irrigation area, mainly on work associated with the drainage of the farms and the replacement of certain irrigation channels with pipelines. However, as with Western Australia, the bulk of the provision of £1,085,000 for South Australia will be required for advances to the settlers, although the average per capita demand will not be as high. Co-operative societies, packing houses, and so on, are meeting some settlers requirements for working expenses in the irrigation areas and many settlers have chosen to obtain part of their financial requirements from stock firms.In Tasmania work is still proceeding on holdings on King and Flinders Islands and at Togari - previously known as Montagu Swamp. Provision is also made in the amount to be made available to Tasmania this financial year for the cost of credits to be given to settlers on these projects for work they have done towards bringing their farms to the desired standard of development.While an end is now in sight for work of developmental nature it will be necessary for the Commonwealth to provide annually for moneys required to make credit facilities available to settlers for some years to come.I commend the Bill to honorable members.Debate (on motion by Mr. Crean) adjourned.","Second Reading","LOAN (WAR SERVICE LAND SETTLEMENT) BILL 1964","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[38]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

329,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BURY, Leslie","JTP","Wentworth","LP","Minister for Housing",85,". - I move -That the Bill be now read a second time.The purpose of this Bill is to authorise the raising of loan moneys not exceeding £51,350,000 for financial assistance to the States for housing. In accordance with Che requests of the States, and with the approval of the Australian Loan Council, this amount of £51,350,000 would be allocated as follows -N/AHonorable members will appreciate that it is the States themselves, not the Commonwealth, which decide what volume and proportion of loan funds shall be devoted to housing. The amount for which parliamentary approval is now being sought is some £1,500,000 more than the amount originally approved for housing in 1963-64.Advances to the States will be made under the authority of the Housing Agreement Act 1961, which runs to 30th June 1966 and authorises the Treasurer to make advances to the States for housing purposes. These advances are repayable over 53 years and bear interest at 1 per cent, per annum below the long term bond rate. At least 30 per cent, of the amount advanced to each State must be allocated by the State to what is called the Home Builders Account. Advances are then made from this account to building societies and other approved institutions which, in turn, make loans to individual home builders.During the past three years the Commonwealth advanced almost £150 million to theStates for housing purposes. Of this amount, close to £100 million was allocated to State housing authorities who used this money to construct 31,900 dwellings. The remaining £50 million was advanced through the Home Builders Account. Funds in the Account were used to make loans to some 19,700 individuals who acquired their own homes. Of the advances made to each State housing authority, up to 5 per cent., or such greater sum as may be agreed, shall be used, if the Commonwealth so requests, for the construction of dwellings for serving members of the forces. Under this arrangement the Commonwealth must make available to the States for the housing of servicemen an amount at least equal to that allocated by the State for this purpose. During the past three years the Commonwealth has so allocated a sum of £4,800,000.Funds provided under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement have made a significant contribution to the financing of dwelling construction in Australia. In particular, they have been of very great assistance to many people seeking to acquire their own homes. It is expected that of the total of £51,350,000 to be advanced by the Commonwealth in the current financial year, some £33,750,000 will be allocated by the States to their housing authorities for dwelling construction, and about £17,600,000 to Home Builders Accounts. This year the States have indicated an intention to increase the funds allocated to the Home Builders Accounts for advances to building societies and other approved institutions. This will, I am sure, be welcomed by the many Australians who wish to borrow at a reasonable rate of interest to acquire their own homes. These funds will, I hope, not only provide a useful measure of Commonwealth support to the building society movement but also encourage these societies to seek new private deposits.In conclusion, may I mention that, although the total funds allocated by the States for housing under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement will, in 1964-65, be larger than in any previous year, they represent a smaller proportion of the total loan allocation to the States approved by the Loan Council. As I mentioned earlier, the proportion of loan funds allocated to housing is determined by eachState and not by the Commonwealth. However, the number of new dwellings commenced in Australia rose from 88,000 in 1962-63 to 107,000 in the financial year ended last June. This is a record. Loans approved by major financial institutions for new housing, including finance made available by these institutions to co-operative and terminating building societies, increased from £81,400,000 in 1961-62 to £113,300,000 in 1962-63, and to a record £134,500,000 in 1963-64. The trend in housing construction is one of decreasing reliance on governmental activity and increasing private construction. This is a very healthy trend and one that I hope will continue. I commend the Bill to honorable members.","Second Reading","LOAN (HOUSING) BILL 1964","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[39]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

333,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WEBB, Charles","KXI","Stirling","N/A","N/A",86,".- The Opposition will not vote against the second reading of this bill but it will move appropriate amendments. While not opposing the measure, which provides for the establishment of a Commonwealth Bureau of Roads, the Opposition deprecates the fact that it will not help materially to solve Australias transport problems. Whilst the Bureau, as proposed in this measure, will be of little or no benefit in the serious transport situation that faces us, it could be a start and from it could develop a body that may have teeth in it some time in the future. That is why the Opposition will not vote against the measure. We will criticise its weaknesses and move amendments and we will outline the type of authority that the Australian Labour Party would like to see set up by the Government. We hope that the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Mr. Freeth) will take notice of what we have to say and even at this late stage will re-examine this bill and amend it so that the proposed body can get down to the gigantic task of grappling with our roads problem. In his second-reading speech, the Minister for Shipping and Transport drew attention to the seriousness of the matter. He said -Transport costs make up a substantial part of total production costs, and road transport now represents the largest element in land carriage of goods and people. Moreover, expenditure on roads now comprises approximately one-quarter of all public works expenditure in Australia, and its impact on economic conditions, both generally and in particular areas, is significant.Having made that statement, the Minister has brought down this anaemic, almost useless bill. Australia is the tenth largest trading nation in the world and consequently costs are important to us. Moving people and goods in this country accounts for about 25 per cent, of the national income. About one-sixth of the work force of Australia is employed in transport. High transport costs are a serious handicap to the development of our manufacturing industries. As I have said, about 25 per cent, of our national income is spent on transport costs. This compares with 9 per cent, in Canada and 10 per cent, in the United States of America. Of course it is inevitable that our transport costs should be high because of the size of Australia compared with its small population. But while the U.S.A. is approximately equal to Australia in area, the population of the United States totals about 188 million compared with approximately 11 million people in Australia. The disparity in transport costs in relation to national incomes - 25 per cent, in Australia compared with 10 per cent, in the U.S.A. - is too great and emphasises the need for us to achieve the greatest possible efficiency and economy in transport.We can achieve this only by developing a national transport system and it must be adequate to meet the needs of future development. It must co-ordinate all forms of transport so that the most economical use is made of each means of transport. Modes of transport must supplement rather than compete with each other. Road, rail and air transport and shipping should all fit into a national plan. Unless the Government gets down to a job of that type, there will be no immediate solution to our transport problems. The only body that can initiate a national plan is the Commonwealth Government but unfortunately it will not take the initiative. The puerile way in which it has framed this bill is an indication of how weak the Government is in the handling of this very important problem.In his second-reading speech, the Minister for Shipping and Transport referred to the fact that the Prime Minister, in his policy speech, had envisaged a national roads authority. Surely this Bureau is not the national authority referred to by the Prime Minister. This Bureau will have no authority to act. It will merely investigate and report. Its grave weakness was revealed in the Ministers speech when he stated -The Bureau will report to the Government on its investigations but it will be for the Government to decide whether or not such reports will be published.I emphasize that the Bureau will be an investigating and advisory body only. Why should not the reports of this Bureau be presented to the Parliament? Why should not we know what is contained in those reports? What incentive will there be for the Bureau to do its work to the fullest extent to which it is capable if its reports are possibly not going to see the light of day? These reports should not only be presented to Parliament; they should be published and available to all interstate bodies and persons.The Opposition has been most active regarding the transport problem that faces Australia. Honorable members will remember that it was the Opposition .that presented its report on rail standardisation before the Government committee presented its report on the same subject. It is true that the reports were on similar lines, but the fact is that the Opposition presented a report in the first place. Yet, in regard to this important matter, it is going to be deprived of even the right to see the Bureaus report and examine the result of its investigations unless the Minister decides that the report should be placed before the Parliament.What value will these reports have if they are merely to be pigeon-holed? It is hard enough to get action when reports are tabled. For instance, I mention the report of the Constitutional Review Committee which was printed in 1959. That report was tabled, of course, but there has still been no action in regard to it. Incidentally, part of it dealt with this particular problem. The Opposition wants the right not only to peruse the reports but to analyse them and, if it thinks necessary, to move in accordance with the reports. It wants to use the forms of the House to get the action it thinks necessary. The Australian Automobile Association also asks that these reports be published.The Opposition will move amendments at the appropriate time to provide for the tabling of these reports and for the publication of an annual report by the Bureau. I remind the Minister again that other countries which have a bureau of the type envisaged in this Bill present annual reports which are published and made available to those who desire to see them. Transport is one of the most important issues that come before this Parliament. It is related to the development of Australia and, above all, it is related to the defence of Australia. The proposal to set up a Commonwealth Bureau of Roads without any authority whatever, and without even having the right to have its reports considered by the very body that establishes it, is an insult to those who will be appointed to theBureau and an insult to this Parliament. It is not what Labour envisages as an answer to our national transport problem.At the last elections, the Australian Labour Party set forward a policy which 1 will quote to the House now so that honorable members will see what we intended to do in relation to a national roads programme. We wanted the return to the States of all petrol tax. We wanted to provide for the establishment of a national roads board to plan national highways and ascertain the best means of financing a national highway system. In the United States there is a Bureau of Public Roads which gathers facts about public road needs, assists and encourages roads research and plans federal road policies. The present national roads system of the United States was developed under the guidance of the Bureau of Public Roads. Canada, France and Germany also show the value of national roads planning. This measure, although it is a start, does not go far enough, in our view.In his second-reading speech, the Minister said that during the next five years the Commonwealth would return to the States £375 million for roads. The amount spent on roads by the Commonwealth is not equal to the amount that it collects in petrol tax. In 1963, the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities estimated the cost of a ten years road programme ending in lune 1974 at £3,615 million. This is the amount that the State and Commonwealth authorities must raise for road purposes. The estimate was the result of the work of State road authorities, whose inquiries extended over a number of years. They agreed on a required standard. Only matters that were, in their opinion, absolutely necessary were included in the estimate.The estimated revenues available for these purposes amount to £2,450 million. This leaves a deficiency for the period of 10 years of £1,165 million. The increased Commonwealth grant for road purposes, which was placed before the House in the Commonwealth Aid Roads Bill, amounts to £125 million, with a matching grant of £45 million. A total of £170 million will be available for the period to 1969. If the same grants are made during the period of five years ending in 1974, the deficit over the 10 years will still be £885 million. I give these figures to show that the Commonwealth is not doing nearly enough to help solve the roads problem.In 1944 fewer than one million vehicles were on the roads. Today, more than three million vehicles are on the roads and by 1974 it is estimated there will be more than six million vehicles or almost one vehicle for every two persons. Unfortunately, expenditure on the roads has not kept pace with the increased use of the roads. Since 1949, petrol consumption has risen by 170 per cent., but expenditure on roads has increased by only 110 per cent. This emphasises the point I am making.Sufficient credit has not been given to the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities for the work that it has done in presenting the problem to the Commonwealth Government. The Association is an organisation of central road authorities in the six States, together with the road constructing authorities in the Commonwealth territories. It was established in 1934 and has served to provide a means of pooling technical and administrative experience, of co-ordinating and rationalising road research projects, of harmonising and coordinating standards, of ascertaining and publishing facts about Australias principal roads and their financing, and developing an informed national outlook on Australias road problem. There has been close co-operation between the States on this matter. Their outlook has been a national one in the real sense of the word. The road problem of one State has, to some degree, become the concern of all States and as a result the national outlook to which I have referred has developed. Unfortunately, this Government has not taken sufficient notice of the recommendations of the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities. If it had, we would not be faced with the present serious road problem. A national authority on transport, such as that envisaged by the Opposition, would work in close co-operation with the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities, and this association would provide advice to the national body. Of course, whatever was decided would fit into a national coordinated policy on transport generally.The experts say that, at the increasing rate at which motor vehicles are coming on to the roads, a point could be reached in the next decade when those countries which have built roads to accommodate the vehicles will have an accelerated economic growth through faster transport costs, and those countries that have not kept pace will lose in the economic race. I have already said that transport costs in Australia are greater than transport costs in any comparable country. We must find a way of reducing these costs so that we will be able to compete with other countries.The roads are carrying approximately three-quarters of the total tonnage transported by all means. The survey of the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities revealed that only 14 per cent, of Australian roads are bitumen or concrete, 23 per cent, gravel, 25 per cent, formed and 38 per cent, unformed. This gives some idea of the overall state of our roads. We are spending only £320 a mile on roads. In Australian currency, New Zealand is spending £700 a mile and the United States £1,450 a mile. The Federal Government of the United States is giving enormous financial aid to the States for roads. At present, we have one motor vehicle for every 3.84 persons, but it is expected that by 1974 we will have one motor vehicle for every two persons. Therefore, when we look at this problem we should keep in mind not only the need to overtake the backlog in road construction but also the need to provide for the increasing number of motor vehicles coming on to the roads.Traffic congestion reduces speed and increases petrol consumption. A United Kingdom survey estimates that when the speed of traffic is reduced through congestion to 10 miles an hour petrol consumption increases by about 50 per cent. In addition, we have the wastage of tyres, mechanical parts and manpower. These factors are very important. The running loss through the inferior roads in Australia is estimated to be £1 million a day. My authority is a statement that appeared in the West Australian on 28th May 1962, under the heading Roads Waste £lm. A Day - Professor. The newspaper article states -An inadequate roads system was costing Australia £1,000,000 a day, the professor of traffic engineering at the University of New South Wales, Professor W. R. Blunden, said today.He said the universitys school of traffic engineering had made this estimate after two years of detailed surveys and research.The cost was in time lost by motorists, wasted petrol and the wear and tear on vehicles because of traffic congestion.The survey showed that the loss to motorists in the community because of the present poor road system was £365,000,000 a year.This figure included waste of petrol, wear and maintenance on vehicles and the loss of time to commercial and private motorists on business trips.Other authorities estimate the cost of traffic delays at between £200 million and £400 million a year. I inform the Minister that this information comes from the 1962 proceedings of the Australian Road Research Board.The poor state of the roads is reflected in the lack of road safety in Australia. On the basis of the use of motor vehicles, we stand fourth amongst the nations of the world, but we have the worst safety record. New Zealand has 4.93 deaths for every 10,000 vehicles, the United States five deaths for every 10,000 vehicles and Canada 6.95 deaths for every 10,000 vehicles, but Australia has 8.78 deaths for every 10,000 vehicles. In each of these countries the popularity of the motor vehicle in greater than in Australia. For instance in the U.S.A. there are 2.53 persons per motor vehicle; in New Zealand, 3.18; and in Canada 3.53, compared with 3.84 in Australia. Although the U.S.A., Canada and New Zealand have a greater density of vehicles, they have lower fatal accident rates than Australia has. It is clear that the state of our roads must have some bearing on the high ratio of road deaths. We should be doing more about this tragic waste of human lives than we are doing at the present time. There will always be some casualties, of course, but if the suffering and the waste of human lives are to be reduced to a minimum we must be prepared to do more about our road problems.The Senate Select Committee on Road Safety assessed the cost of road traffic accidents in 1957-58 at almost £70,000,000. Since that year the number of accidents has increased by 6 per cent. Even though the safety record in the U.S.A. is far superior to our own, that country is not letting the position rest; it is going further into the matter. In support of my statement I quote from  Federal Aid for Highways  at page 7 where the following statement appears -The need for such a program is obvious in todays congestion. We pay dearly for inadequate roads and streets; not just in frazzled nerves and inconvenience and in time and gasoline wasted, but in the prices of everything we buy or sell. Studies of existing freeways shows that in some cases their cost is balanced out by motorists savings in less than 10 years.This is an important point -The safety features of the Interstate System will save at least 5,000 lives a year. Accident rates on freeways are one-third of those on other roads with comparable traffic.Since that report was published, further information has been received in regard to what is expected to be done to save lives. The  A.A.A. Federal News Letter , No. 3, states -Eight thousand lives may be saved annually upon completion of the safety engineered United States National System of Interstate and Defence Highways in 1972. This prediction is based on new statistics recently issued by the United States Bureau of Public Roads.Some 1,130 miles of completed interstate roads have been surveyed, and the Bureau reports a traffic death rate of 2.8 fatalities per 100,000,000 vehicle miles. This contrasts with a rate of 9.7 deaths on the older highways in the same traffic corridors that formerly carried most of the present interstate traffic.The rate is 6.9 deaths for all highways that have been carrying the bulk of traffic to be served by the completed interstate system, thus, travel on the interstate system should be almost 21 times as safe as travel on older highways, and may save 6,000 lives a year.The Bureau study said an additional 2,000 lives may be saved each year because of the reduction of the fatality rate on older highways as they are relieved of traffic by the opening of the interstate system.That emphasises how important it is for us to do more to raise our roads to a higher standard.The State Governments, of course, as far as I can ascertain, spend on roads all the revenue they collect from motor vehicle users. That cannot be said of the Commonwealth Government. The original Federal Aid Roads Act was passed in 1926 and similar acts have been passed since. From 1926 to 30th June 1963, the Commonwealth collected from petrol tax - and latterly from automotive diesel fuel tax - a total of £800,731,000. Over the same period the amounts disbursed to the States amounted to £495,878,000. So, the Commonwealth retained in its Consolidated Revenue during that period not less than £304,853,000. The Treasurer (Mr. Harold Holt) mentioned during the last Budget debate that in the current financial year Commonwealth aid road grants would be £58,000,000, and that in addition the Commonwealth would spend £10,000,000 on roads in the Territories and on special State road projects. These sums total £68,000,000.A statement on page 9 of the Estimates of Receipt and Expenditure for 1963-64 shows receipts from the excise on motor spirit and diesel fuel as amounting to £69,600,000. So, even at that stage, £1,600,000 was going into Consolidated Revenue.During 1964-65 the amount allocated to the States will be £65,000,000, with approximately £9,000,000 in addition being spent on roads in the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and special roads in the States, making a total of £74,000,000. However, as the result of the manner in which petrol consumption is soaring as more vehicles go on to the roads it is clear that the expenditure will be less than the receipts from excise on petroleum products. Expenditure on roads is to go up by £5,000,000 per annum until June 1969, but it still will not catch up with the receipts from the fuel tax.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH BUREAU OF ROADS BILL 1964","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[40]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

335,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"WEBB, Charles","KXI","N/A","N/A","N/A",90,"- The honorable member can answer me when he speaks on this Bill. If the £304,853,000 raised by the Commonwealth from fuel tax and placed in Consolidated Revenue had been used for roads we would not be in the fix that we are in today. At least all the receipts from fuel tax should be earmarked for roads. The Governments of Japan, Sweden, New Zealand and the United States do just that. All of their motor fuel tax revenue is used for road purposes.An outstanding example of a highly organised national roads authority is the United States of America Federal Bureau of Public Roads. Its main function is to administer the distribution of federal aid to the States, but in addition it carries out extensive research on roads. In 1956, the U.S. Government passed the Federal Aid Highway Act which created a Federal Highways Trust Fund into which was to be deposited the receipts from certain federal taxes levied on highway users. I quote again from the  Federal Aid for Highways  at page 16 -In 1956, when Congress increased the ABC Federal aid and launched the tremendous job of completing the interstate system, it recognised that a special financing plan was needed. To pay for the programme, Congress increased some of the federal highway-user taxes and earmarked them specially to go into a Highway Trust Fund, which would be the source of money for federal highway aid. Thus the programme was put on a self supporting, pay as you build basis.The tax structure was modified in 1959 and again in 1961, in order to assure the revenue needed during the next decade. The present tax rales are to be in effect until October 1 1972. Principal revenue source is the motor fuel tax of 4 cents per gallon. There is a tax of 10 cents per lb. on highway vehicle tyres and inner tubes, and of 5 per cents per lb. on retread rubber. There is an annual use tax on heavy vehicles, those over 26,000 lbs. gross weight, of 3 dollars per 1,000 lbs. All of the 10 per cent, tax on the manufacturers sale price on new trucks, buses and trailers goes into the trust fund.I mention that to show that whereas this Government does not even use all of the fuel tax for road purposes, the United States Government uses, not only all the petrol tax it collects, but in addition the other taxes which I have mentioned.The Federal Aid Highway Act authorised the building of a 41,000 miles network now known as the National System of Interstate and Defence Highways. The Federal Government of the U.S.A. assumed 90 per cent, of the financial responsibility for its construction. But in addition the Federal Government increased its annual assistance for primary and secondary roads. This change in policy was described by the United States Bureau of Public Roads in the following terms -Prior to 1956, the Federal excise taxes on motor vehicles, motor fuel, and other products closely associated with the use of motor vehicles were considered to bc general excises, having no legal connection with Federal aid for highways. However in enacting the Federal Aid Highway Act 1956 and its companion legislation, the Highway Revenue Act of 1956, Congress abandoned a historic policyThat policy, of placing revenues from excise taxes on automotive products into the Federal general funds and making appropriations for highways from these general funds, was replaced by a policy of assigning the revenues from specific taxes on highway fuels and automotive products to a segregated highway trust fund to be available for highway appropriations only.The A.A.A. Federal News Letter, portions of which I have been quoting, then goes on to say -New Zealand has a National Roads Board which was established by the National Roads Act 1953. It is doing an excellent job of work.Under the chairmanship of the Minister for Works, the National Roads Board is an organisation representative of private and commercial vehicle owners, the counties, municipalities, the Ministry of Works and the Transport Department.The representative nature- of the Board was adopted to bring to bear on roading matters the widest possible background of knowledge and experience. Although some members are nominated by user organisations and spending authorities, they do not act as delegates for the nominating authorities. Their responsibility is national, not regional, and to the people as a whole who pay the taxes on which the National Roads Fund is based.The money in this fund is derived from the total revenue (less collection expenses) from petrol tax (for a brief period there was a diversion of petrol tax), registration and licence fees, heavy traffic fees, mileage tax, tyre tax, and a contribution of £1 million per annum from Consolidated Fund.This shows that the authorities in New Zealand do not limit expenditure on roads to the amount collected from the petrol tax. They use other funds as well. The Australian Government imposes extensive taxes on motor vehicle users. For the year ended 30th June 1963 the customs duty on motor spirit amounted to £8.8 million, excise duty on motor spirit was £60 million, customs and excise duty on diesel fuel £2.6 million, customs duty on imported motor vehicles and parts £11.8 million, sales tax on private motor vehicles £49.3 million, sales tax on commercial vehicles, motor cycles and spare parts for all types of vehicles, including private motor vehicles, £18.1 million, giving a total in Commonwealth taxes from all these sources of £150.6 million. Payments to the States under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act for the same year amounted to £71.4 million. More than £79 million collected from the road users in that year went into the Consolidated Revenue Fund.The State governments also imposed vehicle taxes, and in that year the State governments raised from these sources £59.2 million. The total of Commonwealth and State taxes was £209.8 million. Although more than £209 million was collected from motor vehicle owners in the twelve months ended 30th June 1963, much less was expended on roads. Labours view is that an authority should be set up similar to that which is in operation in the U.S.A. It should be an authority in the real sense of the word, not one such as that proposed in this measure. In the interests of defence and development this authority, with the co-operation of the States, should accept the responsibility of planning and financing national highways. These highways should form an integral part of the national transport system. They should not be confined to those that connect mainland capitals in eastern States. Other highways should be considered. For instance, the highway from Darwin to Alice Springs should be extended to Port Augusta. Essential arterial roads in Western Australia and in northern Australia should be designed for defence, for mobility and for the movement of mineral and pastoral products. The suggested authority should plan for all-weather sealed roads capable of carrying heavy traffic in northern Australia and in the north west.While I am referring to the north west it is well to mention that the Geraldton Highway is sealed only as far as Carnarvon, 600 miles from Perth. The Great Northern Highway, which connects with the coast highway at Port Hedland, is not sealed at all. These are examples of our highways in the north-west of Australia.When it is suggested that we should spend more money on roads we always hear the cry: How are we going to pay for this?  I have already pointed out that a good deal more is taken from road users through taxation than is expended on roads. Not even all the amount collected by way of petrol tax is expended on roads. It should be remembered that bad roads cost the Australian people about £1,000,000 a day. Let me remind honorable members also of the development that will follow new road construction. Such new construction will encourage a volume of traffic which will, over a period, more than pay for the construction. Without such construction development will be slowed up. In the United States of America it is accepted that road construction made possible the increased traffic that made the country richer. The Government of that country did more than use the amount taken from road users by way of taxation; it borrowed for the purpose of providing the necessary capital. In this connection I would like to read an extract from a document produced by the Australian Development Research Foundation, entitled The Development of Australia- Transport Needs -The most urgent need for development in Australia is for more and better construction of both roads and railways. It would seem that a good case could be made for Commonwealth expenditure on strategic highways at least equal to the amount of taxation, import and excise, collected from road users. In the United States, extensive use is made of tax-free bond issues for highways and bridge construction and these bond issues are amortised largely by toll collections. If the Commonwealth were to take over the responsibility for strategic highway construction, consideration should be given to this method of supplementing the taxation already collected from road users so that toll charges as well as taxation of road users could be used for road construction. No other public expenditures are as important for development and defence as the construction of sealed, all-weather roads to give access to the export resources of north and north-western Australia.I do not necessarily agree with all that is contained in that extract. However, it at least emphasises the fact that the authorities in the U.S.A. are prepared to spend more than they receive from the road users in order to bring their roads up to a proper standard in the interests of defence and development of that country. They believe this is a good investment and that it is more than repaid in the long run.I repeat that what is required is a national programme so that all forms of transport can be co-ordinated, instead of competing with one another. This is the only way to reduce our far too heavy transport costs. Water transport is the cheapest form of transport, and the use of ships should be encouraged for long hauls of large tonnages. At present our ports are inefficient, being administered by 26 different authorities. We have little or no control over overseas shipping. Under such burdens how can our transport system be efficient?Railways are the next cheapest form of transport, but they are not used to the full extent. Traffic that should go to the railways is taken by road while railway deficits continue to increase. Rail standardisation, in my view, and, I think, in the view of all honorable members, will help considerably once the capital cities are linked with the 4 ft. 8} in. gauge, but more will have to be done in that direction. Other main lines need standardising and all the railways need modernising. Full use should be made of the railways in suburban passenger traffic to relieve congestion on the roads. If the railways were subsidised to the same extent as the airlines there would be no railway deficits. We hear railways criticised for having deficits. The Australian Transport Advisory Council estimated in 1956-57 that if airlines were to bear all the costs of air services, passenger and freight charges would have to rise by 21 per cent. If a subsidy similar to that enjoyed by airlines were made available to the railways it would more than cover their deficits.Co-ordination of transport is the answer to the problem. The Interstate Commission already provided for in the Constitution should be re-established. It was recommended by the Australian Labour Partys Transport Committee when it tabled its report in this House in 1956 and it was recommended in the report of the Joint Committee on Consitutional Review in 1959, but nothing has been done about those reports. I am satisfied, I regret to say, that the transport problem will never be solved within the framework of current Government policy or the philosophy of free enterprise.The traffic crisis focuses our attention on the appalling and inevitable inadequacies of public investment under this Government. Both road and rail investments have been inadequate. Raid modernisation and standardisation has not been sufficient to make up for the years of neglect. Road construction has not kept pace with the unplanned outpouring of cars on to the roads. As a result, the nation is suffering the appalling waste due to economic losses from our under-used railways and from our over-used roads at one and the same time. We pay the price in traffic jams and delays, and in road casualties, too. It does not appear in anybodys balance sheets, but that does not make it any the less real. The sheer facts of congestion have driven experts to believe that public transport is the only answer to easy, quick and efficient movement in our cities. The deterioration of public transport is one of the reasons why the move to private car ownership has received such momentum.If we are going to mak; our cities tolerable places in which to live, a completely new structure of planning has got to be established. Problems have got to be seen as a whole - not in the piecemeal manner envisaged in this piece of legislation. That is why I suggest to the Minister that he get down to the job of doing something to coordinate transport as a whole and, as far as this measure is concerned, at least give the legislation some teeth so that it will be able to do the job that is expected of it. This House should receive copies of reports prepared by the proposed bureau from time to time. Those reports should be perused by all interested bodies. In addition, the Parliament should have the opportunity of referring matters to the bureau. I will leave the matter at that and ask the Minister to give earnest consideration to the matters that I have raised on behalf of the Opposition.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH BUREAU OF ROADS BILL 1964","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[40]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
336,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BATE, Henry","JOE","Macarthur","N/A","N/A",93,".- Mr. Deputy Speaker, I think the House is indebted to the honorable member for Stirling (Mr. Webb) for the statistics which he gave on the road problems in Australia. Anybody who has listened to him will agree that he has spent a good deal of time on them. We understand that he has been a member of one of the transport unions and that he is bringing to the Parliament a knowledge of tran port which is important. We must agree with him when he says that transport in Australia is of immense importance. I understand that transport is responsible for nearly 40 per cent, of our internal costs. Most of the products - they are in the main rural products - which have been responsible for raising our export income to £1,370 million - an increase of £309 million in one year - must be transported to the seaboard and must bear the cost of that carriage. Again, many of our manufactured goods often incur transport costs a number of times in moving from one factory to another. Therefore, anything that has to do with transport is of immense importance when we are thinking of costs and competing with people overseas. We agree with the honorable member for Stirling when he talks about this matter and we must commend him for the statistics which he quoted. They will appear in  Hansard  and will be of great importance to us when we are considering this problem.But we do not agree with the honorable members arguments. For instance, we do not agree that an immense bureaucratic, centralised, monolithic authority, to use his own words - an authority with full power in every sense of the term - should make the decisions and have control over the work to be done on roads in Australia.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH BUREAU OF ROADS BILL 1964","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[40]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

338,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BATE, Henry","JOE","N/A","N/A","N/A",94,"- No, but that is the kind of authority that you would have. The socialistic mind is unable to understand the position. If we were to adopt the honorable members suggestion we would have in Canberra a large building of 10 or IS storeys, with acres and acres of office space, occupied by persons who would decide what an engineer would do at, for example, Port Hedland, 3000 miles away, or up in Queensland, or in South Australia, or in Victoria. That is the form of centralised control that you get from the Socialists. Although the matter is not set out in exactly that form in the Labour Partys platform, I take it that the honorable member for Stirling was giving us a new look at Labours policy on transport. He says that the authority he suggests would have full control over planning and designing of roads in Australia. Therefore it would build up a monolithic, bureaucratic, socialised central control.The Bill before the House seeks to do just the opposite to that. We commend the proposal that there shall be a small group comprising a chairman with two part-time helpers at the beginning. These men will call upon road engineers, upon the research organisations in universities and so on for advice. They will call upon fresh minds - not bureaucratic minds but the minds of men who have studied the problem. The honorable member for Stirling says that a bitumen road extends only as far as Carnarvon. I remind honorable members that that would be over a distance of 600 miles, and I do not suppose you would see more than one car an hour if you travelled over the road. Western Australia raided the road funds of the Commonwealth. On some bitumen roads in Western Australia you can travel for hundreds of miles without seeing one car. I repeat that the distance to Carnarvon is 600 miles; yet the honorable member says that the bitumen road extends only as far as Carnarvon. Some time ago we met at Port Hedland a brilliant and noted engineer who was working day and night, endeavouring to evolve a workable system of using local materials for the construction of roads across the millions of acres of that vast country.No other country has the problems that Australia has. We have 2,000 million acres over which to transport enormous quantities of export commodities the price of which probably has dropped a great deal. We may need to produce more than double the quantities we produced in the past in order to get the same money that we then earned. The last published records of the dairy industry show a continuing drop in the price of butter fat over the years, with the exception of this year in which there was a slight increase. The goods that we sell overseas at a lower price attract higher transport costs than goods produced in other countries. In fact, 40 per cent, of the cost of producing these goods is attributable to transport. We agree with the comments of the honorable member for Stirling about the importance of the problem, but we do not agree when it is suggested that the State Governments and the local authorities which are nearest to the work should have the responsibility taken from them.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH BUREAU OF ROADS BILL 1964","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[40]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

340,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BATE, Henry","JOE","N/A","N/A","N/A",94,"- Let me remind the House of what Labour envisages. I carefully wrote down what the honorable member said. These are the words he used:  An authority in the real sense of the word . That is the Socialist approach to such matters. But we will not have any such organisation. We disagree with that proposal.This Bill is designed to establish a small institution which can obtain ideas from the universities and the scientific organisations. Let the university students have a go at this problem. Let them as young members of a brave new world bring forth fresh idea. To do that is more realistic than to set up a huge bureau with authority coming from the top and every member of the staff striving to earn the approval of his boss. We would have only one line of thinking if a bureau such as the Labour Party has suggested were established. Such an organisation would be set up at tremendous cost.At the present time the work is split up amongst some fine road authorities, including the Department of Main Roads in New South Wales. I have in mind, too, the Victorian Country Roads Board and the Queensland Department of Main Roads, which I think were set up before the New South Wales authority. The Main Roads Department of Western Australia was successful in having roads money allocated in accordance with a formula which is based on broad areas as well as population. It seems unfair for one to be able to travel on straight, level roads in South Australia when in some of the other States mountainous areas have been provided with roads at tremendous cost and in flooded areas roads virtually slipped away from under the feet of the engineers while they were being built.The correct approach at this stage of Australias development is for the local authorities to control the construction of roads with the assistance of a co-ordinating authority. The Labour Parly is jumping ahead when it suggests the establishment in Canberra of an authority which would look after beef roads in the north and other roads in Western Australia. In these areas we have men who are dedicated to their job. The roads problem calls for the use of flesh and brains. It is not a matter of saying:  Here is a sum of £375 million; here is the authority. That is not the way in which to approach the matter. We can cast our minds back to the days when roads in New South Wales were constructed by men using horses and drays and picks and shovels. Those men went out to their gangs slowly on Sunday afternoons and started work early on Monday mornings, working for 5, 5i or 6 days a week in times of drought, bush fire and flood. The Clyde Mountain road, which has been financed from a fund which was established to provide access roads to the Australian Capital Territory, was built by men who used horses and drays. The people in the country sought jobs with the road gangs. We can recall the days when small shires took over responsibility for a highway every 100 miles. They looked after their part of the road and put all they had into it. The people who did this work were people in the real sense of the word; they were not planners. Of course, it was impossible to nave planners in those days. But we have evolved to the point where we have the grader, the bulldozer and the bitumen road.We have before us the immense problem of handling transport iri the widest country in the world. Australia has an area of 3 million square miles - 2,000 million acres - and many of us in the last eight years, since we started the Ord River exercise, have been all over Australia. Now everybody wants to follow and to see the sights of this country. People in medium priced cars want to put their bed-rolls or tents in the back of the car or in a caravan and go to the farthermost limits of this great place. However, they cannot get to Cape York as they cannot get past Cooktown.There should be a road from Cooktown to the top of the peninsula, going on past Weipa and the Mitchell River. You can get to the north of Western Australia and can drive to Darwin. At Port Hedland you can see Perth cars on the jetty. The people should be able to get to these places. There is no harm in allowing them to go to these places and to wander under their own steam wherever they want to go. This would be one way to develop Australia - by allowing people to travel, to camp under the stars or stay in motels in the dry season when conditions are perfect. At night, the weather is glorious and warm, and is attractive to people. This country is now beginning to open up. People have said that this country is barren and that it is a desert, except for the lush south-eastern fringe, but now we have found oil coming from artesian basins.We are now discovering gas, which carries rich components called, I think, butane, propane and many other names. Those components can be extracted from the gas, mixed with petrol and burnt as fuel for motor cars. But we cannot have access to that gas without roads, which will enable us to bring the products to the great thermal electricity stations and enable us to enjoy a 20 per cent, decrease in costs year after year because of the richness and great thermal heating of those gases. The real riches of Australia are beneath the ground.- Order! The honorable member must get back to the bill dealing with the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH BUREAU OF ROADS BILL 1964","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[40]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We need a great road system and the Bill now before the House will enable us to have the central group research and planning group research which can bring together the information and supply it to the Commonwealth.The intention of the Bill is to make available to the Commonwealth the information which it must have because the Commonwealth Treasury is involved. If honorable members want any proof of the sincerity of the Government I have only to remind them that under the five year plan the average expenditure on roads each year will be £75 million. Expenditure by a Labour government for roads was about £7 million a year. The last year that the Chifley Government held office its expenditure in this respect was £7 million. I was surprised when the honorable member for Stirling said, if I heard him correctly, that this year a gap of £1.9 million existed between the amount raised in petrol tax and the amount paid out for roads. He said that since petrol tax had been introduced £800 million had been received and that £495 million had been paid out, so in other years there must have been a much larger gap.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH BUREAU OF ROADS BILL 1964","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[40]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That is better than the Chifley Governments £7 million. I know that honorable members opposite will say that we now have more cars and are using more petrol, but the figures I have cited represent hard cash.

345,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BATE, Henry","JOE","N/A","N/A","N/A",96,"- The honorable member for Mallee said that £7 million of the £20 million received in petrol tax was spent by the Chifley Government on roads in its last year, so the Chifley Government put two-thirds of the money into Consolidated Revenue. The honorable member for Blaxland (Mr. E. James Harrison) looks earnestly and worriedly at me because he knows that this is true. This Government gives back over 90 per cent. - nearly 100 per cent, this year - for expenditure on roads, and this is at a time when road building is much more expensive and much more demanding.The honorable member for Stirling says that there are traffic jams on roads in our metropolitan areas. He lauded the American system. What about the traffic jams in America, where people sit for two hours on great road systems? The American Bureau of Public Roads has been operating for 70 years. It has an office of engineering, an office of operations, an office of administration, an office of research, an office of highway safety, an office of planning, and a general council. It is a veritable dream of Parkinson of Parkinsons law fame. In the field regional and divisional officers discharge responsibility for public roads at a local level. A divisional office is located in each state. The tentacles of this enormous Bureau of Public Roads in the United States, costing billions each year, spread to all the States yet there are still traffic jams - much worse traffic jams, I suggest to the honorable member, than there are in Australia. With neurotic Americans involved in those traffic jams, goodness knows what happens when they get out of their cars and sit on the sidewalks, heads in hands, taking powders to try to tranquilise themselves in the awful situation into which they have got. That is the vaunted American situation. The Americans have not solved the problem. As fast as they try to catch up with it the problem eludes them, and more and more motor cars come on to the roads. That is happening in this country also.The approach of this Government to the matter is sound. Something that we heard earlier in the evening shows that what we are doing is economically sound. We are successful and we are prosperous, but this job of roadmaking will confront us to an increasing degree. Of course it is important from the defence point of view. It is important also from the point of view of development, prosperity and reduction of costs. All those factors come into the consideration of the road situation. We ask that this proposal for a small bureau of public roads be given its chance. Here will come into effect the idea, which we have nearly lost in Australia, that there is a big role for private consulting engineers to play. We have great engineering departments with salaried engineers, who take a job for a few years and are then promoted somewhere else. They lose the sense of continued responsibility which is so important in any job. All of the men in our great water works, in our roads departments and in our engineering departments are employed by governments. In Australia there are too few consulting engineers, men with fresh minds who will take on a job and see it through to a finish, whose reputation, chance of existence, and prosperity depend on the completion of a job well done.This proposal supports the idea of consulting engineers. A firm that comes to mind is Gutteridge, Haskins and Davey, which has a very large local authority practice in New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, advising on roads, electricity supply and other projects. These are men of the sort who can bring this matter expert advice which is so different from bureaucratic, departmental ideas. Let us try this method, with private enterprise, consulting engineers, and universities bidding against one another, using their students, and employing the equipment that they undoubtedly have. The University of New South Wales and the University of Sydney come to mind, as do the University of New England and universities in other States. They have a great reservoir of brains, skill and equipment for looking at these jobs. Let us use them. Let us call them in. Let us give them tasks, and get them to carry the tasks right through to completion. To me this is a far sighted solution of the problem. It would get away from the old conception of £ huge department in which everybody is trying to get a smile and, perhaps, promotion, from the man at the top. Let us bring in the fresh ideas from the students and the lecturers at the universities who have studied highway engineering and associated problems. This proposal, I believe, offers a great deal.

James Harrison) adjourned.","Second Reading","COMMONWEALTH BUREAU OF ROADS BILL 1964","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[40]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

His fault was that he thoughtlessly permitted himself to fire with a low trajectory knowing that there could be persons in the general area where the victim was. It was most unlikely that the bullet would have hit anybody, even allowing for its low trajectory, because of the thick belt of rubber trees through which it had to pass.

A rising proportion of total publicity expenditure is being allocated to Asian markets. The Government has simultaneously encouraged greater promotional activity in Asia by Australian exporters. This has been done through such media as the Export Action Television series, special seminars designed to inform exporters about the Japanese market and the wide dissemination to businessmen of printed material describing conditions and prospects in East Asian markets. The response from Australian industry has been good.The Government has given special attention to increasing trade with Asian countries through the following measures: -Trade Commissioner Service.Since 1959, Trade Commissioner posts have been strengthened in Japan, Hong Kong, Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand. A special consultant with wide experience in East Asian commerce was appointed to the Department of Trade and Industry in 1963 to advise on exporting to that area.Trade Fairs.The Government has sponsored major Australian exhibits in international fairs in Osaka and Tokyo, and assisted Australian exporters to arrange exhibitions in Hong Kong and Malaysia.Trade Ships and Missions.Two trade ships, the  Straat Banka  to South East Asia, and the  Chandpara  to Pakistan and South East Asia, were sponsored by the Government and assistance was given to the recent visit to South East Asia of the Australian Chambers of Commerce trade ship, the  Centaur . The Government has, within the last eighteen months, sponsored a foodstuffs mission to Japan and two building material missions to South East Asia.Store Promotions.Food and wine festivals and other promotions have been organized in several large stores in Malaysia, Japan and Hong Kong.Publications.Industry features which highlight Australian industries are continuously being published in newspapers in South-East Asia. In 1963-64 over 50 such supplements, many of them in local foreign languages, will have appeared in ten countries. A quarterly business journal is produced in Japan and a variety of other trade publications about Australian goods are widely distributed in Asia, again using foreign languages whenever practicable.Relations between Governments.The Government has concluded formal trade arrangements with four Asian Governments including Japan, currently Australias biggest overseas market, and two new agreements are under consideration. Talks are being held with India about prospects for expanding trade both ways and similar talks may be held with other countries. The Government welcomes trade missions from Asian countries and assists them as much as possible. An important gesture towards the trade of some of our Asian neighbours was the recent removal of the import duty on tea.","Trade with Asian Countries.

As a first step co-operation was initiated in 1957 through the Australian Advisory Council on Bibliographical Services, an advisory body of Commonwealth, State and university libraries. As a result the Australian Bibliographical Centre in the National Library carried out a survey and in 1960 published a Union List of Newspapers in Australian Libraries . This revealed a need for further co-operative effort to cover the local newspapers of smaller circulation which are valuable source material for the writing of local history. On the advice of the Australian Advisory Council on Bibliographical Services, the Australian Bibliographical Centre in the National Library started the Local Newspaper Project in 1962. This is designed to encourage the active interest of local public libraries and local newspaper offices throughout the Commonwealth in preserving local newspaper files by placing them in local public libraries which are appropriate centres for the collection of source material dealing with the history of their localities. In communities where a library has not yet been established newspaper publishers are urged to transfer their older files to the respective State reference libraries for preservation. As part of the Local Newspaper Project a leaflet has been published and widely distributed. The Australian Advisory Council on Bibliographical Services has also taken an interest in the microfilming of Australian newspapers. The Australian Bibliographical Centre has made a survey of microfilming operations completed or in progress, as a basis for any necessary further action. The results of this survey have been published in The Australian Library Journal.

The Commonwealth Government undertook to place the draft legislation before the Commonwealth Parliament, if all the States approved of the draft legislation. The provisions of the draft legislation have been explained to the Council of Egg Marketing Authorities of Australia and the Council has endorsed them.As I pointed out in 1. above the draft legislation will be submitted to the Commonwealth Parliament only after all State Governments have approved. The position of the Sates in this respect is that general approval has been obtained from all States except South Australia and Tasmania. The Tasmanian Government is waiting on the decision of the South Australian Government before considering the draft legislation. The South Australian Government has advised that it will support the draft legislation if it is approved by a poll of producers in South Australia.","Eggs.

The intention is to operate the laboratory at Chatswood until such time as a permanent laboratory can be erected as part of the Film Unit headquarters at Lindfield.The transfer of the laboratory from Melbourne to Sydney is being effected in the interests of efficiency, economy and quality of output. It will enable more effective supervision of processing and printing, will eliminate delays and expenditure on freight and telephone charges inevitable with the separation of the laboratory from unit headquarters and will eventually provide properly designed premises for the laboratory and its staff.A new establishment to operate the laboratory when it is transferred to Sydney will be sought from the Public Service Board. All members of the present staff will be eligible to apply for the positions on the new establishment. Every effort will be made to find positions in other branches of the Commonwealth Service in Melbourne for those who are not accommodated on the new establishment, either because of unwillingness to transfer to Sydney for other reasons.","Commonwealth Film Laboratory.

No assurances were given or could bc given that such conditions would remain unchanged for an unlimited period. As you know, conditions for sale of houses have changed from time to time, even during the past five years. Those 1963 transferees who elected during the first four or five months to buy their houses were able to purchase on current terms. These terms were then changed, not all to the detriment of the purchaser. For example, the deposit was reduced from 10 per cent, to 5 per cent, which made it possible for greater numbers of people to be able to purchase their own houses. The current conditions of sale of Government cottages to tenants who wish to buy them are most favorable and include the following terms -a deposit of 5 per cent, on the total purchase price only, with no limit on the outstanding amount for which a mortgage would be given;interest at 4$ per cent, per annum on the outstanding amount covered by the mortgage;repayment over any period up to 45 years;that the sale price of houses will not exceed its market value.Yes. This has always been, and will continue to be the practice.No. Policy in this matter was not under review early in 1963. Delays in offers of sale which occurred prior to September 1963 when the new policy was announced were unavoidable. They were due to acute shortages of staff in the Valuation Section of the Taxation Branch of the Department of the Treasury, and in the Housing Branch of the Department of the Interior, coupled with a considerable increase in the number of tenants seeking valuations, possibly because of the attractiveness of the terms.","Canberra Housing.

Students who are receiving full time education, other than secondary education, in pursuance of a training agreement with another person to remain or engage in employment on completion of their studies, and who receive a wage, salary or allowance from that other person, are regarded under the Act as being in employment. Student endowment is therefore not payable in respect of such children. All claims for student endowment are closely examined to see whether the child is a party to a training agreement with another person and, if so, whether he receives payment from that other person. A trainee teacher who is not subject to these conditions may qualify as a student child for endowment purposes. Not all trainee teachers are parties to a training agreement whilst others are not in respect of payments.","Social Services.
