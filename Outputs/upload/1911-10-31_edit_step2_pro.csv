The matter is one coming, not under my control,. but under the control of the President, as Chairman of the House Committee. On my mentioning the subject to him he was good enough to instruct the secretary of the Committee to supply me with a statement, from which I learn that the total expenditure during the month of November last year on wines, beers, spirits, &c, was £6j 5s. 6d., and the daily expenditure for twenty-seven days, £i 9s. rod. The expenditure per head, distributing it among those who, according to the newspaper article, have access to the refreshment rooms, namely, 112 members of Parliament, to Hansard officials, it> officers, and 20 journalists, would be 3$d., or, distributing it amongst members solely, Sid. It should be pointed out, however, that in addition to those named in the article as consuming liquor, there is the large number of visitors who frequent the House, and from time to time are entertained by honorable members. I- am certain that the actual expenditure by honorable members on alcoholic liquors in the month specified1, did not exceed, on the average, i\A. per man per day, and if the average were taken for a period of a year, it would not be more than a small fraction of a penny. The newspaper article would make it appear to the average reader that the refreshments consumed on the premises are not paid, for by honorable members, but members and others pay for all that they get.","PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMENT ROOMS","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

However. I shall pass that over. Nothing that the Prime Minister has said alters for one moment, it seems to me, our responsibility to carefully examine this measure. I have not been speaking upon it up to the present time, so that it cannot be charged against me that I have been endeavouring to obstruct its passage ; but I do say, in the most unqualified way, that the Opposition will neglect its duty if, because the Prime Minister has made a general statement of that character, which might lead us to believe that it had some application to the solution of the trouble in Sydney, it does not examine the measure with proper care. Unless that insinuation, was intended by the right honorable member, I fail to see why he should have risen, to speak as he did. As far as I can see,, the position- as regards urgency for the Bill is exactly the same to-day as it was on Friday. I think it was very unfair, indeed, very disingenuous, on the part of the right honorable member to make the statement which he did, especially in view of the disclaimer of the Attorney-General as to the applicability of the measure to the industrial dispute proceeding in Sydney. I assume that the honorable and learned member, being president of the union in trouble in Sydney, probably knows a good deal about the matter. It may be possible, of course, that he, as president, is slightly biased in the direction of believing that as Attorney-General he had no responsibility for quelling the actions of the union.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[3]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If time permitted, it would be possible to multiply points of objection, because the measure can be criticised from every direction.

Yet all the procedure proposed comes under that most important section of the Constitution which, beyond all ques-tion, limits its jurisdiction to industrial operations, treated, handled, and controlled judicially. You try to deal with individuals in some artificial  association  while still unorganized. As I stated during the second- reading debate, every one of the proposed amendments affords another means of access of a particular character - an open door, and no one can say how far beyond it one may or may not go.

189,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HUGHES, William Morris","DQC","West Sydney","ALP","Attorney-General",1990,"- - The point taken by the honorable member was replied to by me on the last sitting day, when he was unfortunately detained elsewhere. There is nothing novel in the principle of a dual, alternate method of organization, because the legislation of the States, and the practice of industrial bodies, have all along followed the lines which I propose to follow. The shipping industry to-day naturally embraces all those who work for it; but there are distinct crafts in connexion with it, and any attempt on the part of the Court to give at the same time an award covering masters and officers, engineers, sailors, cooks and stewards, and wharf labourers would be futile. It would be beyond the power of any human being, at one and the same time, to deal with occupations so widely divergent. The circumstances of a master or officer of a ship in some respects are similar to those of an engineer, a sailor, or a steward, on a ship. They are all employed on a ship on the sea : but the circumstances of the industrial callings or vocation of these men are quite different, and, therefore, it has followed that, in attempting to deal with this one industry, the Court has had to make awards dealing with different crafts. I am able to speak with knowledge in this matter since I have appeared for the masters and officers, for the engineers and for the wharf labourers, two cases being heard by the one Judge, and one in the local Court. In each case the award was made without reference to the circumstances of the other persons engaged in the industry. If you say that all these persons are to join on the basis of one industry and not by way of crafts, -what are you going to do? Are you going to make water-tight compartments, so to speak, inside the industry? If you are, you will not gain anything at all, because it will lead to a multiplicity of organizations. The organization will have to come before the Court just as if it were on a craft basis. The only argument put forward by my honorable friend, in support of that course is that, by following it an award would be given to cover the industry, the employers and the employes having something in common. As a matter of fact, they must have something in common; otherwise this Statute would not apply. I want here to trace the whole matter very briefly from its genesis. An  industrial dispute  is the basis of our power ; and whatever else an industrial dispute is, it must be something in regard to an industrial matter between persons who stand in the relationship of employer and employed. So far we are right. That being the case we have to consider, from a constitutional stand-point, not what  industry  means, but rather what  industrial dispute  means. It does not matter whether  industry has a narrower or a wider meaning than industrial dispute; in neither case can we extend our power. Industrial dispute is the bedrock; and to that key we set our composition. If we go beyond that, it does not matter how we attempt to deceive ourselves, we are no forrader. An industrial dispute - that is to say, a dispute about an industrial matter between an employer and employé ---can obviously be created, whether the employe is grouped with his fellow-employés upon the basis of an industry, or the basis of a craft. We have seen quite lately - indeed, we may see every day - disputes threatening, or taking place upon the basis of a craft. The recent agricultural implement-makers dispute related to an industry. All the crafts were bound together; blacksmiths, engineers, turners and finishers were all in one. There the industry was co-terminous, as it were, with the persons employed therein. But if the Amalgamated Engineers had a dispute a hundred industries would be immediately involved, since, in this age of machine-production, the industry which does not depend upon steam, is very rarely found, and is not very important. A dispute amongst them goes to the very root of the whole industrial system in our midst. One clearly sees, therefore, that an industrial dispute may arise in a matter which does not come within the definition of  industry  as it now stands in the Act. An industrial dispute between Jones and his employer does not concern the community, because Jones can go away, and Smith can come in his place. But when there are 5,000 or 6,000 Joneses, or other persons, involved, the community is affected. In this connexion we have to remember that the statute we are amending is not one to benefit an employer or employe, except as a means to preserving industrial peace. It is an Act to promote the public welfare. A dispute can arise between an organization or union of craftsmen and employers, and we must provide for that basis of organization. It is useless to say to the Amalgamated Engineers,  You go and organize on some other basis - on a basis different from that which you have followed for the last fifty or eighty years. They would not do so. There are the honorable traditions of their organization to consider; and neither they nor the engine-drivers, nor the trolley-drivers and draymen would consent to organize on another basis. We have, therefore, to take advantage of the existing organization. To what extent is an employer inconvenienced or treated unjustly? If he has a dispute with his employes, what does it matter to him whether it is settled upon a craft basis or on the basis of his industry ? If there are many different crafts included in his industry, then there must be as many inquiries as there are crafts, and he is not called before the Court any more than he would be if the matter were on an industrial basis. I speak now from experience, and I take as an illustration the shipping industry, with which I am fairly familiar. The same men who are holding up their end to-day in the Court against the seamen have to meet the wharf labourers, the engineers, and the masters and officers. They settle the dispute so far as one class is concerned, and then they have to face another. That cannot be avoided. The employer has to deal separately with each different kind of craftsmen, otherwise there cannot be a proper inquiry by the Court as to what is a fit and proper award for the employes services. What we are trying to do, therefore, is simply to take advantage of existing organizations in order to facilitate the business of the Court, and to right a wrong that now exists. There is at present no remedy for 20,000 men in this country who desire to seek a peaceful method of redressing their grievances. I would refer the Leader of the Opposition, by the way, to a number of cases reported in the New South Wales industrial records, the awards in which do not comprise the whole of the persons employed in the industries.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I wish only to say that we intend, under this Bill, to enable organizations to do under the Commonwealth Act what they have always been able to do under the State Act, and what it was thought they had a right to do under our legislation. I come now to the question as to the use of the word  avocation, or  vocation. I do not pose as a philologist, and I want to be quite sure that the use of the word  avocation  does what we desire.  Vocation  is defined in Websters New International Dictionary as -A calling; a summons; a call; specif. : a convocation. ... A calling to a particular state, business, or profession.On the other hand,  avocation  is defined as -A calling away; a diversion; . . . state of being called away ; diversion of attention ; that which calls one away from ones regular employment . . . customary employment; vocation; usual pursuits. . . .It is synonymous in one of its senses with vocation. I think the word avocation  is particularly suited to the purpose we have in view. Vocation, as distinguished from  avocation, means that a man has, so to speak, a call from Heaven. We speak of a clergyman having a vocation - he has a call for the church - but avocation is a calling away from the spiritual and higher to the baser things of life, and it is because of that that  avocation is particularly applicable to mundane pursuits. I prefer it; and as it is synonymous, in no case is there any harm done. I hope that this clause will be accepted by the Committee without a protracted discussion.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[5]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
192,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"DEAKIN, Alfred","009MD","Ballaarat","N/A","N/A",1992,".- My rejoinder to the Attorney-General must be put very briefly. Referring to certain highly-organized industries in which there are important subdivisions of employment, the honorable and learned member says very naturally that the same employers are brought before the Court to answer each of the applications of those whom they employ. That is true. I desire him, however, to realize that his argument cuts both ways. lt is just as much in favour of our proposal to maintain the present industrial procedure as it is in favour of the new craft procedure. Then again, it seems to me that while the Attorney-Generals argument is applicable to particular industries, such as shearing, shipping, and some others, it is not appropriate to a number in which we must deal directly with the industry as a whole, if justice is to be done, in regard to operations nominally the same, the occupation really differing in its methods, its responsibility, and its skill, and perhaps conducted in different portions of this great country. It is sufficient for my argument to remind the Attorney-General that, granting him all that he has contended, he has not shown that the same ends as he desires cannot be attained by the existing industrial means, and within existing conditions, as to any industry,, within the words of the Constitution industrial dispute. I venture to suggest,, therefore, that, although by this addition he may be facilitating, and even in some cases cheapening, the process of obtaining partial or local awards, yet those additions will probably require, in many cases, to be dearly paid for. Even if the procedure be constitutional, and does not imply such a disorganization of the existing system as. may put it out of work, yet on the other hand, as several different proceedings are brought within the shipping industry against the same persons, who must abide by the awards in regard, say, to the engineers, the officers and men, and the stewards, it is plain that the craft difficulty is already being met, and settled, in large industries of that kind. No reason has been shown for making this alteration in our Act, unless it be that there may be some, but not necessarily much, extra expense in a few cases, and some difficulty also. There will, however, be far less expense in the long run, far less confusion, and far less delay, by maintaining the system based upon industries, instead of introducing the system based upon crafts. It appears to me that, when the remarks of the Attorney-General are read, they are just as much in support of the view which I have again submitted as constitutional and practicable, as they support his own view. The Attorney-General again spoke of there being no remedy for 20,000 men. There is a remedy. It is not necessary for the engineers of engine-drivers to abandon their unions because they operate through different industrial organizations in connexion with different trades.

They may contend that the terms which have been obtained, either by another union or another organization in which there are engine-drivers already fix the rates for their similar class of work. Why should not the same conditions be required? The employers would be practically out of court at once if they opposed such a claim. The case would be practically settled before it went into Court. All that would be necessary would be to have the old award in this relation amended and put on record and registered. How could the employers resist? Take the case of men driving engines in the mines at Bendigo, in the mines of the West, or in the coalmines of Newcastle. Any substantial difference in the conditions, such as the extra cost of living in the West, would bo taken into account. But here is your basis already prepared : When once you have engine-drivers paid a certain rate for working eight hours, you can derive your other amended wages and conditions deduced from it in the easiest possible way. When, once you establish your bases of arbitration bringing these crafts and others into line with their branches in the great existing industries, so far as payment is concerned, the road by which they arrive need not affect their unions, or their organizations, for trade purposes. All that is necessary is to relate their new terms to those of industrial organizations already under the Act.

They all appeared to object to the constitution of the Board to deal with certain groups of tramway men.The Judge further said -This very thing is an example. I have two unions, first of all, to deal with, a thing which is really quite outside my proper duties, dealing with the claims of different unions in the same industry. Then a number of different industries appear, and there are a number of existing awards, some have expired, some have not; some Boards have expired and their awards are in existence ; some Boards have expired and their awards have expired also.

But it is not an argument for taking control away from the States and centralizing it under the jurisdiction of one Judge. It is humanly impossible for one man to do the work that he is being asked to take on. Mr. Justice Higgins has more than he can do now with eight or nine industries; and what, I should like to know, is he going to do with hundreds and hundreds of groups and organizations and industries? The whole aim, as it seems to me, is, to establish a statutory organizing agency, if T may so put it. The Government are going to compel the organization of more and more of these group industries. In other words, they are encouraging the making of disputes rather than the settlement of them. Only this week a case is reported in the Worker which brings out this point very clearly.

The State Government say that they have no jurisdiction. The Federal Attorney-General says that they have. Each authority is putting the responsibility upon the other. Is there anything in the machinery proposed to be established to obviate such a condition of things ? It seems to me that, before it will be possible to compass Inter-State disputes in a proper way, our machinery must be improved. Instead of the Federal authority trying to take powers from the States, as has been the case for some years past, the whole business ought to be organized. A line ought to be struck, and rigidly adhered to. I should like to know who is responsible for interfering in the dispute that is going on in New South Wales now.

The only object, it seems to me, is to create another argument in favour of the referenda proposals of the Government, which, we are told, will again be submitted to the electors at the next election. The Government will go before the people flaunting their helplessness instead of. their foolishness as a reason for their proposal. I say again that there ought to be some clear line drawn in regard to all this legislation. If we can act in co-operation with the States and after consultation with their Governments, so much the better. We ought to endeavour to co-operate with them, and not to overlap their legislation in every possible way. afterwards making excuses as to why neither authority does anything. I want to see this machinery work satisfactorily, but that object can only be accomplished when all the factors making up the complex industrial conditions of this continent have been put in their proper place, and accounted for under the machinery which we set up. In a little country like New Zealand, a mere strip of land a little over 200 miles in length, they have three or four separate and distinct industrial districts in order that the authorities may take into account certain factors which must modify their decisions. Here, however, our efforts are in the direction of centralization.

I put the matter in that broad way because it may be thought that in strengthening section 9 there is an effort being made by a member of this House to unduly penalize employers. We cannot make the section too strong, so long as it is directed to discourage employers or others from penalizing persons desirous of joining an organization ; in other words, from taking advantage of the general provisions of the Act. Section 9, as proposed to be amended, reads -No employer shall dismiss any employe from Ii is employment or injure him in his employment or alter his position to his prejudice.We should go so far as to say that, for the reasons mentioned -No employer shall dismiss any employé from his employment, and no person shall injure such employe or other person in his employment.Because it may well be that a person who is not in the relationship of employer at nil may injure another person by refusing to employ him or inducing others not to employ him.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

257,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BRENNAN, Frank","JSC","N/A","N/A","N/A",1998,"- There is no intention to do away with the employer at all, or to unduly penalize him, but there is a general intention, which I think ought to be upheld by honorable members on each side, to prevent a person from being penalized for desiring to join an association or organization. I think 1 have pointed out that a person may refuse to give a man employment for the reason that he is a member of an association or organization, or that he wishes to join one, or induce other persons not to give the man employment for the same reasons. We should say that these reasons are not to operate or to be allowed to operate, in the minds of men against persons who wish to join organizations. Section 9 as it stands says that no employer shall alter the position of such a man to his prejudice. The injury may be done to the man by his employer, not by altering his position to his prejudice, but by refusing to alter his position, or by altering the position of others over his head. Again, the person who is injured may not be a member of an organization, but he may wish to become a member of an organization or association, and it may be held out to him before he is employed as a threat if he becomes or proposes to be a member of an organization or association, that he shall no longer be qualified for employment. We know, and honorable members who come from Queensland will be able to bear out my statement, that this is done openly in connexion with the Australian Tramways Association. So far as theQueensland branch is concerned, the company lays it down as a condition that no person shall hold himself out as, or do anything to indicate that he is, a member of an association, and no person shall get employment if he proposes to join an association. . It is done also in connexion with the Melbourne Tramway Company. They exact undertakings from men before they are employed that they do not intend to join the Australian Tramways Association. It is a very unhappy state of affairs if this House is to go on passing legislation, and inducing persons to enter organizations for the purpose of settling industrial disputes, and dealing in a more efficient manner with industrial troubles, while private individuals and companies are to deliberately and publicly penalize men for going into the organizations. I should say tha°t honorable members on both sides would be quite willing to strengthen this section.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[12]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is for others to suggest objection, but any there may be will be found to the wording, and not to the spirit, of the amendment, which is eminently fair, in view of our desire to encourage men to join associations. I say this with the full knowledge of the fact, which is frequently overlooked by honorable members opposite, that it is not the employes, as a general rule, who have been in the habit of flouting Commonwealth industrial legislation, but that the persons who have shown themselves, not only hostile, but have received such legislation in a spirit of rebellion, are the employers.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[12]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is perfectly true that certain employers do penalize their employes and prejudice them in their employment. One organization waited on me during the last six or eight months and furnished me with a copy of a notice which was displayed in a prominent place in certain depots announcing in an unmistakable way some of the consequences which would follow any attempt to join any other than a certain organization, which was, and is still, I believe, under the management of the employers. In addition, representations were made to me by certain honorable members disclosing a similar state of affairs in another State. In my experience, only one conviction has been obtained under a similar section under the New South Wales Act, and that was in the case of an employer who admitted, in a moment of inexcusable aberration, that he had dismissed an employe because he was a unionist. Usually, of course, exacting such an admission from an employer is infinitely harder than getting 6 oz. to the ton from an exhausted reef. We have to consider human nature as it is ; and the question is whether we can, by any means at our disposal, effectively compel an employer to make no difference in regard to the man who is a member of an association to which the employer, rightly or wrongly, has some objection. That is one point, and another is that the Constitution effectively delimits our powers.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I incline to the opinion that the clause, as before the Committee, covers quite as much ground. The effect, whenever one enumerates particular cases, is to omit other particular cases, which did not at the time occur to ones mind. There is another point to which I would draw the honorable members attention, and it is this. He proposes to provide that no. employer shall exact a promise or undertaking from any employe as a condition of employment not to become a member of an association or organization or prejudice him in his application for employment. I admit that this is a bog or maze, and that we tread with difficulty and amazement in every winding avenue through it. But one thing has been made perfectly clear, and that is that, before the Court can have any jurisdiction at all, there has to be an industrial dispute which must extend beyond the boundaries of one State, and which must have relation to an industrial matter between an employer and an employe - not a person who may become an employé but a person who is de facto an employe I am not going to say that that is not subject to modification, but I do say that an application for employment is entirely outside the relationship of employer and employe. In connexion with a State Court, the position, of course, would be entirely different, but until a man becomes an employe, the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration has no jurisdiction. I will not mention any State in particular, but let me say that in a State other than this, there is, at the present time, an organization of employes that is not recognised by the employers, who are continuously pursuing tactics in regard to it, calculated to provoke a breach of industrial peace. Some honorable members know very well that that is a fact. This -Court is perfectly powerless to do anything at all in relation to such a case unless there is an industrial dispute, or something has occurred to give the Court jurisdiction. Nothing that is in the Statute, or can be put into it, can give the Court jurisdiction in respect of a matter in connexion with which it would not have had jurisdiction, if there were an active outburst of industrial hostility. So I say that, in regard to this matter, we have to keep clearly within our constitutional powers, and we have to remember what human nature is. A man seeks employment, and the employer says,  Are you a member of the union ? The answer is,  Yes. and the employer then says, All right j where did you work last; what did you do? and so on. Is an employer going to be so destitute of imagination and all resource that, having one hundred reasons for sacking a man, he is going openly to sack him for the very reason for which he would have to pay £50, when he slight sack him for any one of the other reasons, on account of which he would not have to pay anything? If the employer were such a resourceless person as that, al) this trouble in society would never have existed: He would never give us any trouble at all. But we know that he is a very resourceful person. This legislation has been in force now for ten years, and the only conviction under the section has been that of one employer at St. Marys, who admitted that he sacked a fellow because .he belonged to the union. And he said,  I will sack all the rest. The Court and -everybody in it were so astonished atThis outburst of unnatural candour that the lowest possible -fine was imposed, and the defendant, was- sent away almost rejoicing. I am inclined to. think, however, that there is one phrase - of the amendment which covers more than may be covered by the clause, as it - stands. . The section, if amended, as proposed by clause 5, would provide that -No employer shall dismiss any employe from Iris employment or injure him in his employment or alter his position to his prejudice by reason merely of the fact that the employé is *o officer or member of an organization, or of »n association that has applied to be registered xs an organization or is entitled to the. benefit nf .an industrial agreement 01 award.The Bill proposes to amend the existing section by inserting: after the words or injure him in his employment, the words or alter his position to his prejudice. That is to say, to fail to promote him, or to -disrate him, as the case may be. It is conceivable that that does not cover everything, and the honorable member proposes to provide for that by inserting the words  or injure, him in any way whatever. I think -that is a drag-net phrase which covers everything.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[13]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We can put that into- the Bill, without invalidating the  measure.  I do not  know that the clause would be inoperative, in so far as it was constitutional. Clearly the Court would never say that the Legislature deliberately intended to go too far. - The phrase might not, however, cover any more ground than is covered by the clause, as it stands. .. This is- all- that could happen to an employ^. He might, lose his -job; he -might lose promotion, or benefits; he might npt progress as rapidly as he ought, and he might in short, work in the shadow instead of the sun of his employers approbation. This is what might happen, putting it into words; and I wish honorable members to consider whether there is anything that is not covered by this phrase. The employe may not be dismissed ; he may not be injured ; he may not be prejudiced. If we add these words proposed by the honorable member for Batman, injured in any way whatever, I think we have got it I do not see anything further that could be done. . In my opinion, the section as amended by the Bill does cover all those cases in which, taking human nature as it is, there is the remotest possibility of -our being able to effectively protect the employe. For that reason, I ask the honorable member for Batman not to press Ins amendment.

I have not had an opportunity to read it, and it is a rather complicated amendment. There are one or two things which struck me as possible results Qf its adoption which I should like to bring under the notice of the honorable member for Batman. One of the proposals made is that no employer shall not merely alter, but refrain from altering .the position . of an employe by reason -.of the fact, -riot merely that he .is a .mem.be?;; of an organization or association, :but that .he seeks to become , a member of .an organization or- association. T ask. honorable members to imagine fpr n moment -the kind of prosecution that would take place under such a provision. John Jones, an  employe, brings .a prosecution against his employer under this amendment, and sets out the following offence :. -That the - employer refrained from . altering- his- position,- he being a person who was seeking- to obtain admittance- into an association. -That., is rather a strange thing to make the matter a criminal offence. Jones comes before the Court and is asked,  What do you complain of ; are you not in the same position as before ?  The answer is, Yes, that is just- what I complain;, qf.. The Court then says, You are still- employed, and still paid, and that is - what you complain of - why? Is it because you are a member of an association? The answer is, No; because I am thinking of becoming a member of an association. My employer has refrained in consequence of that - though how he found out what I was thinking about, I cannot say- - from altering my position. I am inclined to think that that would be a very difficult matter to prove. But the honorable member for Batman gets him out of that difficulty by throwing the whole of the onus of proof on the defendant. The defendant would, first of all, have to show that there was no opportunity of which he could have availed himself to better Jones position; or, if there was, since he did not know that Jones was seeking to become a member of an association, he could not have refrained from altering Jones position because he was seeking to become a member of an association. Could honorable members imagine anything more ridiculous to put seriously before a Court of Justice and particularly a Court of Criminal Justice, as a means of carrying this legislation into effect? I appeal to the honorable member for Batman to reconsider this proposal, because he appealed to honorable members on .this side to join with him in .doing what I suppose is the desire of every one, and that is to prevent the penalization of men because they belong to a union..","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But our laws should be such as can be carried out. As the Attorney-General has shown, the present provisions have not been effectual, and, I think, cannot be made effectual. You cannot make a criminal offence depend orr something in the mind of an employer or employe, no matter what language you employ. To attempt to give effect to such provisions would bring about prosecutions such as have never yet been heard of or dreamt of in any Court- of Criminal Jurisdiction. It is easy to say that the onus of proof should be on the defendant. The onus of proof has been thrown, on the defendant in connexion with certain cases, especially in regard to Customs offences. But when a man imports goods, he knows all about them, having thu invoices and other papers, and it is reasonable that, the Crown having made out a prima facie case on some points, the duty should be thrown on the defendant of making the whole position clear.

We must, of course, treat both sides alike, and I am ready to protect both- employes and employers who are members of unions. Employers should recognise the mens right to organize. If we are going to say that men shall not cease work because their employer is a member of the Employers Federation,- we should not allow employes who are members of organizations to be interfered with by their employers. One effect of this legislation will be to drive both employers and employes into federation, and I can conceive nothing better calculated to bring about industrial peace than the existence of strong organizations which can discuss with each other, or before an impartial tribunal, the terms and conditions under which work should be performed. If the employes require preference, the employers should be given preference, too. But there is nothing in the clause to place an employer under any. disability because he has attempted to induce his men to leave their organization. Inducements are being offered to men to leave an organization and to join another which is under the wing of their employers. Nothing is more likely to lead to industrial trouble, and I hope that the result of such conduct will be industrial trouble. If men are robbed, threatened, or intimidated to induce them to sever their connexion with an organization, trouble will continually occur, and there can be no hope of industrial peace. Some provision should be inserted, penalizing the employers who endeavour to draw men away from their organizations, or to induce them to join organizations financed, supported and encouraged by the employers.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[16]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Attorney-General referred to the words  by reason merely, arid put the view that a man is absolved who dismisses an employe for the reasons stated in the amendment together with others. If an employer has merely to show that, although membership of a union was one reason for the dismissal of an employe, there were others, or one other, to be free from liability to a penalty, the provision is waste paper, but I direct the attention of the honorable gentleman to the fact that I left out the word merely  to make it clear that member ship of a union must not be an operative reason at all, and chat there would be liability to a penalty wherever it could be proved to be. an operative reason. -The Attorney-General has pointed out that the prosecutions under the Act have failed. I have been connected with some of them, and know that they have failed, and must fail, except in those exceptional cases where what he called  unnatural candour  is displayed by the person committing the offence.

I could, if necessary, cite other cases. In his judgment, in the Merchant Shipping case, which was decided on 5th December, 1 9 10, Mr. Justice Higgins said he had to testify to the fairness of the employers in recognising jurisdiction, where he thought it did not exist, for the purpose of enabling an amicable agreement.

I do not think we do wrong when we in- quire from those charged with the administration of the purely machinery part of .theAct in what way this or that section lias failed to be effective. We thus find out its weaknesses just as we ascertain the shortcomings of an engine from the man who drives it. That is what we have done in this particular case. Section 16 (a), as honorable members are aware, was inserted in the principal Act last year, and it has proved, without exception, the most valuable in the whole scheme of the Act. But the question is :  How far does it go ?  During the recent sugar dispute, the question arose whether the Court could, Under section i6a, summon before it those persons who were having a dispute. There was at the time no dispute within the meaning of the Federal Act. It was a State dispute. It could not be said that there was a probability of it extending, but there was a likelihood of the consequences of the dispute being taken up by other industries. In that case the dispute, whatever it became, would extend, and, as a fact, it did extend. Thus, the wharf labourers declined to handle the sugar. When it was handled by persons other than members of the Wharf Labourers Union, it came down to southern ports, and then the trouble became an Inter- State dispute.

The Attorney-General might consider whether there should not be some limitation upon the costs. This might be prescribed by regulation, for instance. In some applications of a minor character the costs ought to be fairly small. What is generally done at present in civil proceedings is to have a scale fixed by regulation, and as such, of course, it is subject to review by Parliament. With a view to having some limitation upon the amount that may be recovered, I suggest to the Attorney-General that the words as may be prescribed should be inserted after the word costs.Sitting suspended from 6.30 to y.45 p.m.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[26]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Under section 55 of the original Act two employers may form an organization for the purpose of registration. This clause has to do with persons of whom cognisance will be taken by the Court. The memorandum which has been circulated by the Government explains that the intention is that the Court shall have cognisance of all industrial disputes submitted to the Court by an organization, of industrial disputes which are certified to the Court by the Registrar as proper to be dealt with in the public interest, and of industrial disputes with which any State industrial authority, or the Governor in Council of a State, requests the Court to deal. I wish to extend the same right to an individual employer as individual employes can get through their organizations. For instance, take the case of a. firm like J. C. Hutton and Company s which carries on the business of bacon-curing in different States. It might be an utter impossibility for a firm like that to belong to an organization of employers, though it employs hundreds of hands in different States. The employes might decline to submit a case to the decision of the Arbitration Court. The employer, as an individual, would not be able to submit his case.

The honorable member points out that section 55 provides for the registration of an association, but that there is no provision to enable one person who employs a large number of individuals to register, and to come under the cognisance of the Court by filing a plaint. The definition of  industrial dispute, which has been struck out, covered any dispute as to an industrial matter arising between an employer and an organization of employes. That contemplated a dispute between employes and one employer. The honorable member wants an employer who does not belong to an association to be able to go before the Court with his plaint. What the honorable member is asking the Attorney-General to do is, I take it, to look into the matter, and to give. an individual employer the same right as an association of employers has. It seems fair that it should be given. Under section 19 of the Act, the Court is to have jurisdiction over industrial disputes sent before it by the Registrar, industrial disputes brought by an organization on a plaint, industrial disputes referred to the Court, and then compulsory matters.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[30]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I think that we have forgotten this fact, that since paragraphs a, b, and c of the section were drafted in 1904, we have extended the definition of industrial dispute to cover threatened or probable disputes, so thai now if there is merely a probability of a dispute and a conference is held by the President, he can send that on for investigation at once, as if it were an ordinary dispute. This is a very wide power to give; but personally, I do not see how one can reasonably object to allow the President to do what a State authority can do.

He will have to decide on some facts as to whether a dispute exists or not. At present, as a rule, a certificate would only be given In cases where no other evidence at the time was available and the fact was notorious. But surely the same rule would not apply to the extension of the dispute; in other words, that where no evidence was available, a certificate could be given of the existence as well as the extension of the dispute. We must assume that the Registrar will go on some facts which will justify a prima facie impression. If such is the case, considering the extent to which the work of the Court is developing, he will have very important and responsible duties to discharge. In the circumstances, it might be well to consider what his position is to be in the future. At present he is an officer of the High Court, and simply holds the subordinate office of Industrial Registrar. That has, I think, been his position from the start. When I looked into his position some twelve months ago, it struck me that if the work of the Court had to be increased, we ought to think of appointing this officer straight out as the Industrial Registrar, at a salary corresponding with the great responsibilities and increased duties cast upon him. I have incidentally referred to the matter now because I have observed that on the Estimates a sum of ^600 is allotted for the position. I suppose that the Attorney-General intends to at once appoint an Industrial Registrar, perhaps to attend to these duties only, whose salary and position will approximately correspond with his responsibilities. But even then he will be below the status of similar officers in the States.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[36]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

368,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HUGHES, William Morris","DQC","N/A","N/A","N/A",2011,"- Yes, and in this form. Under section 31 of the Act, an effort was made to discourage litigation, and reach a conclusion as speedily as possible, making the decisions of the Court final. That, of course, has been a vain hope. I do not suppose that any Act has led to more litigation, with more decisions upset. It is clearly inseparable from the Constitution, as it now stands, that there should be this clashing of jurisdiction. We have not the power to make this Court final in the sense that the Parliament of England, the Parliament of New South Wales, or the Parliament of Victoria would have in respect of such a Court. But where we have the power to create a Court whose award shall be final, we propose to make this amendment so that neither by writ of prohibition nor by mandamus can decisions be quashed or called in question. There are two possible errors into which the Court may fall. It may fall into the error of excess of jurisdiction, owing to some limitation imposed by the Constitution, in which case nothing that we can do can help the situation - it is a fatal error. Then the Court may fall into the error of excess of statutory power, where we have not given some power we could have given if we had thought fit, or did not do all we intended to do. The Court will, of course, bring to the consideration of questions, in its jurisdiction, that judicial care that is the practice of judicial bodies ; and it has to be the final Court to decide whether it has exceeded its jurisdiction, where, and only where, it is in excess of the statutory power which this Legislature could have conferred on it, but did not - and that, whether we intended to do so, and did not, or whether we did not even intend to do so, provided we had the power to do it. In the State of New South Wales, the Courts have been clothed with power to make a final decision which cannot be disturbed by any Court; and we propose to do that here, so that a decision cannot be upset on a mere technicality. Nobody here, or outside, desires eternal litigation on mere technical points. The Engine-drivers case is one in point. If the Court had had the power to make a decision that could not be upset by any writ of prohibition, its decision would have stood despite the fact that the Statute did not confer the power on the Court to do this thing. The Court gave its decision, believing it had the power ; and, therefore, since, of all the cases that have come before the Court, at least half have been upset, owing to errors created by the shortcomings of the Statute, we propose to cure these errors once for all. This is done in a fashion which will commend itself, I am sure, to every reasonable and sensible person. The Justice of the High Court who is now acting as President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court is one of those men who would have to decide in any case how far he should go, or how far he should not go, in any particular. Behind every human system is one man : after all, there comes a point where we must say,  That is the man to decide.  We may say that we will appeal to a man who sils with two or three others; but behind every system is a man. It is merely a question where we shall stop ; and we propose to stop as the clause provides, believing that this will discourage litigation, and tend to the speedy settlement of differences. I say, emphatically, that this provision will make the Court extremely careful in what it does, considering that on its shoulders will rest the final settlement. For the rea-: sons I have given, and for others that are obvious, I hope the Committee will accept the clause.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[39]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Why does the honorable member persist in framing his clause in such a way as to suggest that the idea is, not only to make the Court master in its own domain, but to make it what it can never be, the judge as to whether it has exceeded its own domain or not? Why will he not express himself in the clause in such terms as to put the meaning beyond dispute? The manner in which prohibition is aimed at, and the way in which the whole clause reads, undeniably conveys the contrary impression. The whole of this argument on the second reading turned on this one. point. There was no dispute as to any of the essentials, or as to the wish to set the Court free in its own domain ; and, finally, there was no denial on the part of the Attorney-General of the fact that there must be an appeal elsewhere when the Court exceeds its jurisdiction under the Constitution. Why not, then, use such terms as will leave the clause unambiguous and perfectly clear?","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[40]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The High Court has, in this and in very many other cases, sufficiently emphasized the fact, so that any man, even if pachydermatous - even if he had an elephantine hide, twice reinforced - would have been pierced by the shafts of Judicial wit long ago.  But while it is perfectly true that the High Court will inquire into every case of alleged excess of jurisdiction, it can quash an award, either by writ of prohibition, or in any other way, only when that excess of jurisdiction is an excess of the constitutional limitation. If we. put that in plain black and white it would- well, I do not know whether it would- humiliate us, or whether the meaning is so obvious that nothing could reduce us any lower. It is perfectly clear, however, on the face of the statement I have now made, to what extent we desire to go, and obviously can go; and I think that nothing further remains to be said.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[41]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The only redeeming feature of the amendment appears to be that we leave the President power, on application, to submit points of law on a case stated. We are now really leaving it to the President to determine in every case, not only whether an award is to be made and is valid within the Constitution, but to make an order which is a much more extensive thing. If the Presidents decision is final on every point of law, so long as he proceeds, and We have proceeded, within the Constitution, he may still, if he chooses, send on doubtful points of construction, either of the Constitution or of the Act.

Now the honorable and learned gentleman points out,, very properly, that, with regard to challenging awards or orders of the Court on constitutional grounds, we have no power to do that. He goes on, however, to say that this will have an effect in enlarging, the power of the Court with regard to matters which the Statute we are dealing; with does not give the Court, but which this Parliament could, if it chose, give the Court. I feel some considerable doubt about that, for reasons which I will state. The genera] principle on which the Court - not merely in certain cases in the High  Court, but in a number of  decisions in: England - has acted, is that no statutory provision can take away the right to prohibit an inferior Court from exceeding its jurisdiction. It is very doubtful whether it admits of the distinction the Attorney-General proposes. In a recent case, Whybrows case, known as  The Boot Case, the Court was unanimous in holding that the provision that no award of the Court should be challenged, quashed, or appealed. against, or questioned on any account whatsoever, did not prevent a prohibition being granted, on the ground that the Court had exceeded its jurisdiction. I have the judgment here, and none of the Judges, made any distinction between an excess of jurisdiction, so far as the constitutional power of Parliament is concerned, and. an excess of jurisdiction so far as that giver* to the Court by the Statute is concerned. In all the cases the ground was the same, the question asked being,  Was there an excess of jurisdiction or not? At page 21 of the second volume of Commonwealth Law Reports, it will be found that the Chief Justice pointed out that no Act of Parliament can take away from the High Court the right, by prohibition, to decide whether an inferior Federal Court had exceeded its jurisdiction. Whether that jurisdiction was exceeded by going beyond the Act, or did not exist because the Act was not within the constitutional powers of Parliament, was a distinction that was not made in the judgment. The Chief Justice said -Before dealing with the important question of law, raised in this case I will dispose of the preliminary objection taken by Mr. Arthur that prohibition does not lie to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The objection is based on two grounds. First, it is said that a prohibition is within the language of section 31 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, which enacts that .No award of the Court shall be challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed, or called in .question in any other Court on any account whatsoever. In Clancys case (1) This Court had to deal with same point raised upon identical words in the New South Wales Industrial Arbitration Act of 1901, and we held, in accordance with a uniform line of English decisions, that such an enactment does not extend to cases in which a Court of limited jurisdiction has exceeded its jurisdiction.A Court of limited jurisdiction might exceed its jurisdiction by going beyond the authority vested in it by a competent Parliament, or by attempting to pursue an authority purported to be vested in it by an incompetent Parliament. In each case there might be excess of jurisdiction. Mr. Justice Barton and Mr. Justice OConnor expressed the same view in practically similar words. Mr. Justice Barton said -I agree that prohibition as distinct from ordinary appeal lies to this Court in respect of decisions in excess of jurisdiction pronounced by an inferior Federal Court, including the Arbitration Court.Mr. Justice Isaacs differed in one respect in regard to the nature of the prohibition. He held that this Parliament could, by appropriate words, divest the High Court of the power to issue a prohibition in a case of that kind, but that it had not in fact done so. The majority of the Court, three Justices, held that the right of prohibition could not be taken away from the High Court with regard to any excess of jurisdiction by the Arbitration Court, or any inferior Federal Court. What were j 1 the reasons ? They were twofold. First, with regard to the power that the High Court has to prohibit any Court from exercising jurisdiction in excess on the ground that the Act under which it is constituted is unconstitutional, a majority of the Court held that that was necessarily inherent in the High Court.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[43]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In every case where we have a twofold sovereignty divided between Federal and State Parliaments, that is to say, in every Federation, we must have a line of demarcation between the Federal and State authorities. We have two bodies to deal with, and where one trespasses upon the field of another, and does an act, it is as if it were not done. We must, in such a case, have some judicial authority to say whether it is the law or not. That is an inherent power. With regard to constitutional questions, there must, therefore, be an inherent right in the High Court, as being vested with the Federal jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, to determine that point in the long run. But the Justices went on to decide that that power is given by the Constitution, and not merely by necessary implication, but expressly, in section 75. That section of the Constitution, amongst other things, provides that -In all matters -In which a writ of mandamus or prohibition  or an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth, the High Court shall have original jurisdiction.The right, therefore, to issue a prohibition to an inferior Court is a power vested in the High Court by the Constitution. Honorable members know that if this, power, vested in the High Court by the Constitution, is not expressly stated by the Constitution to be subject to the power of Parliament, it is absolutely vested in the High Court, and is not subject to the power of Parliament.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[43]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There is nothing to control it. The High Court cannot control it. No one can control Parliament acting within the range of its own authority. But where it purports to act outside the range of its own authority, it does not act, and some tribunal has to determine that that is so. For that purpose, it has been held that the Constitution itself gives the High Court the right to issue a prohibition. The other question is whether that right to issue a prohibition which the Constitution gives the High Court applies to the second case referred to, where a question of excess of statutory jurisdiction arises. This point has not been expressly decided. Whilst admitting that the second proposition which the Attorney-General puts forward has not yet been the subject of any decision, there are certain reasons why I venture to express a doubt as to his proposition. It is as to whether, assuming the Act to be constitutional, but assuming that the President of the Court has gone beyond the statutory powers, this taking away of the right of prohibition will have any effect. The Attorney-General says that in such a case it will. I am not going to say that it will not, but I shall give some reasons why I think it is very doubtful indeed. In the Boot case, to which I have referred, the Judges pointed out that the Act purported to take away the right of the High Court to issue a prohibition against an order made in excess of jurisdiction by an inferior Court, but the Judges made no distinction between an excess of statutory, and an excess of constitutional jurisdiction. They based their decision upon a previous decision of the Court in Clancys case in New South Wales. When we look at Clancys case, we find that there was no question there of excess of legislative jurisdiction, because it was under an Act of the Parliament of New South Wales, and that Parliament had no such limits as we have. The Parliament of New South Wales had passed an Arbitration Act, had created an Arbitration Court, and had provided in just the same terms that awards or decrees of that Arbitration Court should not be called in question at all in any Court.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[43]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The words in the Act. and in the New South Wales Act, are wide enough to cover prohibition, injunction, mandamus, or any other like procedure, the phrase  liable to be quashed  embracing every means of putting an end to a degree for which there is not jurisdiction. The question in Clancys case was not whether those words were sufficiently wide, but whether they could give the effect intended, and take jurisdiction away from the Supreme Court. The question was not whether they did nominally take away jurisdiction, but whether they could actually do so. The High Court held that they could not, because it was not possible to take from that Court the power to determine whether the decrees of an inferior Court were in excess of jurisdiction. On page 197 of the report, it is laid down by the Chief Justice that -To hold in the face of these provisions that section 32 prevents the Supreme Court from checking any excess of jurisdiction would be in effect to give the inferior court unlimited jurisdiction. For this reason I have no doubt the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to grant a prohibition.It is extremely difficult to put forward adequately on the floor of this Chamber arguments dealing with difficult legal questions ; but I venture to assert that the use of the word prohibition will have no effect whatever if a constitutional objection is taken, and if the objection is taken that the Court has exceeded its statutory jurisdiction, the decisions in Clancys case and the Bootmakers case also seem to make it clear that it will have no effect. The point itself has never been actually decided, but it is a pity to make it appear to the public that we are attempting to curb or limit the jurisdiction of the High Court to control inferior Courts in the exercise of their jurisdiction. We profess to give the Arbitration Court limited jurisdiction. Is it wise to create -a Court of limited and inferior jurisdiction, and by an indirect and irregular method to, in effect, give it unlimited jurisdiction? Parliament ought to define the jurisdiction of every Court that it creates, making that jurisdiction as wide as may be necessary for the purposes of the Court. Although the jurisdiction given to the Arbitration Court is a wide one, we have imposed limits on it ; but if we take away from the only Court that can review its decisions the power to do so - assuming that to be constitutionally possible - we in effect give the Arbitration Court unlimited jurisdiction. While we nominally hedge the Arbitration Court with statutory conditions and limitations, we really make it the Judge of its own jurisdiction. ls that a wise thing to do? Honorable members should certainly understand that that is the meaning of what is proposed. Either the legislation which we are now considering will have no effect, or it will have this effect : that, while we nominally impose on the Court of Arbitration certain restrictions and limitations, we say to it,  We have defined the ambit of your jurisdiction, but if you go beyond it, there is no one to question your right to do so. I think that an unwise way to legislate. However wide the jurisdiction of a Court, it should be confined within that jurisdiction. To say to a Court,  You have a certain jurisdiction, and as much more as you choose to take, because there is no one to question the exercise of your powers, is to take a course which has rarely been taken, and, in taking it, Parliament abdicates its function as a Legislature in favour of the Court which it creates.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[43]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That may be a very wise course to take, especially in regard to a tribunal like an Arbitration Court, which is not concerned with legal technicalities, and has to deal with a lot of matters which are not proper subjects of regular judicial decisions. It may be wise to say of such a Court,  We are not going to allow its decisions to be questioned, either on the ground that the Court was in error as to the facts, or that it was in error as to law. That is a different thing from saying,  We are going to allow the Court, not merely to be final in decisions within its own range of jurisdiction, but to determine what its own range of jurisdiction is, without appeal.

The honorable member for Darling Downs pointed out that the phrase altogether eliminates the judicial element of the proceedings, by allowing entirely unexpected claims or demands to be made during the hearing involving heavy costs without the opportunity for full inquiry, or preparation of a complete defence, and to the embarrassment of the Court by the multiplication of unexpected issues. This objection, though stated with great clearness and force, seems to have made no impression on the Attorney-General, and I therefore feel it my duty to once more remind him how enormously this provision may add to the cost of proceedings, by protracting them, inviting decisions upon questions which ought to have been intimated from the outset, and presented with opportunity for full examination by all concerned.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[44]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As a rule, if a case comes before a Court on a plaint, the issues are submitted, and the party who has to answer knows exactly the nature of the case that has to be dealt with, and the evidence that can be called. The clause is a further extension of 38B, and its effect is to provide that, after a plaint has been submitted, the Court, in making an award or order, shall not be restricted to the specific relief claimed by the parties, or to the demands made in the course of the dispute, but may include any matter or thing which it thinks necessary or expedient for the purpose of preventing or settling a dispute. How do these matters come before the Court? First of all, they come before it by virtue of the plaint, which is filed, and secondly, by virtue of a claim made during the hearing of a case while the parties are there, and the evidence can be called. We are now going a step further and declaring that the Court is not to be limited either to the demands made in the original plaint, or to those made by the parties during the hearing of a case, but that the Judge may go further and say,  I am going to decide something else which, in my opinion, is necessary to settle this dispute. What is that  something else  to be? It must be something that is going to affect the rights of the parties on one side, or the other, because it may be included in the award. It must mean either that some one is going to get less by the order of the Court, that some one is to fulfil conditions that he may not care about, or that the employer is to do something. All these matters will apply to both sides, and there is an element of danger in allowing something to be included in an award which has not been raised by the plaint or by the parties during the hearing of a case. I should like the Attorney-General to give an explanation of the particular circumstances which necessitate such a wide power being conferred. I see no objection to the Judge dealing with all the matters in a plaint, or with anything that may arise during the hearing of a dispute. For instance, additional matters may arise during a hearing, and the plaint can be amended to meet them.- I believe it is right to provide for such a thing as that. We are considering this question in the same way as we should consider the powers and jurisdiction of the High Court, and want this Court to have every elasticity arid power to deal with anything that may arise during a hearing. Thisprovision, however, goes very much further, and I should like the Attorney-General to explain what hardship has arisen to* necessitate it.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[45]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A body of men, employers or employes, might come before the Court, might state their differences, and believe that the settlement of those differences would promote industrial peace, whereas they might promote industrial war. If an intelligent impartial man, with a judicial frame of mind, listening to all the evidence, sees clearly that the parties have not touched the master-key, and that, unless it is touched, they will be at loggerheads again, is he not to have power to do anything? Is he simply to have power to patch up the trouble, and send the parties: out in a way that will invite fresh disturbance? In the Broken Hill case His Honour went outside the plaint.

It gives the parties to a dispute the right to ask the Judge to legislate concerning matters as to which they may have- been disappointed elsewhere. For instance, -in an Inter- State mining dispute I take it that it would be quite competent for the President of the Court to say that an eight hours, from bank to bank, rule should apply -to the industry, and be a condition necessary to the insurement of peace. In that way be could do things which a State Government has from time to time refused to do. The point is, not whether they are right or wrong, but whether the Judge ought to be given such powers as will enable him to undermine the legislation of the various States. That seems to me to be the most important aspect of the question. I agree that the Judge should have large powers -and great latitude in regard to anything affecting the dispute that has to be settled, but in this provision there are no words of limitation. Under it the President of the Court is not tied up by any plaint, nor by the demands of the parties, but anything that they may choose to bring in while a dispute is in process is a subject upon which he may give a decision. This may lead to his abrogating or setting aside all the provisions of State regulative Statutes. 1 suggest to the Attorney-General that he -is likely to come into conflict with the High Court once more over such a provision as this, although I am beginning to doubt whether he cares very much about that. AH this will make an admirable argument for the honorable member and -his party at the next elections, but I hope it will go on record that the did not ask the Committee to pass this provision without knowing the facts of the case. It is our duty to point them out as they occur to us, and I should strongly advise my honorable friend, if he wants this measure to stand, to place some limitation on this clause.

I might give a number of cases in which persons, on joining unions, were bound hand and foot to do certain things of a political character, quite irrespective of whether those things were in conformity with their political views. They bound themselves to support candidates for Parliament who might or might not hold views entirely opposite to theirs. They had to give up control over their consciences ; in fact, they gave themselves body and soul into the hands of the unions.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[53]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Suppose that there were two men fighting in the street, and because they had elected to spend their money in a certain way the police were called off and told,  You must not interfere with those men, because they are outside the pale of the law. In this instance the Courts of the country are to be told,  You must not interfere with a union that is fighting for the employers if it has spent any of its money on political purposes. Let such a union kick up as much row as it pleases; we only interfere with unions that do not spend money in that way. That is what the amendment amounts to. I cannot accept it.

I think, make the slightest difference. In the circumstances, the Attorney-Generals position is most invidious, and, I believe, distinctly against the public interest. I think that, if a provision of this kind were inserted in the Act, it would impose no hardship upon anybody, and certainly prevent such a state of things cropping up again as we have to-day. I feel sure that it would make generally for greater public confidence than exists at present. As has been pointed out, the amendment would cut both ways. If we had an Attorney-General who was the president or secretary of an Employers Federation, his position would be as invidious as that of the present Attorney-General.

I have not hesitated to say publicly in a newspaper which circulates in Sydney, as well as elsewhere, that J thought the basis of our industrial evolution must be the honorable observance of agreements ; and I say so now. I assure honorable members that whether the agreement was registered or not would not affect the jurisdiction so far as concerns the Courts having power now to do anything with the men, excepting under section i6a. The honorable member says that it is not in the public interest for members of Parliament, either of State or Commonwealth, to be office hearers in any organization under the Act. All I have to say is that the honorable member does not seem to realize that our organization - I am speaking now of the Labour party - is so inseparably entwined with the various industrial organizations all over the country, that, in effect, he says that no member of an industrial organization shall enter Parliament, or, if he does, his counsel, advice, and assistance shall be no longer at the disposal of the organization to which, perhaps, he owes his political existence, or to which, at any rate, he has devoted the better portion of his life. Men on this side may be mistaken, and no doubt they, like all of us, occasionally are. I am perfectly sure, however - and I have had some experience of the matter - that strikes are not fomented by members of Parliament, or men who believe in our organization, as we practise and preach it here, but by men, in very many cases, so widely differing from the views that we advocate that there is nothing, not even a similarity of sound, between us. I do not hesitate to say that some of our most virulent and unrelenting opponents in political life are men that the honorable member, apparently, would rather place at the head of associations than ourselves. For my part, I have been associated with this organization since its inception - I found them unorganized, and I organized them - and I say that no man has ever lost a days work through me. I am unable to accept the amendment of the honorable member. 1 should not have spoken in this strain but that the honorable members contradiction of what I said this afternoon made it necessary for me to explain precisely the conditions under which I spoke. I do not know that I am called upon to say any more, except to assure the honorable member, this Committee, and the country, that my opinion, and the opinion of those associated with me on the Council, is, and always has been, that an honorable agreement ought to be observed.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[57]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But the amendment proposed by the honorable member for Richmond is such as to compel me to say something, as I happen to be the representative of the Waterside Workers of Tasmania. What happened when this unfortunate strike came about? We immediately met together, and consulted with the President of the organization - a man who has done more for industrial peace in Australia than any honorable member opposite, any other member of Parliament, or any individual unionist throughout the continent. The power that that gentleman wields in the union and in conference is beyond measure ; and that power is always used with the one object of securing industrial peace, with honour and to the welfare of all concerned. What did I do in compliance with the views of the Attorney-General ? I went to Tasmania, and in Hobart I saw the president of the union and at Launceston the secretary of the Launceston branch ; and I venture to say that I did something towards preventing the strike extending into that State. The men there, I hope, have every confidence in me, as the men, as a whole, have confidence in the Attorney-General. Is that not doing something for industrial peace? This is drawn from me; I had no intention of saying it, but when I hear honorable members opposite talking about members of Parliament bringing about strikes, and so forth, I feel compelled to defend myself. I, like the Attorney-General, desire industrial peace; and we have entered, on behalf of the unions, into an honorable agreement which, as we had no hesitation in. telling them, ought to be kept. The influence we were able to bring to bear, I trust, prevented the strike extending throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Is that not worth the attention of honorable members who pretend, or say, that they desire industrial peace. If the honorable member for Richmond is sincere he ought to withdraw this amendment, which is an insult- to members of Parliament who use their brains outside this House in their efforts to bring about a better state of affairs in the industrial world. Honorable members will admit that the experience and education we gain here - some, I admit, from honorable members opposite - make us better able to deal with those who represent the organized capital of Australia. We hear nothing from honorable members opposite about this organized capital, although they are continually admitting to us that capital is organized, and will be withdrawn if we do certain things, notwithstanding that such withdrawal would paralyze industry in Australia. If there is justification for organizing capital, and withdrawing it under certain circumstances, surely the employes, and those who are associated with them, are justified in meeting together and deciding whether they shall enter into an agreement which may or may not prevent a strike. If members of Parliament can assist in this work why should they not do so? The agreement referred to was brought about by the ship-owners representatives meeting the workers representatives across a table; and during the whole six weeks of the negotiations not an unkind word was spoken. The result was an agreement unanimously accepted by the unions 1 represent and satisfactory to the ship-owners. Is that not good for the country ? I hope that, under this Bill we shall, at no far distant date, be able to settle all industrial disputes at the conciliatory table.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[58]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I understand, however, that the industrial agreement referred to to-day is registered ; and I incidentally call attention to the definition of  industrial matters   which includes any claim arising out of an industrial agreement, and also the definition of  industrial disputes  which includes any dispute as regards industrial matters. It might, therefore, seem that a dispute as to a claim under an industrial agreement is a dispute within the meaning of the Constitution. If, for instance, one side demands performance by the other it may be that there is an industrial dispute within the meaning of the Act; and if there is, then section 6 of the Act comes into force, and says that no strike shall take place. I shall say no more, because there may be two interpretations, but as the Federal jurisdiction has been spoken about, I thought it better to call attention to these definitions. If one of the obligations of the agreement is to perform work at a certain rate; and if there is a dispute as to that, it seems possible there may be jurisdiction.Proposed new clause negatived.Title agreed to.Bill reported with amendments ; report, by leave, adopted.","N/A","CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[59]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I never knew a more ungenerous lot of individuals than the members of the present Government. Ever since they have been in possession of the pay and privileges of power they have been gibing at the men who, for the time being, are politically down.

When this was brought under the notice of the Attorney-Generals Department it was found that the matter might be more appropriately dealt with in the interpretation clause. In the circumstances, it is considered advisable to omit paragraph d of clause 7, and to deal with the matter in clause 3, the interpretation clause. That is the reason why it is proposed that these two clauses should be reconsidered. On two previous occasions when the Bill was under consideration, the honorable member for Swan expressed a fear that under the Bill the Government might be liable, in case of an accident occurring to a ship because of a light going out. At the honorable gentlemans suggestion a clause has been drafted to deal with that matter, and I desire the recommittal of the Bill to propose its insertion.Question resolved in the affirmative.In Committee .- (Recommittal).Clause 3 -In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears -  Marine marks  includes lightships, beacons, and buoys.Amendment (by Mr. Tudor) proposed -That the word and, line 4, be left out.","N/A","LIGHTHOUSES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Paragraph (d) of clause 7 reads - (a!) construct submarine signal stations.It has been considered by the Attorney-Generals Department that this should be omitted from clause 7, and the matter dealt with in the interpretation clause. That is the reason for the proposed alteration. It will be seen that under clause 3,  marine marks, includes -  lightships, beacons, and buoys.It is proposed now to strike out the word  and  before the word  buoys, and to insert after the word  buoys the words and submarine signal stations, so that a submarine signal station will be deemed to be a marine mark.Amendment agreed to.Amendment (by Mr. Tudor) agreed to -That after the- word buoys the words and submarine signal stations be inserted.Clause, as amended, agreed to.Clause 7 -The Minister may-construct submarine signal stations.Amendment (by Mr. Tudor) agreed to -That the words  (d) construct submarine signal stations be left out.Clause, as amended, agreed to.","N/A","LIGHTHOUSES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In the circumstances, he considered it advisable that we should insert in this Bill a clause, similar to a section appearing in the Post and Telegraph Act, relieving the Government of any liability because of any default in connexion with  a lighthouse or marine mark. The honorable gentleman was so persistent in the matter that I brought it before the Cabinet, and as it was held that there were _ reasonable grounds for his contention, this clause to deal with the matter is submitted.","N/A","LIGHTHOUSES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/speech[4]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
