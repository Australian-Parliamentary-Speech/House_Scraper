23,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"SPENCE, William","KUF","N/A","ALP","N/A",10218,"- Recently the honor able member for Wentworth asked for some information concerning the purchase of locomotives for the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway. The following report from the Engineer-in-Chief is now available : -COMMONWEALTH RAILWAYSMelbourne, 18th December, 1916The Secretary,Department of Works and RailwaysKalgoorlie-Port Augusta RailwaySupply of LocomotivesWith reference to the question raised as to the locomotives for the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway, I have to report as under: -In the early stages of the work the opinion was held that internal-combustion engines could be obtained which would haul material for building the line, for carrying on construction work, and be afterwards available to work the public traffic, and apparently the idea of obtaining these engines was not abandoned to the time of the present Engineer-in-Chief taking office. Presumably with such hopes, the ordering of steam locomotives was deferred.When the present Engineer-in-Chief took charge, in April, 1914, it was found that engines on hand, or which had been contracted for, numbered thirty-two; of these, six were not suitable for railway construction work of such magnitude. They were light passenger engines that had been running many years on the New South Wales railways. They were procured in the early stages of the work because of the delay which occurred in the development of the internal-combustion idea and in having suitable steam locomotives built. They were not equal to the heavy construction traffic, nor were they capable of moving the tracklayer train from point to point as required to facilitate platelaying. So light and unsuitable were these engines that in assessing our requirements their services for main-line traffic had to be practically disregarded. They could only be deemed to be of value for minor runs and for shunting in the depôt yards. The number of properly serviceable engines provided for to this date was, therefore, twenty -six; of this number, two only had been delivered, eight only had been delivered by June, 1914, sixteen by July, 1914, but it was not until July, 1916, that any further deliveries were effected and engines put into running. Even now, only nineteen of the twenty-six have been delivered.Serious water trouble had arisen in connexion with the locomotives, the boilers and tubes being badly affected thereby; also a decision was reached before the middle of 1914 to adequately ballast the line, this work to be carried out, as far as practicable, before plate- laying finished.Additional locomotives were therefore needed, and, on 14th January, 1915, the then Government decided, on the recommendation of the Engineer-in-Chief, to procure twenty more, which would make forty-six main line locomotives in all.Of these, eight were imported from Great Britain, as local manufacturers were unable to supply sufficiently early. The remaining twelve were submitted to tenders within the Commonwealth.Representations by local manufacturers were made that twelve was too small a number for economic construction, and that better conditions could be secured by the Government if the number were increased to, at least, twenty.It is1 understood that the Government at the time had in view the possible construction of a north-south railway, and a strategic railway eastward of Port Augusta, either during or immediately after the war. It appears to have been seized of the importance of linking the capitals, as far as practicable, by railways of uniform gauge, and of the necessity, in particular, of connecting for defence purposes the standard gauge Commonwealth line with the New South Wales system of similar gauge, as subsequently recommended by the Railways War Council. This latter work, it might now be emphasized, is essential from a defence point of view. The Commonwealth line, without such linking up to make State rolling-stock available, would be of. little value for military purposes. It would be impracticable to hold upon it sufficient rolling-stock to adequately meet the defence demands, even for light transport. It is imperative, therefore, to have direct access to the rolling-stock of the New South Wales railways if regard is to be paid to effective service.It would be apparent, also, at the time, from inquiries made among private manufacturers and the various State workshops, that the volume of work in hand was such that if the Commonwealth Government did proceed with any other railway proposition, either as a defence measure in some immediate emergency, or as a means of providing employment for returned soldiers, or for the development of the country, the difficulties, delays, and expense which have arisen from shortage of locomotives for the construction of the KalgoorliePort Augusta railway would be repeated in respect of the new work.There was ample evidence, moreover, that prices of locomotive raw materials would rise, which has since been demonstrated, to the extent that most of them are now, and will continue to be, practically unprocurable. This condition will not be greatly eased immediately by the cessation of war, because of the war wastage to be repaired.The Government accordingly accepted tenders for twenty-six locomotives to be manufactured within the Commonwealth (twenty in Queensland and six in South Australia).The contractors, in consequence of difficulties arising from the war, have applied for eighteen months and nine months extension -in delivery time respectively.It might be added that locomotive manufacturers in this country do not possess the requisite plant or facilities foi that of construction. Consequently it has happened, not infrequently, that locomotives had to be imported from abroad, by Commonwealth and State Governments alike, to meet requirements that were beyond the abilities of local manufacturers in the matter of prompt delivery.","KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA RAILWAY","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[6]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

After the present harvest, all being well, there will be available in Australia, with the residuum of last years crop, nearly 3,250,000 tons. If we have the same facilities as we have had this year, it will take about two years to shift that wheat.

With one exception, all the vessels of the fleet have been used to carry wheat. In the case of the exception referred to the ship was loaded with copra for glycerine at the request of the Imperial Government, which required it for explosives. It was impossible to obtain freight for this purpose, because mixed freights pay much better, and private ship-owners were not prepared to carry copra. We placed one of our ships at the disposal of the Imperial Government at their express request. With that exception all our vessels have carried wheat. It was proposed to complete our c.i.f. transactions with Commonwealth steamers, because in that way we should be assured of freight being available for that purpose. It is only fair to explain to the House that we have been able to obtain only one steamer, and, I think, though I am not quite sure, five or six sailing vessels in four months.

I have explained the matter fully in reply to the honorable member for Echuca and other honorable members. The position of the wool-grower is that the Central Board is representative of the industry. The price of each mans wool is determined, not by any Board, but by skilled experts. The only difference between the selling of wool to-day and the sale of it in ordinary times is that there is now a fixed basis of price, and that the value of a particular clip goes above or below that fixed basis as the quality may demand. Once the wool-grower realizes that the price is not fixed by any body at all, there will be no trouble. The basic price - the flat rate, as it were - is 15½d. per lb. for greasy wool. A bale is brought before an appraiser, who, having examined it, says,  On that basis of value, this bale of wool is worth 22 £d. And that is what the owner gets. There are three appraisers. Any one who is dissatisfied with their decision has the right of appeal to the Central Board. The interests of wool-growers are much better safeguarded than they were- in ordinary circumstances in the auction room. It is not now to any ones interest to give them a smaller rate than that which they should receive. The only limitation is the basic price of 15£d. per lb. for greasy wool. No one denies that that is a perfectly fair price, and it follows that the interests of the small wool-grower are amply safeguarded. If it can be shown that the arrangements made fall in any way short of protecting the small wool-growers, I will see that ample provision is made to safeguard their interests.","SALE OF THE WOOL CLIP","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[13]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We sell .f .a.q. wheat for 4s. 9d. a bushel, but if a man comes along with a lot of chick- wheat we do not agree to take it at that price. In fixing the price for wool, the British Government said,  We will pay you on the basis of 15Jd. per lb. of greasy wool. As the honorable member knows perfectly well, some brands of wool always fetch much more than others. Some are sold for 6d. and 9d., while others fetch five or six times that sum.

The point could be raised on any of the clauses up to clause 12, but I think we ought to have some information now. There are many such clubs devoted to bowling, quoits, and other games, for membership of which working men and others pay £11s. or more annually. From such payments there is absolutely no gain whatever to any person; and clubs of the kind have now the greatest trouble in financing their way. As is well known, no charge is made for admission to any of their competitions, but members and others show a ticket or token, such as I suppose many honorable members possess, and such as I myself hold in connexion with the Melbourne Cricket Club. On my ticket, for instance, I presume the club, if such membership payments are liable to taxation, will have to pay about 3s. 6d. I am speaking on behalf of many athletic and social clubs, which are not moneymaking institutions. Many cricket clubs spend all the money obtained from members season tickets in beautifying their grounds. I wish to know whether a percentage of the revenue that these clubs obtain from members tickets hag to be paid in the shape of an entertainments tax. In many cases the holders of these season tickets pay their money, not for the purpose of being entertained by others, but for the purpose of taking part in sport themselves. For instance, the revenue derived from the annual subscriptions of rowing clubs does not equal the upkeep of the clubs. These clubs have also to depend upon donations, and the only return that the members get beyond the actual sport itself are the prizes for which they compete. The same remark applies to the big cricket clubs. They get practically no revenue apart from the football matches, and since the beginning of the war very little income has been derived from that source. As a matter of fact, with the exception of a few patriotic demonstrations, the Melbourne Cricket Club has not been able to provide any entertainments for the holders of its season tickets. The consequence is that the upkeep of the ground has had to be paid out of the revenue obtained from the membership tickets. In addition, it has been stated that the club has lost 2,000 members, or a revenue of over £4,000 a year. This club does not ask for exemption, but it and other clubs are entitled to fair treatment. There should be some exemptions. Possibly; the Board of Referees referred to by the Treasurer in his financial statement could pronounce upon cases where there should be exemptions. At any rate, I do not think it is the wish of the Government to tax clubs, the whole of whose revenue, obtained from membership tickets, is spent in maintaining and improving the grounds, and which are not run for the profit of the individual. I appeal to the Treasurer to exempt them.","N/A","ENTERTAINMENTS TAX ASSESSMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The whole of the work in connexion with the bazaar was voluntary. But the promoters had to pay rent for the hall and advertising expenses, and I think the expenses were over 20 per cent. of the takings. When a church is conducting any of these entertainments it has the advantage of the use of its own hall, rent free. In Victoria, if goods are to be sold, after 6 p.m., in connexion with any bazaar or fete, a permit has to be obtained from the Factories Department. Under this Bill another permit will be required from the Commissioner* of Taxation, and in addition to that, the organizing body, if the entertainment be for a charitable or philanthropic institution, will have to obtain a hall.

The tickets for this, which is claimed to be a true art union, are sold broadcast in all parts of the Commonwealth, and not only give chances for prizes, but admit the holders to the demonstration. The receipts for that art union from all sources in 1915, amounted to £5,912, which, after deducting £300 temporarily drawn from suspense account, and £57 earned by way of advertisements on the tickets, meant a net revenue of £5,555. The distributions to charities, after deducting expenses and salaries, cost of luncheon to delegates, clerical assistance, bands, office expenses and so forth, amounted to £923, or only about 16 per cent. The art union is supposed to be purely for the benefit of charities and under the clause it will be possible for the promoters to claim exemption from taxation on the whole of the admission tickets sold. I believe that the feeling of the Committee is in favour of raising the allowance to 50 per cent., but, before that is done, the Treasurer should be able to give us the data on which he fixed it at 20 per cent. By raising the allowance to 50 per cent, we shall open the door to abuse, and enable people, under the guise of charity, to use such organizations for the purpose of providing billets and enriching themselves. The honorable member for Yarra took exception to my reference to this particular undertaking, and, as usual, defended it because of some association with trade unions.

He is always anxious to get his knife into the working classes, but he need not be anxious, as I understand the State Attorney-General has decided that the art union will not be permitted again, be- cause of the efforts of his friends in the Liberal party, which has always been anxious to crush the organization that promoted it. I have no doubt that they will never succeed in crushing that organization. Every time action is taken in that direction, the workers strive harder to improve their position. The expenses in connexion with the art union referred to may appear to be very high, but I believe that as much as 30 per cent, commission had to be paid on the sale of some of the tickets. Speaking from memory, I think the boys who sell the tickets in the streets of Melbourne are allowed about 15 per cent. The man who. hands out the tickets to the boys gets an extra 5 per cent, to cover his risk. Agents in the country districts are paid 25 per cent., and agents in other States are paid 30 per cent. Honorable members in their desire to injure the trade unions point out one side of the picture only. They take very good care not to let the people know that the country barber or the country hotelkeeper, or others, are paid about 25 per cent, for the sale of these art union tickets.

He did not show that the biggest percentage was spent in advertising and in paying commission on the selling of tickets. The 50 per cent. agreed to by the Treasurer is a fair compromise, but as I have expressed the opinion privately to the Treasurer, I think that it will cost more to collect the tax from this source than will be actually received.

There are six subclauses with great disparity between them as regards the enormity of the offence dealt with. Apparently the proposal is to leave it absolutely to the discretion of the judge in every case to say what penalty shall be, imposed. The reason why there are so many limitations as to sentences in our Statutes is that we distrust the wisdom even of Judges in regard to the imposition of sentences. In Great Britain there have been Judges who have inflicted sentences of fifteen years imprisonment for offences for which other Judges have not imposed sentences of more than twelve months imprisonment. The last offence provided for is the fraudulent gumming, sticking, or attaching to each other by any process whatever the pieces of a stamp or stamped ticket which has been divided or cut. Therefore, if a youngster fifteen years of age gummed together the pieces of a ticket to get admission into a subordinate entertainment, he would be guilty of an indictable offence, and could be sentenced to imprisonment for fourteen years if the Judge trying the case were foolish enough to impose such a penalty. The Treasurer says that he has been copying the English legislation in this matter, but I would point out that a good many of the faults in our war legislation are due to the slavish copying of the English law. Thus we have adopted the moratorium laws of the Old Country holus bolus, without regard to the action of the States. We ought not to copy English legislation without regard to our local conditions. However, as the Bill is to go to another place, I ask Ministers to consider whether they cannot provide a lower maximum penalty for some of the minor offences that may be committed under it.Clause agreed to.Clauses 17 to 21 agreed to.","N/A","ENTERTAINMENTS TAX ASSESSMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/speech[36]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It cannot go on indefinitely; but I think this tax is an unfortunate one to choose for making a fight. If possible, I would rather see a clear line of demarcation agreed upon, so that our respective spheres of taxation may be adjusted scientifically. But in time of war. anything which savours of luxury is a proper subject for taxation for war purposes. I hope the time will soon come when we shall readjust altogether our ideas of taxation. The sooner we reach that day, the better; but, until that time, this National Government is entitled to tax any luxury for the purposes of the war, and not for the purposes of the ordinary civil administration of the country.

As to the suggestion that I am a Unificationist, I must let my record be my answer.

226,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GLYNN, Patrick","KCO","Angas","N/A","N/A",10235,".- I quite agree with the Leader of the Opposition that we must use every reasonable source of taxation in war time, and, of course, we cannot quibble at the amount of the sacrifices we are called upon to make, considering the tremendous pressure brought to bear on the men who are gallantly fighting for us in the trenches. In comparison with what they are doing, our little abnegations are not worth talking about. At the same time, in raising taxation it is incumbent upon us to raise it in the manner most productive to the State, most uniform, requiring the least machinery, and in the manner closest to economic principles. I do think that, in the taxation of entertainments, we ought not to be duplicating the machinery of the States. In America a meeting is held periodically to arrange between the State and the Federal authority what taxes are to be imposed by them respectively; for, while it is competent for both Congress and the State Legislatures to impose any direct tax, yet in matters of minor taxation they realize the folly of having two sets of machinery to produce the same result, and two sets of taxes on the same individual under different laws. I am glad that, after the slumberous composure of the last fifteen years, the Prime Minister and the Premiers are awaking to the importance of some measure of Unification in connexion with the direct taxation of land, electoral laws, and also income tax. This policy was recommended by many of us in the early days of Federation. In1901 I moved in regard to some of these matters, and I find now an awakening to their importance. In the course of the debate in 1910, attention was drawn to the evil of having two methods of valuation for income-tax purposes, and two sets of laws applicable to the same individual. It is for that reason that the right honorable member for Swan referred to the fact that it was expected that, whilst we would not surrender our powers of direct taxation, in minor matters some arrangement should be arrived at as to the exercise of our rights. It would be even possible to arrange that the total amount of the taxation should be collected for both authorities by the one set of machinery. I hope that some Administration will prove itself worthy of the good name that should attach to a wise Administration, by looking into these matters, which, though they do not pay for the moment, from a party point of view, are of great importance to the taxpayers of the States.Question resolved in the affirmative.Bill read a third time.","Third Reading","ENTERTAINMENTS TAX ASSESSMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

at a taxable income of £2,000, 33.600 pence, at a taxable income of £2,500, 40.000 pence, at a taxable income of £3,000, 45.300 pence, at a taxable income of £3,500, 49.600 pence, at a taxable income of £4,000, 53.000 pence, at a taxable income of £4,500, 55.600 pence, at a taxable income of £5,000, 57.500 pence, at a taxable income of £5,500, 58.800 pence, at a taxable income of £6,000, 59.600 pence, at a taxable income of £6,500, 60.000 pence.For every pound sterling of taxable income in excess of £6,500. the rate of tax shall be sixty pence.Bates of Tax in respect of Taxable Income Derived Partly from Personal Exertion and Partly from Property.For every pound sterling of taxable income derived from personal exertion, the rate of tax shall be ascertained by dividing the total amount of the tax that would be payable under the First Schedule if the total taxable income of the taxpayer were derived exclusively from personal exertion by the amount of the total taxable income.For every pound sterling of taxable income derived from property the rate of fax shall be ascertained by dividing the total amount of the tax that would be payable under the Second Schedule if the total taxable income of the taxpayer were derived exclusively from property by the amount of the total taxable income.Additional Tax.In addition to the tax payable under the preceding provisions, there shall be payable, in the case of incomes in respect of which the tax is calculated under the foregoing provisions, an additional tax equal to 25 per centum of the amount of the tax so calculated.Tax Payable in Certain Cases by Persons not Married and having no Dependants.Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding provisions, , the tax payable by any person who -is not married, has no dependants, and is not an absentee, andhas a gross income of not less than £100, or, in the case of a person carrying on business in Australia, has an income from the business which, after deducting from the gross income the deductions specified in paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of section 18 of the Income Tax Assessment, Act 1915-16 amounts, together with his income from all other sources in Australia, to not less than £100, andwould, apart from this provision, not be liable to pay an income tax of £1 or upwards, shall be £1. rates of Tax upon the Income of a Company.For every pound sterling of the taxable income of a company which has not been distributed to the members or shareholders of the Company, the rate of tax shall be1s.10½d.For every pound sterling of the income of a company distributed to the members, shareholders, or stockholders of the company who are absentees, and of interest paid or credited by the company to any person who is an absentee, in respect of debentures of the company, or on money lodged at interest with the company by such person, the rate of tax shall be 6d.The Bill is framed on the lines of the Act which operated for the purpose of the first income tax assessment in the financial year 1915-16. The differences between the two measures are: - (1) The increase in the rates by 25 per cent.;provision of a separate schedule for ascertaining the rates applicable to parts of composite incomes derived from personal income and property respectively ;.provision for ascertaining the rate payable by persons who are not married, who have no dependants, who are not absentees, and whose total incomes from all sources in Australia is not less than £100 ;provision for taxing a company on dividends or interest paid or credited to absentee shareholders, debenture-holders, or depositors, at a flat rate of 6d. in the £1. There is no necessity to explain the 25 per cent. increase. The second difference, the provision of a separate schedule for ascertaining the rates applicable to parts of composite incomes derived from personal income and property respectively, is necessary owing to the judgment of the High Court in the case of Adam Forsyth v. the Commissioner of Taxation. That case rested upon the interpretation of sub-section 2a of section 4 of the Income Tax Act 1915. The Department has taken the total taxable income from all sources, and ascertained the amounts of tax that would have been payable on it if it had been derived wholly from personal exertion or wholly from property. By dividing these amounts by the total income, the average rates of tax on the personal exertion basis and the property basis respectively were obtained and applied to so much of the total income as was derived from the respective sources. The High Court held that this method was not supported by the law, when the part of a composite income derived from personal exertion or from property exceeded £7,600 in the case of a personal exertion income, or £6,500 in the case of property income, and that the rates of tax fixed by the schedules applicable to income from personal exertion and property respectively must be applied. That judgment reduced the tax assessed by an estimated amount of £30,000. In regard to the third difference, this is a complete departure from the scheme of the Income Tax Act of 1915.In 1915-16 the income tax produced £3,933,471. For 1916-17 Mr. Higgs estimated to receive £3,250,000, and from the 25 per cent. increase £1,000,000, making the total £4,250,000. I do not anticipate receiving £1,000,000 from the 25 per cent. increase, because a quarter of £3,250,000 is only £850,000 in round figures. I am informed by the Department that the reduction in the Estimates is caused by adjustments made in assessments and the general decrease in profits from business. So that we do not anticipate to receive as much from the income tax this year as was received last year.","N/A","INCOME TAX BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This is due to the fact that under the old law the exemption disappeared when an income reached £1,020 per annum.

However scientifically the honorable gentleman may express himself, and however precise may be his mathematics, we have the result here in plain cold figures; and it seems to me, looking at the figures, that we have here a simple device to begin on the lower rungs of this tax, and make them as high as possible while leaving the others at, perhaps, a moderate rate. We have been led to believe that what was proposed was an increase of 25 per cent. in the income tax; but it turns out that, in some of its bearings, the increase amounts to nearly 100 per cent. Let us take the case already presented, namely, that of a man with £500 a year from personal exertion. This is the man who, with his fixed income, is to-day in many ways hard put to it, considering the social and other obligations laid upon him. Such a man, who feels the pinch, perhaps, as much as any in the community, will pay under the Bill £12 13s. in taxation as compared with £6 3s. previously - an increase of over 100 per cent. That, I venture to say, is a tax that nobody ever dreamed would be attempted when the Government made their announcement to the House. Surely, under the circumstances, some alteration should be made. We ought not to pretend that we are imposing an increase of 25 per cent. when, as a matter of fact, the increase is from 75 per cent. to 100 per cent. I suggest to the Treasurer that he should do away with all this rigmarole of figures, wipe out his curves, and let Mr. Knibbs, as a sort of recreation, go over the matter during the Christmas holidays. The Treasurer could, I think, by a simple enacting clause, increase the taxation by 25 per cent. in the way promised. This ought not to prove by any means a difficult matter; and all the provisions about exemptions and so forth might be left to a future period, when we are reviewing the finances as a whole. This is not the time to deal with such a question exhaustively, and, further, this has come on us all as a surprise.","N/A","INCOME TAX BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The two sets of figures have to be read in connexion, and the fatal mistake of the Treasurer was in attempting to deal with them singly. I am not going to express any astonishment at the results that are allegedly declared by this method; all I say is - and no one can deny it - that the basis is scientific. By mathematical, infinitesimal, and equitable gradations, each £1 of additional income bears its fair additional increment of taxation. If the result prove unsatisfactory, that would appear to me to be ample proof that the taxpayer has unaccountably found himseli in the wrong place; if he were lower down in the schedule, the tax would press on him less hardly. The intention was to increase the taxation by 25 per cent. But the Treasurer, as he pointed out in his second-reading speech, decided to remove certain exemptions, and that has caused the trouble.

If an additional 25 per cent., with the exemptions removed, gives a certain revenue, and if to restore the exemptions means a loss of revenue to the extent of £120,000, perhaps the loss may be made up by increasing the income tax by 27½ per cent. I do not know whether that would be the case, but, no doubt, there must be an increment which would give an equivalent return. The Treasurer must have the money, and the question is how to get it with the least possible hardship on the community generally. I agree that people with incomes of £500 may already have burdens on them which are very difficult to bear, and that we have no right . to impose a heavier proportion of the tax on them than on the man with £50,000, but if we lessen the burden on the men with incomes of £500, we must place the burden somewhere else. That means that we must steepen. the curve, so that instead of the increase being 25 . per cent. on all incomes it may be 26 per cent. or 27 per cent. The Treasurer himself will indicate which course he prefers to follow: whether he will go on with the Assessment Bill now, and take the opportunity of reviewing the taxing measure at a later hour, or whether he proposes to deal with the latter now.Mr.BOYD (Henty) [4.2].- When the Bill was passed last year just before the Christmas holidays, it was passed on the same attitude that the Prime Minister has adopted to-day. He admitted that he did not understand anything about it, but the House caught the infection of his genial laughter, and the Bill was allowed to go through without a solitary member knowing the ABC of it. Here, again, not a solitary member of this House can explain the schedule before us to-day. The position nowadays is that an officer of the Treasury, or a statistical expert of the Commonwealth, dove-tails some scheme for taxation drawn from the higher mathematics, and puts it before Parliament in the shape of a Bill, and when honorable members go to their constituencies they cannot explain its meaning. On several occasions I was asked by some of my constituents to explain the schedule of the last Bill, but I said that I would take home to my children the curve and the problem contained in it, and see whether they could work it out, for I could not do so. My constituents said to me,  Then why did you allow a Bill like this to go through? I candidly confessed that it was because I did not understand it, and that I had been told that it was a scientific, accurate, and equitable schedule.

On an income of £500 the increase in taxation is about 100 per cent., and on an income of £600 between 75 and 80 per cent., because of the alteration that is proposed in the exemption. Previously, all incomes below £156 were exempt from taxation, but now the income of a person who has no dependants is not exempt if it exceeds £100.

As to the merits of that proposal, I have nothing to say now, but I consider it unfair to pass the present proposal without discussion and a proper understanding of it. I am certainly in favour of increasing the exemption in respect of children under the age of sixteen. It has been said that we should deal with this matter to-day, so that the community may not be called upon to pay the Commonwealth and the State income tax at the same time. The State of Victoria now requires returns for the financial year ending on the 30th June, instead of the calendar year - that is, for the same period as that for which the Commonwealth returns must be furnished. In my opinion, we should relieve taxpayers of the trouble of making separate returns, as they do now. Even honorable members whose salary is a fixed amount find the making up of returns a trouble, and to the business community it must be a serious undertaking. I plead for a simpler method of estimating the tax, and for a simpler schedule.

300,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"RODGERS, Arthur","KZT","Wannon","LP; NAT from 1917","N/A",10243,".- I am in favour of raising revenue by income taxation; there can be no sounder or more equitable taxation. Some honorable members have captiously criticised these proposals without understanding them. The only points that are now at issue are whether the exemptions shall be retained at what they were or reduced, and whether the rate of the tax shall be increased by 25 per cent. We, on this side, have always contended that it is unfair to exempt one section of the community from taxation. The members of the Corner party claim that in practice all taxes are borne by the whole community. That is too big a subject for me to pursue this afternoon. It is of very little concern to the constituents of the honorable member for Yarra what the exact machinery for computing the income tax may be. That is entirely a matter for the taxation officials. Being highly scientific, the computation must be complicated. The scale makes a distinction between the taxation of small incomes and that of large incomes. It would be, however, unfair during war time to absolutely exempt from taxation persons who can afford to pay, putting the whole burden on the comparatively few well to do. The obligation of fighting for the country has been recognised by individuals in every class of the community. I should like to know why a single man with an income of £150 a year should not pay taxation. Every one whose income is above that amount might fairly be taxed on a graduating scale of increases, because it may be assumed that £3 a week will provide the necessaries for a home. The people, especially in war time, should be prepared to pay in accordance with the privileges which they enjoy. At a time like this all capital should be assumed for the purpose of taxation to return a certain minimum interest. Unless you make that provision you allow crafty individuals to hide their incomes and to evade taxation. A balance-sheet should be associated with every return of income, and there should be an assumed minimum return of, say, 4| per cent, from all the capital during war time. It may be that certain industries would be hard hit, and pay more than they should under that system ; but in war time, when money must be found, I cannot conceive of a more equitable system of taxation than the income tax. The present Government and their predecessors have forecasted a wealth tax to provide funds for the purpose of prosecuting this war. Let us imagine the case of a widow and her children, to whom £2,000 has been bequeathed. Under the proposed wealth tax, that £2,000 will have to bear a levy of £30, although the revenue from it, if the capital be invested at the highest rate of interest - 6 per cent. - would yield only £120. I have heard no honorable members in the Labour Opposition Corner raise their voices against the iniquity of taking away £30 from the capital from which the widow and children are to derive their income. But I have heard protests from all round the chamber because those who were previously exempt are to be hit by an equitable* form of taxation. I agree with the proposals of the Treasurer in the main. If there is one equitable form of taxation, it is the in- come tax, because it makes no distinction as to the source from which a man gets his income, whether from shipping, mines, or land. All must pay on the same basis. I have a distinct objection to that particular form of taxation which assails the man who puts his money into land. There are land-owners in this country who have not much equity, when they have to pay two land taxes and two income taxes, while men; whose fleets are floating round the world, are collecting 200 per cent, and 300 per cent, more profits than ever before. Their industry is operated from no base, but they are allowed to go free, whilst the men who carry on the primary industries of the country are singled out for special taxation.","N/A","INCOME TAX BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As the Leader of the official Labour party remarked, it is unfortunate that the Treasurer did not introduce his proposals at an earlier date, in order to give the House an opportunity of studying them in detail. As I understand these proposals, the Treasurer is asking the Committee to increase the rate of tax by 25 per cent , to lower to £100 the exemption allowable to those who have no dependants, and to make an allowance of an additional £13 for each child. He proposes, also, that the exemption shall et ase at £500, instead of at £1,020. In Victoria, the exemption has always terminated at £500. When this Parliament imposed the income tax last year, it made the exemption too high. The Treasurer has stated that, owing to the extent to which the war profits tax is likely to affect incomes, he expects the receipts from the income tax to be reduced by £700,000 or £800,000. If the Committee insists upon taking another slice from the income tax revenue, where is the Commonwealth to obtain the money with which to finance the war? A good deal of criticism has been offered in regard to the schedule. It is not a good principle to have increases in the rate of taxation at every £50 or £100. This schedule clearly sets out the basis upon which the income tax will be levied, and the amount of tax that will be paid on incomes of all amounts. An objection has been raised that the taxpayer will not be able to ascertain from this schedule what his liability to the Department is. I am confident that the majority of taxpayers, when they submit their schedules, leave it to the Tax Department to assess the amount of tax they must pay, just as we leave it to our banker to calculate the interest we must pay on our overdrafts.","N/A","INCOME TAX BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I would sooner have a schedule based on a scientific principle than a schedule which increases the rates of taxation at every £50 or £100. For instance, in Victoria the lowest rate commences at £100. The tax then increases at various stages until at about £500 the exemption is extinguished. The effect is that the man who has an income of £490 gets the full benefit of the exemption, but the man whose income is £501 gets no exemption whatever. Under the system contained in this schedule a man pays on a graduated scale, every pound of income bearing its own weight, and receiving the exemption that is due to it. If the Treasurer could see his way clear to postpone further consideration of the tax until a later hour in the day, so that honorable members might have a chance of reckoning the effect of the adjustments he has made, it would be an advantage to all of us ; but having regard to the war profits taxation to be dealt with later, and to the levy in connexion with the repatriation scheme, I ask the Committee to hesitate before asking the Treasurer to slice off £120,000 from his income by altering this schedule, which, I say, is based on a thoroughly scientific and sound principle. If the exemption was too high before, the Treasurer has done right to reduce it. I understand that because of the exemption, and the raisins of the allowance for each child, the gradual extinction of the exemption until it expires at £500, instead of £1,020 as formerly, and the increase of 25 per cent. in the tax, there is a large apparent increase in the tax on incomes between £100 and £500. The schedule seems to have been adjusted in order to give us a more scientific system of income taxation, a method of taxation which every honorable member agrees is a fair one.","N/A","INCOME TAX BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[7]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Any proposal that may be brought forward on a scientific basis will receive my support if it can be shown to be fair and equitable.

308,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PATTEN, Robert","KXU","N/A","N/A","N/A",10245,"- But if that exemption is just in regard to a man who is earning only £156, there ought to be the same exemption of the living wage in the case of a man earning £1,000 a year. All income over and above that living wage the Treasurer may tax by any scientific formula he chooses to adopt. Income that has been earned is quite capable of bearing taxation. One of the reasons which the Treasurer has advanced for this scheme is that whilst he is decreasing the exemption on some income in a certain ratio, he is giving another concession in the form of an increased allowance for each child. The honorable member knows as well as I do that the men who are earning to-day incomes over and above the living wage are principally men well up in years, and that, their families being grown up, they do not get the benefit of this allowance for each child. Therefore, that increase in the allowance for children cannot operate as an inducement to pass the schedule. It operates merely in regard to those who are young, and whose opportunities are such that they can earn just the living wage, which I am willing to exempt. I say again, that if £156. is to be regarded as a living wage, it should be sacrosanct, and be exempt in regard to all income. That would be a fair and reasonable attitude for the Treasurer to adopt. Then those who are earning larger incomes could be made to bear the burden of taxation to whatever extent the Treasurer thinks necessary. Let me refer briefly now to the method by which the amount of tax payable on a given income is to be determined. Here we have what is commonly known as the mathematical curve. I can understand what it means, but it may be difficult to explain it to a general audience. We have an algebraic formula put forward as a means of ascertaining the tax payable on any income; but under that formula, in order to arrive at the actual amount of taxation payable on a given income, one might have to dive into no less than six places of decimals. It would be practically impossible for a man on a public platform to explain it to a general audience assembled to hear him give an account of his stewardship, without hurting the self-respect of his hearers by treating them as one would treat a child in an elementary school. In order to make himself intelligible, he would have to do so.","N/A","INCOME TAX BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[8]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But when you come, as in this case, to something approaching the differential calculus, which is amongst the highest of our mathematical studies, the position is still worse. As it is, if a member were asked by an intelligent constituent in a public meeting how the formula was applied, he would have to hurt the feelings of other people, who could not follow his explanation unless he resorted to the simplest terms. If this system is to be adopted, then I suggest that every member of Parliament should be armed with a sort of ready reckoner, so that when a constituent approaches him to ascertain what is likely to be the tax on his income, he may be able to enlighten him without having to resort to the devious ways of the third degree, the mathematical curve, and all these algebraic formulae.","N/A","INCOME TAX BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[8]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The point that I wish to emphasize is that, since on an income of £500 the increase in the tax would amount to something over 100 per cent., instead of 25 per cent., as we were led to believe, the Treasurer should allow the exemption to continue as before until an income of £1,020 is reached. That would give him an opportunity to increase the present rate of tax up to, say, 26 per cent, or 27 per cent, on incomes below £1,000 a year, without involving such a drastic and extraordinary increase as is embodied in the proposal now .before us. When the public realize what this proposition really means, I do not think they will thank -this Parliament for imposing a burden of over 100 per cent, increase in respect of certain incomes which cannot bear that additional impost. Incomes between £300 and £800 are to-day bearing a very large portion of the taxation of the country. The public will be surprised when they realize that those who have incomes of from £1,000 to £7,000 per annum are not being called upon, under this proposal, to bear anything like a proportion of the extra taxation which is falling upon those who have incomes of between £400 and £800. I ask the Treasurer to make his scheme a little more equitable, and, if possible, to do away with this algebraic formula for ascertaining the amount of tax payable on a given income, so that there may be an ordinary reply to an ordinary question that may be put to an ordinary politician in regard to the amount of tax payable on any income.","N/A","INCOME TAX BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[8]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I should like to compare this system of ascertaining the amount of taxation payable with that prevailing in Great Britain, and particulars of which are to be found in Hazells Annual. The system followed in Great Britain appears to be simplicity itself, compared with the highly-technical formula adopted by us. It can be understood by a schoolboy, whereas our method can be understood only by clever accountants. I asked three different accountants to explain to me a certain matter relating to income tax payable under the Commonwealth Act; but, apparently, .they were puzzled, since I could not get two of them to agree as to the amount to be levied. At page 582 of Hazells Annual for 1915 there appears a table showing the amount of tax payable on certain incomes under the Imperial Finance Act of 1914, and under the proposals made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 17th November, 1914.I take the following examples from that table : -N/AUnder such a system as that adopted in Great Britain, any one can readily ascertain what taxation he has to pay on his earnings. It should be the duty of every statesman to try to make the taxation proposals of the Government so simple that every taxpayer can clearly understand what he has to pay, without having to consult an accountant.","N/A","INCOME TAX BILL (No. 3)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am pleased to notice that the Treasurer has raised the exemption on account of children to an amount equal to 10s. a week each ; but I think that he might well go further and also provide exemptions for older children who are attending our secondary schools, and even the University. Parents in poor circumstances often deny themselves many luxuries in order to give their children the benefits of education ; and it is the nation with the highest standard in this regard that prospers. Here we have one of the best investments for the State, largely due to the self-denial of such parents, and when an opportunity offers I shall certainly move an amendment in the direction I have indicated. Another suggestion I make is that, as in the case of the wealth tax, people might be permitted to pay their tax by instalments.

This would not only prove of considerable assistance to those interested in the estates, but keep the financial market steady. As I said before, I am very glad to find that consideration, in the case of the income tax, is given to married men with , families, for no doubt such men are serving the State unselfishly, and to the best advantage. A married man with a large family spends three or four times as much as does a single man, and, moreover, contributes in a much greater degree to the revenue through the Customs House. Our Customs- revenue is something like £17,000,000, or £3 8s. per capita, and a married man with six children contributes £27 4s. before he is touched by the income tax, as against £3 8s. spent by the single man. As the children grow up, the married mans expenses increase, and calls are made upon him at every turn. We pay enormous sums of money to promote immigration; and a man cannot serve his country better than, by rearing a large family.

I must confess that, the examples are a perfect eye-opener to me. It appears that it is not until incomes of £1,500 are reached that the proposed increase of 25 per cent, operates, and that down to £400 the tax is almost doubled, while in no case is it only 25 per cent. But we are only having the usual experience when we find such proposals as these introduced  on the last day of the session, when, of course, they have to be rushed through. Something has been said in condemnation of the Federal basis of taxation, but I infinitely prefer it to that of the States. I do not profess to be able to explain the mathematical aspect, but I know that I have to pay a great deal less on the Federal basis than I have to pay under the rough-and-ready system that prevails, not only in my own .State, but, so far as I know, in every State in Australia. The States basis is not only unscientific, but absolutely unfair. Surely the Labour party have been in power long enough to make some effort to have a uniform basis of valuation and taxation, and to provide that the returns shall be made at one period of the year. At present two sets of income tax returns and two sets of land tax returns have to be sent in at different times; one has no sooner done with the State returns than the Federal returns have to be prepared. Taxation is mounting up in a most extraordinary way, and if it continues this will be a good enough country to get out of.

347,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GLYNN, Patrick","KCO","N/A","N/A","N/A",10250,".- This is a clause that requires a good deal of study, though I think that, on the whole, it is right.Under section 16 of the Act the income of a company is the balance of the total income after deducting the payments by way of interest or dividend. There was a doubt whether, in the case of a company carrying on business here, but incorporated elsewhere, payments of interest to debenture-holders not resident in Australia were liable to income tax, that is, whether we had the jurisdiction which wo professed to have in respect of them, and could tax the interest paid to them.. It has been decided in America that a similar tax is invalid. An inconvenience, which was pointed out by a few of us when the measure was under consideration, is that by making the company here an agent for the absentee shareholder or debenture-holder who is living in London or elsewhere, for the purpose of levying the tax in respect of his dividends or interest, we can prevent the company from being sued for the reimbursement of the amount. Although we collect the tax here, and make it compulsory on the company to pay it, we cannot empower the company to deduct it in England, and, therefore, if the absentee preferential shareholder chooses to sue the company at home, it can he obliged to pay to him the tax that the Commonwealth has collected. The amendment of the law now proposed enables us, without any doubt, to tax the interest paid to preferential shareholders resident in England; and to tax dividends paid to absentee shareholders. If a company, registered in England, starts business in Australia, we tax the whole of its profits here, and under the amendment now proposed we endeavour to make the preferential shareholders or debenture-holders pay taxation. We tax the whole of the companys income made here, and then allow the debenture-holders, if resident in Australia, to get an abatement in respect of their proportion of the tax. But if a debenture-holder or preferential shareholder resides in England, there is no power to allow the company to make a deduction in respect of his interest. We collect the tax from the company, but I am almost convinced that we have no power to make absentee debenture-holders contribute to our revenue. An absentee, on suing the company, could recover any amount deducted by it from his interest. We have provided that -A company, notwithstanding any contract, agreement, or arrangement entered into by it, may, with the approval of the Commissioner, charge pro ratâ, the amount of the tax actually paid by it against those beneficially interested in the income of the company.In other words, if the company under the earlier portion of the clause has paid income tax on so much of its assessable income as is distributed to shareholders or stockholders who are absentees, or if it has paid income tax on interest paid or credited by it to an absentee, then we profess to allow it to charge them with what it has paid on their share of its total income. We profess to do that and to apply the same principle in regard to resident debenture-holders or shareholders. But while the Treasurer can collect the tax, he cannot enable the company to charge it to debenture-holders or shareholders who are absentees, because it has been decided in Queensland in the case of Spiller v. Turner that the absent preferential shareholders are bound by the contract entered into in England, and that we have no power to bind them in respect of interest paid by the company elsewhere. Although we have power to tax a company on the whole of its local profits, and although theTreasurer can thus get at the interest paid to shareholders here, I do not think he can enable the company to regain what it pays from the shareholders or debenture-holders resident in England. That difficulty might be overcome by an amendment as follows: -  Provided that a company shall not be liable under (1a) of this section to pay income tax on incomes or interest in respect of existing debentures or shares in cases to which (1b) of this section is, from lack of jurisdiction, inapplicable.","Second Reading","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In making his financial statement he said, as reported in Hansard, page 9444 -The only alteration in this tax, compared1 with the proposals of my  predecessor, is the abolition of the exemption on incomes of £500 and over. The present exemption of £156 on income from personal exertion is allowed in full on all net taxable incomes not exceeding £500. Over that amount it diminishes by £§ for every £10 increase in the net taxable income, until it disappears entirely, when the net taxable income reaches £1,020.That is the only respect in which this proposal varies from that made by the ex-Treasurer. The honorable gentleman himself pointed out that this variation front the proposals of his predecessor would increase to a very great extent the income tax payable on the lower grades of incomes. The increase of 25 per cent, is reached only when we come to the higher grades ; the increase on the lower grades of income is more than 25 per cent.

As things now stand, if a company that is registered in England, and carries on business in Australia, borrows money on debentures in England, and the contract is to pay the interest on the debentures in England, we cannot interfere with that contract beyond declaring that the company, in its operations here, can be taxed on the amount of interest paid on the debentures. We leave it to the company to recover from the debenture-holders the amount of the income tax paid on their behalf. As a matter of fact, the company has no recourse against the English debenture-holder as long as the debenture-holder resides in England and lends the money to the company under a contract by which the interest is to be paid in England. The provision made in the Bill, by which the company may make a deduction from the interest payable to debenture-holders in respect of the proportion of the income tax paid, that might be debited to them, is all right sofar as it applies to those who receive their interest or their dividends in Australia, but it will not apply in the case of those of whom I have spoken. Consequently, the company will have to pay for something that it cannot recover.","Second Reading","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This point has been decided in several cases, and particularly in the case of Spiller versus Turner, a Queensland case, decided in 1897, in which the decision was that the terms of an English contract with the company, under which the company was bound to pay, without deduction, the full amount of interest, could not be altered. Now we propose to tax that interest, and, apparently, give power to the company to deduct it in face of the contract with the debenture-holder in England, but it cannot be done.","Second Reading","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Tn other words, the company will pay the taxation, and not the individual shareholder, but. the company cannot have recourse to the preferential shareholder who resides in England, and has lent his money to the company in England. It is an English contract to pay the interest in England, and is beyond our jurisdiction. Therefore, although it is a proper proposal to get at these preferential shareholders, we will not be doing so. The company will have to pay the taxation, and will be unable to deduct the proportion payable by these people, or to recover it from them.I raised this question on the original Bill, and pointed -out that the provisions were ultra vires. It has since been discovered that they were wrongly drafted, and now the measure has been very properly amended, giving the powers that I have indicated ; but, incidentally, we are not giving the company the power to pass on the tax to the absentee shareholders:. The only method of meeting the difficulty is to have an arrangement with the Imperial Government to enable it to be done, or to pass an amendment such as I have suggested, namely, that the tax will not apply in the case of existing shareholders against whom these companies have no recourse to recover what is paid on their behalf. But I do not press the point, although it affects a considerable number of companies operating in Australia.Clause agreed to.Clauses 13 to 17 agreed to.Clause 18 verbally amended and agreed to.Amendment (by Mr. Poynton) agreed to -That the following be inserted as clause 5a : -  Section 15 of the principal Act is repealed.Title agreed to.Bill reported with amendments.Standing Orders suspended, and Bill passed through remaining stages.","Second Reading","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/interjection[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
