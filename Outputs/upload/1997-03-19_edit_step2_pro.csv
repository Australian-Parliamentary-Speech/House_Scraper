This bill also proposes to correct an unintended consequence in the operation of the cross media rules relating to the common control of a commercial radio licence and an associated small newspaper.The related bills in this legislative package—the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1997 and the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1997—will amend the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964 and the Television Licence Fees Act 1964 to make commercial licences allocated under the Broadcasting Services Act subject to the payment of annual licence fees based on their gross earnings.This bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act in order to make provision for the administration of annual licence fees payable under the Licence Fees Acts. The bill also makes consequential amendments to the Broadcasting Services (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1992 and repeals various redundant provisions in that act.Honourable members may recall that, when parliament passed the Broadcasting Services Act in 1992, the issue of whether to make new commercial licences, that is, licences allocated after commencement of the act, subject to licence fees, was left unresolved, pending determination of the most appropriate method of recovering economic rents from commercial broadcasters. However, commercial broadcasting licences granted prior to commencement of the new act continued to be subject to the payment of annual licence fees.Options identified for the payment of licence fees by new commercial broadcasters included: a one&hyphen;off payment on the allocation of a licence; ongoing fees based on the value of the spectrum used; ongoing fees based on the income derived from use of the spectrum; or a hybrid system combining two or more of these components.As honourable members will appreciate, a pure price based allocation system attempts to recover, up&hyphen;front and in a single payment, all economic rents generated by the use of the radio frequency spectrum and ownership of a licence. Such a system works best under conditions of effective competition where there is complete market information and certainty, but is less effective where there is limited commercial interest in new licence opportunities.Analysis by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics in 1995 suggested that new licensees are likely to earn less profits than existing broadcasters in the area and that this will affect the premium bid for licences at auction. In addition, under provisions for the allocation of licences in under&hyphen;served single service markets, many of the new licences are being allocated for a charge which reflects no more than the recovery of costs incurred by the Australian Broadcasting Authority in planning and allocating the licence.The current arrangements are considered to be inequitable. New players are able to purchase, comparatively cheaply at auction, a right to compete with incumbents who pay annual fees and who in the past bore the cost of proving eligibility under the former merit&hyphen;based allocation process or, in the case of some radio incumbents, paid high prices for the right to convert their AM licences to FM.Under the circumstances, the government has decided that the best way to ensure fair treatment between incumbent licensees and new licensees, and to ensure that economic rents are not lost to the Commonwealth in respect of new licences, is to apply fees to all commercial licences based on annual gross earnings of the commercial broadcasters.Accordingly, the legislative package before the House today, of which this bill is an important part, will extend the current provisions to licences issued by the Australian Broadcasting Authority in its price&hyphen;based allocation process under the Broadcasting Services Act, as well as to second licences in single service markets allocated via the administrative allocation mechanisms in the Broadcasting Services Act.The two prime components of the broadcasting tax regime remain unaltered. Licensees will pay a one&hyphen;off, up&hyphen;front fee on the allocation of a new commercial licence and an annual fee, which will recover the economic rents due to the Commonwealth. Opportunity is also being taken in the bill to correct an unintended consequence in the operation of the cross&hyphen;media rules with respect to control of a commercial radio licence and a small newspaper associated with its licence area.An effect of these provisions is that they apply to all newspapers with 50 per cent of their circulation in the commercial broadcasters licence area even if that circulation is very limited in comparison with the total population of the relevant licence area and their level of influence in the licence area is correspondingly minimal. The bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act to exclude newspapers with a circulation of less than two per cent of a commercial radio broadcasters licence area population from the cross&hyphen;media rules.The financial impact of this and the other two bills in the legislative package in respect of extending annual licence fees to all commercial radio and television licences is difficult to forecast precisely because of a number of variables. These include: the number of new commercial broadcasting licences that will be made available by the Australian Broadcasting Authority in the future; the number of these new licences that will be actually taken up; the extent of any discounting that may occur at auction because of the new annual fee arrangement; and the gross earnings of new licensees.However, the legislative package when it comes into effect is expected to have a progressively and increasing positive net effect on the budget, levelling out at about $0.134 million per annum after 1998&hyphen;99. The other amendments in this bill are expected to have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue.I present the explanatory memoranda to this bill and the two accompanying bills as one explanatory memorandum. I commend the bill to the House.Debate (on motion by Mr Stephen Smith ) adjourned.","N/A","BROADCASTING SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I spoke in the debate last night and in the course of my remarks I said that the export market development grants scheme measures implemented by this piece of legislation reduce expenditure in EMDG alone by $426 million over four years. I went on to say that in Austrade the annual reductions in appropriations are over $90 million per annum.

44,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr CHARLES","OT4","(La Trobe)","LP","N/A",2382,"—When the debate was interrupted last night, I was talking about some of the principal amendments of the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997. Firstly, I was talking specifically about the measure to finally bring small tourism operators into the scheme and to treat them equally. I note that on 2 May last year the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) asked a question of the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. He said:I refer to the Prime Ministers commitment to small business and to your governments specific election commitment to extend the export market development grants scheme to the tourism industry, particularly for the benefit of single tourist operators who are a cornerstone of small business in this country. Do you still stand by that commitment?What a lot of hypocrisy that was, because the former government failed abysmally to even accept recommendations from reports of committees of this House to bring the small tourism operators and to bring the single service providers into this scheme.So this government, in answer to the question asked by the member for Cunningham last May, absolutely has done precisely what we said we would do in the lead-up to the last election. In fact, four years prior to that, the coalition made a commitment to small and medium sized business, particularly to the tourism operators who had been rejected by the former government which is now in opposition. So it is a bit of hypocrisy from the member for Cunningham.Following on from that, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), who is still with us here in the House this morning, on 7 May last year raised this matter of public importance for discussion:The threat to the capacity of small business to develop export potential as a result of the planned abolition of trade and industry development programs, in particular the Export Market Development Grants scheme.That was about talking down the economy, wasnt it? That was a bit of lets go and frighten the horses and frighten business out there when, in fact, the government has absolutely kept its commitment and maintained the scheme.I want to speak about the second principal amendment in the brief time left to me. The minimum expenditure threshold has been reduced from $30,000 to $20,000. That is in line with our commitment to small and medi um sized business to give new entry players in the market—people who want to become involved in export, people who want to expand beyond domestic production and get their products and their services out into the international marketplace—an opportunity at an earlier stage to go out and market their programs or their products or their services overseas. The reduction in the expenditure limit will bring into play more small business. That is what it is designed to do, and I have no doubt whatsoever that in that regard the new act will be successful.The scheme funding is to be capped at $150 million and a pooled payment system is to be implemented to make sure that the small players and the medium sized players do not miss out. As I said last night, I would rather that we did not have to put a cap on such a scheme. But, in the nature of things, given the legacy left to us by the former Labor government, this government had to cut spending, and that is a fact. For all Australian citizens we had to cut spending. It had to come from across a wide range of portfolios without decimating any particular segment of the economy dependent upon government assistance. So the new EMDG scheme is fair. It will operate equitably. It targets the end of the market where we really need to give a leg&hyphen;up to new entrants in export marketing.Some of the other major amendments include applicants with incomes greater than $50 million being excluded. That is totally appropriate. I believe we do not need in this country to keep using taxpayers funds to encourage industry to continue to make greater profits. Industry with a $50 million profit a year level is certainly capable of supporting itself in both domestically and overseasFor so long as we continue to maintain a mentality that it is the government that will make the play for industry—that the government will provide absolute protection for all of its citizens; protection for industry and protection for jobs—we will never progress to be able to play in the huge international market. With only 18 million people, Australia—a small country numerically, but an important country economically and indus trially—will never ever be able to play appropriately in that international marketplace so long as we continue to cosset industry and allow our production to hide behind protective barriers and artificial mechanisms to provide so-called funds for assistance. Our companies need to be profitable, efficient and productive in their own right. They need to be innovative and they need to seek out new products and new services and new markets.That is really what this bill is all about: helping smaller companies and medium&hyphen;sized companies to go and find those markets and participate in selling their products and their services overseas. The scheme as constituted limits claimable expenses in respect of overseas representatives to $200,000 per grant. That is simply a capping mechanism so that we do not allow companies to artificially raise their expenditure in one area to the detriment of the general development of overseas or export market areas that are particularly applicable.One of the amendments eliminates all capital costs from eligibility. That is appropriate in a scheme which has had to be pared down. Capital costs are to the cost of the company, and depreciation costs, of course, apply. But what we are really looking at with this scheme is encouraging companies to do things which assist their marketing effort, assist selling their product and assist in advising the citizens and the businesses of other countries about what it is that we make, produce and supply, rather than creating infrastructure to supply that product or that service. A range of expenditure categories has been reduced from the number allowable before, and some specific items in relation to expenses have been removed from the scheme.

45,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr HATTON","LN6","(Blaxland)","ALP","N/A",2384,"—The Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997 which is before us today is about the future marketing of our companies and their products into the world market in a constrained format; a format where there is a total constraint upon those companies and their ability to do what they have been doing over the last number of years under the program as outlined and put into effect by Labor. This bill limits and constricts the activities of those Australian companies, and it will limit and constrict the returns that they are able to give to their shareholders and to the Commonwealth through tax moneys.This is a very short&hyphen;sighted bill. If we learned anything in the last two decades, it was that Australias future rests with exporting to the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region and to the rest of the world. Unless a government takes steps to directly support small and medium enterprises in competition with small and medium enterprises from other countries, and larger entities that they have to deal with, unless there is that government intervention and support, Australian industries which have done well over the last decade and a half may perish or be dramatically reduced in their effectiveness. That imperils the state of the economy of this nation. The cuts and the capping that are undertaken in this legislation will hamper, limit and constrict Australian businesses in their attempts to earn income for Australia.This piece of legislation does nothing good for this nation. It is a piece of legislation that breaks commitments the coalition made while in opposition. Prior to the last election, the then Deputy Opposition Leader and now Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Farrer, (Mr Tim Fischer) told exporters that there would be no significant changes to the export schemes that the Labor government had developed during its time in office. But, like most other things they said while in opposition, this government came into office and broke yet another commitment. They gave their lies a euphemism: `non&hyphen;core promises.The coalition came into government proclaiming itself as the saviour of business in this country. It promised everything under the sun and has delivered on almost nothing. This piece of legislation is different. It is not simply that they have not delivered; they have actually done something to seriously damage Australian business. In 1974, Australian businesses exported $7.5 billion worth of goods. By 1994, that had become nearly $65 billion. In 20 years, this country had increased exports by a staggering 860 per cent. The greatest gains were made during the time that Labor was in government. From 1983 until 1994, Australian exports increased three&hyphen;fold. From 1974 to 1994, the annual average growth rate of exports to north Asia was 12.6 per cent and to South&hyphen;East Asia, 14.9 per cent. Did Labor stymie business or did it promise to promote and encourage business?If you listened to the ravings of the Deputy Prime Minister, you would think that we sent all business people to re&hyphen;education camps and collectivised industry. We did more for business in 13 years than the coalition did in 30. The Labor government inherited programs like the development import finance facility and the export market development grants; small&hyphen;scale programs that were under&hyphen;utilised. We had the vision and understanding of the usefulness of these programs in expanding the Australian economy and changing the focus on industry in this country. Under Menzies, Holt, McMahon, Gorton and co. this was a country where industry atrophied. Programs like DIFF and EMDG to the Fraser&hyphen;Howard government were a cottage industry that needed to be patronised and paid lip&hyphen;service.Under Labor, industry was given the tools to broaden its horizons into Asia and the world. We made these and other programs export market programs of some merit. Australia is not in a position to influence prices of goods on the scale of the European Union or North America. Being dependent on primary products is dangerous for this country. The prices for these goods fluctuate in the extreme and our economy is not strong enough to handle these changes. The proof of this was the erratic fluctuations that world commodity prices went through in the 1980s. It was the goal of the former Prime Minister and Treasurer, Paul Keating, to change that. His vision and his policies drove Australian business to become smarter and better at doing business. It was the vision of people like John Button, Ralph Willis and Paul Keating that gave Australian business the tools they needed to make the leap into exporting in areas which had not been extensively explored.Australia has a wealth of talent. It is a wealth that for many years had not been promoted by coalition governments in this country. They were happy to exploit the land and the seas. What they gave us was an empty and hollow belief that this country could survive solely on the primary industries that form the bulk of our exports.The previous Labor government and the Whitlam government before it knew that this country had to diversify its industry or it would become a second-rate, tin-pot basket case, or perhaps worse—simply perish. In order that Australia prosper, these Labor governments had the foresight to realise that diversification of industry and exporting secondary and tertiary products were the key to Australias future.To this end, these Labor governments created and broadened programs to assist businesses in this country in their attempts to export products that would bring enormous returns to Australia. One of these programs was EMDG. Created in 1974, this program helped business offset the costs of trying to build markets overseas for their products. I think we all can agree that the greatest hurdle for businesses trying to export is the initial costs they face in breaking into markets. These costs can be too great to make the initial attempts viable or they can be too much of a burden to continue. EMDG gave some relief to companies making the great leap into overseas markets.The effectiveness of this program can be seen in the budget papers laid before this House last August by the government. In 1994-95 EMDG helped companies gain exports for this country totalling approximately $6.6 billion. The ratio of exports to the cost of this scheme was 33:1—33:1! How can this program be so inefficient and so costly that the coalition government could make cuts and restrictions to it? How short-sighted is this ideologically driven group of Luddites, one might ask? They can only see dollars and never have any sense in regard to providing facilitation for our export businesses. Industry assistance is not a policy area where the government sees direct benefits to its bottom line. The benefits do in fact come with more jobs, more exports and indirect gains in taxes and revenue to the government.It is this kind of short-sightedness that this government has become known for. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has clearly indicated that he has no idea what industry is, unless it relates to shares and trusts; the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) wants to clear&hyphen;fell the land and sell off the sea; and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) does not have anything really regional left.So now we turn to the Department of Trade and the Deputy Prime Minister, the sabot hurler of Australian industry. This is a Minister for Trade who has presided over the destruction of government programs and claims he knows how to promote exports. Programs like the national industry extension scheme, DIFF and EMDG were the tripod on which businesses in this country could make an attempt to push their products overseas. Under the coalition, all these industry assistance programs have been cut—contrary to what the Deputy Prime Minister promised before the election last year.It was not all bad for industry, I must admit. They did get their `Supermarket to Asia—butcher everything else and throw ideological crumbs at struggling businesses. The coalition always claim they represent business and know what they want and listen to their suggestions. So it is astounding that every industry group affected by the cuts to assistance programs has come out publicly to say that this government has completely missed the mark with these cuts to these beneficial programs. Time and time again the minister for industry and the Deputy Prime Minister have heard the cries from industry about these cuts. But you would think that they are blind, deaf mutes. They see and hear nothing and then have the audacity to lecture industry on what they arrogantly presume is right.The substance, or lack thereof, in these changes seems simple when reading the changes, but the implications are astounding if you realise the depth of them. Let us look at some of the changes and the implications for businesses of those changes.Firstly, in relation to overseas representations, many companies cannot afford to set up offices or subsidiaries overseas to handle business for them. Many businesses do not have the know-how to do business overseas, where the slightest mistake may mean that you lose contracts. The best option for many is to turn to local business people to help them to enter markets. Does the government expect that these representatives work for free? For a small or medium size firm struggling to enter a new market, the cost of this sort of representation is very high. Taking away this assistance means undermining their ability to exploit a market.Secondly, there is the overseas market development allowance. That too has been pared back. Thirdly, there is communications. This is a fairly simple concept to understand, but the cost to business is not for this government. It is expensive to stay in touch with markets and initially there are very high costs for businesses breaking into new markets. Cutting puts pressure on businesses involved in this process. As we know and understand, despite the fact that worldwide communication costs have been cut with the introduction of new technology, it is still a major factor for small and medium businesses trying to enter overseas markets.Fourthly, product promotions: this is one of the most mean spirited of all the cuts undertaken under the umbrella of this legislation. Promoting a product in a new market is a horrific cost to business. In very sensitive markets like Japan, promotion is a cost that is not cheap and can never be penny&hyphen;pinched. The Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Corporation may have the discretionary funds to undertake an extensive market promotion, but I do not think a small engineering firm can.Fifthly, trade fairs: again this cut is evidence of the coalitions penny&hyphen;pinching, narrow focused and ideologically driven myopia. One of the most effective means of promoting a product to the largest number of industry buyers and consumers is trade fairs. Each industry and country has fairs for businesses to promote and sell their products. The cost to participate in these fairs and have a presence that will interest and impress is not cheap. Most firms cannot afford this kind of ongoing cost. A few days at a trade fair can mean the difference between entering a market and wasting time.Sixthly, literature and advertising: material for distribution and advertising in local markets seems a fairly logical cost when trying to enter a market. Not so for this government. Translation and printing in those countries is another area they do not seem to understand. So the government cut it and tell business they are unwilling to help it underwrite those necessary costs.Seventh, marketing consultants: markets overseas can be very difficult to understand and then sell into. Japan, for example, as I have said previously, is a highly sensitive market and few Australian businesses have the knowledge to enter this very lucrative market on their own. That is why it is necessary for those businesses to engage marketing consultants who have an experience in trading into a country such as Japan, and those marketing consultants come not at a low cost but at a high one. If a business is to understand the market that it is to enter, the business culture within that country, and is to attempt to directly deal with the sensitivities of that market and with the underlying reasons for purchasing undertaken by consumers in the market and also undertaken by chains in the market, then they need to pay out the money to get that marketing advice; otherwise, as with a range of these other cuts, their attempts to sell into those markets are foreshortened and the benefit to Australia is also directly foreshortened.Eighth, patent registration: if industry in Australia needed any more evidence of a lack of vision in a government, this cut is it. How many times have great Australian ideas been lost to overseas companies because individuals and companies could not afford the cost of patent registration? The black box flight recorder is one that springs to mind quite readily. I am sure that many on the coalition side of politics can remember their lambasting of our promotion of Australias wealth of intellectual talent. The idea of a `clever country was met with howls and hoots of laughter from the coalition. The laughter was from mindless ideologues whose vision extends no further than a plough, a rock and a quadruped. This government does not care if our intellectual property is sold by others with no great gain for this country.It is in this area chiefly of patent registration in our regional markets and markets worldwide that we run into a core problem for Australian businesses. They have to not only attempt to enter foreign markets but also protect their original products from exploitation by others. And we have seen time and time again the inability of Australian companies to cover themselves worldwide because of the high cost of patent registration. Time and time again we have seen in other countries a ripping off of those products and then the extension and development of them, at great cost to Australia. That has been a great windfall for those countries, which have simply taken the intellectual product from the people of this country and then worked it to their advantage.There are a range of other measures which I will not go into detail on. On overseas buyers visits, it is quite simple to understand that, if businesses in Australia need to bring in overseas buyers to look at their products and if they cannot touch and feel and handle the products and come to understand them absolutely, they are not likely to buy that product.The 10th measure is foreign language training; 11th, international business education courses; 12th, export packaging and labelling design; 13th, tenders and quotations; 14th, free technical information; 15th, subscriptions to associations; and 16th, airfares. In this bill we see a reduction of the claimable period from eight years down to two. So, if the grant runs for a period of eight years, under this bill, instead of the airfares being claimable—and they are a necessary business cost—over the whole life of the grant it is restricted simply to two years.The coalition government has abandoned Australian industry in its attempts to change our economy. It was under Labor that industry was given the incentive not just to export but to export goods and services that would bring the greatest possible return to this country.Labor saw simply transformed manufactures and elaborately transformed manufactures as a key to avoiding becoming the plaything of commodity speculators. Under Labor these industries were expanded and promoted as export industries after years of neglect by the coalition. In the years 1991 to 1996 exports in these two industries grew by an average of 13.6 per cent, while primary products grew by only 4.8 per cent.This coalition government does not have the foresight to see that the returns that this country can receive from STMs and ETMs are much higher than for goods with no added value. Labor promoted industry and provided the incentives to become involved in value adding and manufacturing. Labor knew that this country could not survive by just selling wheat and coal. Labor expanded programs like EMDG to make this possible, yet this government sees the money as wasted and the program abused. We know that they think the system was abused because the changes they have made to this legislation will affect 60 per cent of current grant holders.

46,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr BOB BALDWIN","LL6","(Paterson)","LP","N/A",2388,"—Today I rise to speak on the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997. I am glad to hear the words of the member for Blaxland (Mr Hatton), who follows in the true tradition of the former Prime Minister he replaced in that seat. Indeed, the member for Blaxland has become the grim reaper, the bearer of bad tidings, `Mr Negative Half&hyphen;Hour Session in the way that he has presented an economic picture of what is happening in Australia. But my colleague the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) did encapsulate what this bill is about when last night he said that it is about to bring benefits to Australia by encouraging the creation, development and expansion of foreign markets for Australian goods, services and intellectual property.I am reminded of the French general Napoleon Bonaparte, who once said, `One must change ones tactics at least once every 10 years if one wishes to maintain ones superi ority. One of the major initiatives of the coalition during the last election was to encourage new growth in our economy, to promote new business investment and to secure the spawning of new jobs, reversing the trend of business closures and pessimism for the future. A catalyst for investment, the concept for this Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997, a total reworking of the original 1974 act, is both timely and appropriate to the needs of our economic growth in small to medium enterprises.Improvements to the bill include repealing and changing the 1974 EMDG Act. Its revision incorporates the overriding imperative of this government that covers policy area upon policy area, that being to provide a fairer deal for small business. Another improvement is making the Export Market Development Grants Act easier to comprehend, by cutting in half the number of words, as well as simplifying the requirements of the existing act, making it more logical and easier to implement, and most importantly increasing its focus on assisting and delivering opportunities far more to small and medium sized enterprises, particularly in the tourism and small manufacturing sectors.The member for Blaxland said that this bill limits and constricts small to medium business. He said that government needs to take steps to support small to medium enterprises, otherwise Australian industry may perish. I seek to remind the member for Blaxland how many small to medium businesses did perish during Labors reign of 13 years. But this shows that this government, the Howard coalition government, is making growth and the sustainability of small business the governments business. That is achieved in part by lowering the minimum expenditure threshold to $20,000 per grant, from its present level of $30,000, and excluding all applicants with yearly incomes greater than $50 million.Again the overriding thrust of this bill is undeniably in boosting the potential exporting stocks of small to medium sized businesses. The tourism and manufacturing sectors are critical to the economic lifeblood of the Hunter and on any estimate will be a core foundation for future local jobs and investment growth.I am very confident that the shift in the focus of the EMDG program will help provide access to assistance for those small to medium Hunter exporting firms seeking to export product opportunities, particularly in light of the announcement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) of the restructuring of the beef industry which will now allow small producers and graziers to seek export markets of their own offshore or indeed through a cooperative process and get some level of compensation for expenditure in opening up those markets—markets which will create a future for regional and rural Australia, long forgotten by this former government, as shown by the number of representatives they have in regional and rural Australia. I am glad to see the benches are full of them right now, because it is representative of their numbers in regional and rural Australia!Under the former governments act, too often was funding distributed amongst a relatively small group of applicants who applied for large grants which were quickly wiping out the balance and limited the potential good effect that this investment was created for. Now that this bill has been simplified and capped at $50,000—something that I am glad to hear the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) actually supported in his speech last night in this House—it encourages the little guys to make that investment decision, knowing that the process is less cumbersome to implement and that the funding is not likely to have already dried up, creating a window of export opportunity for small business.We have removed the process of jumping through three hoops, going over four hurdles, around the back and inside out in trying to obtain incentive and reimbursement for enterprises seeking to encourage export opportunities offshore. The recognition by this government towards the tourism industry and its growing contribution to our total exports is backed by the increase in the grant rate to the full rate of 50 per cent and by encouraging access in joint ventures. Our amendments to the act will position the tourism industry to allow equal access to the scheme for the first time. That is not only desperately needed but also long overdue.There has been plenty of talk in the Hunter of late and plenty of talk in this chamber about the apparent net benefits of the ever-rising international tourism numbers coming to our shores. It is a fair question, and within our home, the Hunter, that debate continues as to what tangible benefit tourism actually delivers to the average man or woman in the street. The simple answer to that question is jobs; genuine job creation in a growing industry sector. Statistics show, and this data is backed by both sides of the political fence, including most recently by the New South Wales Premier, Mr Bob Carr, that for every 17 international visitors to the Hunter one real job is created, and that is sustainable.Within the seat of Paterson the link between investment opportunities in the tourism sector with real job creation now exists and this act will stimulate even further more tourist visitations, both domestic and international, to our region. With the water wonderland of Port Stephens on our doorstep, the pristine and tranquil holiday havens of Tea Gardens and Hawks Nest—where the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) wisely chose to take his annual vacation—along the greater Myall coast, not forgetting the wilderness and ecotourism potential of the Barringtons and surrounding areas, and the historic nature of townships such as Dungog, Maitland and neighbouring Morpeth, tourism is a critical and growing industry in Paterson.Of course, I am not even mentioning here all that the greater cities of Newcastle and Lake Macquarie have to offer in addition to our own world-class lower and upper Hunter wineries. Whilst these are outside the boundaries of my electorate, they draw extensively from within my electorate.Tourist operators are also small businesses facing the same trials and tribulations as many of the more than three-quarters of a million small businesses across the nation. They are reliant upon ever improving economic conditions of less regulatory burden and the loosening of red tape, and a more cooperative industrial relations system. Tourist businesses, like many other enterprises, are now a seven day a week, literally 24 hour a day operation. If ever there was an industry sector that cried out for, and of course has received, a more flexible, practical and down&hyphen;to&hyphen;earth industrial relations system it was this one, and that has been delivered by this government.The focus of the tourism industry across Port Stephens, and particularly endorsed by the Hunter Regional Tourism Organisation, the peak tourism body of the region, incorporates tourism marketing promotion for the greater Hunter. After all, presently 66 per cent of all international visitors first port of call in Australia is via Sydneys Kingsford Smith airport, leaving them literally just two hours away from the Hunter. Presently they have several international marketing partners, they being Hunter based and in most cases fully Hunter owned small to medium sized tourism providers, involved in grabbing a bigger slice of the 4.1 million international tourism pie that has been established in this country.Tourism providers from within the Paterson electorate participating directly within such initiatives include the Peppers Anchorage Resort at Corlette; Eaglereach Wilderness Resort at Vacy; Salamander Shores and the Rydges Resort at Port Stephens; Moffats Oyster Barn and Fishermans Village Resort at Swan Bay; and the Barrington Guest House near Salisbury, owned and run by the Lewis family. It has indeed been run since late last century.In particular I refer to the game fishing competition that has just concluded in my electorate. This international based competition involving 10 days of game fishing is put on by the International Game Fishing Association. Over 1,500 anglers in that competition fish out of Port Stephens. Overseas teams come from Hong Kong and indeed America. From discussions in this House yesterday and in my office with Bob Lowe and Col Earl, I found out that the before and after effects of this competition in that industry have boosted the local economy by some $16 million. Taking the 1,013 marlin that were tagged and released in four days of this competition, that works out at nearly $16,000 a fish—not a bad return on investment for Hunter tourism.Over and above such clear&hyphen;cut marketing initiatives the Anchorage and Eaglereach Wilderness Resort are but two enterprises which are, on an individual basis, off their own bat, chasing the international tourist dollar. The increased flexibility and redefinition of the export market development grants program is clearly the type of wicket that these firms want to see and what will put them in a position to play on.The Peppers Anchorage Resort presently has an occupancy rate to patronage of 10 per cent international visitors. It is the intention of the management to double that figure, to 20 per cent, in the near future. On speaking just yesterday with the resorts marketing director, Paul ORourke, it is clear that the new export market development grants system could be just the ticket to assist them in reaching that goal.The Anchorage is but one of a number of tourist providers in the Hunter with an eye for the overseas tourist and an even greater hunger for their patronage. For instance, Hunter Coach Connections is a coach company that specifically operates between Hunter based tourist resorts and Sydney airport, connecting international visitors directly to the Hunter. There are many Hunter firms, of course, with their eyes set firmly on devoting a significant and growing share of their enterprise to export markets, particularly in manufacturing, that the EMDG program could touch.Tomago based firm Ampcontrol, an electronics manufacturer for the mining industry, is but one medium sized local firm seeking a niche foothold in the overseas markets. Port Stephens Joinery, a quality local joinery manufacturer, also has the goods, the aptitude and the attitude to expand their sales of product abroad. And, as I said before, with the restructuring of the beef industry, opportunities do exist for small producers to explore overseas markets.In my closing remarks I would like to reiterate to this House what the Prime Minister said in parliament on 4 February this year, the context of which said:Providing greater incentive and greater encouragement to small business lies very much at the heart of the—Howard—governments economic plans . . . it is the small business sector which is the real hope of the side so far as future employment is concerned. It is the small business sector that needs more incentive!Nobody said the job was going to be easy, especially in light of the $8 billion budget black hole that our government faced upon reaching office a year ago. With our responsible and fair initial response to the problem in our first budget last August, belt tightening had to occur to ensure the maintenance of future economic growth and ensure the ongoing recovery is not left floundering in a sea of uncontrollable debt.The fundamental principles of the export market development grants scheme have not been altered by this bill. As the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) correctly stated in his second reading speech:The scheme will continue to provide assistance to small and medium Australian exporters and potential exporters through the partial reimbursement of selected promotional costs.Yes, the export market development grants scheme in this tight budgetary time remains well funded. Yes, its philosophy to get small and medium sized business to export, particularly manufacturers, remains fully intact. Finally, yes, due recognition to the burgeoning tourism sector has been not just mouthed but in fact delivered by the Howard government to stimulate fresh real jobs and export growth within the Hunter and particularly across regional Australia.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
47,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr KELVIN THOMSON","UK6","(Wills)","ALP","N/A",2391,"—I come from the vintage that grew up listening to, amongst others, Joni Mitchell. One of Joni Mitchells lyrics was `Dont it always seem to go that you dont know what youve got till its gone. One of the things that the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) pointed out recently was that Labors industry policy stood largely unacknowledged by the broader community and by the electorate until the Howard government dismantled it and people became aware of just what it was that they had. The Export Market Development Grants Bill is one of those bills which effectively dismantles Labors industry policy.First I will point out some of the provisions of the bill. The bill legislates those changes to the export market development grants scheme which were announced in last years budget. That includes capping the scheme at $150 million per annum and that cap includes up to five per cent for the costs of administration, so the scheme is effectively capped at $142.5 million for exporters. This legislation significantly narrows the scope of the scheme.There are things within the bill that the opposition does not oppose. The single tourism providers grant rate is increased from 25c in the dollar to 50c in the dollar and the eligible expenditure threshold has been reduced from $30,000 to $20,000. Firms with a turnover of more than $50 million per annum are no longer eligible and an upper limit of $25 million in export earnings remains.But we also see that the categories under which grants will be made are to be reduced. Patent registration, overseas buyers visits to Australia, foreign language training—I would have thought that was extremely important—international business education courses, export packaging and labelling design, tenders and quotations, free technical information, subscriptions to associations—all of those things—will no longer be eligible expenditure. Airfares will be eligible expenditure for the first two years only as opposed to the previous eight years.People say, `What is wrong with all that? In the first place it represents broken coalition election promises—yet again. We have had broken coalition promises in virtually every sphere of government activity you can imagine: education, HECS, labour market programs, health care. You name it, the coalition has broken its election promises. In this case the coalition made an express commitment during the federal election campaign not only to maintain this scheme but to expand and improve it.The coalitions trade policy document entitled Meeting the challenges committed the coalition to the continuation of the scheme. It said:. . . will look at ways of providing more effective access to export assistance programs, including the EMDG . . . and examine how access to assistance packages can be improved.That is in the executive summary. At page 3 it said:The Coalition will retain the Scheme.At page 30 it said:We will maintain the Export Market Development Grants Scheme.If that was not enough, Tim Fischer stated to the National Press Club on 15 February, `EMDG stays. The Australian Publishers Association said:We had a meeting last year with the shadow trade minister (Tim Fischer), who gave us his personal and unequivocal commitment to the future of the grants scheme.It goes on to say:Last year we studied with great interest the policy statements of both parties and took great comfort from the fact that both the coalition and the Labor Government promised to continue the scheme into the year 1999. As well as that, our industry group had a meeting with the then shadow minister Mr Fischer, who gave us his personal assurance that the scheme would continue to that date.The Australian Publishers Association and other groups such as the Australian Information Industry Association assumed that the export market development grants scheme itself was safe as a result of the pre-election undertakings of government. What we had was broken election promises announced in last years budget and continued in this bill before the House.The second problem is that it is bad policy. Exports are critical to this nations future. If we have a look at the 1995-96 data on exports of primary and manufactured products, they make it very clear. For example, over the past 10 years unprocessed primary products fell from 53 per cent to 38 per cent of total Australian produce exports, while elaborately transformed manufactures rose from 11 per cent to 20 per cent. The data also shows that over the past five years exports of primary products have grown by five per cent per annum, while elaborately transformed manufactures have grown by 17 per annum.That past effort has to be continued. What the government is doing is in fact taking the focus away from manufactures and, in particular, through slashing funds for Austrade and the export market development grants, abolishing other export and industry enhancement programs like the DIFF and the tax concessional arrangements. It is heading Australia in the wrong trade and export direction and that is bad for growth and bad for jobs.It is also bad for debt. I would like to ask the coalition: where has your debt truck gone? Australias foreign debt has recently broken the $200 billion barrier for the first time. In just nine months this Prime Minister (Mr Howard), this government, has added $16 billion to foreign debt, almost as much in nine months as the $18 billion rise which occurred during Labors last two years in office.The foreign debt to GDP ratio, which measures foreign debt in relation to the size of the economy, has now risen to 40.3 per cent. When Labor left office it was 38.7 per cent. We all remember that Liberal Party debt truck which broke down in the Blue Mountains on its first week on the road.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

49,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr KELVIN THOMSON","UK6","(Wills)","ALP","N/A",2391,"—The debt now under your government has increased by $16 billion. What have you done with that truck? You should get it out on the road and adjust that mobile billboard to tell Australians how much they now personally owe in foreign debt. The government seems to have absolutely lost any concern for addressing this issue of foreign debt, which was such a great problem when Labor was in office, even though foreign debt has increased. Regrettably, the legislation that we have before the House, taking the focus away from export earnings, will indeed increase our foreign debt problems.Further, this is not the right legislation to deal with our problems of unemployment. If this nation is to reach the level of economic growth that we need to create jobs, we need those export markets to be expanding and increasing all the time. Once again, the recent figures make that starkly clear. Unemployment in this nation has risen again to 8.8 per cent. The latest data shows that we have lost 24,200 full&hyphen;time jobs. Since the Howard governments first budget was handed down in August of last year, there are 32,300 fewer full-time jobs.This government is not meeting its unemployment forecasts. It has no unemployment goals. But it has had to revise its unemployment forecast from 8.25 per cent up to 8.5 per cent. The big question now is whether it can meet that objective.If you go back, in its last three years of government Labor had reduced unemployment from 11 per cent to 8&half; per cent. We had set ourselves the target of five per cent by the year 2000. But instead we now find that full-time employment has reduced, and there is no sign that this government has any answer whatsoever to unemployment.The work for the dole program is an admission of defeat. It is a sign of surrender, of running up the white flag saying, `Theres nothing we can do about unemployment, so we will introduce a work for the dole scheme. Furthermore, it is a sign that this government has no strategy for industry.I think one of the interesting commentaries on this governments first year in office, at the 12-month mark, was the number of people in small business and industry who were expressing concern at what they saw—essentially a `do nothing government, a government that was inactive and did not have any answers for the problems of small business and the problems of industry. A lot of that was indicated in the responses that came forward quite recently at the Senate committee hearing inquiring into this legislation.We had, in the first place, evidence being heard of the success of the scheme in increasing exports. In particular, the Australian Publishers Association noted that, as a direct result of the scheme, exports in the publishing industry had increased by 100 per cent over a four-year period—from $41 million in 1990 to $80 million in 1994.The Australian Business Chamber informed the Senate committee that it had surveyed its New South Wales members in late 1995 and the export market development grants program was the program that had been most used by the 500-odd manufacturers surveyed. The committee also received quite a lot of evidence concerning the multiplier effect of this scheme. These ranged generally between 15 and 25 times. So, for every dollar of grant these manufacturers and exporters receive, it generates between $15 and $25 in trade and exports for this country.Witnesses before the Senate committee also informed the committee that 42 per cent of the outlays under the scheme were returned to the government in direct taxation, with additional revenue being gained through sales tax, payroll tax, et cetera. They made the following observation:. . . the EMDG scheme is focused, efficient and a relevant scheme offering measurable financial benefits to Australia in the short and long term.Against that background, it is most disconcerting to find that the EMDG funding is now to be slashed by $425 million over four years, being capped at $150 million per annum and having that significantly narrowed focus.One of the other things that ought to be pointed out too is that this is likely to lead to additional red tape in satisfying the demands of the scheme. Most people in this House would know that small business is classically overpressed with little or no discretionary time. Most people would also be aware that this government has made an election undertaking that it is going to cut red tape by 50 per cent. Against that background, I want to express concern at the prospect that the revised legislation will in fact increase red tape for small business and that many small businesses, rather than go through that red tape, will not make application for grants under the scheme, and it will therefore fail to fulfil its important purpose.The MTIA advised the committee of its view. It stated:Any reduction in funding for export assistance schemes would be short-sighted in the extreme, particularly given the level of Australias current account deficit, and would have the inevitable result of reducing the export promotion activities which industry is able to undertake.It is imperative that Australia increase both the number of exporters and the level of exports by existing exporters. While Australian industry has achieved substantial increases in exports in recent years, this growth has been from a low base. It is essential to Australias economic future that growth in exports, particularly of high value added exports, is accelerated.Government assistance programs and in particular the EMDG Scheme are vital to this process. Funds allocated to these programs should be seen as appropriate investment in our economic future and not as a non-essential expenditure to be cut when budget conditions are tight.They further go on to say:It has taken Australia many long painful years to build up an export culture and improve our competitiveness on world markets. These achievements are all now at risk given the Governments short-sighted decision to abolish the DIFF scheme, to increase costs through the recent changes to the Tariff Concession System simultaneously with the final tariff phasedown and all combined with strengthening of the Australian dollar.I might add that the Australian Institute of Export (New South Wales) Ltd made reference to New Zealands experience. New Zealand removed their export incentives program some six years ago. Their exporters have since battled an appreciating dollar, the countrys rate of export growth has now slowed from 12 per cent to four per cent—just four per cent—over the last three years and their current account deficit will be proportionally larger than Australias from the June 1996 quarter and beyond. The institute stated:New Zealands major export growth has been to Australia and its penetration of Asian, European and American markets has been poor. It simply does not have the small to medium sized manufacturers and service companies emerging as large exporters.N/AOther people, too, have made observations strongly supporting export market development grants. If we go back to the Sun-Herald of 28 April last year, their comment was:Like bull mastiffs taken off the leash, these economists cant wait to dismember programs they neither understand nor like. They have ignored a report from the Bureau of Industry Economics . . . which showed these programs are not just cost effective, but crucial building blocks if thousands of Australian small businesses are to penetrate export markets and liberate this country from constant balance of payment crises.That is exactly right. Robert Gottliebsen, in the Business Review Weekly , said:The easiest way to get money is to lop off business&hyphen;aid projects. Although the political repercussions are minor, the damage it will do to Australia is something that Howard and his ministers will have to live with for the rest of their lives.Tim Colebatch, in the Age , said:What is alarming in the coalitions policies and Budget agenda is the evident lack of any strategy for ensuring the (Exports by knowledge based industries) will (increase). Trade and Industry programs are being tossed up as targets for the axe with no sign that ministers (or treasury) are weighing their importance to achieving the growth the coalition and Australia need.That is exactly right. As a result of cuts in these programs, we have seen our rate of growth tapering off. We have seen the budget black hole, which these cuts are designed to fill, actually increasing so that it becomes a self&hyphen;fulfilling prophecy. I think that is one of the reasons the Fraser government lost the election back in 1983. As a result of the solutions it advanced, the cure ended up being worse than the disease and we ended up having worse problems in terms of budget deficits and economic growth. That seems to be exactly the way this legislation is taking Australia.We in opposition have moved an amendment which reflects our concern that to slash and narrow EMDG funding is penny-wise and pound&hyphen;foolish, that saving outlay dollars here has a net negative impact on Australian exports and Australian jobs.It is worth recapping the second reading amendment—which is a particularly strong amendment that the opposition has moved—noting, firstly, that the legislation is in breach of the governments election commitments and, secondly, that it is in breach of personal undertakings given by the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) when he was in opposition. Thirdly, we note that the governments own budget papers and mid&hyphen;year economic and fiscal outlook assume a negative contribution to growth in GDP by net exports for the next two years—a fall from the positive contribution made in 1995&hyphen;96. We note that the governments own budget papers state that for the 1994&hyphen;95 grant year the scheme achieved a ratio of exports to grants of 33:1. So it is a massively effective scheme. We express concern about the increased discretion provided to Austrade in the administration of the scheme. We reject the notion of capping of the scheme, and we further reject the retrospective applicability of some of the proposals in this legislation.This scheme has been reviewed before by a number of bodies. For example, in 1994 it was reviewed by the Department of Finance and the Department of the Treasury, and on each occasion it has passed with flying colours. By clamping down on the scheme in this way, this government shows yet again that it is bereft of industry policy and bereft of an appropriate vision for Australias economic future.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/break/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
50,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr McDOUGALL","KK6","(Griffith)","LP","N/A",2395,"—It was interesting to hear the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) say in his opening comments yesterday on these EMDG bills that this is anti&hyphen;export legislation. He repeated that several times over. We have just heard from the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson) talk about broken promises and his explanation of debt and the problems associated with debt in this country.Let me remind the House that the improvement and expansion of this export development program in this bill is about offering the opportunity to small and medium business to get into the export business. This would give them far more opportunities to expand, to be able to invest and thus be able to employ. That is exactly what this bill is doing. By simplification and expansion, the bill extends the opportunity, by reducing the level to $20,000, for and encourages smaller businesses to take advantage of a development program such as this.When I listened to the member for Wills I was reminded very strongly of his failure to remember what has taken place in this country particularly over the last 20 years. That was the movement of large manufacturers offshore with their manufacturing bases—those people who had been extended the opportunity of export incentives to further expand the Australian economy and improve our debt situation. We saw companies move offshore to invest their money in the markets we should be exporting to and develop manu facturing operations to be able to supply those markets. What we have seen since then is a fall in investment in Australia, and that fall will correlate with employment.I think it is a very sad day when we see members like the member for Wills come in here and make the comments that he made today in relation to debt and broken promises and remember the outcomes of an industry policy that the previous government had, which was all about a disincentive for investment in Australia and a driving offshore of our manufacturing operations. The larger sector industries in this country continue to do that and will continue to drive jobs offshore.In rising to address the bill, I am relieved to see that the length of the current act will be halved in size. Small and medium businesses have found it difficult to do business under the current act. It is difficult to encourage them to get into export operations when they have to deal with a labyrinth of paperwork and have trouble understanding the bill in its form with its problems.The dissemination of information has almost become a required job skill, while fielding paperwork is, as we all know only too well, the major bugbear of the small and medium business community. The elimination of chapters of bureaucratic bumph and the production of a document that is far easier to read and understand are the first indications that this is a good news bill for small and medium sized businesses. This bill represents a change in direction for our community, with a serious focus on the group ignored by the previous government in relation to export incentive programs; that is, small to medium business, the employers of this country.The tourism industry, for the first time eligible for export grant assistance, will benefit greatly. The member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin), who spoke earlier, certainly explained that point very concisely. This will flow through to those of my constituents who work in tourism and the related hospitality industry—not just the employers but also the employees—because it will give the tourism industry the opportunity to sell their product wider, encourage more visitations to this country and create more demand in the small and medium business sector in tourism, enabling them to employ people. Without that incentive, that will not happen. That this growing market has been recognised by this government as a significant export player is another indication of this bill being a positive one.Those small and medium sized business operators in my electorate who are already exporting and want to expand into new markets will also benefit from the fact that this bill lowers the minimum expenditure threshold to $20,000—a very important point I mentioned earlier. Again, this is encouraging more businesses to take part in export. It is actually offering to small businesses who have never been in export before an incentive to be prepared to have a go at moving into it.Of greater importance is the fact that the system has been refined and the rules relaxed to enable these small and medium business operators to apply without having to hire a consultant to make the assessment and manage the paperwork, putting value back into those operators drawers and enabling them to spend more money in investment and thus employment.Businesses with an income in excess of $50 million are no longer eligible. Without having a go at large industry in this country, if you are earning over $50 million a year and you cannot afford to get into the export business, then you should think of the priorities of your business plan and have a very serious think about where you are going in the future in relation to your shareholders investments.With this bill we have clearly signalled our intention to move away from the era of supporting high&hyphen;fliers. The previous government gave great public support to those `here today and gone today members of the school of high profile money spinners. As is clearly evident in this bill, our support has been redirected to those Australians who are working to create a secure, long&hyphen;term future for their employees.To sell a product or service overseas, a business person needs to be present in one of the most popular marketplaces—the trade show. This bill will provide the encouragement and opportunity for those businesses to do that. The facility to claim airfares and promotional material can be of great assistance to a business person taking that difficult first step of visiting an overseas market. As a previous exporter myself, I must say that you do not need to go on supplying that sort of funding ad nauseam. If, after eight years of receiving that sort of contribution, you are still not successful in the export market, you should really have got out of it long before. So the incentive is there for that initial period, but not for the extended period that we have seen in the past.We have had a decade of promoting the rich and famous, which has tended to leave small business operators with the impression that they are too small to be included in the countrys export program. This is far from the truth. So many of our small companies could be and should be, and under this scheme will be, involved in the export trade.Abuse of the system must be contained to ensure that funds are available to those who need genuine assistance to set up an export market—not to continue trying to set up an export market but to set up an export market and then become effective, profitable and move on to develop another export market.Business people who are insolvent or those who have been convicted of certain dishonesty offences will no longer be eligible. I think that should be greeted well by the Australian taxpayer. This also includes people in positions of control and influence such as company directors.In looking at how best to spend the money available for export grants, this government intends to ensure that it reaches those who need the assistance. Let me remind the House of what I said earlier: if this countrys economy is going to be rebuilt and if we are to get past the debt problems that the member for Hatton reminded us of, the debt problems that were developed—","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Let me go back to the comments of the member for Wills in relation to debt. It was the continuation of the climbing of the debt created by the last government in the last 13 years that left this country and our government with the problems of dealing with the debt. Dealing with the debt is the responsibility of all parts of the Australian community. I do not believe that anybody should be exempted from dealing with that problem.Therefore, what we are asking industry to do is work smarter and work better to be able to ensure that they get the results that they are looking for. Through this bill, we will continue to support those enterprises who show that initiative and show that enthusiasm to be able to expand our export markets.Already many Australians have been successful in penetrating Australias highly competitive markets. That is commendable. But, as I said earlier in this speech, in the last 20 years too many of our companies, particularly our large companies, after getting into that Asian market as an export operator then moved into that market through investment of Australian money to become a manufacturer in the Asian market and, therefore, a domestic supplier to that market, with less return for this country. That is why, as I said before, we encourage this new emphasis on the EMDG to small and medium business to grow and prosper in Australia, invest in Australia and, therefore, employ in Australia.The countries which go to make up Asia are not only geographically our nearest export market but are also collectively twice the size of the rest of the worlds markets. Continuing deregulation continues to open up opportuni ties offshore for Australian exporters. This government can help business operators to identify and keep abreast of those market changes.While the fundamental principles of our export grants scheme have not changed, there has been a shift in attitude and assistance towards small and medium sized businesses. These are the people who employ, as I have said before, the greatest number of Australians and the people who must be supported when they take steps to enter those new opportunities. Those who have already taken the steps and are experienced in exporting are still eligible to apply as they develop into new markets.It was pointed out to me recently that if every Australian spent one less dollar on an imported product and one dollar more on an Australian product we would see a remarkable change in our economy. To that same end, for every manufacturer of Australian made products or designer of services that we can assist to expand his or her market to the world an increase in employment can be the only result. That is what the Labor Party in the last government failed to do. That is what this bill is about to do. This bill is not about handouts but productive assistance to those businesses that will assist the growth of the economy of this country and the employment in this country, and this will benefit the entire nation.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
57,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr ROCHER","ZI4","(Curtin)","IND","N/A",2397,"—`Trade suicide was how one Australian exporter responded to speculation that the export market development grants—EMDG—scheme would be axed in the 1996 federal budget. He observed that export assistance schemes were essential to Australias export industry, given our distance from foreign markets. Exporters breathed a sigh of relief upon learning that the scheme would not be done away with in its entirety. However, there has been an outcry amongst many small business operators since the implications of the governments bill became clear.The need is recognised for carefully targeted export programs that link Australian businesses with foreign companies and markets. One need look only at successive bal ance of payments reports to see that Australia still has a long way to go in developing a solid export culture.Since 1974 the EMDG scheme has played an important role in assisting business to develop successful niche marketing strategies. It is estimated that, for every dollar spent on the scheme, the return to Australia was $35—a substantial return in anybodys language. However, the legislation relating to the EMDG has burgeoned over the past 25 years to the point where it acts as a disincentive to those small and medium sized enterprises, the SMEs, intending to make their move into the global marketplace.The government is to be commended on its efforts to reduce the length and the complexity of the principal act. The coalition is also seeking to enact several measures that aim to refocus the program on assisting small and medium sized enterprises. The reduction of the minimum expenditure threshold from $30,000 to $20,000 is a welcome move, although it is arguable whether this reduction is sufficient to be of any real benefit to most SMEs.However arbitrary, the exclusion of applicants turning over more than $50 million annually from accessing the scheme is a fair and reasonable decision. As the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) made clear in his second reading speech, this will help channel limited funds to some of those SMEs most in need of assistance.Support for this legislation is far from unqualified. Contact with several small business proprietors who have proven to be very successful in exporting Australian products and services to foreign markets gives rise to legitimate concern. Those contacts have expressed deep reservations over key aspects of this bill. So too has the Australian Institute of Export (WA)—IAE (WA)—an organisation that represents 300 Western Australian exporters.The proposed legislation gives Austrade extensive powers of discretion. For example, clause 24 in the explanatory memorandum states:Eligibility of goods is . . . subject to consideration by Austrade that the export of the goods will derive a significant net benefit to Australia.The Australian Institute of Export (WA) argues that such subjective powers will fuel uncertainty in the market and will have a negative impact upon exporters promotional activities.Perhaps the most insidious aspect of the legislation being debated lies in its retrospective application in certain areas. The explanatory memorandum tells us that, once enacted, the amendments will have retrospective application to 1 July 1996. On 24 August 1994, I spoke in this place representing and leading debate on behalf of the coalition, which was then in opposition, on a bill to do with human services and health legislation. In my closing remarks then I made the following observation:. . . we in the coalition . . . are totally opposed to retrospectivity when it comes to attacking the taxpayer . . . We do not believe that legislation should be retrospective in harming or taking away things from the people of Australia.That was then and now is now. Over the considerable period of my service in the parliament, I have remained totally consistent in my opposition to retrospective legislation unless it confers a benefit, redresses an injustice or rights a wrong to individuals. Although flirting with the principle from time to time, particularly when in opposition, the same cannot be said of the coalition in government.I received a letter from Mrs Jennifer Lucas of G.W. Lucas and Sons Pty Ltd regarding the EMDG Bill. This company, as I understand it, operates in northern and regional Victoria. Mrs Lucas said:How can a company plan for their export future if the grant can be changed so suddenly and drastically?She went on to say:How can these proposals if approved at the end of February apply to claims for a current claim year that is almost finished? This seems extremely unfair.G.W. Lucas and Sons has been operating for 5&half; years in regional Victoria. It designs and manufactures sawmills and other mechanical instruments. One of its more recent develop ments, the Lucas Mill, has been marketed very successfully in North America, Europe, Africa and the Pacific Islands. Sixty per cent of its sawmill production is now exported and export sales reached $645,000 in the financial year 1995-96. The company expects export sales for the current year to top the $1 million mark.G.W. Lucas is now the largest supplier of portable swing blade circular saws. According to the exposure draft of this bill, the underlying principle of the EMDG scheme `is that incentives are only provided to export businesses that can return significant net benefits to Australia. There can be little doubt that G.W. Lucas and Sons fits this brief, yet it is to be excluded from the very scheme that helped bring about its success—not to mention a tidy return to the Australian economy.To date, the EMDG has made it possible for the Lucas family to promote their product by subsidising travel costs to international trade shows. As a result of this exposure, the Lucases now have patent protection in 80 countries on the Lucas Mill. G.W. Lucas employs 16 staff in addition to six family members. Mrs Lucas states that another 250 Australian companies benefit from the spillover effects of the success of her family business.G.W. Lucas and Sons is just one example of a small Australian business that is making its mark in international circles thanks to prudent business planning, a preparedness to take a risk and access to the EMDG scheme. But, like numerous other Australian companies, G.W. Lucas and Sons will no longer be entitled to the EMDG, which permitted the carry forward of unmatched eligible expenditure. As the Australian Institute of Export (WA) makes clear:Businesses have continued to incur expenditure in the years 1994-95 and 1995-96 in the expectation that these expenses could be carried forward until their 1996-97 application.That facility has now been denied them retrospectively. That is totally unacceptable. I will support any motion moved by the opposition to correct that.Mrs Lucas is not alone in her criticism of the government on the issue of retrospectivity. Mr Barry Crommelin, the Managing Director of Crommelin Chemicals in Western Australia, had this to say in a fax to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), dated 12 March 1997:Retrospective legislation no doubt has its place in catching crooks, but should it be used to catch honest businessmen who have made a decision on export expenditure based on present legislation only to have those claims rejected based on subsequent retrospective legislation?Mr Crommelin is critical of the proposed retrospective amendments on airfares, suggesting that it will disadvantage those SMEs which have started to make some inroads into the international marketplace. The retrospective nature of this legislation will see Mr Crommelins claim for travel prior to 30 June 1996 disallowed. He argues that to lose the claim is unfair because, at the time of incurring the fare cost, there was no indication that the government planned to move the goalposts on his and other affected small businesses.This is not an example of retrospective legislation being incurred to confer a benefit or correct an injustice towards an individual. It is designed purely and simply to beef up Treasurys coffers at the expense of Australias small business sector involved in international marketing.The financial impact statement accompanying the bill indicates that the government will save $366.1 million over the next three years as a result of these proposals. But one has to question the logic behind slashing this amount of money from a scheme that not only produces $35 for every $1 invested but has underspent its budget for the past two years.Under the new scheme, airfares may be claimed in respect of only the first two grants. In other words, a first time claimant will be compensated for airfares for any overseas marketing they engage in while two-year plus claimants marketing to a new country for the first time will be excluded from making any claim on airfares. It is argued that this will discourage long-term business planning and may cause small businesses to reconsider developing export opportunities. If so, that is regrettable.It is clear that the government must work within very specific fiscal parameters in conducting the EMDG scheme. It is reasonable that a cap be introduced to facilitate accurate budget planning, but it is highly questionable whether this legislation supports the equitable distribution of funds amongst the small business sector. Under the proposed changes, family trusts will no longer be eligible to make a claim under the EMDG scheme. The exclusion of family trusts from the EMDG will also be applied retrospectively to 1 July 1996.Another concern of the Australian Institute of Export (WA) is that the government made no announcement about this exclusion until December last, December 1996. In other words, trusts continued to expend resources promoting their exports for nearly six months before being made aware of the governments intentions. These small business operators were led to believe that they would be reimbursed this expenditure, only to have the government withdraw support retrospectively. So much for an open, accountable and consultative government.This bill will exclude trusts from the scheme because of Treasury fears that the trust structure allows businesses to defer the payment of tax. However, the government is hard pushed to provide any evidence of abuse of the EMDG scheme by trusts, just as it failed to substantiate its claims that industry was rorting the R&D syndication provisions on a large scale before it savaged that program.Trusts are a legitimate business structure and are adopted by many small family businesses—the very sector which is supposed to be sponsored by the government under the EMDG scheme. The exclusion of trusts from future participation in the scheme is clearly another example of Treasurys attempts to rein in current government expenditure without any regard to Australias ability to compete internationally in the longer term.Mrs Jennifer Lucas predicts that the exclusion of G.W. Lucas—which has a trust structure—from the scheme will see a decrease in staffing levels, a drop in export earnings and, therefore, a reduction in revenue to the government as a result of reduced company tax.Trusts are obliged to pay payroll, sales, group and fringe benefits taxes like any other business. Both Crommelin Chemicals and G.W. Lucas and Sons employ staff who each pay income tax. Crommelin Chemicals now pays more company tax on the profits from exports than the amount of assistance it receives under the EMDG scheme, so it is more than paying its way in terms of taxes. A small business based on a trust set-up will take no fewer risks than any other small business when it comes to deciding to expand into the global marketplace. The governments decision to exclude trusts retrospectively is indefensible.The Australian Institute of Export (WA) is also critical of discrimination against knowledge intensive industries under the new scheme. The institute, of course, favours keeping knowledge in technology. Under the proposed guidelines, the categories of expenses that will be reimbursable will be reduced from 11 to five. What is most disturbing about this is the make&hyphen;up of the reduction. Promotional activities, including the provision of free samples, attendance at trade shows and the production of advertising material, will continue to be eligible. Businesses involved in either tourism or manufacturing consumer goods will benefit from EMDG claims. However, patents, tenders and quotations—promotional methods critical to the success of exporting knowledge intensive products—will now be excluded. As the AIE (WA) observed:Western Australian exporters will be particularly disadvantaged because this states exports are predominantly those from jobbing manufacturers, service industries and providers of property rights.This proposition is backed by G.W. Lucas and Sons. Mrs Jennifer Lucas points out that patents are required to be paid in each individual country and must be renewed annually. She wrote that her patent attorney estimates that patents in new countries will cost G.W. Lucas and Sons more than $140,000 each year, a considerable sum of money for any small business, and this does not include ongoing patent costs.Australian exports cannot afford to attend international trade events without the protection of patents. As Mrs Lucas said:I could understand it if the EMDG did not wish to be seen to be financially contributing to the value of our product, but when patent costs are ongoing and not just one initial payment, it then disadvantages products that are unique to the export market and reduces potential export earnings for Australia.The coalitions decision to remove patent costs from the EMDG scheme is anti&hyphen;technology, anti&hyphen;growth and anti&hyphen;employment. The AIE (WA) asserts that this legislation is also anti&hyphen;small business. It maintains that small exporters are more reliant on the EMDG scheme to help meet the costs of airfares, patents and registration than are their bigger competitors. It said:The retaining of overseas representation expenses to a maximum of $200,000 is of considerably more benefit to large companies than smaller ones because small companies cant afford to have overseas representative offices.I am going to run out of time. I will have to leave it there, I regret.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
58,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr RICHARD EVANS","3V5","(Cowan)","LP","N/A",2401,"—I must say before commencing my presentation on the EMDG bills that I am disappointed with what has come from the other side of the parliament on this legislation—disappointed because, after 13 years of Labor, one would expect that the message the Labor Party had from the electorate 12 months ago was that there was a need for change in the way we do things in Australia. This is one of the things that we need to change. It is unfortunate that the Labor Party would rather continue their policies of the last 13 years. They come into this place to debate bill after bill saying that they disagree with what we are trying to do and that they would rather go back to the last 13 years of operation. On 2 March last year, the electorate referred to the Labor Party and said no, they did not want any more of that 13 years of management. The bills that we are talking about today are two of those bills of change.This legislation will create a revised Export Market Development Grants Act, which will repeal the current Export Market Development Grants Act 1974. As members are aware, the export market development grants scheme provides grants mainly to small or medium sized companies to assist in offsetting overseas marketing costs while the companies are entering and/or developing export markets. The present scheme which this legislation will replace has morphed into what many of the previous Labor government policies had shown themselves to be: fat, overly complicated, troublesome and a monetary black hole. Isnt that description of the previous program very much atypical of a description of the Labor Party, in that it is fat, overly complicated, troublesome and has monetary black holes?The current government recognises the export market development grants scheme as a highly worthwhile operation that has been assisting Australian exporters for over 22 years—we in fact say it has been helping Australian exporters over 22 years—and that has the potential to continue to do so. However, the legislation before the House today is evidence that the scheme needed to be updated. As outlined in the second reading speech, these bills simplify the structure and make the criteria of the scheme easier to understand. Something we need to do in export is to understand more easily how to go about exporting. The focus on assistance to small to medium enterprises will be increased, and an upper limit of $150,000 per year will be placed on the cost of the scheme.Full rate eligibility is delivered for the first time to the tourism industry. The minimum expenditure threshold has been lowered to $20,000 per grant to benefit more small and medium enterprises. In addition, applicants with income in the grant year in excess of $50 million will no longer be eligible to receive a grant for that year, thus freeing up available funds for those exporters most in need of assistance. Who could argue with that? The option left to the present government is to fix the leaky boat left by the previous Labor government or else let it sink to the bottom under the weight of its own complexity. The scheme remains a well&hyphen;funded program, despite the cap of $150 million placed on the grants.We must take stock of the savings that will be created by this particular legislation, estimated to be almost $100 million in 1997&hyphen;98, $121 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and $145 million in 1999&hyphen;2000. These are important savings that should not be sniffed at by parliament—in fact, they probably are sniffed at by the other side—savings that the Labor Party could not provide and did not even have the ability to address.The importance of exporting our industries products can never be underestimated in Australia. This scheme will still play an important role in developing contacts overseas for Australian businesses. This government has already proved that it has reduced the burden of debt that this country has to suffer, but it is important to realise that the government alone cannot support businesses which are keen to participate in the export market or are already doing so. It is important to support them, especially the small ones, and that is what the government is trying to do. However, we have to maintain operations while taking into account the damage caused by the previous Labor government, and that means downscaling operations.While we are on the topic of Labors failures, let us just take a brief look at the trade and industry sectors under the last Labor government. Labors policies resulted in a decline in Australias total market share of world trade. From 1989 to 1994, Australias total market share declined by nine per cent. Labor failed to take advantage of the high growth economies in Asia, although there is a lot of rhetoric on that particular issue. From 1989 to 1994, Australias total market share declined by 13 per cent in ASEAN and by 20 per cent in east Asian areas.Labor failed to deliver the economic reforms necessary to improve the competitiveness of the export sector in international markets. Employment regulation, taxation, transport costs and other infrastructure charges place constraints on export activity. These are the calling cards the last Labor government left for us, challenges which the present government has to address and will address.In contrast, I can give you an example of a smaller economy, a state economy, which is paving the way for the national economy. Obviously, the Western Australian economy does not have the wide range of sectors at its disposal as the national economy does. But its economy does offer encouraging signs of where we can go nationally. In looking at the Western Australian economy, it is apparent that we are engaging wide and varied export market interests. In the past, the sheer isolation factor was a disadvantage or even a deterrent for many Western Australians to become involved in any sort of business dealings. These days I am pleased to say that things are much different.According to the Western Australia branch of Austrade, last year 450 claims were made for grants, of which 421 were successful. This was approximately 10 per cent of the total grants allocated nationally. The total grants awarded in Western Australia came to somewhere in the vicinity of $21 million—money that would have been of great use to the successful companies. It is hard to know at this stage how the proposed cap on expenditure, with the maximum limit of $50,000 being paid out to a company, will affect the current system in Western Australia. However, the average Western Australian claim tends to be $42,000—less than the maximum limit. In this sense, the changes to the scheme in terms of the amount of grants offered will possibly not make a huge amount of difference to the current situation in that state.The Western Australia Department of Commerce and Trade has eight offices in South&hyphen;East Asia—in Malaysia, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, Japan and Korea. Western Australia has a very healthy interest in the region. With the level of population and the amount of growth going on in many of these areas, it is encouraging to know that Western Australia and the Australian economy as a whole are able to take advantage of the new business frontiers offered by these countries.The Western Australia Department of Commerce and Trades offices in these areas act as business brokers for business operators and for companies in the region which want to develop business interests in Australia. They also act as a contact point for Australian companies wanting to do business in the region. I recently received some figures from the Western Australia Department of Commerce and Trade which explain our states current economic outlook. I want to take a few moments to indulge members with what a lovely picture these particular figures paint. Many of these figures explain Western Australias heavy presence in the Asian region in general.Exports to Japan passed the $5 billion mark in 1994&hyphen;95 for the first time. Japan remains the states top trading partner, accounting for 30 per cent of exports. Eight out of Western Australias top 10 export markets are in Asia, and 70 per cent of the states total exports are destined for Asia. Key indicators of the state economys strong performance include economic growth—gross state product or GSP—increasing by 5.7 per cent in real terms in 1994&hyphen;95, higher than the national average in that same period of 4.5 per cent.In 1995&hyphen;96, Western Australia exported goods worth nearly $19 billion. The state was the largest contributor, at 25 per cent, to the nations total merchandise exports of $75.9 billion. Exports increased by five per cent to $16.5 billion, equivalent to around one&hyphen;third of GSP. In contrast, during 1995&hyphen;96 Western Australias direct international imports totalled $6.2 billion.These figures were supplied by the Western Australia Department of Commerce and Trade. The department makes the point that the states strong economic performance, accompanied by significant restructuring, has made the state more competitive. I draw members notice to this observation: the presence of restructuring and reform within various areas of the states services has added to the efficiency and the profitability of the states economy as a whole.This is something that the previous Labor government in Western Australia did not contribute to. Premiers Burke, Dowding and Lawrence—plus, of course, David Parker who, I believe, is a former minister for trade—are all Labor leaders who should never be forgotten in Western Australian political history, nor should they be forgotten in Australian political history. We can look back at some of the more notable Labor achievements within Western Australia: they had a budget which plunged into deficit and they lost Western Australias AAA credit rating, among other factors.Currently within Western Australia, direct trade in the services sector makes up an estimated 15 per cent of exports and is valued at around $2.3 billion. This is something that the Labor Party, when in power in Western Australia, did not really address. The services sector is a major one, and growing rapidly. This has all happened since the Court coalition government was elected in 1993. The services Western Australia are able to offer this part of the world are quite extensive. Medical, architectural, landscaping, structural engineering, mining and even the production of videos are just a few of the services that are provided.A lot of work such as landscaping, architecture and engineering is done in countries such as Indonesia where resorts and golf courses are being built. The South&hyphen;East Asian region and countries such as India, Africa and China are extremely important to the Western Australia economy in particular due to its geographic location.As Western Australia has such a superior gold industry, for example, it is able to offer these countries highly experienced trained personnel. I was recently in Zimbabwe speaking to some Western Australians there who were showing the Zimbabwe government how to produce a gold mining town and a gold mine itself. I was given an example of how valuable a contribution a Western Australian company can make to an overseas country. As the operations on mines are extremely expensive, operators need the most experienced so as to get the job done—such as drilling and blasting—in the quickest time possible to save money. Australian companies are able to offer their expertise in this area and save a lot of time and money. This is an example of a larger service operation.The smaller ones are highly important to the economy and the Western Australia economy in particular. I would like to give members some brief examples of the type of operations that make Western Australia export markets really tick over. You may recall that, in an earlier speech I made this week, I mentioned the work of a company within my electorate which is doing quite well for itself in an unusual area, that is, making large neon signs. This would not automatically feature in peoples minds as being a money making venture, let alone being something which could be seen as competing at an international level. But that is precisely what this company in Wangara called Signlight has done. Recently, it has been making large signs for the new Planet Hollywood restaurant in Melbourne.The project director of the company invited me over to have a look at the sign they were completing. When I stopped by, I was quite surprised by the size of the sign, which had a six&hyphen;metre sphere. Perhaps one may not think too hard about its impressiveness when it is perched on top of a Planet Hollywood restaurant, but when one looks at it in a block and actually stands in it and sees the letters making their way up through this sphere it is quite impressive.I must admit that I was quite surprised to hear that the company had already made similar signs for Planet Hollywood restaurants in Sydney, Singapore, Bangkok and Guam and further projects are planned for the Gold Coast and Auckland. That is just one Western Australian company making some exports in sign manufacture.Another Western Australian company, called the Schaffer Corporation, is the holding company for a wide variety of interests, both national and overseas. The corporations headquarters are in Western Australia. Looking at the corporations annual report, one sees a list of part and wholly owned companies that are nationally spread across the country. In particular, the corporation holds a 47.5 per cent interest in Australian Leather Holdings, a leather company whose head office is in Perth. Amongst its various operations, it exports furniture leather to countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan and the Philippines. This is another example of a Western Australian company which has overcome the tyranny of distance in Australia and which is leading the export drive into Asia.With this lowering of expenditure, the Western Australia branch of Austrade feels that, while there may be a lowering of expenditure for those needing to claim, the general spread of industries that will participate will hopefully increase, including smaller companies. I think this is an important emphasis. The export market development grants scheme will encourage a broader spread of companies receiving grants of assistance—a situation which would be welcomed by all members with an interest in matters associated with trade.This spread extends to the tourism industry having equal access to the scheme for the first time. Tourism is the important new business in this particular nations economy. Hopefully, this will pave the way for the broadening of the Western Australia tourism industry. In 1995, Western Australias approximately 486,000 international visitors accounted for 13 per cent of such visitors to Australia. International tourist expenditures in Western Australia were estimated to total nearly $670 million in 1995.The Department of Commerce and Trade in Western Australia also notes that tourism is one of Western Australias best growth prospects. Already having been given a recent boost by the selling and promotional powers of Ms Elle Macpherson, the WA tourism industry is growing but has still a lot of potential that has yet to be realised. Over the last 10 to 15 years, Western Australia has seen a massive increase in the services that it can offer to tourists. A big issue in Western Australia has always been the distance between tourism locations. For instance, Ms Macpherson demonstrated this fact in the course of her recent advertising campaign promoting the west. According to a report in the West Australian , she travelled over 4,500 kilometres from the town of Denmark in the south&hyphen;west to the Bungle Bungles in the Kimberley. And that is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of Western Australias tourist destinations.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[8]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

60,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr RICHARD EVANS","3V5","(Cowan)","LP","N/A",2401,"—The whole campaign was not a `bungle bungle. The point was that the Labor Party was full of bungles; it never got its act together to be able to do it. Transport services for tourists are now improving and it is much easier for tourists to visit the more out of the way areas of the state. Many small towns in Western Australia, previously predominantly agricultural, are now topping up their local economies by catering to the tourist market. The positive results can be seen by towns reinventing themselves as tourist destinations by upgrading public works and amenities, giving the towns a new lease of life and offering different employment and business options for locals.If you drive into many towns in WA these days, the benefits of the tourism dollar can be seen. Probably the most well&hyphen;known example of the tourist dollar instigating a new lease of life is the city of Fremantle. Long after the Americas Cup had been sailed back to America—it has now gone to New Zealand and been bashed up and taken back to England to be fixed—Fremantle remains one of the most popular and charming destinations for both tourists and locals alike. With the export development grants scheme offering incentives for the tourism industry, it will be able to build on this and expand even further.Export is the lifeline for Australia to its future. I think there is too much importance placed upon the domestic market in Australia. Australia is only a small country relative to other countries within the region and our domestic market really cannot sustain the amount of spending that we need to keep our standard of living in Australia. We need to expand our export markets, and one way we can do that is by encouraging companies and helping companies move into the Asian markets, and the future really is with export income.We need exports and we must stop politics being played in this export and trade area and really start getting down to the fact that we should be promoting people in Australia to be exporting their goods, whether they are manufactured goods or service goods, in the region. In Western Australia, we are certainly doing that. We are providing a way for the rest of Australia to follow. I am pleased to see that Victoria is also providing such a lead in that area.We have a window of opportunity at the moment with export within the region and I hope that this particular legislation will go some way to helping Australian companies provide a future not only for themselves but for the Australian community in a broader sense by helping to put income into our government coffers. I hope also that Western Australian companies continue their push into Asia. I also make mention that we should not ignore the Indian Ocean rim. There is a lot of affluence and money there to provide for trade and we have the ability to move into this region.I commend this bill to the House. I do not support the amendments. I hope that this bill is the stepping stone for companies, particularly in Western Australia, to take advantage of and to move into the export markets in the Asian region.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[8]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
61,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr SERCOMBE","QK6","(Maribyrnong)","ALP","N/A",2405,"—The member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) made some unkind characterisations of the approach of the former government to industry policy and support for exporters. Whilst rejecting those characterisations, I think the appropriate characterisation of this governments approach to such matters is dumb, destructive and penny&hyphen;wise and pound&hyphen;foolish. The Export Market Development Grants Bill and the debate about this bill give plenty of opportunity to illustrate those points.The bill is part of a package of this governments efforts to exert blows to export performance and to exert blows to manufacturing industry in particular as an important and growing segment of that part of Australias livelihood. We have seen in recent times the attacks on the shipbuilding industry, attacks on printing, attacks on computing and information technology. Yesterdays Australian newspaper, for example, in its `Computers and high technology supplement, led with a story, `Cuts sabotaging our IT export drive. It says:Senior Austrade officials at CeBIT 97—in Germany—have warned that Australias IT export drive could be sabotaged unless the Federal Government allocates more resources to promoting local technology.We have seen the continuing uncertainty over important Australian industries, such as the car industry. The answers by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to questions in the House yesterday can hardly be reassuring to that industry—obviously lending weight to the position of his Treasurer (Mr Costello), who wants to close down Mitsubishi. The governments approach can hardly be encouraging to the textile, clothing and footwear industry. The governments decisions in relation to the engineering industry, with the machine tools and robots bounty, are significant blows to Australian industry and to the most significant growing part of Australian exports, which is manufacturing industry.Cuts to support for exporters have also become very noticeable in this governments term. We have seen $480 million cut out of the DIFF scheme, the development import finance facility, over several years, despite the established multiplier effects of that scheme and the huge benefits that that scheme provides to Australian businesses in gaining access to markets against fierce competition from a range of other countries that provide mixed credit schemes and other soft loan supports for their operators. This government has bounced Australian business out of that and provided a huge disadvantage to Australian business. The international trade enhancement scheme was abolished to save $117 million. Now we have the slashing of the export market development grants scheme.The government, to its limited credit, is quite honest about what its intentions are here. In the explanatory memorandum circulated to the House, the government says, under `Financial impact:Expenditure in respect of the provisions of this bill is limited to a maximum of $150 million per annum including up to 5% of the cap for administration.The government is saying there that really there is only $142&half; million for exporters, which represents an even bigger cut. It continues:The saving created by this bill are estimated to be $99.8 million 1997/98—up to—. . . $145.2 million 1999/2000.As I said before, it is dumb, destructive and penny&hyphen;wise and pound&hyphen;foolish. At a time when the government has made very clear in its mid-year economic and fiscal outlook that a negative contribution to GDP growth is being made by net exports for this year and projected next year against a background of a positive contribution of one per cent in the previous financial year, nothing is more important to this countrys economic prosperity, nothing is more important to creating jobs and nothing is more important ultimately to the budget coming back into some sort of balance than performance in terms of export and making this country increasingly competitive in world markets. As I said: dumb, destructive and penny&hyphen;wise and pound&hyphen;foolish.There is one particular program I ought to also refer to before I move on. I think the member for Griffith (Mr McDougall) was referring earlier in the debate to the situation that if every Australian spent an extra dollar on a local product instead of an imported product that would make a huge contribution. Indeed it would, and that is precisely why the opposition, when in government, supported the Buy Australian campaign. Instead of directing his comments somewhat gratuitously to this House, he ought to be addressing them to the Treasurer and seeking to reinstate that campaign. I certainly call on him in a spirit of bipartisanship to put some effort where his mouth was on that issue in the House today and in fact make a very strong statement of support for the reinstatement of the Buy Australian campaign.Government speakers on this bill have made a great song and dance about the inclusion of tourism in this particular bill and the EMDG scheme. That is certainly something which the opposition supports. But, before they get too carried away with that, it ought to be looked at in the context of other aspects of tourism. The tourism and expo program has suffered a 50 per cent cut. Programs supporting Australian bids for infrastructure projects in Asia and support for Australian suppliers have been abolished. North Queensland tourism operators obviously feel betrayed by the 600 per cent increase in the visitor charge to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The ATC, the Australian Tourist Commission, will have $18&half; million wiped from its budget over the next four years. Before government members crow too much about a welcome but somewhat limited initiative in this scheme for the tourism industry, it ought to be seen in the context of the net loss that this governments activities have represented for that industry.The opposition does not oppose the features in the bill whereby the eligible expenditure threshold is reduced from $30,000 to $20,000, firms with a turnover of more than $50 million per annum will no longer be eligible and there is an upper limit of $25 million in export earnings. However, we rigorously oppose a number of other provisions in the bill. The member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who spoke earlier, received a most impressive letter from a Victorian company that he quoted fairly extensively. I wish to refer to the very well argued position that has been put obviously to a number of members by G.W. Lucas and Sons in Beechworth, Victoria in relation to a number of unsatisfactory aspects of this legislation.Beechworth is in the electorate of the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman). It would be good if he came into the chamber to make some observations in support of his constituents. Beechworth is a community in rural Victoria that has suffered fairly dramatically in recent times from a range of measures taken by Liberal governments at both the state and federal level, and it needs to be defended. For the record, I have some personal association with and interest in that community because my parents live there.The Lucas company, which has been very successful in the terms the member for Curtin described, has said in relation to the provisions of the bill that exclude patent registration from the eligible categories of expenditure under the scheme:Patents provide export market protection (to countries that recognise patents) for 15 to 20 years. Once fees are paid for each individual country, (as there is no such patent as a world wide patent,) they are required to be paid on a costly ongoing yearly basis. Our company therefore, due to lack of financial assistance of the EMDG, will be unable to pursue export sales into as many countries as we would like to. Our patent attorney estimates patents in new markets will cost us in excess of $140,000, this does not include ongoing patent costs. The dangers for our product, is if we attend international trade shows and exhibit our Lucas Mill—this company makes sawmills—and we have sales into a country where we have no patent protection, our product then becomes no longer unique and it can be copied in that market and possibly other unprotected markets. I could understand it if the EMDG did not wish to be seen to be financially contributing to the value of our product, but when patent costs are ongoing and not just one initial payment, it then disadvantages products that are unique to the export market and reduces potential export earnings for Australia.I would have thought that case is pretty overwhelming.Another feature of the legislation which the opposition is opposed to is that airfares will be eligible expenditure for the first two years only. I once again refer to this very well argued submission from a very successful small business in rural Victoria that is actively selling on world markets:The best method for export sales of the Lucas Mill is to attend International trade shows, which allow working demonstrations of our machine and exposure to international travellers. This is a costly, but very effective exercise and assists us to establish Agents world wide. Therefore by only allowing airfares for the first two grant years to be eligible, there is no possible way that we can adequately cover the countries world wide in that time span. In the past we have been disadvantaged because we are a family company and all six members of the company all work full time within the business. Current legislation has only allowed us to claim one family members airfare and visit allowance when family members travelled to exhibit at trade shows since the business had not been operating for five years at the time of the claims.That argument once again demonstrates the importance of allowing businesses to make claims that enable them to ensure exposure at a range of trade events internationally over a longer period than that limited by this governments proposal.The opposition is opposed to another provision in the bill which provides that trusts are no longer eligible corporate entities. We do not necessarily oppose that proposal as such, but we would very much welcome hearing from the government why they do not believe trusts are an appropriate entity. We have an open mind on that, but we certainly are deeply concerned about the retrospective application of that change because it will very significantly disadvantage companies that in good faith have proceeded to make arrangements, make business decisions, in anticipation of EMDG support. Effective from the date according to the announcement of the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer)—I think it is 16 December—they are going to bomb out. Once again, the Lucas letter says:Our family company operates as a family trust and through the trust it allows us to disperse our income. If proposed legislation is accepted, it will mean that we are no longer eligible to claim the EMDG. Our company was one that started with very little financial resource, but due to sound business management which included considerable future planning and a very dedicated family company with a unique product, we have gone from strength to strength, in particular due to assistance from the EMDG. At present our company directly employs 16 people full time as well as 6 family members. Indirectly it gives work to over 250 other Australian companies. At the moment there is a slight decline in local sales, but an increase in export sales, due largely to International Trade Shows that we attend. If our company was no longer eligible for the EMDG, due to our trust structure, it would mean that there would probably be a fall in export sales and our direct staffing levels could fall as low as 6 or 7, not to mention the 250 odd other Australian companies that receive work from us.N/AIt would be extraordinarily helpful to receive from the government some sort of explanation as to why they believe a trust is not an appropriate corporate structure. It would be particularly helpful and fair of the government to enable organisations, corporate entities such as the Lucas entity and others, to have an opportunity to adjust their structure so that they do not find themselves just left out in the cold willy&hyphen;nilly without explanation overnight. That is clearly not a fair or sensible way. The retrospective application of that is most pernicious and ought to be, in all sense of fairness, opposed by both sides of the House.The cuts that are occurring to EMDG do go against commitments that the coalition provided before the last election. They go against personal commitments that the now Minister for Trade gave when he indicated in the election campaign that he would not `fiddle with the EMDG. I think the consequences of that fiddling have been amply indicated in the press, particularly the financial press over the last number of months. The Australian Financial Review on 27 August had the following to say:In its 1994 evaluation of the EMDG, Helping to Meet the Export Challenge , Austrade measured its viability thus: In the 1991&hyphen;92 claim year, using actual industry and year&hyphen;in&hyphen;scheme data, it is estimated that grant payments of $156 million resulted in additional expenditure of $147 million and incremental exports of $1.4 billion, a multiple of nine times the value of grants payments.The same article goes on and talks about the capping of the scheme. A Mr Baxter, a consultant, is quoted as saying:Companies will now be able to claim a maximum of $50,000, regardless of how much they spend. Once the Government has paid the $50,000 then it looks to see how much money is left in its annual pool and then they decide what theyll allocate.Its become like Tatts Lotto.The article goes on:Mr Baxter fears the tightening of the EMDG and its cap on claims would discourage companies on the verge of an exporting break through. The thing about this scheme is that it has given companies the confidence because if they spend the money, theyll get it back. They do get the sales—it does work.The problems will now be for those companies in their critical exporting phase and to what degree they will be discouraged to go past $110,000 of expenditure because of the uncertainty of what they can claim back.As I said earlier, and as I keep repeating, the overall picture that continues to emerge, whatever way you look at the way the government is approaching this, is that the government is frankly being dumb. It is being destructive and it is being penny wise and pound foolish. It is throwing out the baby with the bath water in terms of the importance of this country continuing to grow in its export markets.I would strongly urge the government to reconsider this matter and look at where it has its priorities wrong. Frankly, as I indicated before, for this country to create the right economic environment for growth, for jobs, for ultimately addressing the governments own obsession of its budget deficit, it is not going about that in the appropriate way in the way that it is approaching this particular legislation.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
62,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr JULL","MH4","(Fadden—","LP","Minister for Administrative Services)",2409,"—I am delighted to be able to join in this debate, which of course is outside my portfolio, but there are aspects of the Export Market Development Grants Bill that I would like to refer to and commend the government for its foresight. I think probably the two most significant measures that have been introduced to direct more funds to small and medium enterprises are those with the minimal level threshold, which has been lowered to $20,000 per grant, to benefit more small and medium enterprises. In addition to that, applicants with incomes in the grant year in excess of $50 million will no longer be eligible to receive a grant for that year, which really does free up available funds for those exporters who are most in need of assistance.I have been interested to be sitting in on this debate and learning of the attitude of the opposition to the decision to make tourism part of that particular process. I think at last we are getting a real recognition that the tourist industry is very much part of our export effort. The government has increased the grant rate for all tourism providers to provide the full rate of 50 per cent, allowing free samples of services provided and access to approved joint venturers. I think that is to be commended.I think one of the real difficulties that the previous government had was its failure to recognise the very nature of the tourism industry and what it was all about. The plain facts are that 92 per cent of the operations of the Australian tourism industry are undertaken by small businesses. That is a phenomenal figure when you consider that, I suppose, most people would consider tourism is made up of airlines and large international hotels. The figures show that in fact 92 per cent of the entire operation are small and medium enterprises.It has been a very great problem for those small operators to get into some of those international markets, yet they are the very essence of the whole industry. At least now they have some access to it. When you look around the world and you see what is evolving out of international tourism and the potential for Australia to cash in on some of those markets over the next few years, obviously it is absolutely essential that those small operators do have the capacity to get into some of those markets.If you look at some of the predictions that are happening out of the Asian countries in terms of their tourism efforts into Australia over the next five years, the figures are really quite staggering. I will cite as an example some figures that came out a little while ago from the World Tourism Organisation. They estimated that something like 124 million Asian tourists would be travelling offshore from their homelands for holidays by the turn of the century. That is indeed a phenomenal figure.Quite frankly, if Australia got about one per cent of that business we would have very great difficulties in handling the business. Obviously, it is essential that, if we are going to go into competition with some of our Asian neighbours at the moment in gaining our fair share of that international tourism business, our providers, our operators and basically the small business group have the capacity to get in to sell their goods and services.I think some tremendous potential exists there to develop those Asian markets. But obviously, unless our small operators and big attractions can get in there, we will have very great difficulty competing with countries such as Indonesia, which has a major expansion of its infrastructure and plant under way at the moment, and Thailand and Malaysia, which really have recognised their capacity and ability to go and get those tourism dollars. Of course, I think we also have difficulties at the moment with areas like Japan, whose numbers coming to Australia, while still very strong, have declined slightly in recent years, because we are facing very great competition from places like Hawaii, who are spending that money and making that investment in international promotion.For all those reasons, I am delighted that the government has seen fit to bring in the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997 and give that very specific recognition to the tourist industry and to the small and medium operators within it which, after all, are the backbone and the bulk of that industry.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
63,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr HAWKER","8H4","(Wannon)","LP","N/A",2410,"—I am very pleased to be able to join in this debate on the Export Market Development Grants (Repeal and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997 and the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997 and to follow the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull), who has just given one his very erudite exposes on the value of the tourism industry for Australia and the export dollars that it earns. I think everyone in this chamber would know that not only does he have an abiding and passionate interest in tourism but also he would easily be the most knowledgeable person in the chamber when it comes to talking about tourism. When this minister gives his endorsement to something, I am sure all honourable members would know that it is something very important and worth while.I would suggest that this legislation with its endorsement by the minister shows that the government does have a very real and ongoing commitment—not only through the export market development grants scheme in association with this legislation but in expanding that scheme to include the tourism industry—and that we recognise this is a very important, very big but also, more importantly, very rapidly growing area that Australia has benefited from, particularly because of our geographical location and the fact that we are now starting to market ourselves in a way that gives us access to such a huge source in the region. I think the growth in the number of visitors from overseas in recent years coming to this country, particularly from some of the Asian countries, is nothing short of phenomenal.I think, with the changes we have put in this legislation, we are recognising that the majority of small operators are the ones who can benefit from this. We are giving them that opportunity to expand their markets and at the same time, of course, earn those badly needed export dollars.As I have said, this legislation does very much recognise the importance of small business, and I think that is something that this government, particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), has shown that we are very much committed to. With this change, I think we do expand that commitment and show that we are continuing to make sure we give small business the encouragement it desperately needs not only to continue but also to expand and, most importantly of course, to employ more people. We recognise that the opportunities for reducing unemployment will be coming very much from the small business sector.Another important point to note about this legislation is that it will lower the threshold that business must spend to receive the grants from $30,000 to $20,000. I believe that that is something that recognises some of the challenges small businesses face when they try to seek out new markets overseas and the fact that for many of them it is not easy. By giving this incentive, we believe that it will encourage more to have a go. As we are well aware, not only have we inherited some budgetary problems from the previous government but also Australia as a nation does have a trading imbalance that we desperately need to reverse, and this is part of helping to attack that problem.It is also important to note that, for the tourism operators, the rate payable for expenditure will rise from 25c in the dollar to 50c in the dollar. This will provide a service to all sectors of the tourism industry, not just the single service providers. So, again, I think it is very important to note that this legislation is recognising the industry as whole.A further important point to note about the legislation is that it will reduce some of the complexities. In fact, it has halved the length of the legislation, making it somewhat easier to appreciate. As people would be aware, under the export market development grants, claims can still be a maximum of $200,000 by any one business. There is a qualification on that which recognises that there is an upper limit to the amount of money that the budget will allocate in any one year for the whole scheme.But it is important to note also that 70 per cent of the claims are for under $50,000, and of course they will all get the full grant. So it really is, I think, a very more part of the governments involvement in developing exports in this nation.It is important also to note that this legislation repeals the 1974 export market development grants scheme, and it deals with all the matters that arise from that repeal. It also has a number of other major effects, but I think I would just like to concentrate on the importance it will have for a number of tourism operators in western Victoria and, in particular, in my electorate of Wannon. I think this does provide some tremendous opportunities to encourage the local tourist operators. Not only have they worked very hard to be part of the intrastate development of tourism in Victoria but also they have worked very hard at the interstate and, indeed, international level.I well recall some years ago, when leaving with a delegation to go to Japan, speaking to the then Warrnambool City Council and asked whether they had any promotional material they would like me to take. I must admit that I had mixed feelings when I felt the weight of what I had been given. But I was very impressed to see that amongst some of that material, which included videos, was one in Japanese. I think that shows the sort of level of understanding and commitment some of the local tourism operators have when it comes to attracting overseas tourists into western Victoria.It is also important to note that three&hyphen;quarters of Victorias 15 million overnight visitors spent time in regional or rural areas, so obviously the opportunities are there for regional operators, and particularly local operators in western Victoria, to capitalise on this. A tourism survey in Victoria last year found that the Great Ocean Road, which is one of the great icons not only of Victoria but of Australia, was the most popular area in regional Victoria. It attracted 2.1 million overnight stays and 2.8 million day trips. This is in very large part due to the work of Shipwreck Coast Tourism, which has worked very hard with local operators along the Great Ocean Road all the way to Port Fairy to promote the area and to ensure that we do attract as many tourists as we can into the region.These operations are not just for the region; they have also been promoting them in other parts of Australia. In fact, they have been promoting them overseas, as I mentioned, not only through the local member but in a number of initiatives of their own. I think it is to the credit of Shipwreck Coast Tourism that they have been named the No. 1 regional association in Victoria in 1993, in 1994 and again in 1995. It is something that I am very proud of and I think the people of western Victoria are also very proud of. Of course, the only reason they did not get there in 1996 was that, having had three consecutive wins, they did not feel it was right to enter the fourth year.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[11]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

65,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr HAWKER","8H4","(Wannon)","LP","N/A",2410,"—The record has been established, hasnt it? It will take a while for someone to match that.I would like to talk about a couple of other areas in my region as well that I think this bill is going to help promote, particularly through the local tourism operators. If we look at the Grampians region in western Victoria, again a very large tourism destination, in 1995 over 500,000 people visited the Grampians region. The stay here tended to be longer, an average of 3.6 nights. Again, this is largely due to the work of some of the local bodies and in particular the shires of the Southern Grampians and the Northern Grampians, which have worked very hard to attract visitors and to ensure that there is ongoing patronage of the region. I believe they are working very well. Of these 500,000 people, 75 per cent came from Victoria, 24 per cent came from interstate and only one per cent came from overseas, so I think we do have some big opportunities here to expand that. I believe that people from overseas, when they get an opportunity to see the region, cannot fail to be impressed by some of the great scenery and the many other attractions that the region has got.What this bill also does is to address the concern of the tourist operators in the region where they have felt that in the past export market development grants have been too hard to access. Many, I know, are keen to take advantage of it, not only those who operate motels and so on but even the coach operators, who feel there are probably going to be some opportunities to take advantage of this.As I said earlier, this bill is half the size of the previous one. That shows that not only is this government committed to reducing paperwork for small business but we are actually committed to making understanding of the legislation a lot easier too. When we look at the bill, the number of categories under which people can qualify for support has been reduced from 11 to six. These are overseas representation, overseas marketing visits, communications, free samples, trade fairs and advertising and short&hyphen;term consultancy. So I think this does focus export market development grants very much into the areas we can get maximum benefit from, and I congratulate the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) for the work he has done here. It certainly shows that he is very much in touch with what is needed and understands the way we can get the maximum benefits from this government expenditure.It is interesting to note some of the things that have been removed from the old scheme. They include patents, labelling, unmatched eligible expenditure, foreign language training, educational courses, tenders and quotations, free technical information, overseas visitors to Australia, subscriptions to industry associations, prescribed services in the construction industry, half&hyphen;yearly claims and trusts. It is an interesting long list which tried to include everyone. Bringing it down to six I think helps a lot in focusing the scheme very much towards the people who will get the maximum benefit.As I said, it will be much easier for smaller operators to access grants with the threshold being cut from $30,000 to $20,000, which means, of course, that people will qualify more easily and not have to outlay as much to get access. Applicants with incomes greater than $50 million a year will not be able to access it, which I think is fair enough. That recognises that we have to target the support to those who most need it and will most benefit.In conclusion, it is important for me just to reiterate that I believe that these changes to the export market development scheme are positive and that they focus the scheme very much towards the small business end of export development. I think all of us have had experiences where we have seen that small businesses have really worked very hard to get export opportunities and have never found it easy. It is much harder in many cases than trying to expand locally, yet we all recognise the importance of making sure that our businesses do expand.The important addition here is to include the tourism operators and in particular the small tourism operators. That shows that this government does have a very real commitment to assisting in this area. I believe that the region I come from is one of the really great parts of Australia and I know that many tourism operators are already keen to take advantage of these opportunities to develop what is already a very successful series of tourism operations in western Victoria. They are keen to expand tourism so that we not only have more opportunities for jobs in the region but we also get our fair share of the overseas dollars that are coming in and therefore can make our contribution to the national interest. This will give the region the opportunity to be very proud of the achievements it has had up to date and will be building on. I support the bill.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[11]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
66,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr PRICE","QI4","(Chifley)","ALP","N/A",2412,"—I am pleased to speak in the debate on the export market development grants bills. I thought it important to remind the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) what the coalition said to the Australian people about this policy at the time of the last election. The coalition made a firm commitment to maintain the scheme, to expand the scheme, to improve the scheme.I found very amusing the contributions of the members for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and Wannon, congratulating the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer). Effectively, they are congratulating him on breaking either a non-core promise or a core promise, because this scheme is being gutted. It is being slashed and hacked at, but government members are standing up in this chamber wanting to congratulate the minister for the coalitions breaching its own election document, breaching its word to the Australian people. I am staggered under those circumstances. If the shoe were on the other foot, I would be a little embarrassed about it. I would not want to take pride in the fact that my government has broken serious commitments given to the Australian people at the time of the last election.Talking of promises, I think it is interesting to put this in context because the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) has reminded the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of his statements to the Australian people that they should look at unemployment—12 months after he came to office—given his promises during the election to fix the unemployment problem and, particularly for an electorate like mine, fix youth unemployment.Looking at the situation 12 months later, unemployment has not improved. It has not stabilised; it has got worse. Youth unemployment particularly has gotten worse. I think that is a shame. The Prime Minister says, `What we need in this economy is more growth. I think we all agree with that. In fact, we are one party that has always said, in government and in opposition, that growth is our target, our mission.But here you have a scheme designed to assist Australian industries, Australian small companies, get into exports and what are you doing? Are you assisting growth? The member for Wannon said, `Well, were making access much easier by reducing the minimum amount from $30,000 to $20,000. I support him in the proposition that this is a good move. But what he fails to say is that there is a cap of $150 million on the scheme. Had the scheme not changed and continued to be funded, by 1998-99 we would have seen $292 million being spent on this scheme.The member for Wannon said that a majority of claims were $50,000. If we were to get another $150 million in this scheme assisting small business claiming $50,000, we would be helping 30,000 small businesses in this country. Here are government members boasting that they are denying 30,000 small businesses the opportunity to get into the export market, help growth, help the economy, create jobs and get unemployment down.That is what we could be doing, but we are not. This government is doing the reverse. It is saying, `We are not going to help 30,000 Australian small businesses, we wont get the growth that we would get if they got into the export business, we are not going to have the jobs and therefore we are going to have unemployment increasing. Shame on them! What hypocrisy! How can they get up in this House and say how proud they are?It is even worse if you look at the impact over four years. It is half a billion dollars. One hundred thousand small businesses over four years will not be able to take advantage of this scheme, and the government are proud of it! They get up and say how proud they are! I find it absolutely amazing that government members can get up and say how proud they are that we are denying 100,000 small businesses over four years the opportunity to get into exports, to expand into exports, for companies to grow, to put on extra staff, to see the economy bubbling along and make an impact on the unemployed.The reality is that those opposite do not give a damn about the unemployed. They do not give a damn about Australian jobs. I think that is the truth of it, because they would not embrace the cutting back of this scheme with such fervour if they did. I cannot understand how small business organisations can believe the rhetoric of government members that these are measures designed to help them when in one year 30,000 will be denied and over four years 100,000 will be denied.The member for Cowan said that the trouble with the opposition speakers is that we do not learn, that we want to hang on to the old scheme. I have indicated at least one change that I approve of. But if we could actually have that extra funding continuing, in the way we had made a commitment to the scheme, and if those extra small businesses were able to take advantage of it, then yes, I really would want to stick with the old scheme.Fundamentally, on this side of politics we believe that creating Australian jobs is probably the most important thing that any government can do. A failure to create jobs horrifically affects Australian society. To deny the opportunity when opportunity presents itself is the worst aspect of any government, and this government is showing it.The point I wanted to make about the scheme and the comments of the member for Cowan is that over the past 10 years it has been estimated that over 500,000 jobs were created as a result of this scheme. That is a phenomenal number of jobs. You would hope that over the next 10 years you would see that increase, but we are not going to see it.Given the amount of information around, I think it would be most interesting if subsequent government speakers, or even a minister in summing up, might tell us what is the estimated impact of cutting back the scheme. The member for Cowan was very proud of the savings and the fact that it is being slashed and hacked and you will get all the money over four years. That is fair enough; that is on the public record. But could the minister give the House and the Australian people an idea of how many Australian jobs will be lost as a result of this cutback? What will it cost in the first 12 months of operation? What will it cost over four years? What is the value of the exports that we will not achieve because of this cutback?I think the opposition is entitled to have that information. Certainly the minister has the benefit of a whole department to rely upon to assist him to make these calculations. If they are in an ungenerous mood, if they do not have the spirit or feeling for the proper processes of this chamber, I think the Australian people are entitled to that information. I will be looking forward to that summing up and our being given those figures.If you wanted to characterise the coalition—the conservatives—when they have been in government, they have had an absolute total reliance on primary production, whether in the sphere of either agriculture or mineral production. I never deprecate those who are involved in primary production. Under Labor we have understood how dramatically important it is to get some value adding out of that. There were historical opportunities that we or the conservatives never took up, but there are still current opportunities.I note that in the governments trade outcomes and objectives statement, they are making it very clear that they are going to continue to look at value adding in primary production and look to value adding in the minerals area. I welcome that. I do not want to knock that. All I am trying to say is that primary production exports have been falling as a percentage of our total exports. They have gone from something like 53 per cent of exports to 38 per cent.The real dramatic increases have come from manufacturing in elaborately transformed manufactures. They have grown by 17 per cent, whereas the primary production exports have only increased by five per cent. I am not saying that that is of no value—I think it is critically important that we look at value adding in terms of primary production—but we must continue to see that growth in manufactured exports and service exports.This bill that is being debated in this House today is not going to do its job. It is going to make sure—I have given the figures—that 30,000 Australian small business companies are not going to be eligible. If they want to get into the export market, they will not be able to because the government has put a cap on this scheme. It is not that they cannot successfully export or develop their business, but the government has put a cap on this scheme and they will not be eligible. They will not be able to do it. Over four years, 100,000 small and medium sized businesses will not be able to do it because the coalition has come in and put a cap on it.You often hear the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in question time saying, `Im going to cut business welfare, as though these schemes are something slothful, something to be ashamed of and something that not only does not assist small business but heads them in the wrong direction. Of course, that is wrong. It is a very neat Treasury view of the world, and consistent, I note from time to time, notwithstanding the government of the day, but it is a very wrong view. It has never been the case that Australia, whether it is in export facilitation programs or assistance programs, DIFF funding or EFIC, has had a superior or stronger system of encouraging exports over and above countries like the United States, Japan or Germany.We have always made our businesses compete on an unlevel playing field. We do not equip them with the same assistance and the same support as other countries. It is less. Yet this government is saying, `Were not going to do it. Were putting a cap on it. Were not going to get growth by getting small and medium businesses into the export market. I think that is a great shame.I do want to say that, when we are in opposition it does give us an opportunity to re&hyphen;evaluate our approaches. In government there were lots of things we did in industry policy from which I think we can all take a great deal of satisfaction. It is the case that we need to do more. It is the case that we have an opportunity to reassess our policies and refashion them for the next century to make sure that we can give small and medium sized businesses a fair go. It is an opportunity for us to demonstrate quite clearly that we are concerned about the creation and preservation of Australian jobs, that we are not intimidated by the challenge of exporting and that we want to get more Australian companies, small and medium sized, into the exporting business.When you look at the range of instruments that are available to a government to assist small and medium sized companies, come the next election there will be a real difference between the opposition and the government. The biggest difference will be this: that we are interested in Australian jobs, we are interested in exports to create more Australian jobs and we are interested in job security.We will make a dash for growth. We will not be ashamed to aim for a much higher level of growth than this government wants. We will not be ashamed to say that we are genuinely committed to bringing down unem ployment. We will not on the one hand be saying, `We want unemployment to decrease and we want more growth, but on the other hand denying small business, denying medium&hyphen;sized business and denying Australian workers the opportunity to get into exports.One other point I wanted to make was that government members are suggesting that reducing the number of categories under which businesses can apply for these grants from 11 under our scheme to six under their scheme has been a great improvement. It is simpler if you only have to go for six, but I do not believe they have made the case that the remaining five are not legitimate categories for which businesses should apply for export assistance.Last but not least, there have been a number of reviews of this EMDG scheme. The principal point about it is that it is working. Because the scheme is working, the new coalition government is prepared to break its promise to maintain the scheme. It went to the Australian people and said, `We are going to maintain the scheme, but when it got into government it put a cap on the scheme. It capped the scheme at $150 million and pocketed almost $150 million in the first year. Over four years it is pocketing $500 million and it is handicapping small and medium sized businesses when they want to export.You are costing Australians jobs. You are adding to unemployment and in particular you are adding to the despair of youth unemployment. It is really hypocritical that you can have the Prime Minister open a youth suicide conference, then in economic policy you promise on the one hand that you will solve unemployment and you say on the other hand that you want more growth while at the same time you abandon schemes like DIFF and you emasculate a scheme like this.I think it is poor policy. I think it is hypocrisy. My only area of doubt—something I could not quite work out—is whether this is a core promise being broken or a non-core promise being broken.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[12]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
67,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr WILTON","YK6","(Isaacs)","ALP","N/A",2415,"—I rise and congratulate the member for Chifley (Mr Price) on a fine contribution to this debate on the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997. There is no doubt that, when he speaks, people listen. Equally, I am pleased to speak in support of the amendments to this bill as moved by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), as this serves as a stark reminder of the many popular and highly successful programs that the previous Labor government introduced to support Australias small and medium sized business sector. It also serves as yet another example of the Howard governments duplicitous and misguided treatment of our small business sector.The export market development grants scheme was introduced back in 1974 by the then Whitlam Labor government to encourage both small and medium sized businesses to seek out export market opportunities for Australian goods and services. Some 70,000 such export market grants were awarded under the scheme between its inception in 1974 and 1991 with the average value of these grants being some $65,000. In the last financial year alone, some 3,400 grants were awarded worth a total of $211 million. This scheme under Labor was expected to grow to some $292 million by the 1998-99 financial year.It is important that we note that both small and medium sized businesses are the major beneficiaries of this scheme, making up approximately 70 per cent of grant recipients. The Keating Labor government had announced in 1994 the extension of the EMDG scheme for a further five years as part of its Working Nation initiatives, which would have resulted in an expected 5,000 exporters receiving grants and assistance under the scheme each year.I should take this opportunity to indicate that both small and medium sized businesses in my electorate of Isaacs have received $700,000 in funding through this EMDG scheme over the last two financial years. This has quite clearly assisted these local firms with their export efforts and has aided in the creation of badly needed jobs for the unemployed in the Isaacs electorate.In turning to the detail of this bill currently before this House, I would like to begin by highlighting that the new scheme, as expounded in this legislation, excludes trusts as an eligible corporate entity. This measure was not announced until 16 December last year, when the exposure draft of the bill was released. As the legislation will be effective right through the 1996-97 financial year, a number of the trusts already in the scheme have spent funds between 1 July last year and 19 December last year on exporting eligible matters, completely oblivious and unaware of the fact that they would be excluded from the scheme in this way.On 12 February this year the Australian reported the case of a particular Queensland company called Mediherb. Mediherb is an exporter of medicinal products, whose grant for the 1996-97 financial year will be withdrawn, as they have been caught out by the retrospective nature of this legislation. The director of the firm, Mr Michael Hoy, said the decision would disrupt the export program his company entered into three years ago. He said, `Three years into an eight year EMDG arrangement, this company has had the carpet pulled from under it.Given this governments absolutely cavalier approach to policy formulation and its complete disregard for the valid concerns raised by exporters, is it any wonder that the Yellow Pages Small Business Index released in February of this year showed that 79 per cent of small business respondents—when asked this question: in what way, if any, has the election of this new government helped your business, and what has the government done for you?—said that this government had not helped them in any way or had done anything for them.The retrospectivity of this legislation is not the only element that has irked the business community and forced it to turn its back on this government. The government had this small business sector believing that they would be particularly looked after, that the door of the relevant ministers office would always be open and that their voice and concerns would always be heard.What the government has done in effect in handling this legislation is an exact case in point of how the small business sector has been both misled and sadly mistaken. You would have expected the Howard government to have initiated widespread and thorough consultation amongst our various exporting sectors, with a view to taking on board any valid concerns that they had raised as part of the formulation of the final draft of this very important legislation.In his second reading speech, the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) said:In the interests of broad consultation with industry and getting the bill right, an exposure draft to the bill was widely circulated late last year for public comment. Over 160 submissions were received. . . . Many of the issues raised in those submissions have been included in the bill that is before the House today.Really, Minister? This seems sharply at odds with what industry has had to say. Again, I will quote from a letter to the Minister for Trade from the Australian Information Industry Association, which says:As outlined in our submission to Austrade, the AIIA is very concerned about a number of changes proposed in the draft bill. For this reason, we prepared a quite detailed submission outlining those areas of the bill that were of most concern to our members.We are very disappointed that it seems none of AIIAs comments have been taken into account in drafting the final EMDG legislation. Apart from some minor drafting amendments, the final bill is almost unchanged from the exposure draft.So the Australian Information Industry Association were not the only ones who copped a cold shoulder and a whack behind the ear, to use a further anatomical analogy, from this government.The Australian Business Chamber raised a particularly instructive example of a family firm in my state of Victoria, that is, G.W. Lucas and Sons. In the course of the last two years, that firm has increased its export of circular saws and mechanical lifting devices from $85,000 to $1 million per annum and was also on the receiving end of this governments myopic approach. Its reward and encouragement from this government is that it will no longer be eligible to receive an export market development grant under the new legislation. Other groups, including the Australian Institute of Export and the New South Wales State Chamber of Commerce have also raised legitimate concerns at the serious disadvantages the governments EMDG arrangements contain for small exporters.Clearly, this government has developed what might best be described as a three-point approach to consultation. The first point is that it calls for submissions; the second point is that it receives them and expresses its gratitude; and the third point is that it totally ignores them. What an absolute insult to our business community, which had prospered so effectively under the previous governments EMDG arrangements.As many of my colleagues have spoken at some length in this place about the other specific points of this legislation and our subsequent amendments, I will not take up the time of the House by going through those in any detail. However, I would like to indicate briefly to the House that—and you would be well aware of this, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick—our main point of contention regarding the Howard governments new EMDG scheme is not so much the specific workings of the program but rather that we on this side of the House join with both industry and financial commentators in expressing our fears about the long&hyphen;term consequences for our exporting businesses in the face of the governments funding cutbacks to export assistance measures such as the EMDG and DIFF schemes.Much of the debate on the worth and level of funding for the EMDG program occurred last year in the lead-up to the Howard governments first budget. It is perhaps instructive to reflect on some of the comments made at that time, given that the government, through this legislation, has fulfilled the worst fears of industry by reducing funding of this program to less than $150 million per annum.A submission from the MTIA—known mostly as being supporters of this government—presented to the Senate committee considering a previous EMDG bill last year said that there was a great necessity for government and government programs alike, such as the EMDG scheme, to pursue these schemes as a matter of course and that the implications for cutbacks in funding were too heinous, too duplicitous and, in fact, too severe—those were its words—to countenance. The MTIA said in its submission to that Senate committee:Any reduction in funding for export assistance schemes would be short-sighted in the extreme, particularly given the level of Australias current account deficit, and would have the inevitable result of reducing the export promotion activities which industry is able to undertake.It went on to say:It is imperative that Australia increase both the number of exporters and the level of exports by existing exporters. While Australian industry has achieved substantial increases in exports in recent years, this growth has been from a low base. It is essential to Australias economic future that growth in exports, particularly of high value added exports, is accelerated.The MTIA continued:Government assistance programs and in particular the EMDG scheme are vital to this process. Funds allocated to these programs should be seen as appropriate investment in our economic future and not as non-essential expenditure to be cut simply when budget conditions are tight.As the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe) quite rightly put to this House not half an hour ago: penny&hyphen;wise but pound&hyphen;foolish. The MTIA concluded:It has taken Australia many long painful years to build up an export culture and improve our competitiveness on world markets. These achievements are all now at risk given the governments short-sighted decision to abolish the DIFF scheme, to increase costs through recent changes to the tariff concession arrangements simultaneously with the final tariff phase down and all combined with a substantial strengthening of the Australian dollar.To now contemplate adding to these major imposts on ability to export by curtailing the EMDG scheme is folly in the extreme and will unquestionably result in fewer exports and heightened import penetration with a consequent adverse impact on the Australian economy.Such were some of the sentiments in the submission provided by the MTIA to that particular Senate committee of inquiry. Having in my first year as a member in this place already spoken on so many bills where the government was breaking one of its pre-election promises, I am not greatly surprised to find yet another situation where the government is trying to worm and weasel its way out of one of its election promises so much cherished by the small business sector.The coalitions often repeated position on the EMDG scheme during the last election campaign was that not only would they maintain the scheme but also that they would look to expand it and improve it as well. This was made perfectly clear in the coalitions trade policy document entitled Meeting the Challenge, which stated that the coalition:. . . will look at ways of providing more access to export assistance schemes, including EMDG . . . and will examine how access to assistance packages can be improved.I must add that the public comment of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) that `EMDG stays will linger in the mind of the business community, I am sure, for many years. That was a position that was made perfectly clear by the coalition in its election campaign. Yet, in clear breach of these promises, this bill institutes a massive funding cut to the EMDG program.It has been reduced to some $150 million per year, not so much in the context of paperwork—as put to this place a moment ago by the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) in suggesting that halving the width of the bill means increasing its simplicity—but in halving in stated terms the money available for exporters in Australia to access these schemes for the benefit of their own bottom line and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole. As I say, one can argue that the funding has effectively been halved.To add insult to this already severe injury, the government has also taken yet another $7.5 million out of the yearly funding to cover the schemes administration costs, leaving only $142.5 million available for exporters. Condemnation of the Howard governments treatment of small business has been widespread, coming from all sides of the political and philosophical spectrum. Alex Kennedy wrote in the BRW of 10 June last year:The governments lack of support for the scheme since its election in March has confounded state governments and business groups because it is almost unanimously considered one of the most successful of any export-support programs.He went on at some length in that same vein. Furthermore, aside from Treasury officials having a well known and long held dislike of schemes such as the EMDG program, which do not fit into their dry, economic rationalist view of `leaving the market to its own devices, and hang the consequences, there has been another agenda successfully at work behind the changes to this worthwhile scheme. Michael Dwyer, writing in the Financial Review on 23 May last year, reported:Internecine warfare has broken out in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as its three core agencies battle it out to protect their key programs from savage budget cuts.Relations between the offices of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and the Minister for Foreign Affairs started poorly and have deteriorated. It appears that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been trying to quarantine itself from substantial budget cuts, and has instead been offering up for sacrifice programs run by AusAID and Austrade.Mr Dwyer continued:It is understood Mr Fischer has written to the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, requesting that all expenditure review committee meetings dealing with the DFAT budget are held at times when both portfolio ministers can be present.When debating amendments to the EMDG program last year in the lead-up to the budget, when speculation on funding cuts was at its height, I spoke of the Deputy Prime Minister as having been provided with an ideal opportunity to restore some meaning to the National Party, in a policy sense, by saving the funding allocation for the EMDG scheme. I said that if the Deputy Prime Minister were able to achieve this, in one fell swoop he would re-establish the philosophical differences between the National Party and the Liberal Party.Unfortunately for Australia, for our exporters, for the National Party and for himself, this bill provides clear evidence of the Minister for Trades failure to achieve this. However, I do commend the amendments to the House.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
68,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr LAURIE FERGUSON","8T4","(Reid)","ALP","N/A",2419,"—One of the interesting rejoinders from the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) during this debate was when he said that he had flown in from Dubai to hear the opposition spokesman. It is very telling. Quite frankly, I do not think it is only the National Partys Western Australian leader, Hendy Cowan, but the opposition and the Australian people who are increasingly questioning whether we are really getting value for money out of the globetrotting of the Deputy Prime Minister. I note that on 27 January—obviously this is out of date, because he has told us about another trip that he has just had—he had clocked up 275,000 frequent flyer points, 79 days overseas and 13 trips in that period.It is interesting that he has just flown in for this debate. If you look at some of his visits and some of the trips that he has made it seems like a collection of good shopping centres—Hong Kong, for example. He has been over to Brunei and through South America, et cetera. As I said, I really question whether he might better spend his time in reviewing this legislation and having a real input into it. It is alright for him to say, speaking about some internecine war within the government, that all meetings should occur when he is present. As indicated, the government is having increasing difficulty in actually scheduling those meetings because of this plethora of trips he is making.This legislation, I think, shows where the real emphasis should be from this minister. Before I move on, I should note that he is probably one of the leaders in defying the April admonition from the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) that these frequent flyer points should be utilised for the purposes of reducing the governments bill for travel. As would be noted in a variety of articles, he has defied that and basically said that the Minister for Administrative Services can go jump. There is a real question as to where his emphasis has been.We know, as many other speakers have indicated, that this legislation is a clear repudiation of earlier commitments by the government and, in the usual style that typifies him, he was very up-front in saying at the National Press Club, that `EMDG stays. That is the contribution and we see here today that it is out the door in a very real sense. That statement was not the sole statement of the government with regard to this measure. We know that in the lead document of their campaign for government, page 3 indicated that they would retain the scheme and page 30 indicated that they would maintain the EMDGS.For all the qualifications at the edges, for all the rhetoric about the fact that there are going to be fewer pages in this legislation, that it is going to be simpler to read, that it is a matter of really getting rid of technicalities and making it easy for small business, the reality is that this legislation fundamentally undermines export potential in this country. It undermines the possibility of small operators actually getting into the field and it undermines job availability in this country. Essentially, it is an anti-job measure by the government.Quite frankly, it is very interesting to note this rhetoric about the availability of these grants for small business and how they are being facilitated by these changes. If the minister were here long enough, if he cared enough about this legislation, he would actually be aware that Austrade has indicated that 70 per cent of previous recipients are in fact small to medium exporters with fewer than 25 employees. If the justification for this legislation is to make it more available, to make it easier for small and medium enterprise, and if that is the total, intelligent basis of this legislation—and that seems to have been the argument of those opposite—then one has to question whether that legislation has a fundamental justification.As I have indicated, of those who have previously been recipients—between 1974 and 1991, for instance—there were nearly 70,000 grants, for an average of $65,000. We are saying that there is no justification if that is all that the government can put forward here today. It is already applicable, it is already available and it is already utilised by small and medium enterprise in this country.As many other speakers have indicated, this is not a lone assault by this government with regards to the export potential and the export efforts of Australia. We have seen a series of efforts that basically discount the need for these kinds of measures, saying, `Look, our minister will surrender ground. Our minister has got no say in the process.We have heard his complaints. They have been recited by the previous speaker. His complaints are that he has been basically marginalised, left out and ignored. That is, unfortunately, not very nice for him. But it is worse for this country, it is worse for the people whose jobs depend upon it and it is worse for our foreign debt.As indicated, there has been a series of similar surrenders by ministers in this government. The international trade enhancement scheme has been successful in promoting export consciousness among small to medium sized firms—once again, small to medium sized firms—and the export to funding ratio achieved to 1994&hyphen;95 was 15:1. That came under the hammer. The export access scheme providing services to about 400 new or inexperienced exporters through the chambers of commerce and industry associations, yet the budget reduced funding for that by over 20 per cent. There is the Asia&hyphen;Pacific fellowship scheme which enables managers and graduate employers of Australian organisations to work and study in Asian markets. Those fellowships are for six to 12 months and once again are under very strong assault.These schemes under assault are to a large extent directed at small to medium business and they have gone on the scrap heap. They have been thrown out. Basically, they have been condemned to oblivion and yet the rhetoric here today is, `Oh, were not really abandoning the scheme. Were not really undermining it. Were trying to help these small operators. They cant get into the market at the moment. They cant get help. But what we have seen is that they have simultaneously scrapped schemes that are fundamentally directed to that area. Of course, late last year we had the legendary shemozzle over the DIFF and the performance of the foreign minister when he tried to say that Asia was not concerned. We have had a series of attacks on the potential of this country and again in recent days an attack on the bounties.It is not as though there has been a chorus of support from industry or from industry associations out there for these measures. We all know that traditionally that is part of the fundamental constituency of those opposite. There has been a series of representatives of industry organisations, umbrella organisations, individuals, companies and many small operators who have said that this is going in the wrong direction. Amongst those who have written to the minister and opposition members and appeared before the Senate Foreign Affairs and Trade legislation committee have been the Australian Information Industries Association, the Australian Institute of Export, the New South Wales and WA branches, the Australian Business Chamber, the Furnishing Industry Association of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Publishers Association and various exporting companies. They have all said that they really do not think this is a bright idea. They have said that this entails a bit more than a few changes of words and fewer commas and full stops.We note Ms Sue Donovans comments from the Australian Book Publishers Association. She states:The Association is extremely concerned about the threat to the future of the scheme, especially in view of the Governments election commitment to maintain it. This commitment was contained in the presentation of . . . the Honourable Tim Fischer. . .She went on to state:These pronouncements reinforced the clear and unequivocal commitments to continue the scheme, without fiddling amendments, until 1999.She noted that she obtained part of that information in a meeting with Mr Fischer. The Australian Information Industry Association has also been extremely critical:We are very disappointed that it seems than none of AIIAs comments have been taken into account in drafting the final EMDG legislation.They noted a variety of problems such as the limit of $150 million and the reduced categories of eligible expenditure. They particularly expressed concern over travel expenditure, which is something that does not concern this minister, of course. They also spoke of a lack of clarity about some of the key assessment criteria. They summarised by noting that:. . . this Association has serious reservations about some of the changes included in the revised Bill, which will erode the benefits available under this Scheme and may also severely reduce the ability of many small exporters to compete in international markets.The State Chamber of Commerce of New South Wales noted:. . . we would like to draw your attention to some of our concerns about the Exposure Draft of the Export Market Development Grant Bill 1997 . . .They went on to state:This affects important service industries such as architects, engineers and project managers that will now be totally excluded from the EMDG or will have their entitlements reduced to negligible amounts. This arises because tender and quotation preparation costs are no longer eligible, and this change, together with the removal of airfares, excludes the two key activities undertaken by these service industries.They went on to speak of the $150 million cap on the scheme and noted:. . . we are concerned that the cutback in funding will limit the number of claimants substantially, and therefore, exclude many small companies which already find it difficult to obtain the EMDG . . . Therefore there is every reason for the Government to retain airfares, and some other minor key market development expenses such as exporter education and training, to ensure there is no shortfall.In summary, once again this is an indictment of the measure and an attack upon it. It is a view that it is a bit more than fiddling at the edges and that it is fundamentally undermining Australian companies and employment and fundamentally condemning the young people of Australia to mindless rhetoric about forced work for the dole because this government has failed to move youth unemployment from the 30 per cent level it was at when it came to government. Essentially this measure will worsen that picture.The Australian Business Chamber also came into the debate on 27 February. They have argued, amongst other things:. . . that reducing the EMDG cap to $150 million, a cut of more than 25%, cannot be rationalised, given the potential for future growth in exports of manufactured goods, especially elaborately transformed manufactures. The Chamber says while manufactured exports have increased strongly in recent years, only 13% of manufacturers are exporting in a substantial way.They are saying that, rather than bring in these caps and limit the classes of work that it will be available for, perhaps the government should look at making it more available to manufacturing industry and increase the number of exporters in that field. We all know that a variety of finance writers are questioning whether the manufacturing sector in this country can essentially take up the slack and are bemoaning the lack of investment and the problems it faces.Here we have an assault on a very necessary piece of legislation. This scheme has been in operation since the Whitlam government and it is worth noting some of the aspects that the government is now saying will no longer be financed. I noticed that an Austrade publication listed some of the items of expenditure that will not be financed, such as gifts, unsupported or estimated expenditure, promotion of X&hyphen;rated films, and entertainment expenses. No&hyphen;one would assert that those items should be covered by it, but what they failed to stress strongly enough was that other items under assault which companies will no longer be able to get finance for or recoup finance for are patents, labelling, unmatched eligible expenditure, foreign language training, educational courses, and tenders and quotations. This gives a greater perspective on what is happening. Export packing and labelling, free technical information, air fares after two years, tender and quotation costs, patent registration and overseas buyer visits—all these things which companies assert are all necessary, worth while and helpful will no longer be covered.This is not just tinkering. It is a very basic, contrived and well understood attempt to reduce expenditure in this field and make it less worth while to this country simply because of the bottom line in the budget. That is what is dictating this; not any kind of analysis of what we need or how worth while it is. When we talk about how worth while the scheme is, we also know that there have been a variety of reviews of it which have said over a period of time that it is of value to this country, it is doing something worth while and it should not be scuttled in any way as this legislation intends.The key findings of Helping to meet the export challenge —a report noted by many members and by a number of government members in past debates when they were in opposition—concluded that it was worth while. The review noted the wide availability of the scheme within different sectors of the economy, such as the service field and manufactures. It noted the multiplier effect and there are various estimates. None of them are negative. None of them have been regarded as pointless and useless. The estimates of 15:1 or 33:1 are all going in the same direction. Essentially they are saying that this is worth while to our country. It was further noted in that report:. . . revenues from taxes on grant receipts and profits on additional exports were estimated to return 42% of the cost of the scheme to the Commonwealth .That review consisted of a view being given by outsiders—people who had no direct involvement necessarily or who had anything to gain by it—that the EMDG scheme was worth while and in need of expansion.This reduction in real terms to $142.5 million when they take administration costs into consideration means a reduced number of companies will be able to utilise it. We can bet our bottom dollar that, despite all the speeches, qualifications and defences of this legislation by those opposite, the people who will miss out at the end of the day are the small and medium&hyphen;sized companies. They will be the ones, despite some reductions in who qualifies for it at the top end of the market. Essentially those small operators will miss out.When putting this legislation into perspective it is worth while noting the track record of some of those members opposite. One of the provisions of this legislation is to further expand its availability to the tourist industry. I seem to recall the member for Latrobe (Mr Charles) entering this debate and being a very vociferous supporter of the expansion of these grants into the tourist industry. I for one have continually questioned the order of priorities and whether it should be expanded to single tourist operators.Basically, the amount of money put into the scheme has been reduced, but at the same time they are expanding its availability and the amount of money going into it into the tourist sector. Today the member for Latrobe said that essentially he wants industry to stand on its own feet and that we do not need these schemes. He has been on the House of Representatives industry, science and technology committee in the past few years and he has said at those meetings that we should expand this grant to these sectors and that it was outrageous that single tourist operators were not getting it. It is very questionable as to how many people these single tourist operators actually attract to this country. I have said previously and I will say again that I do not know many people in Seoul or Tokyo who would get on a plane because of a TV advertisement for one hotel in Sydney, because of the Hertz rent&hyphen;a&hyphen;car scheme or because of one other tourist provider in this country. These people had a track record when in opposition of saying that the scheme was not wide enough, available enough and needed to be expanded. Here today they are trying to defend reductions in the scheme which will essentially undermine its viability and make it less available to Australian exporters.There is the question of trusts and the retrospective effect of this upon people already in the scheme. Like many other opposition speakers in this debate, I say that if there is something that the government feels is essentially wrong with trusts, then it should say it up&hyphen;front and do something about it in the spheres where it should be tackled. The government should not retrospectively hurt individual trusts and companies which went into this on a certain understanding, believing that they were making commitments to help this country and its exports and then slam the door on them after they have made those commitments.I note in passing a typical example which has been referred to me of why a company might create a trust. This company essentially created a trust not to cheat the Australian taxpayer, but because of the product liability laws in the United States and the way they would affect this companys operations overseas. There is a very diverse range of reasons why people go into trusts and the government should tackle it in the proper way. It should not try to undermine people who have made this commitment and tried to help our unemployment situation and our exports. In conclusion, I support the oppositions amendments to ensure that this cap is replaced and that this scheme, which is supported by a variety of investigations, is upheld.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
69,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr McCLELLAND","JK6","(Barton)","ALP","N/A",2423,"—The governments attitude to developing export industries in Australia is typified in the response I received to a question on notice I asked the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) on 9 September last year. I asked about the governments attitude to the forthcoming world exposition which is to take place in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1998. I asked the minister whether Australia would be represented at the next exposition. The simple one word answer was, `No. I asked what form the representation would take. The answer was, `Not applicable. I asked what theme would be presented by Australia at the expo and how far plans had been developed for Australias representation. `Not applicable was the answer.That sums up to a tee this governments policy in respect of developing Australian industry and Australian exports—`not applicable. There is a complete silence, a complete vacuum, on the part of this government. No more is it demonstrated than in respect of three areas—the cutting back of research and development, the cutting back of the EMDG scheme as in this legislation and the removal of bounties, which affects at least four industries.The fact of the matter is that, in respect of the EMDG scheme, it has been small and medium businesses that have been promoted. It is universally acknowledged that, since it was introduced by the Whitlam government in the early 1970s, the scheme has promoted an export culture. There is no doubt that it has had substantial successes.The scheme offsets costs which otherwise would not have been incurred by businesses when trying to foster and develop the sale of their products overseas. When we are talking about their products, we are talking about the businesses products and we are also talking about our products—that is, the products of Australia, the products that generate Australian jobs, the products that develop Australian technology.Contrary to what some would assert, this is far from a windfall gain. In order to receive a grant, the expenditure actually has to be incurred and the project has to be in place. It is not a lotto payout by any stretch of the imagination.All major reviews and reports over the last four years have praised the scheme and its accountability. Indeed, they have shown that there is no more than a one per cent rate of fraud or inappropriate claims in the scheme, and that is quite an exceptional effort by those administering it. We in the opposition favour any steps which would remove any abuse whatsoever, but the reality is that the scheme is benefiting genuine and committed exporters—genuine and committed exporters who are doing a great service not only for themselves but also for Australia.In 1994 Professor Ron Bewley of the University of New South Wales indicated that the return was between $15 and $25 for every dollar spent on the EMDG scheme. The governments own papers show that return to be about 33:1 in the present day and age. So the scheme, by any measure and by any objective analysis, has been highly successful.The scheme is also not nearly as expensive as the government would have us believe. As a result of the profits which come into businesses and which, in turn, are taxed and as a result of the salaries which are paid to workers producing goods sold overseas, the government gets about a 42 per cent return on any of the funds it pays out. So, all around, it has been a win&hyphen;win situation.We have dramatically cut a slice off our trading deficit, which continues to be one of the major problems facing Australia in addition to the unemployment situation. The EMDG scheme has been one of our main weapons in the armoury of promoting Australian industry.All of the major participants in the export industry have given almost impassioned pleas for the scheme to continue. For instance, Mr Allan Handberg, from the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, commented on the effect of losing the scheme:. . . business assistance programs had been particularly useful to the small and medium enterprises that made up 80 per cent of the chambers 6,000 member businesses.He said that those members had benefited from export market development programs. Again, it is not the high&hyphen;fliers, whom one of the previous speakers spoke of. The Australian Institute of Export commented:The scheme repaid the nation in employment and taxes via production and exports to much more than it cost . . .There is no doubt that is the case. A more recent analysis was done by one of the coalitions fellow travellers, if you like. The Premier of South Australia, Mr Olsen, commented on the hypocrisy of the governments stance. He said:The federal coalition had told us the small business sector was the sector which would revitalise Australia.It told us the small business sectors export growth and innovation were critical to Australia—yet it downgraded the export market development grants scheme and the research and development support program.He highlighted the double standards of his federal colleagues—speak one thing, do another.Mr Paul Baxter, a partner of Price Waterhouse, more recently stated the value of the EMDG scheme. He has spoken of the terrible problems that are going to arise and flow on to businesses from the government having this sort of pooling system. He said:. . . the tightening of the EMDG and its cap on claims would discourage companies on the verge of an exporting break through.That is what we want in Australia—we want to encourage export breakthroughs. If we do not, we are all going to pay the price. Unfortunately, this government is doing nothing to encourage export breakthroughs.Indeed, 66 per cent of those businesses which receive a benefit under the EMDG scheme are going to lose under this government—bear in mind that the vast majority of those recipients are small and medium businesses. One would think they would be very much the heartland that the government claims to virtually possess. Those people are not going to take very long at all to realise the shallowness of the governments policy in terms of meeting their needs and meeting Australias needs.Recently, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) spoke of the needs of business, especially small business. His comments were these:It needs the support to be outward looking—export oriented and the proof of the pudding has been in the eating.We have seen a surge in value added exports from this country over the last decade.That has been the case, and that has been the case because of policies pursued by the Labor Party when it was in power. The Industry Commission recently made a submission to the government saying the Labor Party was so successful in fostering that export culture that there was no further need for assistance by way of the export market development grants. That is short-sighted in the extreme because, at the present time, there is a negative growth in the contribution of exports to our gross domestic product. In other words, this government has picked the very wrong time to cut back on the scheme. It is a time when it is vitally needed—it is vitally required.I think it was the member for Griffith (Mr McDougall) who spoke of the Labor Party policy in terms of moving away from the high&hyphen;fliers and the high profile money spinners. As I have pointed out, 70 per cent of all EMDG recipients are small businesses. There were some 69,234 until 1991 and there have been considerably more since then. It has been, fortunately for Australias interests, a growing trend.Again, the blinkers have been placed on government members by their own side, not by anyone else. They preach this rhetoric, they espouse it, but they do not look at the facts. That is the trouble with this bill. They acted before there was any analysis of the benefits received by Australias exporting industry and, as a consequence, of benefits to Australia as a whole.It never ceases to amaze me how the government, and the frontbenchers in particular, will preach with religious fervour the benefits of the free market. Indeed, it is almost as if we can see them bowing before this free market icon. But when it comes to opening their eyes, when it comes to them getting in there and taking the ball up on behalf of Australian industry, they are found wanting. They are nowhere to be found. They are well and truly sitting in the grandstand. It will not be very long before our Australian exporting industries take up the issue and when they look around they will see that the government is nowhere to be found. It will not take long before they realise that fact and it will not be long before they withdraw their support from the government.The irony is dramatic. We hear dorothy dix questions asked about what the government is doing to foster our athletes in the forthcoming Olympics, as important as their achievements will no doubt be for Australia. However, when it comes to fostering literally thousands of quite remarkable and determined Australians to enable them to boost our industry, not only for their own benefit but for the benefit of all Australians, it is seen that we are letting them down quite severely and unfairly. In particular, that is underlined in the case of this legislation by the retrospective impact that it is going to have on so very many businesses, despite claims made by the government in its pre-election platform that the EMDG scheme would continue.A number of speakers before me have spoken on the technicalities of the bill and so I will not continue to debate those, other than to say that the governments actions are regrettable. They come at very much the wrong time in our history. It will not be very long before people who they claim are their natural constituents realise how treacherous the government has been to their interests.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
70,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr ADAMS","UNKNOWN","(Lyons)","UNKNOWN","N/A",2425,"—The previous Labor government attended to many of the reforms required to allow Australia to be competitive. It also provided a number of incentives for being more active in the mar keting of our exports and developing our export opportunities. Much of the past legislation is still working very well. Therefore, it is very difficult to understand why we would want to change it.The member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) has had the opportunity to look at this and, of course, has moved a second reading amendment on behalf of the opposition. The government has gutted the export marketing development legislation. During last years budget it announced what it was going to do and now, of course, these latest moves are entrenching it in legislation. However, surely the reasons for doing this are not only fiscal. Let us consider what is really happening. The measures include slashing more than $425 million over four years and include the capping of the scheme at $150 million per annum, including the cost of the administration. That will reduce the $150 million to something like $143 million.The focus has been significantly narrowed by cutting the number of export activities to which the export marketing development legislation previously applied. It narrows down the opportunities of people who can claim.Not only will there be substantially less assistance for exporters generally, but the exclusion of export activities such as air fares after two years, tender and quotation costs, and patent registration will mean much less export activity being undertaken by small business and many small businesses and medium sized businesses will no longer be eligible to apply.Austrade has estimated that the changes will mean that two thirds of the current EMDG recipients, which is over 2,000 exporters, will have their grants reduced. What the opposition is trying to do is to point out the legislations deficiencies; to reinstate the current eligible export activities proposed to be excluded; to eliminate any retrospectivity effects that the bill has on exporters; and to remove the proposed cap on the scheme.I believe the government should look at the effect this legislation will have on jobs and job creation and the opportunity for job growth. At least the government should hold off the legislation until such time as the possible effects can be assessed properly.There are aspects of some changes in this bill that the opposition can probably live with, but the overall effect of these changes will harm this countrys export drive if the government does not take into account the amendments that the opposition has put before it. There will be job losses and a lot of jobs not realised because of these changes to this bill. In todays Australian Financial Review Alan Mitchell quoted some interesting figures:Australias exports grew in real terms at a trend rate of almost seven per cent a year in the decade to 1994&hyphen;95. That compares with an annual trend growth rate for total exports of less than four per cent in the previous 10 years. Australias manufactured exports have been growing at closer to nine per cent a year in the past decade or so. Exports of elaborately transformed manufactures have grown at a trend rate of more than 16 per cent a year.Alan Mitchell goes on in his article to question how to keep the engine of economic reforms going so that both the economy and employment keeps growing.Of course, when you look at that article and reflect back on what is actually happening, this governments actions have been a major blow to the economy and the opportunity for employment to keep growing. It certainly is not taking a lot of the good things put into place by Labor. It is taking them and it is trashing them. It is just throwing them out without really giving the proper consideration it should. I do not believe that Labor got everything right but it certainly got a lot right and the economy growth is proof to that.We see the headline `Cuts sabotaging our IT export drive in the Australian on 18 March 1997, and journalist Stan Beer says that senior Austrade officials at CeBIT 97 have warned that Australias IT—information technology—export drive, could be sabotaged unless the federal government allocates more resources to promoting local technology. He says that, while the United States and Canada continue to expand their profiles at the worlds largest information technology trade fair, a 30 per cent reduction in Austrades already tight CeBIT 97 budget has forced it to significantly diminish our presence this year.I would think that would have to be looked on by most people in Australia as being a damn silly thing to be doing. Information technology is very important in the world and it is very important to Australia. It is very important that we have some growth in that area and that we maintain our position and keep up wherever we can. Here the cuts of this government are having a direct effect on our opportunities in world trade. Austrade has less resources to attract visitors to the Australian IT displays because there has been such a severe cutback in its marketing activities. It is a terrible thing that this government is doing. Australia is going back; it is being a backwater. Industry cannot take on the battle alone. Governments have a role to play.The federal Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) is wiping his hands of assisting industry when he said that we expect companies to mature at some stage and go out on their own, and that we have a large debt to get under control. The Minister said that in the Australian on 18 March this year. That stage, I would say to the minister, is not now, not when those companies have not reached their markets but are still gathering their markets, when they have not reached their targets. When they have an opportunity is when they are moving into their next expansion, not when they are struggling to capture a part of the highly competitive marketplace. We need to be smarter and more inventive to keep going in the export field. We need to keep an eye on what other countries are doing and making sure they are not putting us at an unfair disadvantage by holding on to some tariffs. The government needs to play its proper role as a facilitator and as a driver of economic direction.We have a sorry situation in my own state, Mr Deputy Speaker, and you will probably be aware of this. The government down there has completely lost the plot. It is trying to fire&hyphen;sale the major assets and all the infrastructure, leaving Tassie with nothing. There is no means by which the private sector can be encouraged into remaining in Tasmania and running viable industries. It is best summed up by Mr David Crean MLC, in his submission to the Nixon inquiry, when he said that Tasmania has to do more in the non&hyphen;resource based industries to diversify the economic base and create more core and semi&hyphen;core industries—industries such as information and communication technology, engineering, metal fabrication and tourism.The starting point is to encourage existing small, successful Tasmanian industries in these areas to expand, to become core and semi&hyphen;core industries. We all know that as Tasmanians. We all know that is what we should be doing and that the bill that we are slashing this support with is going to reduce the opportunity for those small companies and those medium sized companies in our state to expand and to have the opportunity of going further into the export field and to give us the base of industry that we need to have in Tasmania.This is occurring. We should also be encouraging opportunities for market investigation and market development. Companies pushing into these markets need government assistance. This bill is cutting back on assistance to those industries. That is a great shame.It is very interesting, Mr Deputy Speaker—and you probably heard this—that the Premier of Tasmania, Tony Rundle, expressed grave concerns about the cost&hyphen;cutting move. He said that it would stop Tasmanian firms being refunded for air fares associated with marketing their products overseas. He made many comments in the local press about it. He said that 150 Tasmanian companies would be dealt a major blow if they were unable to get refunds from Austrade.Air fares are one of the largest single expenses for small companies. The withdrawal of the eligibility will be a major blow to the Tasmanian apple, vegetable, seafood and manufacturing industries. Premier Rundle sees it as a huge problem for Tasmania. He is asking his people to listen to the problems they will cause for the state by not taking into account these sorts of stories.The Premier has written to all state Liberal MPs in Canberra asking them to do all they can. I have not seen any of them doing anything, let alone what they can. If that is all they can do, it is not very much at all. I have not seen any ministers standing up in here arguing the point or trying, in the back corridors, to change the way the executive is making these decisions.The Premier said that export is Tasmanias lifeline and that to cut back on market funding is foolish. Of course it is foolish. I do not believe pouring money into subsidies is what is wanted, but it is the sort of practical assistance that government can give and which it is best placed to provide through such things as the Industrial Supply Office, advice from Austrade and assistance for overseas displays and fairs. In that way, customers can have first&hyphen;hand experience of Australian goods, get to know them, and become familiar with what we have to offer.It is all tied to skills and skill development. Skill is not exactly being pushed by this government. Skill formation within our work force is not something very high on the governments agenda. It just wants to appear to be doing something. It is a bit like work for the dole—the idea is really a sham. It is not proper training, case management, or working with industries and business to provide the skills that they are seeking—which is what labour market programs should be about. This government does not seem to have a clue about how to keep the economy chugging along, let alone how to get it to expand so that it can take up some of the enormous number of unemployed we have in Australia today.The oppositions amendments are put in good faith. We do not want to see all the pluses of our government going down the drain—which is what this bill is geared to do. If there is a need to tighten things up, fair enough; but to scale it down to a level where this program is not efficient is downright stupid.I would just like to come back to Tasmania. The government backbenchers that I have heard speak on this bill have mainly been praising the minister for cutting these matters out—this assistance to export opportunities, the opportunity to grow—","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/debate.sub1/speech[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We made that very clear. We have been working actively on this issue, and there has been a great deal done. We put an alternative approach to the Papua New Guinea government, and we will continue to press that alternative. We have done so in the context of the Prime Ministers meeting with Sir Julius Chan the Sunday before last and in the context of the large number of contacts with Papua New Guinea involving both myself and Australian officials over the past two weeks.It is true that some people—such as, apparently, now the opposition—have argued that Australia should move immediately to take retaliatory action against Papua New Guinea. We believe we should continue doing what we are doing already, that is, seeking strenuously to persuade Papua New Guinea not to use mercenaries. To retaliate now—I think the opposition should reflect on this—would be to end our chances of persuading Papua New Guinea to abandon their plans. In our judgment, that would be wrong.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It was a critical time to visit the Middle East on two counts. First, Australia is in a very competitive circumstance there with many other trading nations pushing their exports of goods and services in the growing markets in the Middle East. Secondly, there was the very sad occurrence of the shooting of seven schoolchildren last Thursday. The update and advice in respect of that came in during the meeting I had with Prime Minister Netanyahu. This allowed me to immediately express, on behalf of the Australian government and the Australian people, our condemnation of terrorism in respect of this further atrocity taking place in the Middle East and to give our condolences. The Prime Minister, John Howard, then wrote formally to Prime Minister Netanyahu with regard to that horrific tragedy.The main focus of the visit, in addition to reaffirming our commitment to the Middle East peace process, was to boost Australias profile, to further negotiate market access and to generally pursue trade interests. That was done with a great deal of success.In terms of the second aspect of the members question, I would like to advise that the Australian Wheat Board now estimates that its wheat sales this financial year to the countries I went to will double last seasons sales. The Queensland Sugar Corporation expects raw sugar sales to Egypt to increase by a further 50 per cent with new and additional contracts with Saudi Arabia. The outgoing Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation expects an increase of several hundred per cent in sales of product to Egypt and to other parts of the Middle East. More generally, I signed a number of agreements with Lebanon and with Egypt in respect of air services and trade best endeavours, and in respect of grains and pulses with Egypt.

They take a lot of resource from Austrade and from Foreign Affairs and Trade in respect of very busy schedule commitments, but this is one region where a ministerial visit can have a good impact in particular. More particularly, it is one area where we are in fierce competition with a number of European nations and other competitive traders; that is why it was important to go.

In fact, we can actually thank you for alerting everybody to this problem. The same is the case in relation to any superannuation measure where superannuation is conducted by the state and is the property of the state. Under the constitution, the state property cannot be affected by Commonwealth measures. That is the case in relation to all such measures.

Or you can require the employers to do it, which the Labor Party presumably would like because it is all in favour of an employer increase in complexity and account keeping. Or you can ask employees to do it. The fact of the matter is that we have chosen the superannuation funds to do it because it builds on your system. The system currently in place in relation to employer contributions—put in place by the Labor Party—required the superannuation funds to pay across. When we brought in measures to make it more fair, we built on your system. There is no use engaging in psychobabble across the table the way you are—we built on your system. You were in favour of it when you introduced it, and we are building on it.As I said yesterday, superannuation funds have guaranteed income by law. Guaranteed income.

84,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr RUDDOCK","0J4","Berowra","LP","N/A",2430,"—I thank the honourable member for Canning for her question. I am aware of such reports. I know that many members of the House have recently met with Refugee Council members to discuss issues that are related to the asylum process, as well as refugee questions generally. I know that abuse is a matter of concern to them, as it is to me.I am advised by some people who have worked in the field over a long period of time that there is an awareness that some folk are manipulating the system by applying for protection from countries where one would not normally expect applications to be generated.Let me say from the outset that I would expect any officer of my department, or any member of the Refugee Review Tribunal, to grant refugee status to a person who has met the internationally accepted definition of `refugee. That is our obligation and it is one that we accept. However, the governments determination to address the problem of abuse is not code for denying protection to genuine refugees. Unfortunately, we seem to be confronted with a prevalence of abuse which delays assessment and is disadvantaging bona fide refugees.The abuse of the system is costing the taxpayer millions of dollars and is undermining public confidence. The fact is that people who enter Australia, say, as a tourist, can apply for a protection visa, and the fee for that is $30. On that application, they are given work rights and access to Medicare while they are awaiting a decision. However, there are some applying to my department who are not seeking protection but who simply come in and ask for the $30 work visa. These people are seeking only to access work rights and Medicare, and they are not bona fide. There are unscrupulous promoters, who I am told can charge as much as $8,000 for generating applications and advising people how to use each stage of the process to advantage. The applicants seek to delay their departure as long as possible, knowing full well that they are not refugees.We saw this year a 20 per cent increase in the number of applications for asylum. In the last budget, we allocated additional resources to speed up the process to ensure genuine applicants are considered but non&hyphen;genuine applicants are removed. The Refugee Review Tribunal is at the moment providing priority consideration to non&hyphen;bona fide applications to remove them from the process.I will soon be announcing extensive changes to the merits and judicial review system to further address these problems. I intend to ensure that the process is as speedy and as efficient as possible so that non&hyphen;bona fide claimants are removed as quickly as possible and so that the incentive to exploit it is removed. The clear message will be that abuse of the system will not be allowed to continue.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[1]/question.block[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

93,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr COSTELLO","CT4","Higgins","LP","N/A",2432,"—Makin. Any other questions? They are very pleased about their housing affordability. Housing affordability in Australia now is at its best since December 1984—at its best since they started taking records. That is, of course, because the standard variable interest rate in Australia has fallen by three per cent since this government came to office. Nothing makes the members of the coalition feel better about the benefits they have been able to deliver to middle income earners in Australia than the delivery of lower interest rates—for a person on a standard mortgage, a saving of over $200 a month after tax. That is the consequence of a responsible economic policy. These are the benefits of putting behind us the Labor Party failure of deficit and debt and high interest rates which had locked Australia in a vice throughout the late 1980s and into the 1990s.Total dwelling investment rose three per cent in the December quarter, driven by strong growth in both alterations and additions and new dwelling investments. This is consistent with a 5.4 per cent rise in private dwelling commencements in the December quarter. Total private building approvals increased by 7.6 per cent in January 1997 and finance approvals for new dwellings rose 6.4 per cent in January 1997.As a result of both interest rates and the turning of the housing cycle—that is, the adjustment of supply and demand getting back into sync—most people expect the Australian house building industry to pick up through 1997 and get stronger in the latter part of the year.The house building industry is quite a crucial industry to Australia. It has always been a driver of economic growth, and the turning&hyphen;up in relation to the housing industry is consistent with a strengthening economy through 1997. The government would not want to see a return to the boom&hyphen;bust cycle which has marred other housing cycles. What the government would want to see is a slow and gradual but sustainable pick&hyphen;up throughout the 1997 year. We welcome the fact that the cycle is obviously turning and strengthening, and strengthening on a basis which, we believe, will give sustainable growth throughout 1997.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[2]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

The reality in Australia today is that health is provided, to the sum of $20 billion, through the federal budget. The combined impact of the state budgets is about another $20 billion and approximately $5 billion is contributed through the Medicare health levy. That is the point that the minister for health made. It is accurate and that is very clear, I would have thought, even to the member for Dobell.As to the other part of the question that the member for Dobell asked me: he referred to a leaked document, as he described it, in respect of the current budgetary process. One would have thought that last year all members opposite would have got very used to the fact that we on this side of the House are not in the business of speculating on what will be contained in the budget.But—and the Leader of the Opposition would back me up on this—the Department of Finance have a very good reputation for creating menus. In fact the whole process in the Department of Finance is to make suggestions. They make suggestions which the government has the right to reject or accept. Everybody knows that they are a mean lot. In fact their cafeteria down there serves only raw meat! They are told to eat raw meat every day—no fat on it! They have to be lean and hungry.

I did indeed sign on behalf of the Australian government a maritime treaty with the Indonesian government which represents the culmination of over a quarter of a century of negotiations. It finalises the three maritime boundaries not covered by existing treaties.This was a truly historic moment in Australian diplomatic history because what this treaty has done is resolve the uncertainty as to how the seabed and water column should be divided between our two countries. Now Australia will be able to exercise sovereign rights enforceable under international law to explore, exploit, conserve and manage seabed and marine resources in those areas under our jurisdiction. So the treaty will have benefits to both countries. The exploration of natural resources will be able to proceed in a climate of confidence and of certainty.I know all members of the House will be interested to hear that the treaty is an excellent outcome for Australia. It is fair and it is equitable. It does not give away Australian seabed or marine resources. To give but one example, and that is the boundary between Christmas Island and Java, as a result of this agreement, Indonesia will now recognise an Australian maritime zone around Christmas Island which I am advised by the Australian Surveying and Land Information Group is some 19 times greater than before.In conclusion, this treaty was not a secret treaty. This was a treaty that we flagged in September we would move to sign and a treaty that will now be passed to the parliamentary treaties committee for consideration, to which those who wish to do so can make submissions. So this is a treaty which will be considered by the Australian parliament before the treaty is finally ratified.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This is something that we inherited from the Labor Party during 13 years of their maladministration of this countrys economic affairs.This gives me a great opportunity in fact to highlight some of the characteristics of the child-care sector under the mismanagement of Labor when they were in government. Child care under the previous government was characterised by an oversupply in many areas, an undersupply in others, a general lack of information to parents in the community about where their best options were located and in fact a lack of information to people out there who were trying to provide the child-care facilities for the community.

107,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr SHARP","AJ4","Hume","NP","N/A",2434,"—I thank the honourable member for Grey, who has taken a deep and personal interest in this issue. He has been a leader in this field over the last few months in bringing forward the interests and views of his own constituency, many of whom are employed by Australian National Rail and are somewhat in discord with some of the things that the Labor Party are saying now that they are in opposition.Late last year, at the end of November, the government announced the rail reform package that we had been working on for several months since coming into office. That rail reform package was designed to overcome the 13 years of neglect, mismanagement and failed policies of the former Labor government, which saw rail lines closed, thousands of jobs lost at AN and of course a huge blow&hyphen;out in the debt that AN suffered and in its losses on an operational basis.Because of those losses and those debts, this government has taken action. Today the Minister for Finance has advertised in papers right around Australia, calling for expressions of interest in all or part of AN and its business enterprises. This, I am pleased to report, is a welcome event because AN has been losing a considerable amount of money. On average, over the last few months AN has had to be topped up by the government with about $10 million in extra cash in order to keep it operating. In fact, over the last few months some $90 million has been given to AN to keep it going.There is considerable interest from the private sector in buying all or part of AN and its business enterprises. A very pleasing degree of interest has come forward in the period prior to the official calling of expressions of interest.This reform package will bring enormous benefit, enormous gains, to places like South Australia and Tasmania. The reason this will happen is that, as a result of this governments commitment to rail reform, AN will be completely freed of all its debt. When I first spoke to union representatives representing AN workers last year, one of the things they said that had to be done in order to get AN back in business properly was to free it of all its debts—and that is precisely what this government is doing in its rail reform initiatives that we announced late last year.With that will come new opportunities for this business. The new owners of this business will bring fresh capital investment, new management expertise and a commitment to grow the business of rail in Australia. That is exactly what this government wants. We believe that, as a result of this, South Australia and Tasmania will see, over time, a growth in the number of people employed in rail businesses in those two states. Considerable economic advantage will come to those states as rail becomes a more efficient service provider to the transport industry.We can compare this new future, giving rail a real chance of growth, with the future that was provided by the former Labor government, which saw rail declining over the years under their mismanagement, which saw all of those lines being closed down and which saw thousands of jobs lost under Labors mismanagement of AN and its business enterprises.The member for Grey, his constituents and those people who represent the workers of AN in both South Australia and Tasmania can look forward to a substantial improvement in rail under this new future as expressed in the advertisements in todays newspapers right around Australia. This governments initiatives on rail will see a growth in it. That growth will be led by the private sector, with a fresh capital commitment.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[6]/answer/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

In addition, they are receiving some $36 million through the black spots program administered by my colleague the Minister for Transport and Regional Development.If you have a look at the state of Victoria, there is some $285 million in federal government funding through this process, the financial assistance grants, of which $77 million goes to identified local roads plus $8.2 million of the black spots funding. If you take into account the national funding that comes from Minister Sharps area for roads and state roads, there is another $200 million as well. A significant amount goes to roads in Victoria.If the member for Wannon has a look at his own electorate, it is estimated that somewhere in the vicinity of $28 million goes to that electorate for funding under the federal grants system and $11 million of that goes to identified local roads.The point for the shire of Corangamite is this: they receive about $3.4 million which they can choose to spend on what they want. So my argument to them is that they receive very significant amounts of funds in an untied form that they can apply to roads as they see appropriate. I am surprised to hear that they are now ripping up roads.The other important point is the question of employment. It is estimated by the Bureau of Transport Economics that there are 17 direct and indirect jobs created by every million dollars that is spent on road creation—that is, some 1,300 jobs in Victoria. That equates to 470 jobs in Wannon. Right across Australia there are some 6,000-odd jobs created by these funds being expended on roads.In answer to the members question about the shire that has made the complaint, I am surprised that they are making the complaint. They are generously treated. They are given funds that they can use at their own discretion to address the needs in their own particular area.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[8]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

Isnt it a fact that the leaked budget document, which I am very happy to table, shows that the second Howard budget will take a further $157 million from nursing home residents?

When these people were in government they had 13 years and did nothing to fix the deplorable state of nursing homes, despite a report to their government from Professor Gregory of the ANU about the parlous state of nursing homes.We can be proud, as a government, of the measures that we have taken in our first year in government to address the very serious issue of residential aged care that affects the most frail and the most vulnerable in our community.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[9]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

123,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr ANDERSON","4K4","Gwydir","NP","N/A",2437,"—I thank the honourable member for his question. I know this is of great interest to him not only on a personal level but also on behalf of his constituents.I can say too that I have a high regard for Mr John Purcell, who made those comments, but I believe that he is absolutely and totally wrong. He makes two main charges. The first is that he thinks there should have been a formal species split in the new reform package. In fact, I would make the point that there is a split in the area where it makes sense, which is promotion and market development. There is not a split where logically these things belong together. The other thing that ought to be noted is that slap&hyphen;sided generic advertising—`Go and spend $25 million a year in Japan no matter what sort of approach—is being phased out for a more sensible approach, a branded sort of approach, which I think is very much the way of the future.His second major concern is that producers and processors ought to be separated. This is interesting on two counts. The first is that, when I met with him in Brisbane a few weeks ago, he wanted them separated. The second is that I have not allowed them to be separated—and will not allow them to be separated. They will be kept together under a memorandum of understanding.Under this governments, I think, very fair approach to the imposition of levies, we make it plain that if an industry wants to go it on a voluntary basis that is their right. And if in this case, as they have said, they want to do it voluntarily, that is fine, we will give them a run. But they have agreed with me that, if there is clear market failure, we can put the levy back on. That is the best possible outcome under the circumstances. I believe that it will work very well. The meat processors have made it absolutely plain to me that they understand the need to work cooperatively, hand in hand, in a determined way with the rest of the industry to advance the interests of this great industry, both domestically and internationally.All I can say is that those who yesterday—perhaps rather too quickly—made a couple of comments about the package could perhaps learn from the example of the others. They had a good calm look at it, recognised that it is enormous change and that it really does empower the industry to take control of their own destiny. As has been so widely acknowledged today, it is excellent policy. It is hardly insignificant. The three statutory authorities will go and there will be a new producer organisation. It is very much, in my view, the way to go, and I believe that industry are rapidly drawing that same conclusion.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[10]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The words used in the decision, I think, are quite damning of Australia Post in the way in which it handled this matter. In fact, it was said that Australia Posts response to its concerns was `so out of proportion, ill-founded, unjust and illogical that, by independent objective standards, it was tantamount to capriciousness and spitefulness. So, as I say, I think anybody would fairly see that this was a good result and a proper result.It is also timely to note that Quentin Cook has been having a running battle with the factional allies and mates of those on the other side within certain elements of the trade union movement. It was Quentin Cook who was able to expose the rorts in certain union elections. Members might remember the spectre of the four trade unionists sitting around the kitchen table, filling out the ballot papers to get their mates back—who just happened to be mates of certain people on the other side. Members wont forget that, as Quentin Cook was raising his concerns, there was nothing but silence from the member for Dobell, the member for Kingsford&hyphen;Smith and the member for Denison. They turned a blind eye. Why would they turn a blind eye?The fact of the matter is that this bloke has had a very rough time. The other side turned a blind eye to it. He has taken the avenues available to him for reasonable redress. He has had a win here. He has now said that he is going to set up an enterprise union. The good news is that, since the Workplace Relations Act was established, if you can get 50 people to band together to set up a responsible union then you are able to do so subject to the provisions of the act. We welcome responsible unionism, and we say to Quentin Cook, `We reckon there are another 49 who will join you and will put up and provide reasonable services to members in the communications industry.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[12]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

I think they are instructive. They appear to have been lost sight of in some of the flamboyant and extravagant rhetoric that has been used on this issue. In relation to item No. 3 of the terms of reference, this is what the Treasurer said:request that the Commission have regard to the Governments desire—I repeat—have regard to the Governments desire to encourage the development of a sustainable, prosperous and internationally competitive automotive manufacturing industry in Australia; to improve the overall economic performance of the Australian automotive industry; to provide good quality, competitively priced vehicles to the Australian consumer; and its commitment to abide by Australias international obligations and commitments.That is a policy statement of the government contained in the terms of reference sent by the Treasurer to the Productivity Commission.Let us just have a moment, before I sit down, on consistency.

The survey by KPMG for the Australian Institute of Company Directors is yet more good news of the uplift in the economy, particularly relating to the small business sector. From large business and small business the interesting thing to come from the survey was that, of those covered, 67 per cent expect an improvement in the next 12 months in the outlook of the Australian economy; 56 per cent expect sales to increase; and 53 per cent expect an increase in profits.This survey comes on top of the ACCI survey, which also indicated that there is a strong uplift in business confidence, particularly during 1996. The ACCI survey said the data shows expectations of even better performance in the quarters to come. This is yet another confident survey that endorses the governments approach towards the economy—an indication that business is taking account of the governments actions in regard to the economy.As I said, 67 per cent expect an improvement over the next 12 months in the economy. Sales and increased profits are consistent with what we are getting through. It is consistent with increased housing sales. It is consistent with what my colleague the Treasurer just mentioned in regard to housing investment.It is about time that the opposition realised that the economy is on the move. Small business is taking advantage of those initiatives. It is about time they stopped talking down small business and recognised the advantage to the economy that small business gives.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn[2]/question.block[16]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

202,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Dr LAWRENCE","XS4","(Fremantle)","ALP","N/A",2445,"—I am sure that many members will be aware, following a story in Sundays Sunday Telegraph , of proposals that have been floated by the government which would see Holsworthy as the site for Sydneys second airport and, as part of the package, what we would see is the movement of the Lucas Heights nuclear plant from its present location to Jervis Bay. Some members of the government, including the local member, have been at pains to point out that this is not correct, but I want to outline exactly what is on the governments agenda and what the community should know about this very important matter.What we had was a report given to this journalist which very clearly indicates that the government has been considering the Lucas Heights matter. Despite the fact that we have been reassured in this parliament that no decisions had been made, we know that an interdepartmental committee has actually been examining precisely that question. It has been asked whether we should simply refurbish the present facility or whether there should be a replacement.Our very clear understanding is that that IDC has made recommendations to the government and that there is now a cabinet submission which exactly addresses that point. In fact, we understand the federal government will soon consider a submission that recommends that the 38-year-old reactor at Lucas Heights, bordering the Holsworthy site in southern Sydney, be shut because of safety fears and that an alternative facility be built. That, as far as we know it, is what is going on within government. Does the wider community know about this? Have they been taken into the governments confidence? No, they have not. There has been no discussion of this.We also learn that not only has the discussion about the future of Lucas Heights been going on within government through an interdepartmental committee in the preparation of cabinets submission but also there has been action by one of the ministers—the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). The minister for transport and members of his staff have been pressing that Holsworthy should be excluded and that the facility at Lucas Heights should be abandoned, whether it is a replacement or a refurbishment. He apparently has some other plans. What we need to know from this government is what those plans are, because there is a very real suggestion that the plans are to relocate the Lucas Heights facility and to build a new facility and waste reprocessing plant at Jervis Bay.At the time this story came out, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) avoided the question. He did not say this is not on. It was very interesting. He avoided answering the question that was put to him by a journalist. He had one of his staff, a spokeswoman, answer it. When it was put to him that there was a proposal to move the Lucas Heights facility to Jervis Bay, the spokeswoman said, `It is not, and never has been, considered by the government. That seems clear enough. But why use a spokeswoman? Where is the minister? Why isnt the minister saying this?Very interestingly, and that was reported to a journalist in the Sydney Morning Herald , a little further down the track, and I do not know whether it was before or after that statement, presumably the same spokeswoman—she was certainly identified as Mr McGaurans spokeswoman—said, and this is a very interesting quote, `The minister was unaware of any official documents and, if they do exist, they have no official status. So he does not know about any official documents. But, if they do exist, they have no official status, which is a bit of a move from the earlier position that, `It is not, and never has been, considered by the government. So the minister is inferring that maybe there are some documents around that refer to this possibility, but he is not giving them official status. Interestingly, the minister is not speaking either.A similar report was clearly given to the Canberra Times , because they reported a similar spokeswoman saying, `Mr McGauran is unaware of any official documents. If they do exist, they have no status. How he can be unaware of documents that he is not sure exist and their official status is really a most peculiar position for the minister to be in.I want to outline—before I go on to the particular source of this material and the argument that is being put within government about the Jervis Bay location—why it is that this should simply not be considered, that Jervis Bay should be ruled out right from the outset and that there should not be any pussyfooting about the status of this area. I know the local member would want to see that happen; I know the member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel) would want to see that happen; and I know that we on this side would want to see that happen. It is most important that this be ruled out altogether and that there are no sneaky discussions going on within government.I think members need to be reminded about Jervis Bay. It is a unique part of our wonderful coastline. It is of international significance. It is a key habitat for international migratory birds. It is already recognised for its outstanding diversity of both the terrestrial and marine environments, and many species in this area are at the limits of their biogeographical range. There are extensive species rich heathlands, and there is a very high concentration of rare and threatened plant and animal species.Jervis Bay is now on the Register of the National Estate and is a terrestrial breeding colony of little penguins—at least on Bowen Island. There is a population of bottlenose dolphins which reside in the bay. The area contains a coastal dune system; a diversity of associated aquatic habitats and wetlands; extensive and diverse saltmarshes; and seagrasses, including the largest Posidonia meadows in New South Wales. So this is an area not to be messed with. It is certainly not an area in which to put a nuclear facility, waste reprocessing plant or a harbour.I am sure that many will be aware of the fact that there were proposals at one stage to locate an armaments depot and to relocate the fleet from Sydney into this area. The former government made a very clear commitment that they would not be used for either of those purposes. They also made a very clear commitment that it would not be used for a nuclear facility, as was originally proposed by a conservative government. It sat there for a long time as a possibility, worrying local residents. There was an environmental assessment process undertaken in relation to the fleet, which meant that both the nuclear option and the fleet option were stopped, that people could at last feel some comfort. What do we see now? The spectre is again being raised that this may well end up being a nuclear facility.Mr Deputy Speaker, you might say that the government would not possibly contemplate such a move. But the minister here and the minister for transport have very clearly played around with a nuclear option over the years. This is a minister who has, from time to time, advocated that Australia become a nuclear power. I am sure the Minister for Science and Technology, at the table, will agree that he has. Not only has the minister been fooling around with the possibility of reprocessing nuclear wastes but also when he was in opposition he recommended that Australia become a nuclear power—that we actually have facilities here for the nuclear generation of electricity.So this is a minister who thinks there are no problems with the disposal of wastes, and he has said so very publicly on a number of occasions. In 1989 he argued that Australia establish a nuclear industry. In the coalitions 1993 energy policy, the coalition actually committed itself to removing:. . . Federal Legislation and policies that preclude any particular type of generation from being considered and assessed in a fair and balanced way with other generation methods. The Federal Government would not, therefore, oppose the development of nuclear fuel cycle in Australia.This minister has a record on this point. Now, almost 10 years after a Labor government clearly ruled out a nuclear future for Jervis Bay, it is back on the agenda. You would have to ask why they find Jervis Bay so appealing. It is because right now it allows the minister for transport—Mr McGauran interjecting —","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
203,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Dr LAWRENCE","XS4","(Fremantle)","ALP","N/A",2445,"—You are a junior minister—as described in the article—outside cabinet. We want to know what the minister for transport really thinks about this. The minister for transport wants to continue with his plans for Holsworthy airport. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) will outline some of those proposals which will allow the Minister for Science and Technology to pursue the nuclear option for Australia.The same minister misled this parliament about the safety of the 1,600 spent fuel rods when he was talking about the need to keep open the reprocessing option, the need to keep open the possibility of importing nuclear waste from other countries. In a matter of public importance, the minister said about the nuclear fuel rods:. . . they are corroding—they are corroding; very clear—We cannot leave them indefinitely.But, as has been pointed out by a number of people, including Paul Cleary from the Sydney Morning Herald , the latest report from ANSTO, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, affirms that the rods are `in very good condition. Yet the minister says they are corroding—present tense. ANSTO went on to say:The generally good condition of fuel and liners provides confidence in the concept of long&hyphen;term storage of spent fuel rods under controlled dry atmospheres.Why then did the minister mislead this parliament? How did he correct it? He left it to a spokesperson to correct the record. The spokesperson admitted, `It would be wrong to say they are corroding at this point. But the minister has not actually corrected the record in this place.I want to raise not only the values associated with Jervis Bay but the source of this information that is supposed to have some status. They do not know if there is an official document and, if there is, they do not know what status it has. I will tell you what status it has, Minister. It is a memo to you, and I quote from it:I met with Lachlan McComish, Adviser, Land, Transport, Rail to John Sharp, last Tuesday. We discussed the location of the HIFAR reactor at Lucas Heights in relation to the proposal to locate Sydneys new airport at Holsworthy. Lachlan made it clear that Badgerys Creek was dead as a viable option for the airport, mainly due to the build&hyphen;up of residential housing in the area since the site was first proposed. He believes that Holsworthy will be selected as the preferred site subject to a satisfactory outcome of the EIS.This memorandum does not come from way outside government; this is a senior government adviser. That is why the minister said he does not know if it exists and, if it does, it does not have official status. It is a memorandum to him, and he has seen it and read it. He knows it exists. So he needs to correct what his spokeswoman said during the week. Lachlan McComish, the adviser to John Sharp, said Holsworthy is the option, Badgerys Creek is dead. That creates a problem for this minister: what do you do with Lucas Heights? The memo goes on to say:The location of a new airport at Holsworthy would make it impossible for the HIFAR reactor to remain in operation at Lucas Heights or for a possible replacement reactor to be built there.He has had a senior minister take away the place where he wants to build a reactor. That, by the way, is the recommendation of the interdepartmental committee. They say, `Yes, you do have to build a new reactor, it is necessary for Australia, and it should be in the general Lucas Heights area—the Holsworthy area, according to ANSTO.They have got a problem. Minister Sharp does not want it there; he wants it somewhere else. One of the helpful people suggested, `Well, youve already got a facility located, in some peoples minds, at Jervis Bay. Lets put it there. That is where it was originally scheduled to go. Lets return to that option. It may be, as the minister says, that he is not promoting that option, but as sure as any argument can be mounted there are people in government who are promoting that option. They reckon you can sell off the land at the current Badgerys Creek site to purchase the necessary additional land for the Lucas Heights reactor, wherever it might go, and pay for its establishment. That information is all contained in this memo. It goes on to say:I believe the refurbishment of the existing high fire reactor is not a viable option, regardless of whether the new airport is constructed at Holsworthy or Badgerys Creek.In other words, he goes on to argue you cannot simply refurbish it—and there are a whole range of reasons given for that—and clearly that is the view of the IDC. If you look at the respective costs of refurbishment versus replacement, there is not really all that much difference. He talks about some of the technical problems associated with each of the options. He goes on to conclude—we understand this is now contained in a cabinet minute—as the IDC did:It is clear the government has no option but to proceed with a new reactor.But where are you going to put it, Minister? Are you going to put it at Holsworthy? Are you going to create a new set of problems for the preferred option of the minister for transport? It is bad enough that there is all that unexploded ordnance there but now they want to have a brand&hyphen;new nuclear reactor, complete with a reprocessing facility, an expanded facility, not only in the middle of an electorate—I am sure the local member would not want to see it located there—but right smack bang next to a brand&hyphen;new second Sydney airport. Very clever, Minister.I can understand why the minister for transport, since he loves the Holsworthy option, is saying, `Youve got to get that nuclear reactor out of here. Youve got to put it somewhere else. The government has not, I have to say, been open with the public about that. That is what really has to happen.

For instance, he said:I am disappointed in the result and I am feeling a little bruised and battered from it.He said it was `like returning to the past. The editorials at the time, including in the West Australian and the Age , all pointed out the contradictions and hypocrisy and inconsistency of Labors position, which was based purely on internal factional positioning. As Geoff Kitney said in the Sydney Morning Herald on 26 September 1994:The so&hyphen;called three mines uranium policy is a joke. It has no credibility not least because, from the Prime Minister down—namely, Prime Minister Keating—a chorus of senior members of the Government and of the ALP have said the policy is outdated and should be changed.But no, they are not going to do what is in the best interests of the Australian public.

This is a good one: the Age reported on 4 May 1989:The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, says uranium sales could help Australias balance of payments . . .Bob Hogg bought into the act at the time.

After all, who will ever forget the then foreign minister Gareth Evanss lame, limp&hyphen;wristed response in June 1995 to the Mururoa tests by France when it resumed nuclear testing in the Pacific? You really should go to the newspaper clippings of that time just to remind yourself of the fury and the anger and the disgust that all Australians felt towards Gareth Evans and the Labor Party.Really, you just refused at any time to sensibly address these issues. Gareth Evans was abused up hill and down dale, even by his party. On 28 June 1995, the Australian reported that Gareth Evans, the now member for Holt, conceded that his response to the nuclear tests had been too weak. The article says:The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, yesterday conceded that he and the rest of Cabinet—he is not going to take this rap all on his own, is he?—had underestimated public anger about French nuclear testing and should have acted sooner to introduce tougher measures.There are a number of editorials throughout the country at the time that spoke of `Gareths Suez, and the `Mururoa protests sell us short, according to the West Australian editorial of 17 June. The Financial Review report of 16 June 1995 had the headline `Caucus, unions angry over `soft stance. So, really, you are just mischief makers.You ask us in the MPI to categorically rule out once and for all the relocation of the Lucas Heights research reactor to Jervis Bay. That is fine. I am happy to put it on the record here and now, just as we put it on the record from 9 a.m. on Sunday morning, and continually since. I know you are a bit lost without aNiMaLS. I realise that it is a bit hard for you to really keep up to date without that vast bureaucracy of politically paid journalists you had established to assist you. You must have really relied on aNiMaLS in those days, because how could you have missed dozens of radio broadcasts throughout Sunday and all of Mondays major newspapers—the Sydney Morning Herald , the Canberra Times , the Australian —carrying the governments and the minister for transports complete rejection of this furphy? You do not have government documents. You have one memo that dates back to June by a former Commonwealth employee who has but one or two sentences, off the top of his head obviously, relating to Jervis Bay. So you can rely on nothing in that memo.Quite frankly, how the opposition could have slid into this state of incompetence where they put up an MPI that reads, `The failure of the government to categorically rule out the relocation of Lucas Heights nuclear reactor and storage facility to Jervis Bay, and not ask a question is beyond me. We give you 10 questions a day so that we can have ministers accountable to the parliament and, through it, to the Australian people. This is how seriously you regard it. All I can say is that I am relieved that the shadow minister for science and technology, the member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), has been clever and smart enough not to associate himself with this complete farce and complete waste of the parliaments time.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/break/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"
225,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr LATHAM","K26","(Werriwa)","ALP","N/A",2452,"—The Minister for Science and Technology, the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), asks why is the parliament debating this matter. Five hundred thousand people in the south-west of Sydney would give him this answer: because of the governments deceitful and disgraceful handling of the Holsworthy airport issue.I know there are divisions in the National Party about leadership, present and future, but I did not really expect the member for Gippsland to so thoroughly drop his colleague the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the member for Hume (Mr Sharp), right in it. This is what the minister for transport told this House on 21 May 1996—it was the day he announced the new EIS process for Sydneys second international airport:Can I reiterate to the House that it is this governments first priority to develop an airport at Badgerys Creek. We are determined to proceed with a second airport for Sydney. Our first priority is Badgerys Creek.Now we hear from the science minister that this memo, leaked out of his office, was written in June 1996. That is just a few weeks after the minister for transport tells this House that Badgerys Creek is his first option. We have a senior adviser to the minister for transport telling staff of the science minister, `Lachlan made it clear that Badgerys Creek was dead as a viable option for the airport. That is Lachlan McComish, adviser, land transport rail to John Sharp in June 1996.If these words passed on to the science minister are true, the minister for transport has misled this House. He has misled this House by telling the House on 21 May 1996 that his first priority was Badgerys Creek. Here is his senior adviser on land transport, Mr McComish, telling other government staffers just a few weeks later, according to the science minister, that Badgerys Creek is dead. What a disgrace; what deceit; what misleading of the people of Sydney over a key lifestyle and economic issue like Sydneys second international airport.That is a disgusting episode in this governments history—to think that the minister is telling the House on 21 May that his first priority is Badgerys Creek; meanwhile, in the back corridors of Parliament House, around the ministerial wing of this place, senior advisers to the minister for transport are telling other government staffers that Badgerys Creek is dead. They are telling other staff that their minister has misled this House. He is an absolute disgrace. He not only misled people in the lead-up to the election campaign about his intentions with Holsworthy but also misled the members of this place when he told them that Badgerys Creek was his first priority. The truth is that he has only ever had one priority—one priority alone—and that is to build his airport at Holsworthy.But there is not only that—not only the misleading of people in the lead-up to the election; not only the misleading of the parliament on the announcement of the new EIS process—he then tries to treat the people of south-west Sydney as mugs. For him it is all a Monopoly game where he is playing with the pieces. He is playing around the board with the minister for science. He says, `Ill swap you a nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights for an international airport at Holsworthy. It is all a Monopoly board.But there are two other players at the board, and they are sitting just over there: the member for Hughes (Mrs Vale) and the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash). What is their role in this Monopoly game at the expense of people in south-west Sydney? They are sitting at the board picking up the Chance cards. They got the one that said, `Go to gaol; do not pass go; do not represent your electorate. That is their sole role in this tawdry affair within the Howard government.The member for Hughes was not even told about the EIS to be announced on 21 May. It was all news to her, not representing her electorate. I would bet my bottom dollar—not Monopoly money but real money—that the member for Gilmore was not told about this memo written in June 1996 foreshadowing the location of the new nuclear plant and facility at Jervis Bay in her electorate. There is something very interesting for the member for Gilmore. If you look at this document, you will see one page full of analysis, full of the things that you would have to be worried about, full of the things that are of concern, full of the political implications the government needs to consider. It goes on for hundreds and hundreds of words, but not once is there a reference to the member for Gilmore.She is a forgotten member in the ministerial wing of this place, as government staffers and government ministers work out the arrangements by which they are going to play Monopoly with land uses across New South Wales—swapping a nuclear reactor for an international airport. In all the political considerations that were mentioned in this particular memo out of the science ministers office, the member for Gilmore and people in her electorate do not get one single mention. She is as forgotten as the member for Hughes was on the issue of international airports.They are so ineffective, they are so hopeless, they have gone so far missing in action that government ministers and their staff did not even bother to mention them in this correspondence—not a consideration, not a concern to anyone. That is just so sad for the people in their electorates, because the people in Hughes and Gilmore are getting zero representation in this place. For them, they are just the pieces on the Monopoly board—`Trade away the nuclear reactor for the international airport. Put the nuclear reactor down to Jervis Bay. The memo makes mention of the plan: `Sell the land down at Badgerys Creek; put a house on it; put a hotel on it; sell the land at Bankstown airport; develop that for an industrial site.It is all a game for these arrogant ministers, played at the expense of people in the electorates of Hughes and throughout the south-west of Sydney, including my electorate and the electorate of Gilmore. The member and her constituents were not even mentioned in the consideration given to this matter in June 1996. It is an arrogant government. It is a deceitful government engaging in a disgraceful game at the expense of peoples lifestyles throughout south-west Sydney and down the south coast of New South Wales.What sort of government engages in these games while it is also breaking the law, while it is also breaking the due process of an EIS? What is the point in having an EIS at a public cost of $12 million if Badgerys Creek is dead—not dead today but dead almost 12 months ago, in June 1996, according to the ministers senior adviser? What is the point in the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) pretending in the Senate that he has some regard for the environmental and planning laws of the Commonwealth if staffers and ministers were telling each other in June 1996 that the process is a sham because Badgerys Creek is dead?Not only is this a government that treats people with contempt and all the arrogance of some dictatorship that just moves these facilities around with absolute disregard for due process; it is a government which is willing to disregard its own environmental and planning laws because, for an EIS to be proper and lawful, it must be fair and all the matters on its agenda must be considered.We have the science minister staffer saying the government should treat Holsworthy, Badgerys Creek and Lucas Heights as a package. But where is the environmental consideration in the EIS for relocating the nuclear facility? It is not there. It is not being untaken by the consultants. How seriously can anyone judge the findings of an EIS when we all know that back in June last year the transport minister and his staff were saying in the corridors of the ministerial wing that one of the options is dead and, de facto, will not be given due and proper consideration?This is an absolute sham on the laws of the parliament, on the integrity of the parliament and on the people, the families and the lifestyle in seats like Werriwa, Hughes and Gilmore. The arrogance of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to talk about honesty and integrity in public life when he so seriously misled people prior to the last election, when his ministers have been misleading this parliament on this issue and when his staffers and his ministers have, in the back rooms of this parliament, been subverting the EIS process to which the government should be bound to uphold! How can the Prime Minister talk about honesty and integrity when, as has been revealed today by the science minister, in June 1996 Badgerys Creek was dead in the water and the government never had any intention whatsoever of giving it proper consideration in the EIS process? How can the Prime Minister talk about family values? It is all right for the Howard family.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

I spoke only last night. Let me quote from last nights speech so that the member for Fremantle can hear and remember what was said:I use the time in this adjournment debate to categorically deny that the nuclear reactor will be relocated to Jervis Bay and to advise my constituents that this relocation is not and never has been on any agenda.The source of this malicious rumour is currently being investigated and I am sure it will soon come to light.As it has this afternoon. I continued:This rumour has caused a tremendous amount of angst in my electorate, especially amongst our Aboriginal community, for much of the area in question is of significance to them.Most of the Aboriginal community is based at Wreck Bay, part of Jervis Bay and of course the Fraser electorate. The balance of Jervis Bay is in my electorate of Gilmore. I do not believe that any government—I repeat: any government—would jeopardise this pristine icon of New South Wales and Australia. I certainly have not heard the opposition stating their views. Could it be that they have a hidden agenda? How much does it take to put this absolutely bizarre rumour to rest?

238,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mrs GASH","AK6","(Gilmore)","LP","N/A",2454,"—Do you wish to be continually ignorant? Another point I would like to make is the fact that the unique 30,000 hectares is part of the National Estate and controlled by the Aboriginal community—a fact so important that just recently the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, announced that that part of Jervis Bay would be renamed Booderee at the request of the Aboriginal leaders. Part of this National Estate includes Beecroft Peninsula, which is a landmark as a bombing range for the De fence base and has been for many years under both Labor and coalition governments.I ask: what sort of a ludicrous situation would it be to have a nuclear reactor and a bombing range anywhere near each other, not to mention a public camping ground in the middle? I am pleased to say that the other members of the community who have contacted me, including the local media, have treated it with the contempt that it deserves. I view this gossip with distaste and suspicion. I trust the media will also view it for what it is—a very, very sick joke. I sincerely hope that those who took it upon themselves to contact me have had their concerns allayed.However, to have the member for Fremantle bring it up again shows that the opposition is bent on continuing to create anxiety as a political ploy amongst those who live in my electorate of Gilmore. I regard this sort of behaviour as totally irresponsible. This government has not and never has had a proposal to relocate a nuclear reactor to Jervis Bay. Perhaps you would like me to stand here for the next five minutes repeating my lines like a school child over and over again. There has been no proposal. There will be no proposal.This government is totally committed to oceans and coasts. With our oceans policy, we will be delivering after one year in government what the ALP promised but did not do in 13 years. I remind the honourable member for Fremantle that when they were in government and had announced their coastal care program, did we ever see any of it in Jervis Bay? No, we did not. In those days it was a case of words speaking louder than actions.In contrast, this government has already spent in excess of $240,000 on coastal care programs in Gilmore, bushland restoration at Jervis Bay, erosion control on beaches, rehabilitation of the wetlands, regeneration of the creeks and bitou bush control as well. It will also spend another $60,000 for coastal watch and monitoring equipment for Jervis Bay—and this is only the start. No promises from this government—just action.This government promises a new start, a new start that will balance the needs of the environment with the needs of resource security and jobs for the people of Gilmore. This governments ocean policy will give Australia an integrated and strategic platform for the better management of our coasts and oceans and in so doing squashes totally—I repeat again—any suggestion of a nuclear reactor facility at Jervis Bay. In fact, the oceans policy will provide us with a basis for identifying opportunities and promoting economic development of our marine resources and gives us the means to conserve the natural environment of our oceans and to develop the industries and communities that they will support here in Gilmore.As time permits, I will give a brief overview of the Gilmore electorate so the member for Fremantle and the member for Fraser can accept the importance of these areas and in doing so understand the stupidity in persisting to raise this matter, knowing full well it can never happen.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start[6]/para","N/A","N/A"

241,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr CAMPBELL","CF4","(Kalgoorlie)","IND","N/A",2456,"—In speaking in this matter of public importance I must say that I find myself in agreement with many things said on both sides of the House. The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) talks about the enormous waste of time in this debate. Clearly he is right and clearly his government is equally guilty of that. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) talks about the arrogance of lack of consultation with the people. He is right and of course his party is equally guilty of that.I want to read a little history about this nuclear debate in Australia. Up until 1976, it was the policy of the Labor Party to mine, process and reprocess uranium. I know because I, foolishly at the time, was one of the people involved in changing that policy. I was in the Labor Party then when many on the front bench were not. Having achieved that change, I realised that Australia was irrelevant in the wider game and we had to stop nuclear energy in France if we were going to be successful.So I set off to France at my own expense and campaigned across France, standing up in picture theatres lecturing the crowds with my wife translating. I took the opportunity to look at the industry in both France and Britain and I realised that I was talking nonsense. I came back to Australia convinced that the nuclear industry was safe, it was environmentally friendly and it is was an industry which we should be looking at very seriously.When I am wrong, it is my habit to change my mind, not to go with the flow of a particular partys policy. To hear the member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) get up here and say that her electorate will be spared this great outrage, this great threat, is just puerile nonsense. What damage has Lucas Heights inflicted on the people in that area? The answer is none, and it would inflict none on yours, madam.I believe that politicians are not in this place to represent necessarily the views of their constituents; they are in this place, however, with an absolute obligation to let their constituents know exactly where they stand. I have always made it clear that I support the nuclear cycle. I would be quite happy to have these facilities in my electorate. In that, I believe I would be endorsed by most in my electorate, who I believe are somewhat stouter than appears to be the case with those on the east coast.The government, in looking for an alternative site, should probably look at South Australia. That state, under the policies of this and the previous government, has been devastated by the decimation of its manufacturing industry and sorely needs an industry such as this.Let us look at the record of the Liberal Party. In 1975 Malcolm Fraser had unprecedented power in this place. He had control of both this House with a massive majority and the Senate with a very large majority. Malcolm Fraser had the ability and the opportunity to change the Labor Partys stupid two&hyphen;mine policy. And did he do it? The answer is no, he did not. Malcolm Fraser could not even bring himself to allow contracts to be signed for sales from the existing mines. It took an incoming Labor government to overcome that stupidity.I was one of the people involved very heavily in lobbying for a three-mine policy. It was my view that, if we could get three mines up, the third mine being Roxby Downs, so ridiculous would the uranium policy be shown to be that the parliament would have to rescind it. Here we were saying that we were going to have three mines, with the capacity of the third mine, Roxby Downs, being larger than any other capacity in the rest of Australia and representing a substantial part of the worlds capacity. It was an enormous addition to our capacity.But the industry does not buy on capacity; it buys on security. Because it was a very large mine, it did not mean necessarily that we were going to sell any more and, further, the customer wanted diversity. Graham Richardson, I must say, did not get much right, and I think some of his judgments were very awry. However, I would say that his judgment was consistently better than Keatings, and he was right on uranium.The truth is that no party in this place can hold its head up on this issue. What did we see in respect of the French nuclear testing on Mururoa Atoll? We saw John Howard set off across this country a wave of revulsion against the French—mainly, again, on the east coast. But it was a wave of revulsion that John Howard knew had no basis in fact. He knew there was not one scintilla of evidence to show any threat to Australia from nuclear testing—not any evidence at all. Of course, there is no threat to Australia from French nuclear testing.It is ironic that the Chinese were testing bigger, dirtier bombs closer to us. But of course they escaped total censure, until the anomaly was drawn to the Prime Ministers attention and he meekly tacked China onto the back of his condemnation of the French. It was a political stunt. It was a stunt to try to raise the stature of the Liberal Party, just as John Howards performance on guns was an attempt to raise the stature of John Howard. He knows full well that nothing done in relation to that will have any bearing on the tragic events at Port Arthur.This country will one day embrace a nuclear industry; it will do it by necessity. It is quite clear that our neighbours, once armed with nuclear weapons, will force that alternative on us. We will have no alternative. It is nonsense to suggest otherwise. While Australia has massive energy resources, they are not evenly distributed. Parts of Australia are, in fact, energy poor.Technology exists in South Africa right now to develop very low output, fully automatic nuclear reactors; I am talking about reactors in the range of kilowatts. These could affect enormously the viability of many country towns and many industries in Australia. The pastoral industry in this country is being beaten absolutely into the ground, with the high cost of energy being one of the reasons. This may be a solution which we could be adopting. It is now known throughout the world that these things can be handled.Let us look at Chernobyl, the greatest crisis we have had. At the time it was the view of the Russians, and the view of the Left of the Labor Party, that nuclear energy was somehow safe if it was socialised nuclear energy. So confident were the Russians in their view of this that they had no protective vessels, no pressure vessels, around their reactors. It is also known—and I became aware of this when I chaired a delegation to Russia—that, on three occasions on the day that Chernobyl eventually blew up, they physically overrode three warnings in response to the centralised socialist demand for more power. That is why there was the problem there.But with Three Mile Island in the United States there was a very similar occurrence. What happened there? In terms of public damage, nothing. All radiation was contained within the pressure vessel. While the cost of the clean&hyphen;up probably took a couple of billion dollars, there was never at any stage any threat to the community.Nuclear energy, like everything else, has to be managed properly. If it is managed properly, it has the potential to reap great benefits for us. I believe that we are living in a time frame that will see nuclear energy itself made obsolete with the development of new technologies evolving with the direct conversion of sunlight. I think the titanium oxide conversion, rather than the silicone conversion, will bestow great benefits on us and be seen as a source of real power for the community. But there is clearly going to be a gap, and that gap can be filled very effectively by nuclear energy.Australia, which, under this government and the previous government, has continued to put itself in the hands of foreign treaties and foreign domination, is now being berated over greenhouse output. Mr Deputy Speaker, let me tell you and the people of Australia: there is no evidence for the greenhouse theory. We know that in times past—and I am talking about millennia past, thousands and thousands of years ago—the greenhouse levels were higher than they are now. I think it is a measure of mans arrogance that they think that mans puny efforts are going to cause the trauma that is being suggested. Every time a volcano explodes it probably does more than the combined effort of man since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.There is no evidence that greenhouse is the great threat, but there is a lot of pressure on Australia to conform to the so&hyphen;called greenhouse rulings. What it is in fact is an attempt by world powers to nobble Australia. It is an absolute outrage and I believe this government will be derelict in its duty if it in any way concedes or signs Australia to ratifying this greenhouse protocol.

242,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr DARGAVEL","KP6","(Fraser)","ALP","N/A",2458,"—The honourable member for Gilmore (Mrs Gash) said last night in response to this debate that members of her electorate are concerned about the prospect raised in relation to a nuclear reprocessing facility at Jervis Bay. She accused the opposition of maliciously spreading rumours and said that there should be an investigation into the origins of the rumours.If the member for Gilmore had bothered to listen to the opposition spokesperson for the environment, she would have learned the source of the rumour. It is actually from the government. The government were considering the political advantages of relocating the reactor, and the memo to Mr Peter McGauran says:There may be political advantages in making the relocation of the Lucas Heights facility an integral part of the Holsworthy airport package.So that is where the debate is coming from. To continue:The removal of the dangerous Lucas Heights reactor to a more suitable location would be welcomed by the Sutherland Shire. It may partly negate the negative impact of this new airport. There will be problems with finding a new site for the reactor but the possible use of Commonwealth land at Jervis Bay may be an option.So that is where the consideration has come from. It has actually come from the coalition government. For her to accuse the opposition of making things up—presumably after she had heard the presentation from the opposition in relation to this issue—seems to me to be rather odd.The member for Gilmore further said in relation to this issue that she contacted the Hon. Peter McGauran and the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, John Sharp, who immediately denied any know ledge of any supposed report or documentation and are on the public record as saying so. That is rather odd, when Mr McGauran has received a memorandum actively canvassing what is a very hot political issue—the establishment of a nuclear reprocessing plant in a national park as part of a repackaging of a deal over Holsworthy airport.I think it is tremendous that the government have backed down on this proposal, which is clearly politically and environmentally untenable. We are delighted that they have backed down, and I am pleased to finish my remarks at that point.","N/A","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

245,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Dr KEMP","BT4","(Goldstein—","LP","Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation)",2459,"—I move:That the bill be now read a second time.The government believes that the work for the dole initiative recently outlined by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) will have substantial benefits to the individual participants and the community.Since it was announced, the government has received strong public support for the work for the dole initiative. Many Australians believe that it is fair and reasonable that those being supported by the community should make a contribution in return. Young people themselves are also looking for ways to contribute positively to their communities.The value of the work for the dole initiative lies in bringing young unemployed people back into a work culture to help rebuild a work ethic. It will give young people a chance to engage with the community rather than being alienated from it.This bill would provide for the changes necessary to implement the governments work for the dole initiative in a way which is consistent with feedback the government has had from the community. At the same time the initiative is based firmly on the principle of mutual obligation: that it is fair and just that people receiving unemployment allowances be asked to make a contribution to their community in return.The government recognises that the work for the dole initiative is not a solution to youth unemployment and has not represented it as such. Real jobs can only be created by the government providing a business environment that secures our economic future. The governments strong but fair budget has put downward pressure on interest rates. Policies for small business will reduce the paperwork burden on businesses, and capital gains tax relief on the sale of businesses provides an incentive to small business owners to expand their businesses.The abolition of the previous governments unfair dismissal laws has removed a significant disincentive for businesses to take on new employees and it will encourage more productive labour relations.The government recognises that the particular disadvantages young people face in getting jobs are structural—the low skilled jobs that young people used to take on leaving school have gradually disappeared and those jobs that remain are increasingly being taken by older and more experienced job seekers. Fundamental reforms are necessary to deal with this to make sure that young people are better prepared when they enter the labour market. We need to strengthen the relationship between schools and the workplace to provide young people with the means to overcome these disadvantages.A number of recent government initiatives are already addressing these fundamental issues. These include the new national apprenticeship and traineeship system, our numeracy and literacy strategy to ensure that students acquire appropriate standards of competence in these areas and the introduction of incentives to complete vocational education courses through the jobs pathway program, which provides job placement assistance to those students who successfully complete vocational education courses in Year 11 and Year 12.The introduction of pilot work for the dole projects should also be seen in the broader context of the governments commitments to young Australians through the governments reforms to employment services, legislation for which is also currently before the parliament. Complementary strategies are also being put in place to address other important youth issues such as family breakdown, youth suicide and homelessness.The government considers the work for the dole initiative will combat the drift to despair and despondency felt by many unemployed young people. The government considers that young job seekers should be given the chance to add to their experience and prove their work ethic through participation in projects which are supported by the community and will be of lasting value to the community.Aim of the LegislationThe aim of this legislation is to establish the framework necessary for implementation of pilot work for the dole projects. In particular the bill would amend the Social Security Act 1991 to:remove provisions precluding measures to compel a person to work in return for the payment of unemployment allowance;enable a person to voluntarily participate in a programme of work which has been approved by the employment secretary or to be required to participate in such a programme;provide for participation in an approved programme of work to be included in newstart activity agreements;provide for an approved programme of work supplement of $20 per fortnight for participants.Amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 would also establish that participation in work for the dole would not give rise to an employer&hyphen;employee relationship for the purposes of the following acts:the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1991;the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988;the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992; orthe Workplace Relations Act 1996.While it is expected that participation in work for the dole projects would be largely voluntary, the bill provides that a person may be required to work in a programme of work approved by the employment secretary in return for the payment of unemployment allowance. A person may only be required to participate in a work for the dole project if they are in receipt of full rate unemployment allowance and there is no risk to personal health or any contravention of occupational health and safety laws.The government recognises that participants in work for the dole projects will incur additional costs. The bill provides that an extra $20 per fortnight be paid as a supplement to their unemployment allowance in recognition of the additional costs of participating in work for the dole projects.The government is cognisant of its international obligations. It has taken advice of the Attorney&hyphen;Generals Department that a work for the dole initiative should not contravene our international obligations, provided that the work offered under work for the dole is `suitable and reasonable for that person. The fact that payment of unemployment allowance is not based on any prior mandatory contribution, combined with the positive benefits of work for the dole for participants, means that the initiative should be regarded as reasonable in its requirement of a contribution to the community from participants.Pilot Work for the Dole projectsWithin the legislative framework, we envisage publicly seeking submissions across the whole of Australia. Submissions would be price competitive. Host organisations would be responsible for supervision, essential training, any transportation costs to work sites, minor personal equipment and required clothing such as safety boots or clothing necessary for public contact situations. Appropriate insurance coverage will be arranged.Regions with highest levels of youth unemployment would be the focus of the pilots, with an emphasis on non&hyphen;metropolitan regions. About 50 pilot projects would be allocated to these identified regions, with about another 20 projects available to ensure that quality projects from anywhere could be approved having regard to the need for broad geographic coverage during the pilot phase.The government is targeting regional Australia in the pilot stage for many reasons, not the least of which is because our rural communities perhaps best illustrate the disastrous results of thirteen years of Labors economic mismanagement. All communities have witnessed the fabric of our Australian society unravel under Labor. Initiatives such as `work for the dole are important steps towards repairing the damage of the previous government.Pilot work for the dole projects would be for a minimum of three and a maximum of 12 months duration. They would be selected on the basis of criteria which would include:the needs of the local unemployed young people;the capacity of the sponsor to monitor and maintain the project;the extent of contribution and support for the project from the local community;the quality of community involvement; andpreparedness of the community to support the participants after completion of their placement.A primary test would be the benefit of the project to the wider community and not to a private sector interest. A committee including independent experts, individuals who are well known in the community and committed to the initiative, would be involved in the final selection of projects. The aim is to have about 10,000 places in the pilot work for the dole projects—with the first expected to start in September 1997. There would be no minimum size for projects.Referral to projects would as far as possible be voluntary, with the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency and the project spon sor advertising the availability of projects. If the response from volunteers did not provide enough participants, the CSDA would identify and notify eligible clients that they were to be compulsorily referred. Within certain limits, project sponsors would be given a degree of choice in relation to the selection of participants for particular projects.Participants in the work for the dole pilots would primarily be 18- to 24-year-olds who have been unemployed for at least six months. However, priority would be given to those unemployed for over 12 months who were not in case management or employment assistance and not likely to be referred to these within six months.In some locations there may be some flexibility regarding the age and duration of unemployment of participants, especially where there were insufficient numbers of young people to fill projects. In addition, some projects would benefit significantly from including older job seekers to help supervise younger participants and pass on expertise.Based on averaged national training wage award level C rates, participants would work for two six-hour days if aged 18 to 20 years and 2&half; six-hour days if aged 21 years or over. They would be required to participate for a maximum of six months each.Participants in the initiative requiring child care would be able to use existing child-care arrangements for labour market program participants so as not to disadvantage participants with children requiring care.The work for the dole initiative is not designed to artificially manipulate the measured rate of youth unemployment. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has advised that it is unlikely that the initiative would have a noticeable impact on youth unemployment statistics.The initiative is different from the previous governments programs in that participants would continue to receive their unemployment allowance payments and would still be required to look for work. However, in recognition of the time spent on the work for the dole initiative, job search requirements for participants would be reduced to the minimum Department of Social Security requirement of two employer contacts per fortnight.The existing standard unemployment allowance provisions of compliance and breaching arrangements would also apply to the work for the dole initiative. In line with existing arrangements, `clean slate provisions would be adopted whereby if a person who is subject to an activity test or administrative breach agrees to a work for the dole placement, their payment would be reinstated from the time of their commencement on the initiative.Pilot work for the dole projects would be evaluated to assess the impact of the initiative on young people and to assist consideration of expansion of the initiative beyond the pilot stage, including the scope for expanding into different regions. A first report of the evaluation will provide a basis for decision making in the 1998-99 budget.I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.Debate (on motion by Mr Latham ) adjourned.","N/A","SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (WORK FOR THE DOLE) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The 1st Brigade is currently being relocated to increase the defence presence in northern Australia. The relocation will be completed by the year 2000. New facilities for the brigade are being provided under the $530 million army presence in the north project at Robertson Barracks, about 20 kilometres east of Darwin city. To date, some 1,200 of the 2,300 members of the brigade have moved to Darwin. Expenditure to date on the Robertson Barracks project is some $275.64 million.In developing this proposal, defence has worked closely with Environment Australia and the Northern Territorys Department of Lands, Planning and Environment. Both of these organisations support the defence project, particularly the way in which environmental issues and consultation is being managed.Bradshaw field training area is located about 600 kilometres by road from the brigades barracks in Darwin. The property is currently developed to support beef cattle production. In order to develop it as a field training area, the following infrastructure is required: a bridge over the Victoria River in the vicinity of Timber Creek; working accommodation for the range control organisation; living and working accommodation for the range managers; communications facilities; an internal road network; two 500 person camps; vehicle crossing points over creeks and rivers; two C130 capable air fields; and vehicle wash points.

259,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr SOMLYAY","ZT4","(Fairfax)","LP","N/A",2464,"—by leave—On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I have presented reports Nos 349 and 350, which relates to the first quarter. These are the first reports arising from the JCPAs new public hearing based review procedures. These two reports do not attempt to analyse in detail all of the audit findings and recommendations. Instead, they draw attention to the key issues discussed at the hearings and highlight any commitments given by witnesses.Having said that, may I turn now to Report 349: Review of Auditor&hyphen;Generals reports 1995&hyphen;96 . Three public hearings were held in order to take evidence on the 14 reports selected by the JCPA for closer scrutiny. Among the reports listed is Audit Report No. 28 1995&hyphen;96: Jindalee operational radar network project: Department of Defence . After considering the evidence taken in relation to audit report No. 28 on the JORN project, the JCPA decided that the issues canvassed in the audit report warranted further examinations as part of a full and separate inquiry. The inquiry is currently still under way and will be reported separately, probably in the 1997 autumn sittings.In regard to the remaining audit reports, further examination of the issues involved resulted in six recommendations contained in report No. 349. I would draw particular attention to recommendation 1, in which the JCPA seeks amendments to the Cabinet Handbook so that any potential liabilities to which the Commonwealth may be exposed as a result of action being recommended in a cabinet submission or discussed in a cabinet memorandum are clearly identified and costed.This recommendation arose from the public hearing into Audit Report No. 14 1995&hyphen;96: The sale of CSL , Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, when the committee discovered that the then Minister for Health had been provided with verbal briefings only prior to committing to the arrangements underpinning the sale of CSL. Consequently, the Commonwealth incurred an uncapped liability in relation to a number of potential claims.The committee considers that it is totally unsatisfactory for departmental officials to enter into substantial agreements on behalf of the Commonwealth without written ministerial consent or approval. There needs to be an appropriate paper trail so that accountability and probity questions may be answered.The JCPA is pleased that recently the Department of Health and Family Services has been successfully investigating commercial insurance arrangements in relation to CSL indemnities. The committee supports such initiatives and considers that greater incentive and flexibility to consider risk retention and risk transfer in relation to the Commonwealths exposures will result in greater accountability in public agencies.In its third public hearing for 1995-96 audit reports, the JCPA focused on the client service programs. Announcements made in the 1996-97 budget impacted significantly on the programs and methods of service delivery, which were the subject of six audit reports being examined at that public hearing. The committee therefore decided to review the programs in light of future changes so that relevant departments and agencies take client service needs and accountability into consideration when implementing the budget changes.One concern which emerged during this public hearing was the difficulty experienced by ANAO officers in gaining audit access to information from third-party providers of client service programs. Although the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill 1996, which is currently before the parliament, provides the Auditor-General with unfettered powers to obtain any information required to fulfil audit functions, this power would be enhanced considerably if it were specifically referred to in contracts between the Commonwealth and third-party providers.Recommendation 6 in report No. 349 therefore urges the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs—when establishing contracts with private sector employment placement agencies—to include contract provisions which make explicit the Auditor-Generals statutory authority to obtain information from third-party service providers.It is clear that much work needs to be done by DEETYA and DSS, within a relatively short time frame, to ensure that integrated and contractually sound performance measurement and monitoring systems are in place for the introduction of the employment placement market. The committee believes that it has played a part in ensuring that both departments are fully aware of the need to incorporate accountability requirements into the management arrangements they are drafting for the new programs. A response to this recommendation is urgent, and I would ask the government to respond positively and quickly so that these accountability measures can be put in place without delay.I now turn to the 1996-97 audit reports. Two reports of the Auditor-General were the focus of the first quarterly public hearing for 1996-97. These were Audit Report No. 5 1996&hyphen;97: Accounting for aid: the management of funding to non-government organisations and Audit Report No. 6 1996&hyphen;97: Commonwealth guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort . Report 350 focuses on the main issues raised during the public hearing.The JCPA notes the audit finding in the audit report No. 5 that AusAIDs regime for the management of funding to NGOs is generally of a high standard and that aspects of the management framework are at the leading edge of international best practice. The committee is reassured by AusAIDs advice that evaluation and audit activities will continue as a check on the new performance reports particularly provided by the NGOs. The JCPA awaits with interest the Simons review of the overall priorities, objectives and focus of the Australian aid program and, in particular, the findings of the review in relation to the role of NGOs in the delivery of Australian aid.The report contains two recommendations for further action in relation to Audit Report No. 6 1996-97: Commonwealth guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort . The recommendations in audit report No. 6 are designed to improve agency awareness and management. In order to encourage agencies to focus on a responsibility that most chief executive officers have been neglecting, the JCPA recommends that the Department of Finance seek statements from agencies on the steps they have taken to address each relevant recommendation in audit report No. 6.The JCPA considers that the current state of reporting on liabilities is clearly deficient and recommends that full statements of off balance sheet liabilities associated with guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort should be a mandatory inclusion in annual financial statements of departments.I am confident that our new review and reporting procedures will result in more timely and effective parliamentary examination of audit reports, and that this will be to the benefit of all parties involved: the parliament, the ANAO and audited agencies. The JCPA looks forward to receiving the governments response to its reports.I conclude by thanking all those who contributed their time and expertise to the JCPAs round of scrutiny hearings between July and October 1996, upon which these two reports are based. The JCPA has been appreciative of the full cooperation it has received from the people involved. I also commend the secretariat staff of the JCPA, who have fulfilled their task with their usual efficiency. I commend the reports to the House.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
260,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr GEORGIOU","HM5","(Kooyong)","LP","N/A",2466,"—by leave—Occasionally some people are tempted to regard reports of parliamentary committees as being a step removed from the main game of government. This temptation is increased when a committee reports on an examination of other reports. However, a great deal of the parliaments work is done by its committees, and the Joint Committee of Public Accounts reports Nos. 349 and 350 are cases in point. They are the first arising from the committees new public hearing based review process which provides for speedier examination of ANAO reports and subsequent report to the parliament.Obviously, in the time allotted I cannot go through the detail of all 16 reports considered by the committee, but I would like to touch briefly on a few of the issues which indicate the importance and, I believe, the effectiveness, of the committees review process.Firstly, the committees examination of the report on the Jindalee Operational Radar Network found significant but unspecified time and cost overruns, as well as continued uncertainty about final delivery. It was the public hearing process that generated a further JCPA inquiry into JORN, designed to shed further light on this project. The inquiry is still on foot.Secondly, the JCPAs examination in September of a number of reports covering client services delivered by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs brought to notice the somewhat dismissive response of DEETYA to the recommendations by the ANAO. By adopting such an approach, DEETYA ignored valid criticisms of operating procedures which, indeed, surfaced again in its own evaluation material later on. The committees pursuit of this issue at the public hearing and the discussion of it in report No. 349 will, I believe, in future discourage any similarly dismissive responses from departments to what are carefully considered recommendations on the part of the Auditor&hyphen;General.Finally, following its examination of the report on the sale of CSL and the reports on Commonwealth guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort, the committee noted serious deficiencies in estimation of and reporting on potential Commonwealth exposures from these, and it highlighted its concerns about the management of the Commonwealths exposure.The inclusion of recommendation 1 in report No. 350 calling on the Department of Finance to seek up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date statements from all agencies with guarantees and indemnities is, I believe, further evidence of the importance of the JCPAs review of the Auditor&hyphen;Generals reports in monitoring the activities of the executive and reporting to the parliament.I would like to share the thanks of the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) to the people who cooperated in the reviews, especially the secretariat. I commend the reports to the House.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
261,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mrs STONE","EM6","(Murray)","LP","N/A",2466,"—by leave—I rise to support the tabling of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts reports Nos. 349 and 350. Our committee chairman, the member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) has already referred to the key recommendations of report No. 349. They were echoed by the member for Kooyong ((Mr Georgiou). The key recommendation in report No. 349 calls for the amendment of the Cabinet Handbook to ensure that agencies clearly identify and cost any potential liabilities when preparing costings information for cabinet submissions. In the time available, I will also comment on some of the other significant findings of the audit reports, and the committees deliberations which informed the key recommendation I have just referred to.For example, the findings of audit report No. 7, which looked at the financial management of the Department of Veterans Affairs, had clear implications for all Commonwealth agencies. In particular, they showed the need to educate program managers in the importance of financial management in program administration. They also clearly indicated the need to develop improved financial management training. The audit also identified that the Department of Veterans Affairs needed more user orientated financial management systems, and that barriers needed to be broken down between the corporate services and program delivery areas. This is particularly important, given that the Commonwealth is moving towards an accrual accounting environment. In such an environment, managers will be held to account more directly for the full cost of service provision, not just the cash costs.The Joint Committee of Public Accounts commended the ANAO production of a profile of best practice financial management objectives and practices in its report No. 7, 1995&hyphen;96. The committee recommended that such advice and guidance should be promulgated widely.In reviewing audit report No. 19, 1995&hyphen;96, which dealt with the management of small and medium&hyphen;sized overseas posts, the Joint Public Accounts Committee supported the ANAOs call for cost transparency. Once again, looking at that issue was most significant. Such transparency would, we believe, enable the Commonwealth to better assess the resource impact of decisions more accurately. Such transparency depends, of course, on initially agreed costing methodology. We recommended that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, together with Austrade, the ANAO and the Department of Finance, should develop such an agreed methodology.I will turn very briefly to some of the important findings and recommendations in report No. 350. In particular, in audit report No. 6, 1996&hyphen;97, we considered Commonwealth guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. This report followed a hearing at which evidence was taken from numerous government agencies, as well as from the ANAO, on recording, management and reporting, as well as the level of risk exposure to federal government through guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort. We discovered that the governments exposure through these instruments amounts to many billions of dollars. The results of this inquiry have led to a number of very significant recommendations.These have already been referred to by the committee chairman and by the member for Kooyong. The committee in particular was concerned that there was no central or uniform system for registration of these indemnities in each department. Furthermore, there were clear deficiencies in the reporting of these exposures. The JCPA therefore strongly supports audit recommendations 1 and 2 which concern steps to be taken to ensure this situation is urgently addressed. I commend these reports to the House. They contain recommendations of great significance to the nation.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
262,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr VAILE","SU5","(Lyne)","NP","N/A",2467,"—by leave—I want to support the previous speakers in recommending to the House these two reports from the JCPA—hopefully in the not too distant future to become the JCPAA. The reports are No. 349, Review of Auditor&hyphen;Generals Reports 1995&hyphen;96 , and No 350, Review of Auditor&hyphen;Generals Reports 1996&hyphen;97—First Quarter .I just want to make a quick comment on two issues that arose while preparing these two reports. When we reviewed the Auditor&hyphen;Generals reports for 1995&hyphen;96, we came across a very interesting circumstance where $40 million worth of taxpayers and levy payers money had been lost in an abortive project called Fututech. This project was operated by the board of the MRC which, following the announcement of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) yesterday, will no longer exist in that form.The point I want to raise is that the day when public servants can come before a parliamentary committee, where they have been found wanting in their management, put their hands up, plead guilty and expect absolution should be gone. I think we are living in an age of transparency and accountability. That is what this committee of this parliament exists for, and I do not think this committee or this parliament should accept that as an excuse for some of the practices that have been undertaken.I highlight that in this exercise, because there was $40 million—$20 million of taxpayers funds and $20 million of levy payers funds—lost. The funds disappeared into the sand and all we got from the representatives of the MRC was yes, they were guilty, and they expected absolution. In clause 3.39 of the report, the JCPA says:While the JCPA appreciates the candour of the MRC witnesses in admitting to the Boards serious errors of judgement, and recognises that the MRC seems to have learned the lessons of the failure of the project, it was, nevertheless, a $40 million failure for which the MRC Board is responsible.It is not acceptable for anyone to put their hand up and say, `Yes, Im guilty, because those public servants can walk away from that loss. It is not a loss out of their pocket. It is a loss for a lot of the hardworking taxpayers of Australia and, more importantly as far as I am concerned, a lot of the primary producers in this country that pay those levies.Hopefully, under the new arrangements that are going to be put in place by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, that situation will not arise again, but it should be brought to the attention of this parliament that this committee is going to hold these public servants to account for the decisions that they make. No longer can they expect, as they have always done in the past, to be able to walk away from their mistakes. We will continue to hold them to account in this place.Contained in report No. 350, which I want to mention in regard to accountability and transparency, is a report on Audit Report No. 6, Commonwealth Guarantees, Indemnities and Letters of Comfort . As we have found in previous reports that we have done on Commonwealth agencies, this area is left wanting. If we were to ask the Department of Finance to give us a clear indication in dollar terms of the Commonwealths exposure in this area of letters of comfort and indemnities, it could not tell us. If you went to individual agencies and asked the chief executive officer of those agencies for an indication of the Commonwealths exposure, they could not tell us. That is not good enough in this day and age. We as members of the JCPA, and certainly all members of this parliament, should expect better from the professional managers of our departments and agencies that are operating on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia. Again, it is an area that this committee will continue to pursue until things have improved.Finally, in public hearings we continually get evidence from professional officers from these departments, particularly the central agencies, and when we continually ask about the progress of accrual accounting and reporting we keep getting fobbed off. That is not satisfactory, and the challenge is before the government today to try to expedite the implementation of that much needed accounting procedure within all departments and agencies of the Commonwealth.","N/A","COMMITTEES","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/debate.sub1/debate.sub2/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

265,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr TIM FISCHER","DG4","(Farrer—","NP","Minister for Trade)",2469,"—The Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997 represents a targeted approach to assisting Australian exporters in a fiscally responsible way and is a boost for the tourism industry, which will see full rate of EMDG for the first time. The measures introduced in this bill squarely focus the scheme on small and medium enterprises as they enter export markets. I thank all members who have participated in the debate which is moving through to the second reading amendment, which the government opposes, and the consideration in detail stage. I have taken careful note of the contributions made in the debate last night and again today.I advise the House that the government will further examine the issue of trusts in respect of this legislation. I am not in a position to provide a concluded view on this matter for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the Senate committee report on this legislation. The matter was the subject of deliberation before a Senate committee only last Monday and the report is not yet available, but I expect it to be available later this week. If the governments examination of trusts leads to a variation of its position—taking into account consultations with parliament as well as with export industry and the submissions which have been variously made—this would obviously obviate the need to proceed with regard to the issue of retrospectivity. In any event, on the question of retrospectivity, governments frequently—and the convention has been long established—provide announcements in the budget which are backdated to the start of the financial year. I acknowledge that a particular view has been submitted on the question of trusts by the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and other members in the debate. I give an undertaking to the House that the government will examine those issues.I thank the other members who participated, including the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) for his longstanding interest in the scheme, the member for Paterson (Mr Bob Baldwin) with his emphasis on small business and the members for Griffith (Mr McDougall), Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) and Fadden (Mr Jull) with their emphasis on the tourism industry and the big advantages contained in the bill for this industry. I have referred to the members for Curtin and Perth and I thank them for the spirit of their contribution. I note particularly their comments on trusts. The members for Blaxland (Mr Hatton), Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), Maribyrnong (Mr Sercombe), Chifley (Mr Price), Isaacs (Mr Wilton), Barton (Mr McClelland) and Lyons (Mr Adams) provided general criticisms, many of them also covering the issue of trusts.The member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) went on to deal with another matter. I am sorry he has just stepped out, but I have discussed this informally with him. He criticised the fact that I had been overseas 13 times as Minister for Trade. Let me tell you that I have screwed down the amount of overseas travel; you could be overseas every week of the year as Minister for Trade. I have micro&hyphen;managed it. Indeed, I had not been out of the country for three months prior to this most recent visit to the Middle East.If the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for trade have now reached a concluded view and are supporting the member for Reid that the Minister for Trade should not travel, well, I take note of that particular view, and I am interested to know whether the member for Perth endorses the criticisms of the member for Reid on the general point that he made.On the specific point, the frequent flyer points are, of course, available to ease the budgetary circumstances associated with the travel. My costings have in fact been comparable with, and in some categories lower than, those of my predecessor, the member for Canberra (Mr McMullan) and, frankly, with a young family, I do not want to be out of this country one day longer than is necessary. I have a job to do and I will represent this country fully, and full on when that is required in the overseas setting as well as back in Australia.It has been a carefully balanced set of programs requiring, obviously, attendance at APEC and World Trade Organisation meetings and reaching out in other directions— such as in South America and chairing the Cairns Group. If someone can devise a way of further cutting it back, I would be pleased to hear of a solution—","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[1]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

On the cap: this is a matter which has been dealt with in the appropriation bill. It is a budget decision and reflects the need to close up the deficit, which I strongly support. It has provided the framework for lower interest rates and this is the fairest possible way of administering the cap in respect of the scheme, a matter already decided in the appropriation bill of the parliament.Finally, I reiterate that there is a need to tighten up, streamline and simplify and there is a good deal of gain to be obtained from the process of simplification which is delivered by this legislation as well. I commend the bill to the House. I commend particularly the advantages to the tourism industry.

269,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr STEPHEN SMITH","5V5","(Perth)","ALP","N/A",2471,"—I have 39 amendments listed for the Export Market Development Grants Bill and two amendments listed for the Export Market Development Grants (Repeal and Consequential Provisions) Bill. It might assist the House if I indicated how it has been agreed to deal with those so that members can be aware of the order in which those amendments will be discussed and also when they can expect divisions.The amendments essentially fall into four categories, firstly in respect of trusts, about which the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) made some comments in summing up the second reading debate. I will refer to that in more detail later. They go, secondly, to the proposed capping of the scheme; thirdly, to the range of export activity which is proposed to no longer be eligible under the scheme; and, fourthly, to elements of retrospectivity.They are conveniently found. Clauses 1 to 10 deal with trusts, clauses 11 to 53 deal with the eligibility categories, clause 54 deals with trusts and clauses 55 to 107 deal with the capping aspect of the bill. In due course I will request two divisions by way of symbolism, if nothing else. In respect of the eligibility categories, I will propose that we divide over proposed new division 2A. In respect of the capping nature of the scheme, I will propose that we divide over my amendment to clause 61.I would have called a division in relation to the proposed treatment of trusts under the bill but I will not on the basis of the undertaking given on behalf of the government by the Minister for Trade to examine that issue in light of the representations made by industry associations and groups and exporters before the Senate hearing earlier this week and in light of the contributions made in this House. In light of that undertaking, which I have absolutely no qualm will be respected and genuinely pursued, I do not propose to call a division on that issue, although I will make some comments that I regard as pertinent.At the outset it is important to make the general comment that this bill was put out for exposure on 16 December last year. It was the subject of some 180 submissions. It has now been the subject of a public hearing before the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, with some 40-odd submissions in written form and a range of associations and companies appearing before it. If we synthesise those industry responses, we clearly find that a significant industry and exporting company concern is in the areas that the opposition has struck upon by way of its second reading amendment and also by way of the consideration in detail amendments that I have listed and referred to.Industry and exporters are massively unhappy about the $150 million cap. They are massively unhappy about the exclusion of the previously eligible expenditure items and, in particular, that goes to the restriction of airfares overseas to two years rather than eight years. They are also particularly unhappy about retrospective aspects of the bill. I think it is fair to say—and the minister acknowledged this—they go to the heart of the trusts issue.Some of the organisations who have made submissions include the Australian Publishers Association, the Australian Information Industries Association, the Australian Institute of Export, New South Wales branch and Western Australian branch, the Australian Business Chamber, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and a number of companies adversely affected by the proposals—Pureharvest, Mediherb and G. W. Lucas and Sons, who have particular issues worth noting.The weight of the submissions is appropriately summarised by an article in the Australian yesterday headed `Exporters condemn bid to cut assistance—a report which resulted from the public hearing earlier this week. I think that reflects the industry view.So far as the trusts issue is concerned, the fact that the minister has agreed to review this particular issue and the retrospective elements attached to it indicate that this was far and away the most pernicious and most unfair of all of the measures that the government proposed in the bill. (Extension of time granted) I move opposition amendments Nos.1 and 2:(1) Clause 6, page 4 (after line 22), after paragraph (1)(g) insert:(h) a trustee of a trust estate which has been accepted for the purposes of the payment of grants under the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 ;(2) Clause 10, page 10 (line 29), at the end of subclause (5) add:except in so far as the export earnings were gained by that person as a trustee of a trust estate as provided for by paragraph (6)(1)(h).On the question of the trusts and the matter of retrospectivity, the very unfair aspect is that while the budget was announced on 20 August last year with the consequences here to take effect from 1 July, the minister announced only on 16 December that trusts would be excluded. That goes beyond the comment that the minister made in his second reading speech about budget measures applying retrospectively. The trusts aspect was not part of the budget announcement and is particularly pernicious as a consequence.A range of companies have made representations, which the minister would be aware of—Crommelin Chemicals from Western Australia, Mediherb from Queensland, Pureharvest and G. W. Lucas and Sons from Victoria. There are a couple of submissions that struck me as being particularly pertinent. One was a submission by South Pacific Reef Pty Ltd which stated:In the current financial year, our company continued to promote aggressively, and, in good faith, budgeted for EMDG support under legislation in force at that time. In fact, our decision to participate in the forthcoming HOFEX `97 trade fair, was influenced largely by our eligibility to claim EMDG for these costs. The attached copy of correspondence from Austrade, dated 4th October 1996, specifically mentions the potential eligibility of such expenses under the EMDG scheme.Here we have a company which is being actively encouraged to go to a trade fair in Hong Kong in May of this year and by a letter dated 4 October 1996 Austrade included the comment that these costs plus additional costs may be claimable under the EMDG scheme. So the company relies upon those representations by Austrade. This legislation would have the effect of rendering the company ineligible under the scheme.The other point I thought was particularly worthy of making, because it seizes upon the question of the method of incorporation, was from Cochlear Implants International Pty Ltd, again, in a submission to the Senate hearing. The submission states:One which is of specific interest to Cochlear Implants International is the proposed non acceptance of Trusts for EMDG eligibility. This is of great concern to our Company.Cochlear Implants International Trust was established to ensure that profits from the Trust would benefit a dedicated charity. In the case of Cochlear Implants International, the directors of the Trust have agreed the charity dedicated is the EAR Foundation, a Foundation established and founded by myself at the University of Sydney. The EAR Foundation is directing all funds raised to benefit the Childrens Cochlear Implants Centre in Sydney.. . . . . . . . .N/ACochlear Implants International would no longer be eligible for an Export Market Grant. This would inhibit our growth and exclude many hearing impaired children in Asia from the opportunity to learn to hear and speak.The cochlear implant has been revolutionary to deaf children and adults.Here you have a trust where the intent of the trust is essentially beneficial, yet this trust would, as a range of other trusts I referred to would, be excluded retrospectively. I have no difficulty with the government determining that a particular method of incorporation is appropriate for this scheme or that scheme, but if you are going to go down that path then you should do it in the general and you should not do it retrospectively.I notice a letter from the minister to Don Lazzaro of Pureharvest dated 7 February said:The current rules addressing trusts are difficult to understand and administer. Excluding trusts reduces the number of complex rules in the Scheme and simplifies claim assessment procedures as trust structures sometimes obscure the underlying business arrangements.I will be gentle because the minister has engaged in good spirit in saying that he will review this; but if, as the Register of Members Interests disclose, a trust vehicle is good enough for the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran), the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser), the Minister for Veterans Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott), the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and the Minister for Trade himself, then it ought to be good enough not to retrospectively render trusts ineligible for EMDG.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
270,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr OCONNOR","WU5","(Corio)","ALP","N/A",2473,"—I rise to support the amendments that have been proposed to this legislation by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), the shadow minister for trade. This set of amendments is designed specifically to improve this legislation. That is the function of an opposition: to support a very successful scheme whose success has been well documented.It is the role of an opposition to propose amendments that have general support of industry and that are going to improve this legislation over time. This is a very important program of support to exporters throughout this nation and I am disappointed that the government, after making an electoral promise not to tamper with this scheme and to support it in its current form as it was before the election, went back on that particular promise.In this debate it is very important to gain an appreciation of the rapid transformation that occurred in the Australian economy over the period of the 1980s and the 1990s. I refer specifically to the growth in the trade of elaborately transformed manufactures. Since 1985 we have seen a growth in real ETM exports of 14.5 per cent per annum. This represents a rather staggering growth and is an indication of the structural shifts that have occurred in the Australian economy over the past 15 years.Indeed, the latest export figures for manufactured goods are contained in a Financial Review article of 28 February 1997. In that article some statistics are referred to which give us an indication of the size of that increase. The latest export figures for manufactured goods show that they grew to 22 billion in 1995-96. That represents 31 per cent of total exports, which is up from 19 per cent 10 years before. So there has been a huge increase in the exports of elaborately transformed manufactures, and we have to look for clues as to why this spectacular growth has occurred.Let me refer to a paper that was prepared by the Centre for Strategic Economic Studies at Victoria University, Melbourne. The article is entitled `The rebirth of Australian industry: Australian trade in elaborately transformed manufactures from 1979 to 1993. That article identified four specific reasons for our having seen this massive increase in the export of elaborately transformed manufactures.There has been a sharp and sustained reduction in costs. Of course, that, over the 1980s and 1990s, reflected the benefits to the Australian economy that had been achieved by the previous Labor government. The second factor was an expansion of world import demand. The third was a positive change in Australias attitude to competitiveness and to exporting. And this is a very important point: the fourth reason was specific policies targeting export growth.Part of those specific policies targeting export growth is the scheme that is now before the House and which is the subject of the amendments which have been proposed by the honourable member for Perth. The study had this to say:There is clear evidence that many of the industry specific policies designed to boost the export orientation of various sectors have played an important part in improving ETM trade.So I am very disappointed that the government, after making a promise to Australian industry and to many regional firms throughout the length and breadth of Australia, have gone back on that promise and forced us, as an opposition, into the position of proposing this plethora of amendments to give a bit more relevance to the scheme as it has been proposed in this legislation.It is a very good scheme, one that has worked and one in which the gains to Australian industry and the Australian economy have been well documented. It is not a scheme that ought to be tampered with. It is one of the more successful schemes. I think the amendments that we are debating now and that have been proposed by the honourable member for Perth ought to be supported by all members of the House.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

272,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr WILTON","YK6","(Isaacs)","ALP","N/A",2474,"—In my submission on this matter I referred to a company in Victoria by the name of G. W. Lucas and Son. It is a family firm which has, in the course of two years, increased its exports of circular sawmills and mechanical lifting devices from 85,000 to around one million and which, as I said today, has been on the receiving end of this governments clawback approach. The companys reward and encouragement from this government is that it will no longer be eligible to receive an export market development grant under this new legislation.The so-called Lucas Mill was developed in March 1994. Since then, the company has sold over 1,000 mills. At the moment it manufactures 12 sawmills a week, each valued at $124,000, and 60 per cent of these are exported to markets worldwide. Of course, as I have just outlined, the company is increasing export sales on an ongoing annual basis.The companys three major areas of concern are: firstly, the exclusion of the expenses of an applicant if they were incurred in the capacity of a trustee of a trust estate; secondly, the fact that patent registration no longer is an eligible expense; and, thirdly, that airfares are only eligible for the first two grant years.Mr Deputy Speaker, I will take you briefly though those points one by one. For example, in terms of the trust matter, if G. W. Lucas was no longer eligible for EMDG due to its trust structure, it would mean that in this case there would probably be a fall in export sales, and its direct staffing levels could fall as low as six or seven per cent. This was said by Ms Jennifer Lucas, the companys managing director, in a letter to the member for Franklin, Mr Quick, dated 10 February this year. So these staffing levels could fall as low as six or seven per cent, not to mention the 250&hyphen;odd other Australian companies that receive work from this company.This company has just received its CE approval—its European Community occupational health and safety approval—which is recognised as the worlds highest standard of safety. It is the first sawmill of its type in the world to have received this approval, which can only add to its exporting success.On its concern about the patent question—that is, patent registration no longer being an eligible expense—can I say on behalf of this company that, due to lack of financial assistance of the EMDG, it will be unable to pursue export sales into as many countries as it would like to. Its patent attorney estimates that patents in new markets will cost it in excess of $140,000. This does not include, of course, ongoing patent costs.If the company attends international trade shows and exhibits its Lucas Mill and has sales into a country where it has no patent protection, the danger is that its product is then no longer unique and can be copied in that market and possibly other unprotected markets. The company can understand if the EMDG did not wish to be seen to be financially contributing to the value of the product, but when the patent costs are ongoing and not just one initial payment it then disadvantages products that are unique to export markets and reduces potential export earnings for Australia.On the third and final point—the question of airfares being eligible for EMDG arrangements only for the first two grant years—the company has put to the member for Franklin that the best method for export sales of the Lucas Mill is to attend international trade shows, which allow working demonstrations for its machine and exposure to international travellers. This is a costly but very effective exercise and assists the company to establish agents worldwide. Therefore, by allowing airfares to be eligible only for the first two grant years, there is no possible way that this company can adequately cover the countries worldwide in that time span. In the past it has been disadvantaged because it is a family company and all six members of the company work full time within the business. Current legislation has allowed the company to claim only one family members airfare and visit allowance when family members travelled to exhibit at trade shows, since the business had not been operating for five years at the time of the claims.This is one of many companies that has certainly received the cold shoulder from this government over its EMDG cuts. I urge the government to consider these amendments in light of the first&hyphen;hand experience this company is submitting to the parliament this evening and to reconsider in good faith the fact that to exist and export and develop markets that are beneficial to the Australian economy these companies need to export and need the benefits of the EMDG arrangements.Amendments negatived.Clauses agreed to.Clauses 11 to 38—by leave—taken together.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
273,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr STEPHEN SMITH","5V5","(Perth)","ALP","N/A",2475,"—These clauses deal with the question of eligible categories of export expenditure and the removal from the export market development grants scheme of a range of export enhancing activity. I have circulated amendments Nos 3 to 9, which at the conclusion of this part of the debate I will seek leave to deal with together.This is the second area of substantial consternation, concern and opposition by not just this side of the House but industry itself. This goes to the removal of patent registration, overseas buyer visits, foreign language training, international business education courses, export packaging and labelling, designs, tenders and quotations, free technical information and airfares being restricted to eligible expenditure for two years only. That is the range of export activity which the government proposes, through its bill, to remove as eligible export activity. In answers at the supplementary Senate estimates hearing in October of last year, Austrade estimated that those changes would affect about 60 per cent of exporters currently within the scheme.There are a range of submissions that have been made to the minister and/or the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee which are worth drawing attention to. One was from the Institute of Export in my own state, the Western Australian branch—a submission made to the Senate committee. In the course of that report, in addition to making the general points about the narrowing of the range of eligible export activity, the institute had this to say:The expenditure categories now excluded, such as air fares, tenders and quotations and registering overseas patents, are those promotional methods most applicable to service providers and exporters attempting to dispose of intellectual property rights and know&hyphen;how. These industry sectors are the very knowledgeable and intensive industry on which the future of our country belongs.It went on to say that Western Australian exports will be particularly disadvantaged because Western Australias exports are predominantly from service industries and providers of property rights. Western Australia has very little manufacturing and a small amount of tourism. So, in the intellectual property area, in the service providing area and in a range of value adding areas, things which are proposed to be excluded as eligible export activity are those things which are relevant to where the great weight of international trade is now moving.The submission by the New South Wales branch of the Australian Institute of Export, which was made to the Senate hearing, makes the point, which is a separate point, that the removal of these also most adversely affects small and medium sized enterprises. It states:We submit that SMEs are substantially more reliant on overseas travel than their larger counterparts. SMEs are constrained by funding and cash flow constraints from contracting the services of consultants, representatives and overseas offices, and accordingly must rely on travel by existing personnel.The same constraints dictate that an SME cannot experiment with marketing options. In reality, the safest option available to the SME is to have its own personnel travel to meet agents/clients in order to promote exports.Very often it is the rapport and goodwill built between the managing director of the SME and its foreign clients or potential clients which ensures the success of foreign marketing. Unlike its larger commercial counterpart, the SME has not the external or international infrastructure or reputation which allows marketing to be successfully carried out on a company to company basis.In summary, the removal of air fares from the scheme deletes at a blow the single most effective and most used marketing tool available to SME claimants.That is the sort of anecdotal evidence that you always get if you are out and about talking to small and medium sized enterprises, cooperatives, family companies and small businesses trying to get into export. The one thing they always say is that in the end there is one person in the business who has got the know&hyphen;how, the understanding of the product, the understanding of the market, and it is that person who needs to get out and get effective access to markets overseas.What the government is doing with this proposed bill, restricting that capacity to only two years, is taking away, as the Institute of Export says, the single most effective export enhancing advantage or assistance that the EMDG scheme can give. Recently, members may have noticed that a report—a joint report sponsored by Austrade and its British equivalent—entitled First steps to export success by the PanAgra Research Program of the London Business School also dealt with this point generally.

274,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr OCONNOR","WU5","(Corio)","ALP","N/A",2476,"—Once again, I express my disappointment at the way that the government is limiting the categories of claimable expenses. As the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) has just indicated, these provisions in the act and amendments to the scheme will affect small and medium enterprises, which are in the forefront of the exporting effort of this nation.If we go through the series of categories of claimable expenses which the honourable member for Perth is seeking to restore, we find that these are all very important to the smaller enterprises which are currently recipients of support under this particular scheme. If you go to any small and medium enterprise that is attempting to enter the export arena, you will hear that it is a difficult task and, of course, every dollar counts.When we look at the claimable expenses that the honourable member for Perth is seeking to restore to this legislation, they are all very important. These include the foreign registration of eligible industrial property rights, expenses for foreign language training, expenses for certain educational courses, packaging and labelling of eligible goods, preparation of tenders and quotations, expenses incurred and subscriptions to industry associations. These are the smaller expenditures, I guess, that really bring a burden to bear on the small and medium exporter when they are coming to grips with the exporting task.As the honourable member for Perth has just told the House, 60 per cent of firms that are currently receiving assistance under the current scheme will be affected by what the government is proposing to do with this legislation. I think it is timely, in the face of the amendments that have been proposed, to look at who exactly are the major recipients of assistance under the EMDG scheme. It has been estimated that around 70 per cent of EMDG recipients are small and medium exporters with 25 or fewer employees. These are not companies with great financial firepower to bear the brunt of these expenditures. They are usually cash strapped firms that are innovative, have a good export culture and are seeking to expand their sales overseas.When we step back one step further and look at the importance of this small business sector to the Australian economy, you get an idea of how important this scheme is. From 1983-84 to 1993-94, over 850,000 jobs were created in this sector. Employment growth over the same period averaged 3.6 per cent a year—five times that of big business, which averaged around 0.7 per cent. There are over 780,000 small business enterprises in Australia which comprise 97 per cent of all firms.Small business employs 45 per cent of all people employed in Australia and over 58 per cent of all people employed in the private sector. I would have thought that, given those statistics, and given the fact that this scheme relates very much to small and medium enterprises, the government would have backed off the provisions in its legislation, particularly those which seek to deny the access of small and medium business enterprises to some assistance for those claimable expenses under the scheme.We over this side of the House have a very proud record of comprehensive assistance to the small business sector, of which these small and medium firms who are recipients of assistance under this scheme form an important part. The creation of AusIndustry as a one-stop shop for the dissemination of information to small and medium exporting businesses on Commonwealth, state and industry association support programs is a very import&hyphen;ant assistance that was given by the previous government.We introduced the very successful export access program, which small and medium enterprises accessed. We expanded EFIC, we published the `Winning exports planning guide, which was designed to assist small business firms to plan their export drive, and we assisted high&hyphen;technology firms to export with the 150 per cent concession, R&D grants, concessional loans to commercialise their products— (Time expired)","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When I was speaking earlier, I was referring to the recent release of the report First steps to export success . One of the key features of that report—a joint Austrade and British Overseas Trade Board sponsored report—was that it found that:Successful exporters visited their export markets as often as possible.Successful exporters built close, trusting and long-term partnerships with their foreign distributors. The more potential distributors you meet, the more likely it is you will settle on the right one.Successful exporters communicated regularly with their distributors . . .They devoted time, money and effort rather than taking the opportunistic approach of shipping overseas only when they happen to receive an order.The whole thrust of that First steps to export success report is consistent with the sorts of submissions we have seen from a range of industry groups. The airfares aspect is one of the single most effective things that you can do to turn a company from domestic orientation into having a chance of export success.I wanted to spend a short time going over a couple of examples from my own state of Western Australia. I made the point that the Institute of Export, Western Australian branch, had made a submission to the Senate committee. It submitted that Western Australian exporters will be particularly disadvan taged because of those matters sought to be excluded from the scheme by the bill.Mr Denver Davies gave evidence to the Senate committees hearing earlier in the week on the impact of the legislation from Western Australia. He was of the view that it would have a disproportionately greater adverse impact on Western Australian industry because the key growth areas for Western Australian exporters are in the industrial property and services areas and the removal of patent costs, quotations, airfares and technical information would have a disproportionately disadvantageous effect in Western Australia. Having spoken to him, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, I know that he also takes the same view about Tasmania, which would be of considerable concern to you when you are sitting in a different place.There are a couple of Western Australian examples which are worthy of drawing to the attention of the House. Both of these companies have made submissions to the Minister for Trade. Entech, an environmental and energy technologies company in Maddington, Western Australia, wrote to the minister on 20 February in response to the exposure bill, saying:We are manufacturers of specialised thermal processing/recycling systems that are custom built to meet the specific requirements of our customers. Our export sales this financial year are expected to be approximately $2 million. We have no domestic sales of any significance.So here you have a company which is almost exclusively export oriented. They go on to talk about their two areas of major concern. They refer to the two major items of promotional expenditure that they incur, namely, airfares and tender preparation expenses. Under the governments bill they would no longer be eligible. This is a successful exporting company in Western Australia. Export sales this financial year are expected to be $2 million. They have no domestic sales of any significance. The two things that they rely upon to make the difference between zero to successful export are airfares and tender preparation expenses, given the specialised thermal processing and recycling system industry that they are in. That is a classic example of the sort of company which Denver Davies from the Western Australian Institute of Export was referring to.A second example that I draw to the attention of the House is a submission that has been made to the Minister for Trade and also made directly to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) by Crommelin Chemicals, manufacturers of quality waterproofing and sealing systems from Welshpool in Western Australia. The submission that Crommelin Chemicals made to the Minister for Trade was made shortly after the budget on 29 August 1996. The submission states:We are a typical small company established for 38 years which has taken advantage of the E.M.D.G. Scheme and ventured successfully into export. We are entering our fourth year and our success can be measured by the fact that the company tax on our profits from export in the first year was greater than the payment received from our E.M.D.G. and our export sales will for this financial year represent 25% of our turnover.(Extension of time granted) They then went on to say:In dropping airfares from E.M.D.G. after two years . . . you have virtually eliminated the normal claims of small business.Crommelin Chemicals went on to say:As an active supporter of the conservative parties for over 40 years I am bitterly disappointed that such duplicity can be used by our new Government.So they are none too happy with the decision. The submission reflects, as Mr Davies put to the Senate committee, `particular disproportionate adverse effect in Western Australia.To move from Western Australia to South Australia, I made the point in the second reading debate that I had recently been to Hamilton Pharmaceutical Pty Ltd in South Australia. This is a successful exporting pharmaceutical company. Referring to airfares in their submission, they said:This is one of our greatest areas of expense as there is no selling tool better than face-to-face selling. We need to visit our distributors and prospect for distributors in new markets to keep our exports going and growing.The one thing that is vital for them is the airfares. A similar submission made to me indirectly by Filmont Pty Ltd, export packers of citrus fruits in New South Wales, again bitterly complained about the removal of the airfares.Being cognisant of the time, I am happy to leave my remarks on those matters at that. Suffice to say, when you sift through the submissions made by the various companies to individual members or by companies to the Senate committee or companies or export associations to the minister or the Prime Minister, they reverberate around a familiar theme: that one of the most important things you can do to help small and medium sized enterprises is the EMDG airfare assistance.The regrettable thing—the point I made in my second reading contribution—is that it is not as if this has been the subject of an objective review of value for effort or export ratio to dollar spent. It has simply been a matter of the minister being told that he has a particular amount of money and the minister and Austrade and his various officials are working backwards from that. That has never been the way in which various changes to this scheme over the 22-odd years have occurred or been made. On this occasion it is clear that our exporting companies are saying that this is bad for our export enhancement, bad for export culture and bad, in particular, for small companies.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
276,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr OCONNOR","WU5","(Corio)","ALP","N/A",2479,"—The honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) has really outlined in a nutshell the impact that the governments legislation will have on small and medium sized firms and on the export culture that we on this side of the House assiduously cultivated over nearly a decade and a half which turned around Australias exporting effort in such a dramatic way.The honourable member for Perth nominated two categories of expenses which are very important to small and medium firms in that exporting effort—that is, the airfares that are involved in establishing that personal and face&hyphen;to&hyphen;face contact with clients and buyers in overseas countries and, of course, the expenditures that occur in preparing tender promotion documents to win valuable business for those countries.He mentioned one very important point in the remarks that he has just made, and that is the damage that this legislation will do to the ongoing development of an export culture in Australia. I refer again to the article `The rebirth of Australian industry prepared by the Centre for Strategic Economic Studies in Melbourne. One very important reason this paper identifies as leading to such a dramatic increase in exports and elaborately transformed manufactures was the changes in Australias business attitude to competitiveness, to exporting, to best practices and to an economic future linked to world markets, in particular to Asia. All of those have been important factors in the improvement of ETM trading outcomes. It is this very factor that is being affected by the legislation now before the House.The government ought to be aware that the measures it is proposing in limiting access to this scheme by small and medium enterprises, especially in the manufacturing sector, are going to affect job growth not only across the length and breadth of the national economy but also in specific regions throughout Australia. I have referred to the potential of the manufacturing sector in the export area. Let me refer once again to that article in the Australian Financial Review of 28 February which identified some substantial improvements in Australias manufacture exporting performance. I am interested in the quotes by the ACMs National Chief Executive, Mr Alan Handberg. In that article, he said:The figures reinforce ACMs call for a national action plan for manufacturing development to the year 2010 which establishes clear growth targets and puts in place long-term strategies to achieve them.This scheme in the form that it was in under the previous government constituted part of a long-term strategy which had yielded enormous fruit in improvements in export performance to the national economy. The article further stated:Mr Handberg stressed that the growth in manufactured exports was unlikely to be sustained without a national plan . . .He should have added `without tampering with the schemes that have delivered such outstanding economic benefits to the national economy. The article further stated:He also warned that the chances of maintaining the export success would be reduced by measures such as cutting research and development encouragement. Innovation will drive these types of exports.He could have well argued and could have well stated that the measures that are contained in this legislation will also inhibit the growth of manufactured exports, especially by small and medium enterprises, and severely limit the potential of those enterprises for job growth.The series of amendments that have been proposed by the honourable member for Perth have the support of industry, they have the support of work forces engaged and they have the support of regional communities.

All those amendments and those which followed relate to the proposed capping of the scheme at $150 million. As we made clear in the second reading debate, this is, in our view, in breach of election commitments. It has the effect of removing $426 million out of appropriations over four years for the scheme.When you take into account that the bill now enshrines a maximum five per cent cost for administration, the real maximum available to exporters under the scheme is $142.5 million. All the reviews and analyses of this scheme have shown that we get national benefit from every EMDG dollar spent. We regard this as regressive, and that reflects our opposition both by way of second reading amendments and the amendments in respect of which we have divided.Amendments negatived.Clauses agreed to.Remainder of bill—by leave—taken as a whole.","N/A","EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS (REPEAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

After 1 July, we will have a situation where, in a customs union and membership of the WTO, they will continue as two separate entities. That is perhaps not a position to be encour aged, to quote Zhu Rongji, who is a very senior interlocutor on behalf of Beijing, and Madam Wu Yi, who is my counterpart in Beijing as well.Australia supports the accession of China to the WTO as soon as the negotiations and the negotiating gap can be closed up.

297,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr GARETH EVANS","VD4","(Holt—","ALP","Deputy Leader of the Opposition)",2486,"—As I indicated in question time today, this legislation constitutes one of the most unholy messes ever created in Australian financial administration. The opposition does not oppose the principles of this legislation, applying, as it does, an additional burden on the superannuation contributions of high income earners starting at $70,000 and going up to $85,000 a year and beyond. Accordingly, we will not be voting against the second reading of this bill.But the method of collection that has been chosen by the government is, frankly, an unmitigated disaster. Not only is it a nightmare for the major superannuation funds and the whole superannuation industry to make it work because of the impossibly cumbersome, indirect and inefficient method of collection that has been adopted; not only will it involve a heap of additional red tape for small businesses administering their own funds, at a time that the government is supposed to be cutting their red tape in half; not only will it be spread in its impact far beyond the stated target group of those with incomes above $70,000 to reach all those lower and middle income fund members whose returns will be diminished by having to bear a share of the extraordinarily high compliance costs involved, estimated by the industry itself at up to $100 million initially and up to $30 million per annum thereafter; not only will something over one million Australians be penalised, the vast majority of them again low to middle income earners, because they will not have their tax file numbers submitted by the time the legislation specifies and will be caught as a result for the 15 per cent superannuation tax plus the advance payment of 7&half; per cent; but, in addition to all those things, the package as presently constructed does not fall evenly on all high income earners.It does not fall on federal judges, because of a constitutional problem in reducing their incomes during the course of their tenure. It does not fall, more importantly, on some 25,000 higher income earners in the state public sector, because again of constitutional problems involved in directly taxing state property—here in the form of superannuation funds. Again, if Dennis Rose QC is right—and he is one of the finest constitutional lawyers in the country and he is not often wrong—the legislation will end up not biting into any high income earners or indeed anyone else at all, because it is wholly invalid for the simple reason that the impost is expressed to be biting on one person, the superannuation fund, but provision being made for the payment to be actually made by individual fund members, a quite different person.Just to top off this litany of sins: even if the legislation is wholly valid, there is now a strong body of industry and professional opinion that the surcharge will not bring in anything like the $500 million a year which is budgeted over the next three years. That seems to be a perfectly likely outcome, given the governments absolutely abominable record so far in forecasting tax collection outcomes.Indeed, on information that has just come to hand through the rather extraordinary mechanism of a financial impact statement attached to a later government amendment, it has become apparent that the governments own estimates of the income reduction for this particular measure in the coming financial year, 1997-98, are of a reduction of some $46 million, from an expected return of $480 million that appeared in the budget papers to $434 million in the latest information we have. So already the government is acknowledging a revenue shortfall of some $46 million for this coming year.Already there is a further black hole in the budget to that extent which no-one has been told about yet—it has just come to light—as a result of this measure, quite apart from all its other numerous deficiencies, apparently being quite likely to fail in its income receipt projections so far as the revenue is concerned. So this package of bills, which is after all the major tax measure of the entire 1996-97 budget, estimated originally to raise around $1&half; billion over the next three years, comes to this House—and I choose my words quite carefully—as an unmitigated shambles.It is hardly surprising that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is not here personally to defend the package under these circumstances. He could not be bothered to introduce the bills. He could not be bothered to debate them. He could not be bothered to act as the minister in this debate, rather leaving it to the poor, benighted Attorney-General (Mr Williams), who I would have thought has more things on his plate than to be worrying about even this important legislation at the moment.The Treasurer has gone on record to say that he is very proud that he has had the courage to take this legislation on. He really thinks this is a terrific bit of legislation. He is so proud of it that he does not even bother to carry it through this House and he is so proud of it, I might also add, that he refuses to release the actuarial report which he commissioned into the operation of the new tax.What is he afraid of? Because he was advised that the administration of this measure was going to be a disaster, because he was advised that there is in fact, as we are saying, a better way to raise the revenue? We can only speculate upon that. His colleague the Western Australian finance minister, Mr Max Evans, had no doubt about it when he said on PM on 12 March:And we hoped that we might have got a copy—he is referring to this actuarial report—but we understand no one got a copy. There must be some very adverse comments in that report . . .I think my namesake has got that one just right.Why has the Treasurer got himself into such an unholy mess with these bills? Why has he incurred the absolute disgust of the superannuation finance industry, which he and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have been bagging unmercifully as a kind of diversionary tactic, by his wilful refusal to consult seriously, to adopt a more streamlined, workable collection method? Why has he got himself into the impossible legal and constitutional tangles that I have just briefly described? Why has he adopted a collection method that will, in practice, bite hard on a whole legion of low and middle income earners earning way below the threshold of $70,000 who, the government wants us to believe, will not be affected at all?The answer is really very simple: all this twisting, all this turning and all this performance of legal and administrative gymnastics—all these triple somersaults with pike—that we are seeing from Mr Costello are because he does not want to concede the simple reality that this superannuation surcharge is a tax—a t-a-x tax—involving a tax increase, and a whopping tax increase at that. The reason he does not want to own up to this is that, if it was a tax, the government would be totally exposed in breaching yet again another major election promise—that famous election promise not to increase taxes and not to introduce any new ones.This is the promise the government has broken on at least two previous occasions, with the tariff increase on thousands of consumer items and the Medicare levy surcharge. Obviously, the Treasurer did not want to be caught out yet again, so an absurd fiction has been maintained about this particular legislative package. We have heard over and over again that this superannuation surcharge is not a tax. We have had the Treasurer, we have had poor, benighted Senator Short, who is now going off to London to occupy a $150,000 tax-free job—it is the only job Peter Costello has created all year and he puts Jim Short in it!—and we have had Senator Kemp, various officials and the revenue agencies bending over backwards to not say that the surcharge is a tax, to avoid at all costs blurting out the `t word.We have seen obfuscation throughout this House, through the Senate, through the estimates committees, through numerous media interviews in a quite deliberate not telling of the truth. All of these semantic gymnastics have further diminished the Treasurers rapidly diminishing standing with the public and the media. Unequivocally the surcharge is a tax. It is classified that way in the budget papers and by the Bureau of Statistics. Even the Treasurers department, representatives of which are looking rather embarrassed in the box over there at the moment, have effectively conceded that of course it is a tax. They have structured the thing in accordance with section 55 of the constitution by splitting the package into imposition and assessment bills as required by the constitution because they know it is a tax and it is absurd to maintain this fiction. Why else would they have made this already ludicrously complex package of legislation even more complex in that way?Of course, not even the Treasurer can maintain day in, day out this preposterous claim forever, and over time the Treasurer has slipped up on a couple of occasions. We first heard him do so on the John Laws program on 27 February when he said:. . . the tax that is collected on employer contributions will be 30% rather than 15%—a clear, if no doubt inadvertent, admission that he had been comprehensively fibbing, with a capital `f, since the budget. Then on 12 March on the breakfast program on Radio National he told Pru Goward:At the moment, where an employer makes a contribution, theres a tax of 15 per cent. What weve done is we have said, `Well, for higher&hyphen;income earners starting over $70,000 and going up to $85,000 or beyond, the contributions tax should be higher, peaking at 30 per cent.So there it was: a blatant admission, overdue but not one that we have heard subsequently made on more formal occasions when his guard has been further up. Yet an hour later, in fact, the Treasurer was back in media on the AM program. In one particularly gymnastic piece of language, the Treasurer, in response to a question about why wasnt it time he dropped the pretence that it was not a tax, said:No, its a surcharge which reduces the tax concession currently available to high income earners—Jesuitical casuistry of the kind that would make even the senior Jesuit Pooh-Bah, whoever he is at the moment, positively cringe, I think, with the squalor of it all.A simple alternative model has always been available for the implementation of this particular legislation. If the Treasurer came out of his squalor, if he swallowed his political pride, if he openly, honestly and frankly conceded that this was a new tax on high income earners, the method of collection would be straightforward and simple.In the case of employees, what would it mean? It would mean the following simple four-step process. Let me spell it out: one, the employer provides contribution details to employees via group certificates; two, the employee lodges the usual tax return, including contribution details; three, the Australian Taxation Office levies the surcharge where it applies as part of the usual assessment; and, four, the employee meets the surcharge by one of the following alternatives—either by offset against other tax refund due, if any, or by payment in cash as part of the settlement of tax, or by passing the liability to a super fund to make the payment and to debit the employees account. It is as simple and as straightforward as that.In the case of self-employed people, no additional paperwork would be imposed. The calculation of the correct amount of the surcharge could be done automatically from the information already provided on the income tax form. The only information that is necessary is the taxable income and the deductible super contributions made during the year, which are already disclosed facts in the tax return. The tax office would automatically make the calculation of how much surcharge is payable and would then advise the relevant fund how much surcharge should be deducted from the members account. All the super fund would have to do is send in the required amount—no fuss, no additional administrative load to the self-employed and no additional cost to fund members, which will otherwise arise under the governments absurd system.Compare what I have just described with the governments absurd system, its absurdly complex administrative procedures. The simplest account of it I have seen prepared by ASFA, the Superannuation Funds Association, involves the following eight steps, nearly every one of which eight steps involves a great slab of administrative effort.First: each superannuation fund reports the contributions and tax file numbers, if they are supplied by the member—therein lies a big `if; we will come back to that—for each and every member to the ATO by 31 August each year. Two: the member submits a tax return. Three: the ATO matches the return and the information provided by all the funds of which the taxpayer is a member—there may well be more than one—and determines the amount of the surcharge, if any. Four: the ATO three times a year issues a `grouped assessment, as it is described, to each superannuation fund for the amount of the surcharge for specific members.Five: the superannuation fund deducts the surcharge from the members account and pays this to the ATO. Six: the superannuation fund advises each member of the amount of contributions reported to the ATO and any surcharge deducted. Seven: the liability for the surcharge is transferred to another fund or funds or to the member if the group assessment occurs after the member has left the fund. Eight: from 1998 each superannuation fund makes a provisional surcharge payment at 15 June of 50 per cent of the surcharge paid in the last tax year. And that is the simple version of how the process operates.To put it that way significantly understates the extent and complexity of the actual actions which the funds will need to take to implement the governments preferred mechanism. If I am given leave to do so, I would like to incorporate in Hansard a short document from ASFA which spells out the eight particular major steps the superannuation funds would have to take in that respect. I seek leave accordingly.","N/A","SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS SURCHARGE (ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION) BILL 1997 Cognate bills: SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS SURCHARGE IMPOSITION BILL 1997 TERMINATION PAYMENTS SURCHARGE (ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION) BILL 1997 TERMINATION PAYMENTS SURCHARGE IMPOSITION BILL 1997 SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS SURCHARGE (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997 SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS SURCHARGE (APPLICATION TO THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 1997 SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS SURCHARGE (APPLICATION TO THE COMMONWEALTH&hyphen;REDUCTION OF BENEFITS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

309,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr GARETH EVANS","VD4","(Holt—","ALP","Deputy Leader of the Opposition)",2486,"—Some of them. So what you have to do is you have to publicise the new measures to members. You have to collect tax file numbers from all members to provide to the ATO by 31 August. You have to change systems to report TFN and details of contributions for each fund member to the ATO every year. You have to change systems to debit each affected members account by the amount of the surcharge after receipt of assessment batches from the ATO. You have to establish procedures for members who have exited.You have to change fund accounting procedures to accommodate surcharge payments to the ATO on the required dates, including the 50 per cent of the previous years surcharge from 15 July 1998. You have to change systems for annual member statements and the exit statements to show details of the amount of contributions reported to the ATO and the surcharge deducted. You have to establish procedures to credit any refund from the ATO after a dispute has resolved. If you are still alive, well and sane after that little lot, `Youre a better man than I am, Gunga Din! That is the attitude of the superannua tion funds to this particular system that is being imposed upon them.Let me now look in a little bit more detail at some of the implications of this mechanism for Australians, for the wider community. First of all, this problem of submitting tax file numbers. It is the case on industry evidence given to the Senate last week that at least one million Australians, the overwhelming majority of whom would be low and middle income earners earning far less than the $85,000 a year that would be normally necessary to make you pay the 15 per cent new tax, will be liable for the full new 15 per cent superannuation tax, plus a compulsory advance instalment of 7&half; per cent, because they will not have provided tax file numbers to the superannuation funds in the time required by the legislation, by August this year.Why wont the tax file numbers be submitted by then? Simply because in the real world—the world of my electorate in Dandenong, for example, as distinct from the world occupied and inhabited by the Prime Minister with his view from Kirribilli and by the Treasurer with his view from Toorak and Malvern—that is the way things are. People either do not get their mail or when they do get their mail they do not always understand its significance. Peoples command of written English is often very poor. People may be simply reluctant to give any information, especially confidential tax related information, to anyone in apparent authority.The fact is that the experience of the industry and funds management in the past is that only about 50 per cent of members ever reply to requests for information made by the funds, even if the provision of that information is enormously to the members advantage. The funds—and I am not just making this up: this is not an opposition estimate; this is the testimony of groups such as Life Insurance and Superannuation Association of Australia, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, AMP, Jacques Martin—have all voiced their significant concerns about the way this will operate so far as the TFN provision is concerned.When people do not comply by submitting their tax file numbers then the legislation, on its face, bites to impose the 15 per cent surcharge until such time as they do. Even when someone does finally get the message that they are suffering a financial penalty by not complying with this request, if they ever get around to understanding and absorbing what the request is, the member still loses out because any subsequent return of overpaid surcharge does not get any interest from the government. So even if a member finds out that they have been wrongly charged, even if they manage to get a refund, they still lose as they have lost the income that would have accrued if the money had stayed in the superannuation fund.That is the first big fat problem. Over a million Australians, not just a few hundred thousand but three times the number who are targeted by this legislation—335,000 high income earners, we were told—will for this reason alone because of the way this legislation is constructed now be caught by the fund: a million low to middle income Australians, not the high fliers, not the high earners.Then we have the impact of these administrative costs on the members themselves. To tax around 335,000 high income earners, which is the target, 15.7 million superannuation accounts, because that is how many there are in this country, have to be brought into the administrative system. For every one of the thousands of funds in the system, major steps have to be taken—steps I listed before when I retailed what I was not allowed to incorporate. All those steps are necessary, even if no members earn more than the income threshold of $70,000. Even if not one single member of a fund earns that amount, the fund nonetheless has to go through these administrative hooplas in order to fit into this governments collection system.The sheer waste and the sheer lunacy of these administrative arrangements are very hard to comprehend. The cost of the legislations administration will simply be huge. Precision is really impossible at this stage. But there are serious estimates, as I have already said, of around $100 million in start&hyphen;up costs and something like $30 million per annum in ongoing costs.Ongoing costs include handling the massive physical data flows which are necessary to comply with these proposals, the costs of running more sophisticated information technology and, in particular, the costs of communicating much more often with fund members, whether those communications are requited or not. Defined benefit funds will also need to employ actuaries at a cost of some hundreds of dollars per hour to advise on how the surcharge will affect their members, bearing in mind that just about every individual case is different and the calculations are in each case quite complex.All of this is a deliberate decision by the government which has the effect of increasing costs massively, because the government simply does not have the courage to say what it is doing, to call a spade a spade and to tax high income earners directly. The real crime in all of this is that it means, again, that lower and middle income earners bear the brunt of these cost increases. They can only be recouped from members funds, and the overwhelming majority of members of those funds earn way below the threshold limit of $70,000&hyphen;plus.It is unfair the way the system operates, in this respect. It has been acknowledged to be unfair throughout the superannuation industry and by all those who have commented upon it. The only people in the country who are not prepared to acknowledge that, it seems at the moment, are Mr Costello, the Treasurer, and the government.The third big problem that arises, after you look at the TFN problem and the costs of administration that will be borne by ordinary members, is that of high income earners probably escaping this net anyway. Some certainly will because of the Treasurers pig&hyphen;headed determination to set this up as an impost on the funds themselves rather than on individual members.The Treasurer keeps saying that he is basing and building this on an existing scheme. But, of course, this is quite different. To the extent that you are imposing this surcharge on a personal income related basis, this extra 15 per cent, being dependent as it is on the individuals income in a year being above $70,000, makes it very different from the original 15 per cent which is just imposed across the board on all members.So you have the problem of Federal Court judges, 150 of them, being excluded, let off the hook, because of the constitutional concern that their incomes cannot be reduced during their tenure. It should not be difficult to recast the surcharge here on judges superannuation equivalent entitlements in a way that meets the constitutional problem. But the governments face is set against that because of the particular collection mechanism they have chosen for reasons I have already mentioned.State public sector employees are also effectively excluded at the moment. The way the legislation is drafted, it bites on the funds themselves, which count as state property and which are therefore ruled out from Commonwealth taxation by another provision of the constitution. This is easy enough to avoid if you tax the individuals contributions as individuals. But the government has chosen not to go down that route.Then you have Mr Roses opinion based on clause 34 of the bill as it stands, which I have already described in rough outline. That puts really under a very serious cloud, I would have thought, that analysis of the constitutional viability, not just of some groups but of the legislations impact as a whole.Moreover, it has become increasingly clear that the legislation is not going to meet its revenue targets, quite apart from its failure to effectively impact on some particular individual groups, because the government, once again, seems to have rather comprehensively miscalculated what the returns will be. The budget estimated, as I said, that just on $1.5 billion will be collected over the next three years. The latest figures that have just come out and been circulated as part of the amendments distributed a little while ago suggest that, at least in the first year, that rate of collection will be dramatically down by, as I said, some $46 million, generating a new contribution to the governments budgeting difficulties in the process.The reason underlying this is, of course, the reality that behavioural change will almost certainly ensure that the surcharge does not bring in anything like what it would be if it is simply adding on 15 per cent to what is being contributed at the moment. That view is not just an opposition look from the outside in; it comes from the inside, from the accountants and financial advisers who are providing advice on remuneration package structuring.The Institute of Chartered Accountants issued the results recently of a survey it had undertaken which showed that nearly 60 per cent of the clients of chartered accountants are being advised right now to change their retirement plans because of this surcharge. If that advice is being taken, then clearly the governments revenue estimates are even more shaky than has been apparently the case so far. Given the governments track record and its revenue collection forecasts over the last few months, one can only assume that it is utterly unclear what the income returns will be.The unhappy underlying irony, of course, in all of this is that again, due to the poor design of the collection method—about which I have been speaking for most of the last half hour—it may be that, while those at whom the tax is aimed will be easily able to avoid its operation, those who are low income earners but who do not provide their tax file number will, in fact, be paying the surcharge instead. That frankly outrageous scenario is now looking increasingly likely.So there we have it. This legislation is possibly unique in Australian political history. It combines in its impact, in effect, a blatant repudiation of cast&hyphen;iron pre-election commitments not to introduce new taxes, and at the same time we are seeing a steadfast refusal by the government to honestly acknowledge that particular breach.It has given us a massive increase in compliance costs and procedures from a government which is supposedly committed to lessening the burden of red tape. It has given us a reduction in the benefits of all members of super funds from the surcharge, a complete alienation of the super industry and related professional advisers, angst and non&hyphen;cooperation from the states and the territories and the prospect at the end of the day that the revenue estimated to be collected will not in fact be collected from those at whom the new tax is aimed.Far from being confined in its operation to the 335,000 high income earners who can manifestly afford to pay it, it will operate in practice to directly reduce the retirement benefits of over one million other lower and middle income earning Australians. Far from being fair in its operation, it will be manifestly unfair to those lower and middle income fund members who have to bear the huge administrative burden of the collection methods that have been chosen.The opposition has not and never has opposed the principle of this legislation. We will not oppose it for that reason at the second reading, but we strongly believe that it should be withdrawn and redrafted so as to meet its stated objectives with much less complexity, much less expense and much more fairness. I move accordingly:That all words after That be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:(1) condemns the Government for:(a) breaking solemn commitments made before the election not to raise the rate of existing taxes nor introduce new taxes;(b) attempting to deceive the Australian public by not admitting that this measure is a tax;(c) deliberately inflicting on the superannuation industry an impossibly cumbersome, inefficient and expensive collection method;(d) ensuring by that collection method that superannuation providers incur enormous administrative expenses which will in turn be borne by their members, the great majority of whom are low and middle income earners;(e) ensuring by that method, and in particular the requirements for notification of Tax File Numbers, that over one million Australians, the overwhelming majority being low and middle income earners, will become liable for the full 15 per cent tax;","N/A","SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS SURCHARGE (ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION) BILL 1997 Cognate bills: SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS SURCHARGE IMPOSITION BILL 1997 TERMINATION PAYMENTS SURCHARGE (ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION) BILL 1997 TERMINATION PAYMENTS SURCHARGE IMPOSITION BILL 1997 SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS SURCHARGE (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997 SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS SURCHARGE (APPLICATION TO THE COMMONWEALTH) BILL 1997 SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTIONS SURCHARGE (APPLICATION TO THE COMMONWEALTH&hyphen;REDUCTION OF BENEFITS) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/debate.sub1/speech/talk.start[6]/para","N/A","N/A"

320,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr PRICE","QI4","(Chifley)","ALP","N/A",2494,"—Some honourable members may be aware that I have made a speech regarding the higher school certificate performance of Mount Druitt High School and the notorious publication of a photo. I am pleased to say that the report into Mount Druitt High School, Review of 1996 Higher School Certificate Performance , by Dr Alan Laughlin has now been completed. I said at the time that I would put into the marketplace yet again the idea that we really needed to look at a senior high school for Mount Druitt with feeder year 7 to 10 students. I have been criticised locally for this, so I want to refer to some of the remarks made in the report. Dr Laughlin says,The structure of secondary education in Mount Druitt is extremely fragile.. . . . . . . . .N/AThe creation of the nearby St Marys Senior High School has been a clear success.. . . . . . . . .N/AGiven the apparently tenuous nature of secondary education provisions it is important that a wider analysis quickly occur to ensure that the current situation does not just struggle on.I would like to give the House some interesting figures. There are five public high schools in Mount Druitt. The total enrolment of years 11 and 12 students for those high schools was 668. The equivalent enrolment for years 11 and 12 for St Marys Senior High School was 808 students. I happen to agree with Dr Laughlins suggestion that the 55&hyphen;student enrolment in year 12 means that Mount Druitt High School really is not a comprehensive high school.I must say that I have always argued that a senior high school provides students with greater subject choice, greater choice for those who want to go on to tertiary education, greater choice to see the world of work as their goal and greater choice in vocational training. Among the 55 students in year 12, 46 subjects were taken. If you just divide that one figure into the other, you can come to some understanding that there must have been some very low class numbers.I have always said—I say with great respect—to the Teachers Federation that they need to understand that teaching resources are precious resources. We cannot afford to have them squandered, particularly when the issue of aggregation of those numbers and greater productivity and outcomes are available to them. I am indebted to the Laughlin report because I had forgotten—shame on me for having forgotten, because I was part of the handover process—that there will be two new senior high schools in the Nirimba educational precinct: one is Catholic and the other is a public senior high school, which is coming on-line in 1998.This is going to further exacerbate the problem. Indeed, there will be an Anglican high school established in Oakhurst and that again will exacerbate the problem. For example, at Mount Druitt High School, it is expected that the enrolments will decline in the year 2002 to 43 students in year 12 and, with the opening of the other schools, it may in fact decline to 30 to 35. Clearly, something needs to be done. I have suggested that we need to look at a senior high school—not as a total response to the problem but as part of the response that we need to make.The report makes 10 recommendations. The first, I guess, and most important, is that there needs to be a wider assessment of the demographic, structural and educational needs of the high schools and their feeder primary schools in Mount Druitt.

321,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr ZAMMIT","ZK6","(Lowe)","LP","N/A",2494,"—I want to refer tonight to some unfortunate statements made by the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) and the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) in the debate last night on the Aviation Legislation Amendment Bill. What I want to say at the outset is that I paid them the courtesy of informing them earlier this evening that I was going to refer to both of them in this adjournment debate this evening. All I can say is that it is a pity that they did not extend the same courtesy to me last night.They both stated that they wanted to know where I was last night. I would just like to mention the statements that they made. The honourable member for Watson, referring to me, said:Where is he? It is quarter past nine. This debate has been going on since just after 8 oclock. We have not heard from him. Goodness knows where he is.Then the honourable member for Grayndler said:The honourable member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) certainly will not be speaking in this debate, because the member for Lowe is cowering and running from anything to do with Sydney airport.I would just like to say that the bill before the house last night had absolutely nothing to do with Sydney airport. In fact, both the honourable member for Grayndler and the honourable member for Watson were not even on the speakers list. They attempted an ambush. All I can say is that it was a premeditated and coordinated attack on me and they did not have the guts or the decency to inform me of the attack on me personally.I would just like to say for the record that I was, at 8 oclock last night, at a reception for an international communications forum organised by the Hon. Chris Miles, Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister, at which we had overseas participants visiting Canberra to talk about lifting the ethics in the media. No doubt they also made passing reference to the role of parliamentarians in regards to the media. The participants were William Porter, who is a very widely experienced journalist, Rajmohan Gandhi, a journalist and author and a grandson of Mahatma Gandhi and others, who came to Australia to talk to us about lifting the standard in the media and the role of parliamentarians.I would just like to say that I cut my political teeth in the New South Wales bear pit. You do not survive there for 12 years, as I did, unless you learned how to look after yourself and learned to dish it out when the dishing out was done to you in addition to that.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

I would just like to warn the honourable member for Watson and the honourable member for Grayndler that if they do that again, if they do not pay me the courtesy—or their colleagues on the other side of parliament—of informing us that they are going to do a dump job, then all I can say is that if that is the sort of thing that they want, I can dish it out as well.I think that that is not the best thing to do for our constituents or for the parliament, in which we are very honoured to represent the Australian nation. The reason why they are no doubt very upset at circumstances surrounding aircraft noise—which, incidentally, had nothing to do with what was before the House last night—is that I have succeeded, beyond my wildest dreams, and no doubt it is upsetting the Labor members.I issued a press release on 14 February, which I stand by. We promised, prior to the election, a reduction of aircraft noise, over my electorate, of 47 per cent. It is now going to go up to 65 per cent reduction of planes over my electorate. No wonder they are trying their best to denigrate me. All I can say is that I have the support of my constituents. It was there before the election, it is there now and it is increasing in the number of votes that have been promised to me by my constituents.The last thing I want to say is that the thing that I found most despicable—I want to raise this—on the other side, is to bring into this debate the Australian Lebanese community and the Australian Greek community, who have absolutely nothing to do with this issue of aircraft noise. If that is the sort of attitude you people on the other side have adopted, all I can say is that you are going to be sitting there for a long, long time to come, and that is well and good as far as I am concerned.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
324,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr KELVIN THOMSON","UK6","(Wills)","ALP","N/A",2496,"—Just over a month ago I raised in this House the activities of Mr Alan Jorgensen as an example of the problem of phoenix companies—that is, companies which go bankrupt and leave their debts and their creditors behind them, with a new company being set up to carry on the same, now debt free, business.The Australian Securities Commission reported in May last year that phoenix companies are a $1.3 billion drain on the national economy each year, that at least 9,000 businesses are affected by phoenix company activities each year and that phoenix companies, and not unfair dismissals, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) would have us believe, now rate as the biggest problem for small and medium sized businesses.I pointed out to the House Mr Jorgensens trail of new companies designed to avoid paying creditors their due entitlements—Townsend and Parker Pty Ltd, then Consolidated Diecaster Pty Ltd, then Townsend and Parker Gravity Centre Pty Ltd, then Townsend and Parker Vic Pty Ltd, then Machland Pty Ltd. A meeting of creditors of Machland on 29 January this year was presented a damning administrators report which made highly critical findings of Mr Jorgensens companys conduct in at least three areas—preferential payments to creditors, related party transactions and insolvent trading.As the administrator points out, section 588 of the Corporations Law makes voidable transactions which confer a preference on particular creditors. It is clear from the report that the administrator suspected that this was going on, for he had been requesting from past and present directors the company records concerning payments made to creditors. He said, `These records appear to exist; however, they have not been provided to me. He noted that payments made during the period from June to December 1996 may have conferred an advantage greater than if the company had been wound up, but he needed further analysis of the companys creditors records.Since I made that address to the parliament, two different sources have informed me that Alan Jorgensen offered them money in exchange for their proxy votes at the creditors meetings held during that period at the end of 1995 and early 1996, following the collapse of Townsend and Parker Gravity Caster Pty Ltd. This was clearly an attempt by Mr Jorgensen to rort the creditors meeting and represented a plan by him to effectively defraud other creditors.In the light of this, I again urge the Australian Securities Commission and the administrator to examine Mr Jorgensens conduct and the conduct of his companies concerning preferential treatment of creditors and insolvent trading pursuant to section 588G, breach of which is both a civil and criminal offence, and also sections 588FA and 588FB.I again call on the government to examine the problem of phoenix companies and look at increasing the disqualification period of directors associated with these companies from five years to 10 years and in some cases to life suspension.It has also been brought to my attention that disqualified directors do try to get around disqualification by acting as consultants. I suspect that we need to look at prohibiting disqualified directors from consulting to directors on matters of company management and prohibiting directors from accepting advice from a disqualified person, given the frequency with which phoenix companies have relatives and friends of the former directors as their new directors.The workers at Townsend and Parker deserve much better than a man who is killing this companys business by failing to pay his debts and syphoning off money to his family company. For example, $270,000 was paid to Freeway Management, the present directors of which are the parents of Mr Alan Jorgensen. Mr Jorgensen himself was a director of Freeway until 3 October last year and is presently the secretary of Freeway.It has been estimated that Mr Jorgensens various scams and sham transactions involving phoenix companies have cost banks $15 million, taxpayers over $3 million, employees $400,000 and other creditors $3&half; million. The workers—hardworking employees at this factory—deserve much better. I urge the Australian Securities Commission to closely monitor this mans activities in order that this company can get the management which it rightfully deserves.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[3]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
325,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr BILLSON","1K6","(Dunkley)","LP","N/A",2497,"—I wish to congratulate my colleagues here for the enthusiasm and healthy competition that is on display every adjournment debate, raising issues of interest and concern to our local communities.There are two issues I would like to briefly mention tonight. One is the outcome of the municipal elections in my region last weekend. I would like to extend my congratulations and best wishes to all the successful councillors of the Frankston City Council and the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council. I hope I can look forward to a very productive and healthy relationship with all of them as we work towards serving our community.On the same issue, the three retiring commissioners who had that difficult and quite taxing job of managing the transition to a modernised local government in the state of Victoria and the move to larger municipal areas deserve a mention. In the Frankston City Council area, our Chief Commissioner, Tom Sweeney, and commissioners Max Batchelor and James McCoy did their utmost in representing the interests of our community and in tackling the challenges with diligence and a very genuine commitment to the community and a great deal of enthusiasm, which I think many of us warm to.The Mornington Peninsula Shire Council was ably guided through this transition period by Chief Commissioner Nick Hudson and commissioners Jane Moffat and Peter Newman. My congratulations and the thanks of the community also go to them.The second issue I would like to briefly mention this evening relates to the Mornington Racing Club. I would like to pay tribute to the racing club, the recently incorporated Mornington Racing Club, which I am in formed is the largest provincial club in Australia. Its membership continues to grow. For the last 26 years it has been handled and managed under the guidance and direction of its chief executive officer, Mr Lindsay Carr.As one of the largest employers in Mornington, the racing club is extremely important. Not only are 450 horses trained on the track by 90 licensed trainers with over 600 horses in stables within the area of Rosebud down to Moorooduc, but 55 full&hyphen;time and 80 part-time people are employed in positions such as stable hands and in other areas around the racetrack. This makes a very welcome increase to the employment generated from the 80 horses that were operating out of Mornington when Mr Carr arrived.On Mornington Cup Day, OBriens caterers employ up to 100 staff and approximately 50 staff on each of the other racing days. The club itself employs 35 casual staff on a normal race day and 70 on cup day. Morningtons success in supplying as many racehorses as it has to Victorian meetings at Flemington and Caulfield, creating jobs for float transporters, saddleries, blacksmiths and stud owners, reflects the importance that the club has to our local community.Mornington Cup Day on Wednesday, 19 February with a $85,000 purse up for grabs saw Palos Verde storm home. The heatwave conditions of around 40 degrees kept attendances down to a still impressive 6,500, down slightly from the 9,000 in 1996. Thanks to the Mornington Peninsula Business Councils suggestion, the 1997 cup carnival will be held over two days, which is something I encourage all of my colleagues to attend if they can.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[4]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

327,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr BILLSON","1K6","(Dunkley)","LP","N/A",2497,"—I cannot share any tips with you—I have not quite worked out that formula. A race is named in the memory of a great Australian—the R.M. Ansett Stakes. That was run on 20 February. Sir Reg chaired the club from 1947 to 1981 and was the driving force behind the resumption of racing there after the Second World War. Sir Reg has generously left the club an ongoing bequest, which is now a large part of the R.M. Ansett Stakes prize money.The phenomenal success of the racing industry in Victoria is because it is taxed at 28 per cent compared with the New South Wales Labor governments high tax of 52 per cent. This has played a large part in shaping the sort of prize money that is available and is partly why racetracks around Victoria like Mornington and Seymour seem to be going from strength to strength.I am particularly pleased that around a quarter of the horses who win at Mornington are actually trained there or in the near vicinity. Horse breeding and preparation are very important industries to the Mornington Peninsula economy. I think it is Dizzy Carlyon who reminds me regularly that it is the third or fourth largest industry on the Mornington Peninsula. This locally won prize money at race meetings is also a great boost to the local economy.The club has gone through many transitional periods over its time, but it is now in very good shape, due in no small part to the management and the guidance provided by Mr Carr and the board. There are plans for redevelopment of the club and improvement of facilities. I think it is a great credit to the club that they have been planning for the future and providing improved facilities at Mornington.Race day at Mornington has always been a very welcoming atmosphere and enjoyable experience for the whole family. Horse breeding and racing preparation are job creators and entrenched industries on the Mornington Peninsula. It is another example of how important leisure related activity is to the people and the economy of our region. I congratulate the continuing good work of Mr Carr, the committee and members of the Mornington Racing Club for the development of an important local asset to the community of Dunkley.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[4]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
328,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr LEE","MG4","(Dobell)","ALP","N/A",2498,"—Tonight I would like to discuss two issues in the adjournment debate. The first issue is child care and the second is changes which the government is making to nursing homes. On the first issue, I had the pleasure of visiting the Jelli Beanz Child Care Centre at Blue Haven in my electorate last Friday. Mr Speaker, I am sure you would be welcome at any time if you are passing near Blue Haven.The issue that the management of the Jelli Beanz Child Care Centre spent some time discussing with me is the governments decision to impose a limit of 50 hours on the number of hours that are subject to fee relief for parents who send their children to child-care centres such as that at Blue Haven. Despite what a number of government members have been saying, this is going to affect parents whose children spend less than 50 hours per week at a child-care centre as well as those parents who do have their children at those centres for more than 50 hours per week.One of the government members shakes her head, but the reason that is the case is that most of these centres charge a flat rate per day. If the honourable member for Bowman (Mrs West) wants to check with her own minister, she will learn that the Department of Health and Family Services is encouraging these child-care centres to charge the same amount per day, no matter how many hours parents might be having their children supervised at the child-care centres.As a result of this governments decision, the amount of fee relief subsidy is reduced for those parents who have their children for whatever reason at the child-care centre for more than 50 hours a week and that is going to mean that they are paying up to $15 a week more. When you consider that the first round of cutbacks in last years budget takes effect only on 1 April and that we already have a secret document from the Department of Health and Family Services to the minister, which the minister has confirmed, proposing another $400 million worth of cuts to child care, then it can mean only that more parents will be paying even more after this years budget for child care.There will be an opportunity for senators to disallow that limit of 50 hours a week in a little while. I hope that people such as my friend the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Lloyd) might consider supporting the Labor attempts to disallow that limit of 50 hours per week. I am sure there would be a number of parents in his own electorate who will have to pay more as a result of his governments decision.The second issue is nursing homes. My second honour last Friday was speaking at the Gosford&hyphen;Central Coast Branch of the Association of Independent Retirees, which covers the electorates—","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/p/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/debate.sub1[5]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

332,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr LEE","MG4","(Dobell)","ALP","N/A",2498,"—The member for Robertson interjects and says that he sent them the true facts. I would hope he would also have a chance to read what some of the members of that association have put down in writing, the concerns that they have raised, concerns that have been raised quite independently of the Labor Party. I am sure that as each day passes and the honourable member for Robertson has a chance to speak to more of his constituents about the impact that this piece of legislation is going to have, then he will start very quickly trying to persuade his government, I hope, and his minister to drop this package because it is going to be very unfair.The introduction of these up-front fees, even according to the governments own figures, means that there will be an average of $26,000 charged in the up-front fee, or the accommodation bond, as the government calls it. It is true that some residents are exempted, but they are going to be a very small proportion of the number of people who go into nursing homes.The biggest flaw in the legislation is that there is no cap on that up-front fee. The government says that it will be an average of $26,000, but, because there is no cap, it means that people, especially in areas where there are high quality nursing homes such as the Central Coast, will be expected to pay very large up-front fees.If you are the owner of a nursing home and you have one spare bed in your nursing home, if one person can afford to pay a very large up-front fee of $100,000 or more and another person might have only a very modest amount of money to contribute, you actually have a fiduciary duty to the shareholders of your company to let the person who can pay the largest up-front fee have that bed.When you consider that there is also the imposition of the new 25c in the dollar means test, it means that some people are going to be paying more than 95c in the dollar in effective taxation as a result of the means test on social security, the withdrawal of the taxation and this new 25c in the dollar means test on nursing home benefits. For all of these reasons, I believe these measures should be defeated. We would hope that there are more members on the government side of the House who would speak up and try to make sure that this legislation does not proceed.

334,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"Mr LLOYD","IK6","(Robertson)","LP","N/A",2499,"—Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I interjected during the speech of the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), the opposition party seems to be intent on a campaign of scaremongering and misinformation throughout the community, and I most certainly have provided the Association of Independent Retirees with the true facts. I would say that the member for Dobell can stand there and look us straight in the eye and not even bat an eyelid about the state of nursing home accommodation on the Central Coast and throughout Australia.For 13 years they let that system fall apart. They let it get to the stage where we have four elderly residents to a room, sharing bathrooms. We have elderly couples who are separated after a lifetime of marriage together. One of those people may have to go into a nursing home and they are separated because there is not enough nursing home accommodation on the Central Coast of New South Wales and in many places throughout Australia. They are forced to get accommodation in Sydney or Newcastle. Can you imagine the distress that is caused to those couples and to their families, when couples who have been married for 50 years are separated and an elderly person then has to try to find their way from Woy Woy to Sydney or to Newcastle? It has a devastating effect on those couples. The couples are separated and are devastated by those sorts of incidents.That subject is not what I wanted to speak about tonight and I will get back to the subject that I did want to speak about tonight. It is a positive subject, which is more than the opposition can raise. They seem to have had a campaign of negativity over the last 12 months because they cannot offer any substantial, constructive opinions. What I wanted to speak about tonight was the magnificent work done by the men and women of the parliamentary Guide Services and the Parliamentary Education Office.When I was elected to this place some 12 months ago, I certainly was not aware of that magnificent service provided by these people. Each year thousands of children—some 102,500 last year and an even greater number expected by the end of this year—visit Parliament House. Almost every day of the year you can witness school groups entering this magnificent place and being informed and educated on not only the building but the actual workings of the parliamentary system.To many people the workings of parliament and how the parliamentary system works basically remain a mystery. For school children in particular it is important as part of their education—I would say vital, in fact—that they understand the workings of parlia ment and how bills are passed and how laws are made and how they can have an effect on their lives.The Parliamentary Education Office provides a chance for these children to experience the workings of parliament. They re-enact the sittings of parliament, giving them the opportunity to elect a Speaker and re-enact the roles of Prime Minister, opposition leader, ministers, shadow ministers, members of the government and members of the opposition.I would strongly urge members—particularly newer members, who may not have had the experience of having the opportunity to visit with some students from their own electorates during these education sessions—to take the opportunity and make the time to visit one of these re-enactments provided by the Parliamentary Education Office. It is quiet enlightening and, dare I say it, the level of parliamentary debate that I have witnessed on some of these occasions has exceeded the level of debate that happens in this great place on some occasions. Many honourable members, particularly those on the other side, could possibly learn a thing or two from these young students.Recently I spent time with one of my schools, Avoca Beach Public School, through their studies with the Parliamentary Education Office and was greatly impressed with the level of their debate. I must say, though, I was very surprised that the government members of the Avoca Beach school did use their numbers to force through a bill calling for longer school hours. Although it was strongly opposed by the opposition, the government did have the numbers and this bill was passed. One does feel, however, that the bill may have trouble passing through the Senate, and I understand that there is a strong push to have this bill amended before it becomes law. The parliamentary Guide Services operates public tours of Parliament House every half&hyphen;hour. Parliament House is a building which I am immensely proud of, and I believe it is a most fitting building for our national parliament.Again, I strongly urge honourable members who have not taken part in any of these public tours to take the time to visit one of these tours and go along with the guides, because I am sure they will learn things that even they do not know about this magnificent building. The guides are thoroughly professional and extremely knowledgeable, not only on the building but on all of the types of fixtures and paintings that are hanging throughout this building.

360,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr CREAN","DT4","(Hotham)","ALP","N/A",2503,"—The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Bill before the Main Committee brings into effect a measure that was announced in last years budget. It has the effect of transferring the DIFF loan liabilities from EFIC to the governments national interest account and for the consequent payment to the Commonwealth of a portion—$40 million—of EFICs reserves.This bill means that the Commonwealth will assume contingent liabilities of some $1.7 billion in respect of the DIFF loans. The removal of DIFF loans from EFICs account removes the difficulties which EFIC has faced through concentration of exposure on the fairly narrow range of countries assisted through DIFF.The opposition does not oppose the legislation. In itself it is non&hyphen;controversial. However, I point out that the DIFF scheme and the potential for loans under it have been far from non&hyphen;controversial. I remind the committee of the circumstance we got ourselves into earlier this year when, unilaterally, the government announced the ending of the DIFF scheme.We remember the embarrassment that was caused to the nation and, specifically, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in his telling the parliament that not one country had complained to him about the abolition of the scheme. It was shown, in a very short space of time, that it was true that not one had, but that many had. The minister was forced to come into the parliament and indicate that he had misled it.","N/A","EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

The only circumstances in which people are ever ultimately required to honour it is when they are forced to—when they are caught out.The decision of the government, and of the foreign minister in particular, embarrassing as it was for him, was also a very significant setback for a lot of Australian companies which had come to rely on the DIFF scheme. At the time, the minister said that every formal offer for DIFF would be honoured. However, that formal offer only covered seven projects worth some $186 million. In addition to that formal offer, there were 50 other projects which were worth $1 billion which were effectively scuttled because they had received letters of advice to proceed, but not the technicality of the formal offer. The circumstances of this were that this scheme had been in existence over a long period of time—","N/A","EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

364,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr CREAN","DT4","(Hotham)","ALP","N/A",2503,"—Not only did it have bipartisan support, but there was a commitment during the election campaign to maintain it. No doubt it was one of the promises that hit the fence because it was not a core promise. However, the government went to the election saying that the DIFF scheme would be retained.Not only is this scheme important for our bilateral relationships, but it has also been an important driving force for industry development because it has been through this scheme that our heavy engineering industry has actually positioned itself into export markets. Think back a decade ago. At that time, heavy engineering in this country did very little by way of exports. The difficulty is that it is very hard to get into export markets, particularly in developing countries where what you have to do is compete against other companies bidding for projects where their governments are prepared to back them.Essentially, the backing for those companies comes in the form of either assistance with soft loans through the aid budget or else through a cushioning of the impact, a lessening of the risk. There is risk associated with these things, sovereign risk, but there is also risk in the sense that there is a fairly long lead time before you get payment for the completion of the product.The nature of the DIFF scheme was an essential part not just of our aid program but also it was a sensible use of aid, the leverage of government money, to assist Australian investment, Australian manufactures, Australian expertise and Australian services being exported. This heavy engineering sector has seen a huge growth in exports due in no small measure to the fact that many of the companies were able to rely on the DIFF scheme.There were 52 projects in the DIFF pipeline before the foreign minister created this mess. There were 52 projects but they involved something in the order of 600 Australian companies. There is a multiplier effect in terms of the companies that can be brought into the network. That is what we talk about when we say we should use the leverage of government assistance, assistance which both parties agreed to, and assistance which is important for the countries to where it is directed.Why can we not have it both ways? Why can we not at the same time say we are prepared to give you that assistance, we are prepared to assist you in your development projects but, provided our own contractors, our own businesses are up to the mark, then they should be able to use this assistance and get themselves into the marketplace? They could be the most efficient producers in the world, they could have the best expertise in the world, but without this assistance they would not be competing on a level playing field. They would have to compete in circumstances where the companies against which they have to bid have the backing of their governments.The point that we are making here is that whilst this technical change in terms of the transfer of the DIFF loan liabilities from EFIC to the government national interest account is taking place, we want to take the opportunity to urge the government to rethink its position on this scheme. It is not the only scheme being changed that has hit Australian manufacturers. The export market development grants scheme, which is being debated in the other chamber, is also a scheme which the government promised would be maintained at the last election but, whilst it is being maintained, it has been heavily slashed.It is very interesting to note these simple facts. Over the last decade, Australias manufacturing exports have been our fastest growing sector. They now represent 31 per cent of our exports. They are a bigger export earner now than agriculture and they will outpace minerals in the early part of the next decade. The manufacturing sector is not the poor relation any longer of industry sectors or of potential export earners in this country. However, the simple fact remains that whilst we have seen huge growth in manufactures as a proportion of our exports, still today only 13 per cent of our manufacturers export.So what we have is a huge growth in exports, a marketplace out there into which Australia can position itself. But the assistance is not sufficiently based to encourage more exporters to come into the game and that is why we need export schemes. We need assistance to get us into the export market. That is where the growth in world trade is. It is where our expertise has the capacity to position us but it cannot do it on its own.Australia did have to embrace the notion of reducing its protection levels. Protection is the wrong way to go about trade policy and expanding export opportunities; protection is about stopping imports. Australia has to be about growing its exports. It is too small a domestic market to find the critical mass here alone. But it has the potential to position itself with that critical mass in the global economy and, in particular, in the Asian region. But at the same time as reducing our protection levels we have to have a strategy for positioning our industries for a post&hyphen;tariff environment. It is not good enough to strip away the protection without also underpinning the support mechanisms to get us into the export markets.It is very interesting, looking at that growth in exports of those manufactures that I have talked about before, that the group that has grown the fastest and the strongest is the group called elaborately transformed manufactures, or ETMs—if you like, the high value&hyphen;added end of the marketplace. Within that group of ETMs, the areas that have grown the fastest, just to name a few, include automobiles, clothing and textile, food processing, information technology and telecommunications equipment. I name them not because they have been the fastest growers in export values per year—at least 20 per cent per annum growth in all of those sectors—but because they are all sectors that have had some form of assistance. Pharmaceuticals is another group.We are looking at the automobile plan and not the tariff level. It is true that Labor significantly reduced tariffs across the board. It treated automobiles and textiles as a separate category but nevertheless reduced tariff levels, and they are still on their way down to 15 per cent. The reason for the growth in automobiles has not been that we have reduced tariffs but that we have had an export facilitation scheme in place. It is because we have deliberately encouraged and given incentives to these companies not just to produce for a domestic market but also to get out there and flog the things into the world market. And it is not just whole cars, it is the componentry industry. It is the positioning of Australia, because of its expertise, to get into the global market for car componentry.A great example of this is at a place in Adelaide called Henderson Springs, where the Labor party launched its car plan a couple of weeks ago. I see the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) smiling knowingly about this establishment. I hope that she has been down there to visit. If she has not, we will arrange an invitation for her, just as we are arranging one for Neil Andrew, who is about correcting his position and stance on tariffs in the Adelaide Advertiser . The member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) is also very interested to hear about this.Alexander Downer and Ian McLachlan, who cannot spell his name—he spelt it Mac in a letter he sent off to the Adelaide Advertiser —say that they cannot state a position on the car tariff because it would be breaching the solidarity of the cabinet. That did not stop Ministers Hill and Vanstone. They have come out and declared their hand. I wonder who is breaching confidence. I wonder who has got the courage to stand up for Adelaide and stand up for the automobile industry in that place.We know what the position of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is. There he was, over at Canberras most exclusive club the other night, with the minister for industry—and we know where he is at the moment: checking the stock exchanges of the world. Perhaps he is at Stoke Lodge in London. We see that a few on your side of politics are actually vacating for more lofty fields overseas.

369,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr CREAN","DT4","(Hotham)","ALP","N/A",2503,"—Thank you, and I will recognise that point, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am trying to point to the position that this bill, whilst technically correct, is part of a much broader issue that we want the government to focus on. It is not good enough to bury this bill in the Main Committee because it is non&hyphen;controversial, without understanding the context from which it comes. The context from which it comes is a slate of measures that the government has taken, which is driving our manufacturing base backwards and is restricting our capacity to get into export markets; and DIFF is one of those schemes.To give an example, in relation to the automotive industry, of how these export schemes work in encouraging manufactures, the Henderson seat operation in Adelaide is a very good case in point. It started 12 months ago from nothing. It takes leather from another company, Howe Leather—a beneficiary of the export facilitation scheme, but almost lost because of the bungling of that aggressive bilateralism that the Minister for Trade (Mr Fischer) goes parroting on about. That bungling almost cost Howe Leather its business in Australia, but that has been patched up in some way that has not been completely divulged to the public.Hendersons takes Howe leather and makes a seat for a vehicle which is exported. Hendersons is not part of the Mitsubishi plant in Adelaide, but is peripheral to it. It supplies those seats just in time. Every two hours, seats are going out into export vehicles. This is an example of what the export facilitation scheme has done. This is an example of a company in car componentry, which has mushroomed all around the country as a result of the car plan and a commitment to exports—just as DIFF was a commitment to getting exports up.There are 200 of these companies in the automotive industry all around the country and in regions around the country, and all of them employing between one and 400 people. These are the companies that are now under threat because of actions that the government will take, it is suggested, if it adopts the majority recommendations of the Productivity Commission.We know what the Treasurers stance is in all of this, because it was divulged over that cosy little dinner at the Commonwealth Club some two weeks ago—over cigars and port, the sort of nightcap that some of that side of politics revel in. Some even stay in this very lavish club, so they can afford to indulge a bit more. This is when the truth comes out, and the truth was, of course, revealed a couple of weeks ago. The Treasurers secret vision for the future of the car industry is to close Mitsubishi. There is not space for four automotive manufacturers in this country, and so we have to close one. This is the Treasury view.Let me say this: the mathematics of the automotive industry is such that, if you can get 100,000 units, a car plant is viable. If you want to keep four car manufacturers in this country, it is simple—you need 400,000 units.","N/A","EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start[5]/para","N/A","N/A"

If Ford decides to stay, that is up to it. But I tell you what: the government has a responsibility to keep an environment going in which the four can stay. That is their responsibility. And what do they do? They sit there, hiding behind the Productivity Commissions recommendations, giving no certainty and no direction.Labor does not sit there. Labor took the initiative and came forward with a six&hyphen;point plan for the automotive industry. It was one that froze the tariffs at 15 per cent from the year 2000; one that said that we should have a transparent measure as to what our trading partners do in reducing their level of protection; one that would have a review in 2003 to see where we would go after 2005. It was not retreating from the APEC agenda, but ensuring that our trading partners keep up with it, keeping the pressure upon them.","N/A","EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start[6]/para","N/A","N/A"

It is an issue that is important to the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth). They have been out there in the Adelaide Advertiser saying how they are supporting the car industry, but they will not come into this parliament and support it. We should perhaps use the opportunity to get some business on the agenda paper in another chamber to require them to vote in relation to where the Productivity Commission is heading us. Maybe this is not the appropriate forum to do it. If the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) insists on taking points of order to stop these important deliberations and the opportunities for members on our side to talk about these significant industries for the country, then be it on him.We know that their agenda is to push under the carpet the significance of these measures and their impact on exports. Whether it is the DIFF scheme, the changes in terms of EFIC, the export market development grants scheme or the specific industry plans, this is a government that is driving manufactures down. This is a government that is not committed to the growth of our manufacturing base, not committed to securing the continued growth of our heavy engineering industry and not going to continue to be clever with one of the important leverages available to government—that is, aid—to try not just to assist other countries, but at the same time to also use Australian manufactures in the process.Why shouldnt we be doing that? That is a win&hyphen;win situation. That is the circumstance that we should all be aiming for. That is why we need a bipartisan approach to these issues. This is not an issue just of budget bottom lines. If you say that, you are essentially arguing that you cut regardless of the consequences. If you ignore the consequences of what has happened to the DIFF scheme as a result of the bungling and incompetence of the foreign minister, you also ignore the impact that that scheme has had on significantly growing the heavy engineering base in this country.DIFF is a vital arrow in the quiver, if you like, for going out into the international marketplace and trying to win the battle. There are many arrows that have to be in the quiver and they have to be selected, because some of them will apply differently to different targets. But that is the nature of trade. It is the nature of manufacturing. It is the nature of picking where your niche opportunities are. Not government picking it—not that at all—but government saying to industries, `You get in there and compete on your own merits. But if, in fact, there isnt a level playing field, then we will try to level it up for you.There is not another country in the world competing for these projects in developing countries that does not back its heavy engineering industry. It is only Australia that dud its industry and it is only the Liberals in Australia that dud it. Labor was prepared to have a scheme. It was prepared to develop DIFF and the Export Finance Insurance Corporation. It was prepared to put the substance of government in partnership behind industry development. It is prepared to support the goers. You cannot just get up there and preach to manufacturers on the basis of, `Get out there, chase exports and we will see what happens. It does not work that way. It needs a partnership, and DIFF was a vital part of the partnership.The opposition, as I said, supports the measures that are before us today but it laments the circumstances in which it comes to us. It urges the government, and those who represent the government in this chamber today, to rethink its position, to restore the DIFF scheme, to honour its election promise in relation to DIFF and to keep the export market development grants scheme going. We urge them to adopt, in a bipartisan way, Labors plan for the automotive industry. If the government does not do that, we will see not just one manufacturer close but maybe all of them, and that will be a sorry day for Australia.This is a circumstance in which we can build the strength of one of our great industries, just as we can build on the strength of our heavy engineering capacity. But it will not happen on its own. It requires a partnership. It requires government to be working with industry. The great tragedy of this government is that it is not prepared to work with industry. It thinks it understands industry but it just has no idea. The litany of complaints that comes through from businesses these days is about the government not listening to them and not being prepared to act. It is a sorry indictment on a party that claims to represent business interests that those businesses now have to turn again to Labor to try to argue their case.I hope the government takes note of our concerns. We are offering a preparedness to be involved in a bipartisan way in the development of a sensible industry policy for this country; one that embraces schemes such as DIFF and the export market development grants scheme. The simple fact is that people in business need to plan on a longer&hyphen;term horizon than the term of one parliament. Just as we give certainty in the economic direction—the treasury line, if you like—we need an industry direction or line. We need to create the environment for certainty against which businesses can invest; an approach of certainty that, regardless of changes in government, will carry on.That is an expectation that people had, when they went to the last election, in relation to the DIFF scheme. It is a promise dishonoured—one of many. The government should be shamed on that ground alone. But let us look forward to where these industries can be taken. Let us try to support the heavy engineering capacity of this nation. Let us re&hyphen;establish the DIFF scheme, not just transfer the remnants of it to another arrangement against which those that were lucky enough to get in can still be administered. For all of those projects that were given the go&hyphen;ahead, we require that that be honoured. I think that is the appropriate course for us to follow. We would certainly join in any change to arrangements that saw that happen.","N/A","EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start[9]/para","N/A","N/A"

390,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr ZAMMIT","ZK6","(Lowe)","LP","N/A",2509,"—You are very welcome to it. I recall that, as I was importing these goods from Germany and from other countries, they approached me at a given time and said that they were willing to substantially increase the stockholding at no cost to me—very long term—to repay over a period of, say, 12 to 15 months. Because I had that flexibility, I did not need to obtain the finance to import goods from the other parts of the world that were of a similar nature and similar in price. That meant that my emphasis was on that product from Germany almost to the exclusion of that similar product from other parts of the world. The Germans were able to establish a very strong foothold in Australia for a product that was not manufactured in Australia. What that meant was that they were able to lock out their competitors from other parts of the world. That is one of the added incentives that is there for the government to get strongly involved in export finance.As the minister stated in his second reading speech, in last years budget the coalition government stated that DIFF loans would be divorced from EFIC and those liabilities transferred to the governments responsibility. The reason for that is the DIFF loans are invariably long&hyphen;term loans, in the vicinity of up to 25 years. This restricted EFIC in its ability to assist small and medium sized enterprises with their requirements, which are invariably for much shorter terms, with faster turnover and thus being able to assist more enterprises because of the faster turnover.The clients of EFIC are invariably small and medium sized enterprises with a very smallish turnover, in the vicinity of up to about $50 million. These are exactly the sorts of enterprises that are strong in manufacturing that need a bit of a boost to enter the export market and to develop Australias export drive, especially into the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region.In his second reading speech, the minister detailed the comparisons. A DIFF grant of some $120 million, needed to develop the export market of a small to medium sized company, translates roughly to an equivalent soft loan through EFIC of something like $350 million. That means that, because of the restriction of the time, less money is available to provide the necessary moneys for export. That has restricted EFIC very strongly. As a result, the potential to assist small and medium sized enterprises with quicker turnover and shorter term loans has been greatly enhanced.In 1995&hyphen;96, EFIC financed some $7.5 billion of Australian exports to more than 150 countries around the world, benefiting about 1,000 Australian enterprises. There is no doubt that a great deal of that business would have been lost because the availability of finance and the cost of export risk mitigation would have precluded those Australian enterprises from obtaining their share of the export markets around the world.The main function of a DIFF grant is to provide finance for Australias overseas aid programs, which are invariably focused in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. As a result, their exposure is concentrated in a small number of countries that are very regionalised just to the north of Australia. Consequently, EFIC found itself in the very unenviable position of having the risk unevenly balanced.When Australian exporters approached EFIC for funds to export products of a non&hyphen;aid type to the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, the problem was further exacerbated, especially in view of the fact that Australias exports are growing exponentially into the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. In other words, the risk factor is concentrated and it meant that EFIC had to look at expanding the risk and, as a result, had to reduce the amounts of money available for this non&hyphen;aid type export.The amendments will allow EFIC more room to move and to more efficiently expand loans for short to medium periods for enterprises wishing to export their goods, especially in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region. The Commonwealth will receive a special payment from EFIC of $40 million, which is intended to cover any potential losses that may occur, and the Commonwealth will pay EFIC a fee for managing the loans.This amendment will substantially strengthen EFICs role, which is a niche that needed to be filled because the private sector was unwilling and/or unable or reluctant to provide risk venture capital in some overseas markets because of the risks involved—and quite understandably. EFIC was able to provide that much needed service.EFIC has demonstrated that it can meet most of the Australian exporters requirements by operating on a commercial basis and paying its way, as well as building up reserves to meet potential future losses. In fact, not only has EFIC operated efficiently and effectively but, in addition, it has paid a dividend to the government during this financial year of $12.6 million. I strongly support the amendment to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment Bill 1997.","N/A","EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[7]/para","N/A","N/A"
391,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr PRICE","QI4","(Chifley)","ALP","N/A",2511,"—As you would be aware, the opposition is not opposing this legislation, which really removes the liabilities for DIFF funding from EFIC to the Commonwealth account. I did not hear all of the contribution of the honourable member for Lowe (Mr Zammit), but I do not think he once mentioned that the government he is a member of has actually cancelled DIFF. The scheme no longer exists. I am not sure whether it is out of embarrassment or shame that he is unable to say it. DIFF is no longer there.It is all very well to say, `EFIC is moving in and filling the gap, but, in fact, it has not changed at all. It is certainly not changed by this bill, other than having a liability removed from it to the Commonwealth, and having to pay $40 million to the Commonwealth in consideration of the Commonwealth assuming liabilities for about $1.7 billion worth of loans.This whole sorry saga of DIFF funding needs to be again placed on the record. Let me be quite frank. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), when in opposition—I think in about November 1995—asked the most comprehensive question on notice about DIFF funding to the then Minister Bilney and got a response. The coalition went into the election saying that they were going to maintain DIFF funding. Of course, we know once they were elected they cancelled it. One can only conclude that during the election there was dishonesty when the people of Australia were told that the coalition would maintain DIFF funding.We ought to reflect on the cancellation of this DIFF funding. The Development Import Finance Facility: why did we have it? In fact, it was the coalition that introduced DIFF funding in 1980. The first project under DIFF funding was approved in 1982—I might say with Labor Party support; it was bipartisan—but they were the ones that actually originated the scheme. You would think that they would demonstrate some pride of ownership. I note that the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) will follow me in this debate. Perhaps he, or whoever is going to be the next coalition speaker, might exhibit a little bit of pride of ownership.","N/A","EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

They put in, I think from memory, a $300 million bid into Indonesia for communications equipment. Quite frankly, when you discussed it with the officials there, it was not that it was an inferior bid; it was not that the equipment could not and would not have made a significant difference. But when push came to shove the decision really got around to what was the best form of financing—who was giving the better deal there. They were at a disadvantage. That meant that jobs in Ericssons were at risk.We keep on saying as parliamentarians—both sides, but we say it with a greater degree of genuineness—that we need to export more. Traditionally, in communications there have been very few exports. We were pushing companies like Ericssons into the export market. If they could not survive competitively in the bid with DIFF funding, how in the hell are they going to survive without DIFF funding?The member for Hotham (Mr Crean) has pointed out that this backflip by conservatives on DIFF funding and the actions of the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the beginning of their new term of office was a cause of extreme embarrassment, if not humiliation, for the minister and the government. And why was that so? He was reporting to the House that DIFF funding did not make any difference to our neighbours in our region because DIFF funding is very narrowly focused. There they were not concerned about the announced cancellation of the scheme and, of course, that proved to be grossly misleading.We went through a series of exposures one day after another where, far from being indifferent or not concerned about the cancellation of the scheme, and having contacted the minister, the ambassador, or high commissioner, or even having written letters to the minister, he was forced to come into the House and, effectively, make a grovelling apology and have the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) make it clear to the people of Australia that he was on a warning. He had not been sin&hyphen;binned; he had not been sent off, but he was on his warning. And so he deserved to be.But it brings no credit to this government to remove DIFF funding. We like to think in the Labor Party that we represent the workers and, indeed, we certainly strive to do that. We are absolutely concerned about jobs, about permanent jobs, and about growth in jobs and, given that obsession of ours, we are very concerned to ensure that the full range of measures is available to Australian industry and Australian services when they are producing here in Australia and, more particularly, when they are exporting. And it is quite clear that they need DIFF funding.I should have mentioned that there is a whole range of projects, involving some 50 companies in all, caught up by the cancellation of the scheme. If there is one thing that business really objects to, that narks them more than cutting expenditure, more than slashes, it is an inability to plan and know where a government is heading. And these companies were narked because the government did not say that they are going to cut the scheme off and give businesses some advance warning. They did it overnight, and projects that were in the middle of approval processes were caught up.Given that the coalition, the originators of the DIFF scheme, have now emasculated and removed it, perhaps the parliamentary secretary (Mr Andrew Thomson) who is going to sum up in this debate might tell us when he comes to this place: what were the conditions? Does he agree with me? What were their reasons for implementing the scheme in the first place, and have those conditions changed? Is Australian manufacturing industry so absolutely robust, flushed with funds and success that it no longer needs DIFF, and what are the implications of the cancellation of DIFF? How many Australian jobs are going to be lost? How many Australian dollars worth of exports are going to be lost because of the cancellation of DIFF funding?There is one other aspect of DIFF funding that I have not mentioned and that is that, yes, it certainly helps some companies get into the export business. But when you get into the export business, it does not conform to Australian accountants theory of business. You do not get success in three months, or six months, or twelve months. The export business is a long&hyphen;term business and you have got to be patient. You have got to be in there; you have got to prove yourself, and after a period of time one success will breed success again. So perhaps the parliamentary secretary might take the trouble to tell us how many Australian companies will be deterred from making that long&hyphen;term commitment to exports.","N/A","EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[5]/para","N/A","N/A"

But I do want to say this: the Australian Labor Party in opposition is most concerned to do all that it can do to work with industry. The member for Hotham talked about industry plans that had been put in place when we were in government. Of course we are proud of those industry plans. The essential feature of them is that you need, in the first instance, to sit down with the industry, whether that is management or the workers, to ascertain where they are and where they see the potential to be, and develop a plan based around that. Industry plans do not necessarily mean forking out taxpayers dollars for assistance. For example, the car plan involved an export facilitation approach. This did not cost any dollars, but it put the car manufacturers on notice that they really had to export. Again, with communications, it was looking at the role of the dominant carrier and the new carrier, Optus, in trying to get as many dollars and jobs as they are able to pull through Australian industry.We are not embarrassed or ashamed of the fact that we are concerned about Australian jobs and Australian exports. We are prepared to sit down with industry to work through the impediments to growth and export to ensure that if there is a role for government to play in that, we will play it. I think that when we go to the next election, there will be a distinct contrast between a Treasury&hyphen;led government indifferent to jobs and to firms surviving, and an opposition where we are concerned about Australian jobs, about growing Australian small and medium businesses and about developing plans that allow them to grow and to export. I think that when we go to the next election, the Australian people are going to see that we are reflecting their concerns on this. They are concerned about it. They are very worried about you mob over there because they believe that you have no commitment to Australian jobs or to Australian industry or services, and you may very well reap the reward of being indifferent to their concerns. We want to be assured on this side of the House that that does not happen to us.As I said, we support this bill, but I am looking forward to—I cannot stay—reading the parliamentary secretarys response—","N/A","EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[7]/para","N/A","N/A"

However, the opposition is deeply concerned about the context in which this legislation comes to the parliament which, as previous speakers have said, arises from the governments decision, against its election commitments, to abolish the DIFF scheme.Not a lot has been said in the debate about some of the more recent statistics of EFIC, and I will take a few moments of the Main Committees time to illustrate how important EFIC is as an organisation to Australian exporters. According to its annual report, in 1995&hyphen;96 it supported almost $7.5 billion in Australian exports, up some 20 per cent. It had 240 new clients, most of which were small to medium enterprises, 60 per cent of which were manufacturers. Its insurance against non&hyphen;payment increased by 14 per cent to $6.5 billion. It introduced export finance guarantees, which are a package of EFIC and bank arrangements which provide competitive, medium to long&hyphen;term finance to Australian exporters. The first loan under that arrangement was made in July 1996 for a project in Thailand. We are talking about an organisation which is growing in importance in terms of Australias export effort, and one which ought to be acknowledged, I am sure, on a bipartisan basis.But we need to understand, as other speakers have said, that EFIC and Australian exporters operate in a pretty competitive world, and a pretty competitive one in relation to access to finance and insurance. I had a look at some figures that were produced recently in an OECD publication. They are a little dated, but they show the scale of support from organisations comparable to EFIC in other countries with relatively small economies, such as Austria. In 1992, Austria provided cover for export contracts of some 296&half; billion Austrian schillings. On a quick and dirty calculation, that works out at about over $A32 billion. Swedens equivalent organisation to EFIC can incur liabilities of up to 72 billion Swedish kronor, which works out at about $A12&half; billion. Germany, which the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit) referred to, at the end of 1991 had commitments of DM152 billion—on the OECD figures I had—for export credit insurance, working out at some $A117 billion.I have a slightly more generous view of the example the member for Lowe gave about his experience as an importer than has the member for Chifley (Mr Price). In a somewhat garbled way, I must concede—and perhaps that is why he confused the member for Chifley—the member for Lowe was making a point, as an importer dealing with a German company, about just how important the package of financial support was that the German company was able to offer him. When you look at the figure of over DM152 billion as the level of commitment that the German equivalent to EFIC offers to its exporters, you can understand what a competitive world this country is operating in, and why it is so important that EFIC be supported. You can see what a tragedy it is for a range of Australian industries, particularly in the engineering area, that the government has proceeded to break its election commitments and abolish DIFF.EFICs last annual report gives some examples of DIFF supported projects—the sorts of projects which are now not going to happen, which is going to place Australian companies at a huge competitive disadvantage compared with their overseas competitors. A $17 million project for China of machinery for filtering or purifying water is just one that springs to my attention, with the Overseas Project Corporation of Victoria having a project of $6.7 million for a water treatment plant in China. In Indonesia, the Vocational and Technical Training Corporation of Australia has a $27 million occupational health and safety project. In the Philippines, AWA has a project of $30 million for the upgrading and rehabilitation of existing metro&hyphen;Manila traffic signal systems. These are just some of the projects listed in the EFIC annual report, projects which are simply not going to be there in future. Australian companies are simply not going to have a competitive advantage in obtaining those sorts of projects.I recently picked up another example in the Philippines of a $40 million BP solar project, which apparently is one of the last ones that slipped through the net, as it were, with EFIC making an announcement about providing a concessional loan which included a $13 million Australian government grant from AusAID. As I said, these are going to cost Australians jobs. They have also cost, and are going to cost, Australia a great deal in terms of its international reputation.If we were talking about an inefficient scheme, one that was not achieving its mark, one might argue that the government could have acted appropriately in wanting to review it. But in government budget papers, in Budget Related Paper No. 2 on the 1995&hyphen;96 Australian overseas aid program, there is a report of the review by AusAID which says:The review also found that the DIFF had generated substantial commercial benefits for Australia.This is in addition to the earlier part of the report which talks about the benefits offshore to recipient countries of DIFF. The report goes on to say:Almost all firms surveyed reported that DIFF had been important to their business, with half stating it was either crucial or very important to their operations. Commercial returns from 51 of the 53 projects—involving some $285m of AusAID funds—were examined in detail. The 51 projects resulted in expenditure in Australia worth some $709m. Follow&hyphen;on business already won by companies at the time of the survey, and directly related to the original DIFF project, was estimated at $263m. Firms indicated they expected to achieve further follow&hyphen;on business, in the order of $400m, by the end of 1994.Companies indicated there was a range of significant, but non&hyphen;quantifiable, benefits arising from the scheme. For many organisations, a DIFF project was their first overseas contract; several noted that undertaking the project had internationalised their firm and had changed their focus from solely concentrating on the domestic market to including a significant export orientation in their activities. Other important benefits arising from participation included: establishing credibility in international markets; enabling investments in plant and equipment; fostering new research and development initiatives; gaining international experience for staff; and setting up joint ventures.And so the report goes on. What this government has done is to throw out all those gains—gains which are directly quantifiable in many respects—and also many gains which, while not quantifiable, are clearly contributing and have contributed towards an export culture for Australian enterprises. It is a real tragedy that this has occurred.It has also been very damaging for Australias international credibility. Media reports last year in the period when Alexander Downer, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was making a real dill of himself on this issue, make that quite clear. In the Financial Review of 17 May, there is a quote from the Chinese Ambassador which says:Should those projects be scrapped off, it would not only cause financial losses on the Chinese side, but also would do no good to the Australian side in terms of its credibility and business interests in China, he said.We are all aware that the Prime Minister is visiting China shortly. We wish him success in trying to repair some of the problems and issues that exist in that very vital relationship. But the governments performance in DIFF is undoubtedly one of the significant factors that significantly damaged Australias position with China.In the same article that I have referred to in the Financial Review , the Philippines Ambassador attacked the governments decision. She said that the abolition of DIFF would be damaging to Australias image in Asia. It certainly was damaging, and is damaging, in terms of Australias reputation as a reliable long&hyphen;term partner in a range of commercial activities.I come back to what, in some respects, is possibly the most important point of all, and that is that this government is putting Australian firms on an increasingly uneven playing field. There is no doubt that the Japanese, German, French, Italian and Spanish companies that will be competing for projects throughout Asia, the Pacific and elsewhere, and that are receiving soft loans or mixed credits from their governments, are going to be in a substantially improved competitive position vis&hyphen;a&hyphen;vis Australian companies. That is simply stupidity on the governments part.","N/A","EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[1]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
407,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr ANDREW THOMSON","FB6","(Wentworth—","LP","Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs)",2517,"—It is my task, in the absence of the minister, to sum up the debate on this bill. It is really rather a small, perhaps technical bill in the greater scheme of things. It has come from a decision made in the process of the 1996&hyphen;97 budget and it is essentially about improving the efficiency and effectiveness of EFIC, a government business enterprise that is of demonstrated value to our exporters. One of its roles in the past has been to deliver DIFF loans under an agreement with AusAID, the agency that I have some responsibility for.The government announced the scrapping of DIFF last year during the election campaign, a promise that was kept in the budget last year with some adjustment, and formed part of the governments deficit reduction strategy, which is a central plank of our economic policy. An unintended consequence of the use of EFIC in this role was pressure on EFICs capitalisation, which was adversely affecting its ability to assist exporters in the two markets—Indonesia and China—where DIFF had been concentrating. It is a case perhaps of not wanting to put too many eggs in the one basket. As these loans were very long-term loans—in the case of Indonesia, 25 years—they were tying up a large amount of EFICs capital. The EFIC board advised the government of this problem, that in effect there were too many eggs in the one basket. As a result, the government decided to remove DIFFs liabilities from EFIC and place them on the governments account.As the government will henceforth be directly assuming some $1.7 billion in liabilities for these loans, it was decided also that EFIC be required to transfer to the government some of the capital that it was holding as a measure against the risk of default on these loans. The figure of $40 million contained in this bill represents less than half the capital tied up by EFIC for these loans. The result is that it will dramatically free up EFICs ability to provide medium&hyphen;term and long-term finance in support of our exporters, and for this reason of course it has the full support of EFICs board. EFIC will continue to administer these loans and will be paid an administration fee by the government for doing so. The government will, however, be liable to reimburse EFIC for any losses occasioned by loan defaults or other interruptions to payment on the DIFF loans.I have not had perhaps as much opportunity to listen to the arguments put by opposition speakers on this bill, although I welcome their gracious act in supporting it. My friend the member for Chifley (Mr Price) I heard on the monitor as I was preparing to leave my office to make my way to the chamber. I believe he asked whether I had any pride of ownership in Australias exports—perhaps that is what he meant. I simply ask: does the member for Chifley likewise have pride of ownership in the sort of disruption we see on our waterfronts? Or does he share pride of ownership perhaps in acts such as Mr Keltys letter to Chubu Electric Power, advising them not to buy Australian coal? If that is the sort of thing that the organisation that supports his party is liable to do, I wonder if he would volunteer that same sort of pride. I have pride in lower interest rates, I have pride in a more flexible labour market, and I have pride in some of those Australian products such as our great wines, for example. My friend the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) is sitting here beside me and, indeed, I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, which are the finer wines, those from his electorate or those from yours?

416,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr LEE","MG4","(Dobell)","ALP","N/A",2518,"—I would like to begin my contribution on the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1996 by placing on record the oppositions continuing support for the review of the food standards code. We recognise that is a substantial undertaking for the Food Authority.The opposition also supports the stated intention of the bill to improve the planning and financial management of the Food Authority. But we question whether this bill will really bring about reform or whether it is more to do with budget cuts to the authority and the government setting up arbitrary charging powers for the authority to make up the shortfall which was announced by the government in the budget.The bill enables the government to make substantial savings by cutting funds to the Food Authority. It does so by setting up a process which allows the authority to charge applicants for dealing with their applications. The provisions which give the Food Authority these charging powers are extremely broad. The opposition believes they need to be far more explicit.The basis on which those charges can be levied appears arbitrary and possibly ill thought out. There is certainly not sufficient detail in this bill to demonstrate otherwise. The bill allows the Food Authority to impose charges or to waive them, but it does not provide sufficient information on how or why this will be done. I believe it would be far better if the government had provided explicit criteria for these circumstances.Similarly, it is of concern that there are apparently no guidelines for the Food Authority decisions on which applications will be treated as a priority. There is nothing in the legislation which indicates which particular food groups or applications will be processed free of charge and which will be subject to full cost recovery.I understand that the government might believe that regulations or some other administrative procedures might make that clearer. But, at this stage, the parliament is dealing with this bill unless we can have some draft regulations made available or the government can provide some greater clarity on this. I think that is to be encouraged.It is clearly in the interests of all parties to have a clear and explicit set of rules so that applicants know well in advance what procedures are to be followed and what charges will be involved in any application. It is also important that there be appropriate appeal mechanisms available. My understanding of the bill is that there is no provision for industry to appeal against a decision to impose cost recovery.The government is asking to be taken on trust on this important legislation, and I do not think that is good enough. The opposition has demonstrated in the past that we were prepared to deal constructively with proposals for genuine reform, but we do not look kindly on half&hyphen;baked savings schemes, especially not in an industry as important as this, with such enormous potential for future growth in exports. There is a real danger that this legislation, which is being introduced during a period of reform for the Food Authority, will undermine the current reform program—which would be a very unfortunate outcome for the industry and for Australian consumers.Whilst the opposition will not be seeking to oppose the legislation in the House of Representatives, that is on the basis that we understand that the legislation is going to be subject to close scrutiny in the Senate. Of course, the opposition reserves the right to move amendments in the other place. We will be hoping to consult not just with the industry but also with the government, the department and the Food Authority, to try to see if there are some amendments that perhaps in consultation we could put together to try to deal with the concerns that I have raised this morning.Senator Neal, on behalf of the opposition, is certainly willing to sit down with the industry and to see if there are suggestions that can be made for ways to improve the industrys understanding of how the act will be administered. In my electorate there are two companies which might be known to members of the House and which will be affected by this bill. The Sanitarium Health Food Company and Master Foods have built substantial factories and employ a large number of my constituents. They are members of the Australian Food Council, which has raised a number of queries about their concerns about the arbitrary powers that are to be given to the authority to fix charges and to place certain levies on applicants.I will quote from one letter from the Chairman of the Australian Food Council, W. Murray Rogers. The letter describes the legislation in these terms:It is extremely disappointing, therefore, that the Government should introduce such broad and one&hyphen;sided legislation at the very time that the entire industry is seeking to achieve a more cost&hyphen;effective and efficient system of food regulations which can deliver safer, quality foods to consumers at the most competitive prices. Despite the unfortunate timing of this legislation, the industry will continue to pursue this objective with the Government.And that is certainly the shared objective of the opposition. Before the bill gets to a final vote in the Senate, we hope that we can clarify those concerns.The other issue I want to raise this morning is an issue I am sure some members of this house have heard some of the opposition members raise on many occasions, and that is the issue of chicken meat. I know that this bill does not directly deal with quarantine regulations and imports of chicken meat, but there was a so&hyphen;called expert on radio this morning stating that he had concerns about the level of antibiotics fed to chickens, and about whether that results in people who consume the chicken meat—and, certainly, people who work with the chickens and are exposed to the antibiotics—having in their bodies viruses which could increase their resistance to these antibiotics.People are aware that there are some very aggressive diseases that are resistant to some of the best antibiotics in the world, and that some of these diseases can cause great distress and illness in some of our hospitals, both public and private. We need to be very careful about how we use antibiotics, in order to make sure that we are not the only century that has the ability to control diseases through the use of antibiotics.I understand that there are probably some industry codes that are followed by the chicken growing industry in Australia, codes that seek to put limits on the levels of antibiotics that are fed to chickens grown in Australia. I would be interested to know the answer to the question I raise in connection with this legislation—even if the minister takes it on notice, as I do not expect an answer off the cuff this morning. If the officials know, I am keen to know whether the Food Authority in Australia does actually set a limit on the level of antibiotics in any of our foods, and in particular, in chicken meat. If we do not do so already, should we have such a limit? In particular, if we do not have any such limits in Australia, what action do we intend to take against the possible importation of Thai chicken meat, which I am informed is subject to much less rigorous standards?Chickens grown in Thailand apparently are fed much larger concentrations of antibiotics. I am sure that means that more chickens survive, but it also means that those of us who consume the chicken meat are ingesting higher levels of antibiotics. In the long term that might mean we have diseases in Australia that are resistant to antibiotics and that may become more common in Australian hospitals. That would be a retrograde step. I know this issue is not directly connected to the bill, but can we get some advice on whether we have any standards on levels of antibiotics? I am not even sure that we can measure these concentrations—because they might be quite low—or whether we simply rely on the practices of various industries to limit their use of antibiotics.As I say, the opposition is generally supportive of the aims of the legislation but we have reservations about the arbitrary powers given to the authority. We would be hopeful that further consultations with the government and the industry might allow us to clarify, if not resolve, some of those concerns.","N/A","AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
417,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mrs STONE","EM6","(Murray)","LP","N/A",2521,"—I speak today in support of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1996. This bill will enable the authority to establish a standards review work program which will set priorities for food safety, consumer protection, and international and industry harmonisation issues over the next three years. The bill therefore redresses deficiencies in the current legislation which prevent the authority from having the capacity to plan, manage and prioritise its workload.The amendments change the statutory obligation to finalise applications within 12 months. The authority will no longer have to assess applications on a first come, first serve basis and it will no longer be obliged to assess each application individually. Current requirements have prevented the authority in the past from undertaking comprehensive and thorough reviews of groupings of foods.No&hyphen;one here would dispute the importance of the Australia-New Zealand food industry. In Australia that industry is worth over $40 billion per year and this figure is, of course, substantially higher when the New Zealand industry is included. We would all agree that Australia enjoys an extremely close relationship with New Zealand, both culturally and geographically. We have no language barriers. We share a common colonial heritage which means that our food, in particular, is similar. It costs less to transfer food between Australia and New Zealand than it often costs to transport it from one side of Australia to the other. Thus this bill, which helps facilitate the food exchanges between the two countries, is of enormous mutual economic advantage to the two countries.New Zealand has a population of 3.64 million and that provides it with a food market in Australia roughly six times that of its own domestic market. New Zealand is our third largest trading partner; the trans&hyphen;Tasman food trade is now worth more than $1 billion annually. This bill builds on the cooperative and mutually beneficial economic and trade framework first developed under the Australia&hyphen;New Zealand closer economic relations trade agreement. It is a logical extension of that agreement and it is part of our building on that agreement. We expect that the outcomes of these amendments will provide an even closer model of cooperation, one that other people in this region look to as a model of coordination, cooperation and mutual satisfaction.Already, the closer economic relations trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand has eliminated barriers to trade between the two countries and it has led, in particular, to the creation of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. In many ways, this authority complements the new Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill—which was recently in the House and debated in this chamber—which will allow goods legally sold in an Australian jurisdiction to be sold in New Zealand without further testing and vice versa. Producers only have to ensure that their products comply with the laws in the home country in order for them to be available and saleable in the other.The new Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill, for example, opens up substantially new opportunities in the confectionery and dairy manufacturing areas. We can therefore expect, with the passage of the new Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Bill, a substantially greater workload for the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. The amendments contained in this ANZFA amendment bill that we have before us this morning will improve our ability to handle that increased workload. The two bills are a step towards mutual recognition and harmonisation of food standards between Australia and New Zealand and this, of course, has implications for a greater food trade beyond the two countries and into Asia.The National Food Authority—that is, the Australian Food Authority—was formed in 1991, in consultation with industry, governments and the community, to ensure uniformity in food standards across Australia. Australian governments accepted the food standards as recommended by the national authority. In 1995, New Zealand joined and legislation was passed forming the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. This ANZFA initiative allows for a joint food standards setting system for Australia and New Zealand. As I said before, it provides for harmonisation of food standards and consumer information on the ingredients in foods between the two countries. The authority is responsible for developing, varying and reviewing standards for food available in Australia and New Zealand, as well as coordinating national food surveillance and recall systems.The authority is funded by the Australian and New Zealand governments, as well as by industry. In particular, the objectives of the authority in developing or varying standards are, chiefly: the protection of public health and safety; the provision of information to consumers to enable them to make informed choices about foods; to prevent fraud and deception; the promotion of fair trading in food and the promotion of trade and commerce in the food industry. As well, the authority aims to achieve the harmonisation of Australian and New Zealand food standards with international food standards, provided that those standards are not lower than the Australian and New Zealand requirements.At present, we are faced with the unacceptable situation where the Australia New Zealand Food Authority is unable to meet its management objectives, or to effectively develop any comprehensive joint food standard systems or, indeed, to harmonise food standards and consumer information. This situation has arisen due to the current regulatory and legislative framework which, as I mentioned before, places severe restrictions on the authoritys flexibility and ability to control its own targets, priorities and management plans. In particular, the authority needs assistance in achieving its main objectives and targets as it aims to produce a food standards code by March 1998.Given the importance of the growing economic relationship between Australia and New Zealand, it is essential that we address the problems created by the current framework of ANZFA. This bill addresses those problems. The main obstacles facing the authoritys attempts to be totally efficient are, firstly, that the authority, as I said before, has no control over a number of applications it is legally bound to handle at any one time. It must accept all applications that meet certain basic criteria. As well, the authority currently has a legal obligation to complete the relevant assessment of each application within 12 months, regardless of the circumstances and where the application fits in relation to public safety or industry priorities. If there is an urgent requirement the authority cannot bend its rules. The authority must assess the applications in order of receipt, effectively on a first come, first served basis, irrespective of any more urgent demands or later applications.The authority also has an obligation to assess each application individually. This leads to a fragmented response and approach to food standards and it undermines the important principle that the National Food Authority has, which is that it should achieve a coordinated, thorough and effective response to assessing food standards throughout Australia and New Zealand. In particular, the authority cannot respond urgently to public health and safety matters. It must take the products as they come in to it, strictly in order of first in, first to be dealt with.These proposed amendments will help to advance the authority to a position where it will be a leader in the field of setting and monitoring food standards internationally. They will also help, as I said before, to ensure cooperation and the continued advancement of the mutuality between Australia and New Zealand in relation to trade in food products, and in doing so will advance the closer economic ties between the two countries. This new program will be supported by industry, the states, the territories in Australia, and New Zealand. All major stakeholders will be consulted.In terms of setting the new work plans that this amendment makes possible, the industry will be consulted in order to ascertain which priorities are pre&hyphen;eminent in the industry. The main players will be consulted. They include federal, state and territory governments in Australia, as well as New Zealand.Applications that are given a priority will be assessed within 12 months and without charge. Other applications that do not fall within the new priorities of the three&hyphen;year work plan will still be accepted and assessed, but on the basis of cost recovery or fee for service. If the relevant charges are not paid, the assessment will be able to be delayed until the charge is paid. This latter amendment is in line with the contemporary approach to cost recovery and with industry cooperation and commitment to their own regulatory regimes. It gives the industry greater flexibility and autonomy. The industry can set its own priorities and it can control its own future.There are a number of recent cases in Australia where the standards of food have caused major community concern. For example, we had a recent scare with Kraft Foods and their peanut products. This is an example where, if you have a more flexible authority, you can have urgent and instant action. We have seen the damage when food safety is allowed to be compromised. In fact, in that case it has cost the industry many millions of dollars both in reclaiming a lost market share and in having to recall their product.Nestle Australia discovered that, under the old regime, if their frozen food is prepared in Australia, New Zealand health standards require that the chicken be cooked for longer than required in Australia, even though in Australia we agree that the cooking times and temperatures are adequate for public health safety.Without harmonisation, Nestle has to have special runs in cooking product that is to be exported to New Zealand. This involves cleaning a line each time and a changeover of production schedules. There is no doubt that food standard harmonisation is essential for cost-effective industry. It is also essential for the safety of all consumers.In my electorate, SPC fruit products, the canners, have complained that since New Zealand joined the food authority the time taken to process applications has increased. They have expressed considerable support for these amendments, understanding that under these amendments the times will again be reduced and they can get on with exporting the best possible product with minimum red tape and time required for them to address multiple layers of bureaucracy.As outlined previously, the authority will now be able to charge fee for service for assessments that are not classed as priority issues under their three&hyphen;year work plan. That is very important for a government which sees industry paying its way.The national food regulatory framework, and this new ANZFA in particular, underpins consumer confidence in the safety of Australian and New Zealand food supplies. Its maintenance and its standards, its integrity, is therefore of enormous value to both countries and, as I said before, to our exports.As I noted before, industry is one of the main beneficiaries of the work of this authority. Industry will now contribute more substantially to covering the costs but industry will also be a partner in the authoritys new ability to be flexible with its work plans. It is a win&hyphen;win situation all round.The country of origin labelling laws in Australia and New Zealand are a critical part of our food standards, and as we march together to comply with World Trade Organisation standards, new flexible arrangements with the ANZFA bill will make sure that our food labelling is as coherent and transparent as possible, and that our products are immediately recognisable in terms of their contents and their standards of safety.This is a very important bill. The amendments to be introduced will substantially improve our ability as two countries—Australia and New Zealand—to have the worlds safest food products. It also means that our products can be seen internationally as being of the highest standard.There is no doubt that, with the markets in Asia burgeoning only a very short distance from us, there is increased emphasis on the quality of the foods that all nations consume. These qualities include being able to identify that there are very few additives, that there are minimum chemical levels, that the food is fresh and absolutely complies with what its labelling states. In fact, this new set of amendments makes sure that, into the future, Australia and New Zealand will be known internationally as countries that produce the best foodstuffs in the world.","N/A","AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Having been the parliamentary secretary responsible for the authority in the three&hyphen;year period of the last Labor government, and having been involved directly in the negotiation of the treaty which formed the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, I take a keen interest in the development of the authority. It is good to see the officers of the authority here.Having said that, I must say that I am very concerned at a problem which has arisen. The member for Murray was mistaken in her comment that industry is happy with this bill. I do not know where she gets that idea from, because the key industry organisations are very concerned about this bill. I might say that—","N/A","AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

420,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Dr THEOPHANOUS","QJ4","(Calwell)","ALP","N/A",2524,"—I will explain what I am doing on the bill—you just keep quiet and pay close attention to the comments I am going to make. The situation is that, during the period of the previous Labor government—and certainly when I was parliamentary secretary—all issues concerning the National Food Authority were dealt with in a very consultative way with industry. Indeed, I worked together with representatives from consumer organisations, industry and other stakeholders from state governments. I used to often bring these representatives together, or ask the authority to bring the representatives together, and we would discuss these issues. If a matter arose, as it did, for example, with the country of origin exercise, the labelling exercise which was very long and difficult and where there were significant differences of view, even then we brought people together.Therefore, I was a bit shocked to see that the peak body of the food industry in Australia, the Australian Food Council, has written to the opposition and basically they are so concerned with this bill that they say in their conclusion:Our concerns are so fundamental that the preferred course of action is the withdrawal of the bill pending resolution of the ongoing debate about the imposition of charges in the industry. Simple amendment cannot satisfy these concerns.The industry wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). We are not just talking about one food industry, we are talking about the Council of Food Industries. They wrote to the Prime Minister expressing their concerns about this bill and the issues that were raised. As I say, what is really puzzling to me is the poor administration in this government which has led to this situation.I do not blame the authority. I do not blame the industry. I blame whoever was responsible in the government—and, of course, it is a bit difficult to determine who was responsible because we have had changes of the relevant parliamentary secretary—but, nevertheless, whoever was responsible has not done his job. A good job has not been done here because you cannot go to the parliament with a bill that is so universally opposed by the major industry with which it is dealing. This is a very reasonable point.As the shadow minister, Michael Lee, has indicated, although we will allow passage of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1996, we will be moving amendments in the Senate. Those amendments are intended to take account of the concerns not just of industry but also of others in relation to the issues which have been raised. As I say, I am puzzled that we got to this position because, as someone who was involved so intimately—virtually on a daily basis—in matters concerning the National Food Authority, I have been happy to see all the developments in the closer economic relations that have taken place between Australia and New Zealand because of the formation of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority and as a result of the different aspects that we have taken up.It is a unique structure. We are not objecting to the idea that there have to be certain other provisions to deal with the workload of the authority. But the question is: does this bill adequately deal with those? We do not believe that it does. The shadow minister, Michael Lee, indicated that there are certain serious problems because there are not specific regulations put forward. Maybe it is the intention of the government to bring specific regulations to help determine which of these groups are going forward as non fee for service and which are going forward as fee for service. It appears that we do not have any indication of those regulations and that is one of the things that we will be asking to have a look at.One of the concerns raised by the industry is that it is going to give the food authority the ability, as it is presently worded, to charge willy&hyphen;nilly in relation to the industry. There are two basic concerns. Firstly, because it is unclear which are going to fall within the charged group and which are not—and it is left very much up to the authority—there will be a real risk that the authority increasingly and effectively will, as the letter from the food council says, push applications into the fee for service category and levy charges at any figure it determines, subject to the taxation caveat discussed in the legal opinion which has been presented on this matter.It seems to me that this objection has not been dealt with. No&hyphen;one is saying that the authority is inefficient, or anything of that sort, but let us assume that under the current administration anything can happen. If we have a situation in the future, there could be an incentive for the authority, as the food council says, to push applications into this fee for service category when they should have been in the other category, and then impose further burdens on the industry.Already we are saying that one of the reasons we formed the Australia New Zealand Food Authority was that we wanted to streamline the determination of food standards at the state level, at the federal level and with New Zealand into the one body, to have not only uniformity for consumers but also efficiency in terms of the charges which are put on industry. I do not think that it is an unreasonable request from industry to seek clarification of this. One has to ask why the Prime Minister has not responded to these concerns of industry which were raised with him by the chairman of the Australian Food Council on 9 December 1996. I would be interested to see what the ministers answer is to that.The situation is that we are interested in getting this bill through and in getting the main ideas of this bill through, but we are not going to support clauses which effectively are going to totally alienate the very industries that the food authority is supposed to be dealing with. That would be totally counterproductive and I cannot understand why this has taken place.I will now go to the other point, which is this question of the authority having the ability to determine which applications fall within, and which fall without, its predetermined work programs. In principle, that does not sound too bad, and one might say that they can have a look at the work program. But one has got to ask: if the authority is aware of the situation, and it knows that some applicants have a good ability to pay and others do not, then it might be tempted to predetermine its work program on the basis of saying, `We know that this lot is not going to have the ability to pay, and we know that this group has the ability to pay. Therefore, an arbitrary selection, or a selection based on the possible ability of the applicant to pay rather than on the merits of the work program, could make a determination. This reinforces the need for some kind of regulation or indication about the work program to be put in the context of this bill.It is true that the industry does have a representative on the committee looking at the work program but, of course, there is no necessity for that representative to be listened to. I think that in dealing with industry—at least this was my experience when I was parliamentary secretary—especially in this regulatory area, it is always good to have them on side about these matters.It is not as if the industry says, `We will not pay. One of the things that I certainly achieved, and even my predecessors achieved, was the agreement of industry to pay their fair share in this process for the National Food Authority. But when there are concerns about equity, when there are concerns about the application of the system, it is time for the authority and the minister responsible to talk again to industry and come out with some resolution.That is the general structure of my comments about the bill but I want to say that we can resolve this in a positive way if the minister wishes to discuss it with the industry. We in the opposition are happy to discuss it. In other words, I am talking here about a constructive resolution of the problem. We think that it is possible to bring together industry, other stakeholders and the Food Authority to find a way out of this impasse and achieve the goals of allowing the authority to have certain structured work programs, as well as achieve the goals of equity and of an efficient charging system—and keep the parties quite happy in the process.This is not an impossible job. I can say that there were much more impossible and difficult jobs than this one that the Food Authority and I had to negotiate. The honourable member for Murray referred to one of those. We have to take a grip on ourselves and ask, `Do we really want a battle in this situation? I have indicated very clearly that, if the government persists with this approach, we will move amendments in the Senate and we will seek to gain the support of the minor parties for our amendments so as to be sure that the concerns of industry and of others are met in relation to the comments that I made.I conclude by saying something about the interrelationship between the Food Authority and the recent actions that have been taken to move everything back to state governments. I give a word of warning, now that we are discussing the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill, about the general tendency of the coalition government to push things back onto the states. I hope that we are not going to be tempted to hand back powers that currently exist in the Food Authority to the state governments.One of the things that came out during the period I was parliamentary secretary was the frustration we had about the fact that far too many of the features that involved ensuring that the rules and the laws were actually met rested on state governments. We should be thinking about a national enforcement regime in food standards if we are really going to try to prevent the sorts of sensational cases that happen, such as when the little girl died in Adelaide because of salami poisoning. That had a dramatic impact on the whole of that industry for a long time. When we look at what happened, the Food Authority had done everything properly. The problem was that the government of South Australia had not, in terms of enforcement of food standards.The minister who is going to be responsible for the Australia New Zealand Food Authority in the future should be aware that we need to look at that issue. It is all very well to set standards, to have consumer protection councils looking at things and to have proper labelling—and that has been one of the big issues on which ANZFA has done a great job—but in the final analysis, you have to look at the enforcement of standards.This is where many of the state governments have starved it of resources, and yet they feel when it suits their interests that perhaps they ought to think about taking back some of the powers that have been given to the Food Authority. I think any such pressure should be totally resisted. We should be looking at the opposite, which is to increase the powers of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority in the enforcement area.

421,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr SLIPPER","0V5","(Fisher)","LP","N/A",2527,"—When one listens to many of the comments made by my colleagues in this place on the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill, it is obvious that the Australia New Zealand Food Authority is held in fairly high regard, as is the work it has done since it was established in 1995. The aim of this bill is to enable the Food Authority to better manage, plan and prioritise its workload. I suspect that no&hyphen;one would be opposed to such an idea.It is important that Australia maintains its reputation for clean food. It is eminently sensible, given the closeness of the relationship between this country and New Zealand, that we have cooperative arrangements such as that set up when the National Food Authority became the Australia New Zealand Food Authority in 1995. That legislation enabled the full participation of New Zealand, with the aim of having common food standards and common food quality between the two countries across the Tasman.Increasingly, we are becoming a single market. It has been pointed out that it is wise, wherever possible, that common standards exist. The honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) stressed the need for a national approach and for national standards. Most people would agree that it would be ridiculous to vary standards but, equally, it would be a nonsense to have differing standards in Australia and in New Zealand.I wish to question, however, the competence of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority in the way in which it seems to be determined to damage the health of Australians by increasing the level of cadmium which is permissible in foods. The Australia New Zealand Food Authority has failed to consult widely with respect to its proposal to increase the level of cadmium from 0.05 milligrams per kilogram to 0.1 milligrams per kilogram.This approach by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority has concerned me greatly. While I support the principles of this legislation, I am worried that within the legislation we find that the Australia New Zealand Food Authority is able to bring forward proposals which will undermine the productivity and incomes of Australian food producers. In addition, it will be placing in jeopardy the health of Australians of various ages.I have received numerous representations from around my electorate from people who are extremely concerned at the proposal to increase the acceptable cadmium levels in foods and, in particular, in peanuts. Until recently it was considered gospel that cadmium is extremely dangerous in foods beyond 0.05 milligrams per kilogram. Research has indicated that long&hyphen;term exposure to cadmium might lead to considerable accumulation in the liver and kidneys, particularly in the renal cortex, resulting in liver damage.The Australian and New Zealand Food Authority recently decided that cadmium levels could safely be increased to 0.1 milligrams per kilogram without affecting the health of consumers. This appears to run contrary to research done throughout the world which indicates that what we should be doing is seeking to reduce the level of cadmium, rather than increasing it. Yet the Australia New Zealand Food Authority appears to be heading along the direction of increasing the level of cadmium. I see that as being totally unacceptable and I hope that the Food Authority rethinks this proposal.It ought to be noted also that the main argument advanced by the food authority for increasing the level of cadmium, particularly with respect to peanuts, is that this is a non&hyphen;tariff barrier excluding the importation of peanuts to this country. The simple fact is that every peanut producing country in the world can meet the Australian standards for cadmium and I have to ask: why should the Australian New Zealand Food Authority seek to expose the Australian public to twice the cadmium level when there is simply no need? At present, there is no restriction on the importation into Australia of peanuts which meet the current guidelines as peanut producing countries throughout the world have no difficulty in meeting the standards which we currently have.Australian producers, and particularly those in the South Burnett and Kingaroy areas of my electorate, have worked very hard over many years to ensure that their peanuts are as free as possible from cadmium and other residues. Cadmium is a heavy metal that is possibly a major contributor to kidney disease and it can cause bone disorders. High risk groups include young children, pregnant women, vegetarians and smokers. Given the very real concerns and the fact that there has not been adequate consultation, I think it is important that the Australian New Zealand Food Authority re&hyphen;considers this matter.There have been some studies done in Sweden and I wish to refer to an article in a publication in August 1996. It says:. . . exposure to cadmium can give rise to a tubular kidney dysfunction which may proceed to a more generalised renal damage and bone disease if exposure has been high and prolonged. Recent scientific work shows that early renal effects develop at lower levels of exposure than previously anticipated. Previous risk assessments for cadmium were mainly based on studies on healthy male workers. The general population, however, also include particularly susceptible groups such as elderly and individuals with illnesses (e.g. diabetes) that may predispose the cadmium&hyphen;induced health effects. A significant proportion of the general population displays early signs of toxicity already at urinary cadmium concentrations around 3 mmol creatinine. In addition to early tubular effects, cadmium may exert direct or indirect effects on mineral metabolism and the materialization of the skeleton at relatively low levels of exposure. This may have important health implications as poor and easily fractured bones is a major problem among the elderly in all industrialised countries.It is interesting to note that in Sweden the cadmium content in wheat has increased during the 20th century, but that concentrations in Swedish food are still much lower than in food from, for example, cadmium polluted areas of Japan. The article says:Comparisons between the Cd concentration in human kidneys preserved at anatomical museums in Sweden and in kidney samples obtained in recent decades show that the kidney and body burdens of Cd have increased severalfold during the last century.There is no reason to believe that the situation in Sweden with regard to cadmium pollution is worse than in many other places and clearly cadmium pollution is a global problem. So, in the face of this evidence from Sweden, we find the Australian New Zealand Food Authority is moving to increase the level at which food in this country is able to be riddled with this heavy metal. This is absolutely unacceptable.It is interesting to note, too, that the National Food Authority had a cadmium workshop in Canberra in 1995 where it was considered that all regulatory bodies should work to put in place a strategy to minimise the exposure of the Australian population to cadmium by reducing cadmium in fertilisers and by maintaining maximum permissible content. Therefore, the activities of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority appear to be running contrary to the recommendations from this particular workshop. I believe that the food authority really has a case to answer. The Food Authority ought to be looked at very closely.This legislation currently before the House is legislation which is supported broadly by both sides of politics. Clearly, it is important not to force the authority to divert all of its resources to the handling of applications and that, indeed, it ought to get on with its other work. I have no complaint with any of that but my constituents are extremely concerned that the authority seems determined to double the level of cadmium which is deemed to be acceptable in Australia.There were two proposals to go before the Commonwealth, state, territory and New Zealand ministers for health and these were proposals 148 and 144. Proposal 148 sought to double the permitted levels of cadmium in peanuts from 0.05 milligrams per kilogram to 0.1 and proposal 144 seeks to achieve a general increase in permitted cadmium levels. I have outlined the situation in relation to peanuts and how this could create increased health problems for Australians. It now seems, however, that the Food Authority has said that while it is not going to proceed with proposal 148, which deals with peanuts in isolation, it is going to impose increased cadmium levels on all Australians in relation to all food products. That is clearly unacceptable.It is interesting to note that a very reputable member of the Queensland community, in fact, the president of the Queensland grain growers association, has opposed strongly what is proposed by the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. It is very hard to find supporters out there in the community for the proposal of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. I have heard it reported that pressure is being imposed on the ANZ Food Authority because apparently there has been a consignment of condemned peanuts already in the country and the intention is to increase the level of cadmium to permit these condemned peanuts to be inflicted on the Australian community.I think the Australia New Zealand Food Authority needs to answer some questions here. It is unacceptable that the authority should be acting contrary to the health interests of Australians. All of the evidence, both in Australia and elsewhere, shows that we should be moving towards reduced cadmium levels and yet the Australia New Zealand Food Authority seems hell bent on doubling the maximum permissible levels in Australia. As the Swedish studies indicate, such an action by the authority could well impact on the health of not only young Australians but also older Australians.However, the government is to be commended for this legislation. It will improve the procedures of the Food Authority. It will enable the authority to concentrate not on applications but rather on the very major projects at which the Food Authority is looking. I ask at this stage that the government, and particularly the minister, look closely at the authoritys advocacy of doubling the levels of acceptable cadmium in Australian food with a view to preserving the present levels which I believe is in the interests of reasonable health standards for Australians. I commend the bill to the Committee.","N/A","AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
422,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr ANDREW","HE4","(Wakefield)","LP","N/A",2530,"—I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Bill, particularly as the standards that apply to Australian food are of such essential importance to every Australian. It is true that we have an image of which we are justly proud, an image as a clean and green producer of Australian food. In fact, we have a reputation as a country which ensures that most Australian consumers can be assured that what they pick up from the shelf of Australian supermarkets, or acquire through their retailers, comes with recommendations that ensure that the health of the consumer will not be put at risk. It is fair to say that so good is our reputation as the provider of clean and green food and foodstuffs that Australians generally take that reputation for granted.The member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) in his participation in this debate referred to the very tragic circumstances surrounding the Garibaldi case—a case with which I am familiar because the young girl who died as a result of the food poisoning contracted in the Garibaldi case happened to be resident in my electorate. That, mercifully, is very much the exception. Every Australian travelling overseas returns to Australia breathing a sigh of relief that the standards applying here are so much more rigorous than those applying in other countries around the globe.In fact, in order to ensure that the standards are consistent trans&hyphen;Tasman, that there is a level of cooperation between Australia and New Zealand in policing Australian food standards, we have in place the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. It is the amendments to the act that has set that authority in place that we are dealing with in this debate this afternoon. It is fair to say that Australians, as I indicated earlier, tend to take food standards for granted. It is also fair to say that the focus of this debate has been on the oppositions particular concern about the proposal in the amendments that we are considering in this debate to allow the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to charge for some of the services that it offers.I understand the concerns expressed by the opposition, although I thought it was a little inconsistent for the member for Calwell to say that he was desperately bothered about all of this, but he would not oppose the legislation. I also felt it was a little inconsistent for the member for Dobell (Mr Lee) to imply that there was some sort of inadequate standard being policed in Australia and that, under existing arrangements in Australia, so far as he knew, it may be possible for higher levels of antibiotics to apply in Australian food than he would find acceptable.In my participation in this debate I want to pick up two points. Firstly, I want to make a comment or two about what I see as the general standard of Australian food and, secondly, to refer specifically to the legislation and the proposal to allow the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to make some charges for some of the services that it is delivering.My background, as most of the parliament knows, has been in the food industry as a fruit grower. I can reassure this chamber and the parliament that standards do apply and that every fruit grower is conscious of that in terms of the fruit supplied to any retail outlet across Australia. The member for Calwell is to be commended, as indeed is the former government, for the work done in bringing state and national standards into some sort of uniformity. That was important. I thought the member for Calwell might have been a little more generous in his remarks, had he recognised that part of the Garibaldi disaster had occurred as much under a Labor Party state administration as any other. But that sort of generous comment was not something that he was volunteering in this debate. Nonetheless, as the parliamentary secretary he played a key role in ensuring that these standards were made uniform.The result of this is that food producers, food processors and food retailers across the nation are obliged to adhere to a standard which ensures that spray residues, antibiotics, and any other things that are seen as deleterious to human health are kept to an absolute minimum; a minimum that is seen as more than adequate by any of the other standards applying around the globe. As a fruit grower, I was obliged to ensure that if any form of spray had been used on the fruit that was being produced then that fruit was not harvested until it had met particular withholding periods.I also knew, as did all of the people who were fruit growers around me—and that includes those people from ethnic backgrounds who were without the same capacity to soak up the immediate information as those with European backgrounds automatically were—that any one of the deliveries made to, say, a fruit processor or a fruit canner had to meet minimum standards and that there would be random regular selections of processed fruit off the line that would be assessed for its contaminant free status. So Australians, generally, have little to fear from the foods that they consume and from the standards that are applied.Of course there are exceptions. The member for Calwell focused on one of those exceptions. The most recent food scare, which concerned the Arnotts biscuit chain, had nothing to do with producers or processors, but very much to do with what was little more than a terrorist attack. Nonetheless, the Australian community and Australian retailers ensured that every step was taken to make sure that Australian consumers could be assured that the food they were consuming was of the very highest possible standard.The Australia New Zealand Food Authority was set up so that we could ensure that the standards that apply across Australia would apply across the Tasman, in New Zealand. The first point of the authority was to develop and maintain an Australia New Zealand food standards code. The second was to develop and implement new hygiene standards for food processing, manufacturing and handling. The third was to ensure that national arrangements were in place for the surveillance and for compliance with the code. This has largely been successful.But, as a result of the involvement of the New Zealanders in what was once an Australian standard, we now have a situation in which the workload that the authority is facing is larger than it can reasonably process in order to meet the March 1998 deadline originally set down for the authority to have firm trans&hyphen;Tasman arrangements in place. The authority has come to the government saying that it has no control over the number of applications made to it for compliance with these standards and that it is obliged under the existing legislation to deal with the applications on a first come, first served basis, so it cannot accurately assess the relevant importance of some applications over others—and even if it could, it cannot process them as it would choose to.It also has the problem that every application that comes to it must be individually assessed, even if it parallels another application on which the authority has already made a determination. For those reasons, the authority has asked for these changes. The member for Calwell has said that the changes proposed do not meet with the approval of the Australian Food Industry Council. He indicated that the particular concern the council had was a concern over the charging regime, and the member for Dobell tends to have reinforced that point. What has been overlooked in this debate is that the advice of the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) on the charging regime that is being proposed is that any fee charged under this legislation must be related to the expense incurred.The Attorney&hyphen;General has indicated that some of the activities cannot be characterised as a service and, consequently, the costs will not be fully recovered, so there is still an obligation on the government to make an input into the way in which the Australia New Zealand Food Authority goes about exercising its important task. Furthermore, the Attorney&hyphen;Generals office has indicated that existing constitutional arrangements mean that we cannot impose a charge which would constitute a tax.So much of the concern expressed, justifiably, by the member for Calwell on behalf of the Australian Food Industry Council is a concern that the government knows is unfounded. This is not a proposal to find a way to tax the industry. In fact, the industry should be aware of that. The government not only indicates that in the second reading speech by the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), but it is reinforced by the advice gained from the Attorney&hyphen;Generals office. I will quote a portion of the ministers second reading speech where she said:The bill:. permits regulations to set the amount of the charges and to waive, remit and refund charges in whole or in part; and. specifically limits the level of the charge to recovering the authoritys expenses in assessing an application.I therefore suggest that much of the concern expressed about this charge regime is unfounded and is, in fact, scaremongering. There is no intent by the authority or the government that these charges should provide a revenue raising measure for the government.I want to pick up a couple of other points that have come out of this debate and reinforce the remarks made by the member for Murray (Mrs Stone) when she said that, in her own electorate, the SPC people had found, following the movement of New Zealand into the authority to make the Australia New Zealand Food Authority complete, that there had been delays in their processing applications that they were anxious to have accelerated. The legislation before the House is designed to allow the government to accelerate these applications and, as I said earlier, to meet the 1998 deadline.This is important, because there is a great number of opportunities for food processors, not only in exports to New Zealand—which are already very important to us—but, furthermore, in exports to other APEC countries. These opportunities will best be resolved when we can maintain our clean and green image through the successful operation of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority. This bill allows the operation of that authority to be enhanced. I am pleased to support it.","N/A","AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
423,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr REID","VT4","(Bendigo)","LP","N/A",2533,"—I am pleased to have the opportunity to comment on the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill. The bill amends the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991 to overcome operational limitations within the current principal act. The proposed amendments to the bill will enable the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to better plan, manage and prioritise its workload.The background to this bill is that the principal act amended by this bill was originally the National Food Authority Act 1991. The main goal of the authority is to provide a national focus within Australia for cooperation between governments, industry and the community in developing a safe and wholesome food supply.It is that topic that I wish to address, because one of the most important things for Australia is that it has enjoyed a very strong reputation overseas for clean, wholesome food products. It indicates how important it is, not only in our relationship with New Zealand but also—as the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) mentioned—with our near Asian neighbours, and the wonderful opportunities that that provides for Australia to provide food to what we now term `the supermarket to Asia.I was delighted to hear recently of the move by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to create the Supermarket to Asia Council. The Australian food industry is one with tremendous potential to generate wealth, jobs and exports for Australians. It is one of the largest sectors of the Australian economy, with retail sales and exports valued at $64 billion. Exports of food in 1995&hyphen;96 were $15 billion, with approximately 40 per cent of these exports going to Asia.The industrys potential for further growth is considerable because of the natural production advantages in Australia and its proximity to rapidly growing markets for food in Asia. This Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill ensures that both Australia and New Zealand reach agreement on joint food standards.It is imperative that New Zealand and Australia are in a position to present a united force to the Asian opportunities which are currently available. The diets of Asians are becoming more westernised, and this is creating new opportunities for the export of food products like meat—and I relate that to my own electorate where we produce beef, lamb and pork—dairy products, horticulture and grains, as well as a number of other very important primary products and foods which are suitable for inclusion in the strategy that the Supermarket to Asia Council is embarking on.The Supermarket to Asia Council was established by the Prime Minister and, without having the bill in place that we are dealing with in this House, we cannot ensure that food standards and consumer information on the ingredients in those foods are compatible between Australia and New Zealand.We need to ensure that, if Asian customers are looking at a supplier from within the Australia&hyphen;New Zealand providers who are emerging in the marketplace and they are looking for food products, obviously they are going to be looking for the standard of quality, ingredients and information that is provided between those two countries to be compatible and for there to be closer cooperation between Australia and New Zealand to harmonise those things. That is very important.Under the terms of this legislation, I am delighted to see that we are, in fact, bringing Australia and New Zealand much closer together in the standards that they provide, particularly on their consumer information on the ingredients. This is a complaint that a lot of members, I am sure, would receive in their electorate offices from time to time. People ask what the ingredients are in a lot of the products on the supermarket shelves, and there is no doubt that people who visit a supermarket these days have a pretty close look at the labels to make sure that they know what the ingredients are. It is important because of our close economic relationship with New Zealand that those standards are harmonised and, in fact, that there is close cooperation between the two countries.The proposed amendments will enable the authority to complete the major task of a three&hyphen;year standards review work program. Support and agreement to this program will set priorities for a food standards review and will involve negotiations with the food industry. I think that this is important because I just heard my colleague, the honourable member for Wakefield, who obviously had some discussions with the Food Industry Council of Australia. They have written to me also on this matter. They were concerned about the charges and I just arrived in the chamber in time to hear the honourable member for Wakefield address that question. I know the minister has made a note of that and, no doubt, will respond in the latter part of this debate. I have not had the opportunity of meeting with them but I am sure that those concerns of the Food Industry Council of Australia will be allayed by the minister.But it is important that we have full negotiation and consultation with the food industry, the states and the territories, and New Zealand in the implementation of this bill. I will leave my remarks at that point. I welcome the bill and support the initiative to bring both New Zealand and Australia much closer together. We already enjoy closer cooperation under the economic cooperation which we have between New Zealand and Australia and I welcome this further move.","N/A","AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
424,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr VAILE","SU5","(Lyne)","NP","N/A",2534,"—I will be fairly brief in my support of this bill. The bill amends the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act to implement provisions which will enable the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to focus its resources on issues which are of critical importance to both countries. They include: the development, establishment and management of the Australia&hyphen;New Zealand food standards code; the development and implementation of the new hygiene standards for food processing, manufacturing and handling, and the development of improved and consistent national arrangements for surveillance and compliance. This bill will enhance the authoritys ability to undertake these important tasks.It is important that we maintain set standards and that, as a nation that closely competes with New Zealand in a lot of these areas, particularly as far as fresh food is concerned, we maintain close links as far as common standards are concerned. I certainly would like to add my support to the amending bill, the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill, in that regard. It is important that we maintain that close liaison with New Zealand and maintain a high level of standards in this area. I am certainly happy to support the bill and I commend it to the House.","N/A","AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
425,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mrs MOYLAN","4V5","(Pearce—","LP","Minister for Family Services)",2534,"—in reply—As is stated in the preface, the main purpose of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1996 is to allow the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to appropriately manage its workload. I know that there have been many compliments paid to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority by colleagues this morning for the work that it does but, as with any authority, from time to time things change and it needs to adjust its practices. It is important for us to have a look at the underlying reasons why we need to address some of the pressures on management and the growing workload on this authority.It is enormously important that Australias food standards are dealt with in a timely manner so that we can continue to have public confidence and good public health practice in this country. We also cannot overlook the fact that the enhancement of the industrys ability to compete domestically and internationally has a very important economic purpose. We have also heard today from my colleagues just how important the food industry is in Australia and, indeed, it is an industry that is worth $40 billion.The current act requires the authority to assess, within a 12&hyphen;month time frame, all applications made to it to vary the food standards code. This means that applications have first call on the authority resources regardless of their relative importance or their priority in the whole scheme of things. In practice, this has meant that resources have been diverted from the more important tasks, such as the review of food standards and the development of a joint Australia New Zealand food standard code, in order to deal with the sheer volume of applications that come in.The impact of the new bill will be to enable the authority, firstly, to allocate its resources to an agreed work plan that incorporates public health and industry and, of course, consumer priorities. It is immensely important, as I said, that we have public confidence in the system that we have in place.The second part of the legislation enables the authority to ensure a review of the entire food standard code and that it is completed in a timely manner, not interrupted by perhaps less important code changes. An important part of this legislation will allow for a charge for goods it produces, as well as for the existing power to charge for services and to waive fees, for example, for all work done in relation to the agreed work plan including, and in particular, public health priorities.The member for Dobell (Mr Lee) did raise some points that I would like to cover in the operation of this bill. The first point that he raised was the fact that the detail was not available. I am a little surprised at his comments because we all know in this place that it is hardly unusual for the main bill to come without those detailed principles in the first instance. But the detail will be scrutinised by the House and the Senate in the form of regulations to be introduced. The powers are not arbitrary; they are subject to disallowable instruments.The member for Dobell also sought details of priorities for setting out the work plan. I have to say that, again, I am a little surprised at the members criticism here about not having detail because I understand that in the principal act the three key criteria are clearly set out. They go to issues of importance in terms of public health, consumer information which would prevent fraud and, of course, consistency within the industry and the elements of fair trading. So the three main priorities, or criteria if you like, for work to be progressed are set out clearly in the principal act.In addition to that, we also have a priority for setting a work plan. The first phase of this process has already been advertised in the national press and consultations have commenced with the state and territory governments and with the New Zealand government. Consumers and industry will also be part of that process. The member for Dobell also stressed the importance of the food standards review. Given that they see this as an important priority, this bill will ensure that the project can be progressed and it cannot progress in a timely manner without this bill being passed.The member for Dobell raised an issue about the level of antibiotic residues in food and I understand from the department that the food standard code does set limits on residues of antibiotics in foods, whether they be domestic or imported. We can always provide specific detail of that to the member for Dobell, should he wish for that information.The member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) also made some comments, not unlike those from the member for Dobell, about the detail that was necessary. As I said, that will come forward in the regulations. His other concern was about a letter received from the Australian Food Council, a peak industry body. I think it is fair to say that the main concern in that letter revolved around the charging practices and, as I have said, the detail of those practices will come forward in the regulations and be scrutinised by this House and, indeed, by the Senate.It is important to convey to the House that there has been considerable consultation with the industry and, in particular, with the Australian Food Council—as I understand it, as recently as earlier this month. The industrys difficulties have been discussed and will be put into context through the associated regulations that will come before the parliament. The concerns raised are important but they can be dealt with properly through the foreshadowed disallowable instruments.The bill ensures that we protect what is a critical program that is important in the interests of public health and public confidence in the system. It also assists our industry to enhance its ability to compete, both domestically and internationally. This bill will allow the authority to work with industry, consumers, the states and territories, and New Zealand in addressing, as a high priority, the food standard changes. I commend this bill to the House.Question resolved in the affirmative.Bill read a second time.Bill—by leave—reported to the House without amendment.","N/A","AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1996","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[2]/debate.sub1/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

428,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr MILES","BI4","(Braddon—","LP","Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister)",2536,"—I move:That the bill be now read a second time.This bill is about removing legislative impediments to the implementation of reforms in the electricity industry. These reforms, together with the gas reforms agreed by the Council of Australian Governments in February 1994, have been estimated by the Industry Commission to lead to an increase in annual gross domestic product of $5.8 billion.To do this, the bill will amend part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act 1974, the principal act. Part IIIA includes provisions whereby third parties can seek access to services provided by essential infrastructure facilities of national significance. These provisions are an important feature of Australias national competition policy reforms. They promote competitive markets in order to improve efficiency and service delivery. The amendments to part IIIA will provide a legislative framework to support reforms in network industries where a co&hyphen;regulatory approach, as an alternative to direct regulation, is being used to implement pro&hyphen;competitive market structures.This approach, which is being pursued in the electricity industry, involves the development of a code of conduct by industry participants and governments, setting out market rules, including rules about third party access to network infrastructure. In order to implement the access provisions of the code, it is envisaged that network service providers will offer access undertakings to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, later referred to as the commission, under part IIIA, setting out obligations in relation to network access. These undertakings are enforced by the Federal Court, upon application by the commission.There are, however, a number of shortcomings with the principal act which would prevent the timely implementation of this approach to access regulation. Firstly, the principal act requires the commission to undertake multiple public consultation processes before such arrangements can be established: one in relation to the code, if the code requires authorisation under part VII of the principal act, and others in relation to the access undertakings of individual service providers. This unnecessary duplication of public consultation processes is an inefficient way of processing access undertakings in network industries, and runs the risk of unduly delaying progress towards more competitive infrastructure industries. Also, it may be difficult for the commission to assess whether separate access undertakings will achieve coherent industry&hyphen;wide access arrangements.Secondly, the principal act requires an undertaking to set out a high level of detail about the terms and conditions of access. Accordingly, an undertaking cannot include a maximum price or a formula with factors which are reset from time to time. Inclusion of highly detailed terms and conditions about access may be undesirable and impractical in certain network industries, such as the electricity industry, where an industry&hyphen;wide approach to access is to be adopted.Thirdly, the principal act does not enable an access provider to confer power on the commission to make decisions about access issues pursuant to an undertaking. For example, in the case of access to the national electricity grid, it is envisaged that undertakings will provide for the commission to make decisions which will affect the price for access, in accordance with criteria set out in the undertakings.The bill will address these shortcomings by setting out a process whereby the commission can accept industry access codes, following public consultation. Each access code would set out rules about access for the industry. Once the commission has accepted an access code, the commission can accept access undertakings in accordance with the code, without the need for further public consultation. This process allows for the development of coherent access arrangements through a single consultation process. Furthermore, the bill will relax the level of detail required in an access undertaking. The appropriate level of detail will be determined by the commission and access providers, on a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case basis.The bill will also enable access providers to confer power on the commission to make decisions in connection with access. The undertaking would set out how the commission is to make its decisions, along with other relevant ancillary matters. In this regard, an undertaking could confer on the commission a role that is similar to its role under part IIIA of the principal act in relation to declared services, should an access provider choose to give the commission such a role.In addition, the bill includes a provision to preserve the integrity of the competitive conduct rules and authorisation provisions of the principal act. The bill provides that the access provisions in the principal act will not affect the liability of the relevant parties for contraventions of the competitive conduct rules in the principal act. The cost to revenue of the proposed amendments is expected to be nil. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and I commend the bill to the House.","N/A","TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (INDUSTRY ACCESS CODES) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/debate.sub1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Maybe that is the best way to progress ones interests in the Howard government. The relevant point for this debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill is that the speech is very different because the government brought into the Senate amendments to its own bill, and they were subsequently carried by the Senate.The parliamentary secretary, the member for Braddon, did not mention that, but the essence of those amendments concerns the level of public consultation in a determination by the ACCC for further undertakings on the access regime. The Australian Labor Party naturally supports the access regime; we introduced it in the Hilmer package of reforms some two years ago.","N/A","TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (INDUSTRY ACCESS CODES) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

433,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,"Mr LATHAM","K26","(Werriwa)","ALP","N/A",2538,"—The member for Corangamite will find, in my case, that consistency is a virtue. I am speaking in favour of the competition reforms we introduced in government and which remain in the national interest. The principle is very sound. In the case of infrastructure characterised by monopoly or oligopoly features you should not need to own an electricity power station to retail electricity and you should not need to own a gas pipeline to retail gas. I would also argue that, in the petrol industry, you should not need to own and have tied access arrangements to a petroleum terminal to be an effective retailer in that particular industry.So the concept of downstream access makes sense. It allows a competitive retail, and even a competitive wholesale, market to be established in industries which are essentially vertically integrated and have monopoly and oligopoly characteristics. These are basically infrastructure industries.The bill brought into the Senate is something that we have no problem with. The idea of an industry&hyphen;wide access code seems to make some sense. The problem the Labor Party has with the provision concerns the amendments that the government put to its own bill in the Senate. They are amendments which minimise the public consultation process. They allow the ACCC, without any amount of public notification or public consultation, to determine undertakings after the industry&hyphen;wide code has been established.I believe, in principle—and I know I am supported throughout wide sectors of private industry in Australia—that the undertakings power and discretion of the ACCC needs to be treated with caution. It is not necessarily good public policy to expand the undertakings capacity of the ACCC without public consultation when there are, within the boardrooms of Australia and in the public arena, a whole set of concerns about the way in which the ACCC has been exercising those powers in the past.I will offer a few examples. The most pertinent is the decision that was made with regard to the merger between Ampol and Caltex. Ampol was allowed to merge with Caltex on the basis that they would divest certain terminal facilities and would provide certain access undertakings to their terminals, but it left an inconsistency in the industry structure. Ampol&hyphen;Caltex has divested and Ampol&hyphen;Caltex provides some limited access, but BP, Shell and Mobil do not.Now we have an aggressive campaign by Ampol&hyphen;Caltex to try to apply those same standards of access to its three main competitors: BP, Shell and Ampol. It is not the role of the competition regulator, like the ACCC, to set one standard of regulations for one company in an industry and have the other three major competitors under a different set of industry rules. But that was the net effect of the ACCC discretionary use of the undertakings power in that industry. This was an instance of industry moulding—industry moulding in the case of petrol, the world according to Fels—rather than strict industry regulation where the regulations apply equally across the entire industry.That has been a concern to participants in the petrol industry. It has been a concern remarked on by academics around Australia and, from my discussions, a concern with members on both sides of this parliament. Why should Ampol&hyphen;Caltex have a different set of industry regulations and rules applied to it compared with its three major competitors? If undertakings are to be applied, they should be in the name of fair competition. They should be in the name of equal regulation right across all parts of a particular industry. This was a case of industry moulding.The ACCC subsequently produced a report on petrol that used the Ampol&hyphen;Caltex merger as an argument for retail market entry in the industry. You get more competition because Ampol&hyphen;Caltex has opened up its terminals, and with extra imports of petrol this could facilitate new retail players in the market. This is an instance where, clearly, the ACCC decision or undertakings in terms of the Ampol and Caltex merger were framed to accommodate the matters ACCC had in mind for its petrol report to the federal government. It was an instance where it was moulding this industry according to its own priorities; moulding the industry in its own image, rather than setting regulations across the board that apply equally and fairly to all competitors in the industry. I am an opponent of industry moulding.I am an opponent of the way in which the ACCC used its undertakings power in the Ampol&hyphen;Caltex case. If it was good enough for Ampol&hyphen;Caltex to have terminal access imposed upon it by the ACCC, it should be good enough for BP and it should be good enough for Shell and Mobil. That is the best way to cleanly regulate an industry, instead of moulding it, knowing that there is a report coming up to be used in a fashion consistent with the dirty regulation of the petrol industry.That is the first instance that has been raised. I noticed recently, again, criticisms of the ACCC in these matters. Mr John David, the executive chairman of the wholesaler and grocery retailer, Davids, has accused the ACCC of moving the goalposts to allow Woolworths Ltd into the wholesaling market. I will quote from the Australian Financial Review of 12 March:Mr David told reporters yesterday the ACCC had previously ruled that wholesaling and retailing were the one market for the purposes of making a decision on Davids acquisition of QIW and Composite Buyers, and was now defining the markets as separate.This is another instance where the ACCC inconsistently is trying to mould industry outcomes—in this case to the benefit of Woolworths—instead of operating as a clean and consistent regulator that applies the same standard across time and the same standard to all participants in a particular industry.That is why the Labor Party is concerned about the governments decision to open up further powers of undertaking by the ACCC in this legislation without public consultation. If the industry code is to be altered by way of the ACCCs discretionary use of undertakings, why should the public not be involved in that process? Why should not all those industry players particularly affected by that decision be notified, be able to make submissions and, moreover, beyond that, why should they not have some power of appeal? Why should there not be a third party appeal right in these particular instances? The parliament is placing too much power and authority in the ACCC when on its track record it is not acting as a clean industry regulator, consistent across time and across the board with market participants. It is acting as a dirty regulator, moulding these industries according to its own priorities.I express that concern in relation to the bill. I further point out to the Main Committee, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Labor Party has amendments to move in detail. We seek to use this Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill 1996 to apply part 3A access—the downstream access regime—to petroleum terminals. These were amendments that were also moved in the Senate and defeated on the casting vote of Senator Colston in that chamber. The Labor Party will be persevering with those amendments, once the consideration in detail is referred to the main chamber of the House of Representatives.It is a debate that is, of course, relevant to this bill but it does not detract from the support that we can lend to the concept of general industry access code approval processes. It uses this bill, and the parliaments consideration of part 3A of the Trade Practices Act, as a vehicle for establishing downstream access in the petroleum industry. I see no difference between the structure of electricity, for instance, an homogenous product with a vertically integrated structure, and downstream access applying there. There is no difference to the way in which downstream access can be applied in petrol—again, an undifferentiated product with a vertical industry structure.It is interesting to note in that earlier decision by the ACCC that, for the purpose of groceries, retailing and wholesaling are part of the one market. If that standard were applied in petrol, why did the ACCC not recommend some vertical separation? Why are they willing to tolerate the situation where the major oil companies in Australia control the exploration, refining, distribution and retailing through the vertical control and ownership structure in this industry? Why did the ACCC not recommend some element of vertical separation? Why did they not recommend in their report last year the amendments that I will be moving in the Main Chamber; that is, to place the petroleum industry on the access regime, to give every single service station operator and distributor in Australia his or her chance to shop around for the cheapest wholesale petrol?Those particular concepts, that particular use of part 3A of the Trade Practices Act, is becoming more relevant by the day. I refer to the Daily Liberal , the newspaper in Dubbo where Woolworths has entered the industry. This is a report from last week, 14 March. It says that plunging petrol prices have Dubbos fuel retailers on the brink of turmoil. One couple is netting as little as $300 for a combined total of 140 hours per weeks work, slightly more than $2 per hour. Because Woolworths has got access to cheaper wholesale petrol than the oil majors will provide to their retailers, the whole generation of small businesses around country New South Wales—and it will happen right around the country—is being wiped out because of unfair competition.Why should Woolworths have access to cheaper wholesale petrol that is being denied to existing service stations in country towns? There is a real risk right around the country that these country towns will become planet Woolworths. Woolworths will do all the petrol retailing, all the pharmacy work, all the newsagency work, and all the groceries. Every country town will become nothing more than a planet Woolworths where all other business interests are orbiting around the main business interest.That is not healthy at all. There is a legitimate argument to place the petrol industry on the access regime so that these retailers in Dubbo and beyond can access the same cheap wholesale petrol. I am getting into National Party language, arent I? Someone has got to represent them effectively and it will be the Labor Party that says that those retailers in Dubbo should have the same access to cheaper wholesale petrol that Woolworths enjoys.For a government that talks about industry, entrepreneurialism and small business effort, how can they just sit there and grin at the prospect of small business—the Prime Ministers family once ran a business like this—netting as little as $300 for a combined total of 140 hours of work, all because the government will not accept the principle of fair wholesale competition in the petrol industry? All the government needs to do is tick off the Labor Party amendments in the Main Chamber and these people in Dubbo and hundreds like them around New South Wales and, indeed, the entire country, will have fair access to wholesale petrol and a fair chance to compete against Woolworths.","N/A","TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (INDUSTRY ACCESS CODES) BILL 1997","/html/body/p/hansard/maincomm.xscript/debate[3]/debate.sub1/speech[2]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

It is their way to write it into the laws of the Commonwealth.I look forward to that debate in the main chamber. We had a very good debate, as I mentioned, in the Senate on these matters. The National Party, particularly the Queenslanders, went missing. Senator Boswell from Queensland, who talks the language of assisting small petrol retailers around his state, voted against the concept of putting the petrol industry on the access regime. He opposed the means by which these small businesses, these small petrol retailers, can have a fair crack at competition with the likes of Woolworths. If this government does not stand for something better than $300 total income for 140 hours of small business work, then something has gone wrong. There is a big gap between its rhetoric and the way in which its policies are playing out around regional Australia. So the Labor Party will be representing the interests of these people.

I also have under consideration other situations where exemptions may be warranted.The existing asset test hardship legislative provisions are also available to affected persons in circumstances where the exemption power was not exercised.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This is because it is intended to address any additional financial strain of caring for an orphan child. Most recipients of Double Orphan Pension are also receiving Family Payment which aims to provide help with the ongoing costs of raising children. Pensioners with dependent children receive Family Payment at the maximum rate (which is $124.90 a fortnight for each child aged 13&hyphen;15 years and $96.00 a fortnight for each child under 13). Other supplements and assistance are available according to the carers circumstances such as Guardian Allowance for sole parents. The Government is also providing additional assistance to families through the Family Tax Initiative.(4) The view of the Government is that the needs of different groups are addressed through the existing system of assistance. However, as with all pensions, the Government will be keeping the appropriateness and adequacy of payments under review.N/A","N/A","N/A","/html/body/p/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[3]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
