His death occurred in Sydney on the 15th January last, and a State funeral was accorded by the Commonwealth Government.The late honorable senator had a long career of parliamentary service - from 1897 until 1922 in the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council, respectively, of Western Australia, and since 1922 as a senator representing that State in the Parliament of the Commonwealth. His term of election as a senator would ordinarily have expired on the 30th June next.During his association with the Parliament of Western Australia, the late honorable senator held ministerial office in the Government of the State for periods totalling four years, and was President of the Legislative Council of that State for a term of three years.Senator Kingsmill was President of the Senate from August, 1929, until August, 1932, and we recall with high appreciation the ability and impartiality with which he discharged the duties of that important office. He was knighted by His Majesty the King in January, 1933.The late honorable senator was a man of wide learning and varied experience, and filled with distinction many important positions during his career of public service. He was keenly devoted to the cause of science, and played a prominent part in the initial measures taken in Australia for the preservation of fauna and flora. Those who were closely associated with him in this Parliament will remember his charming manner, and his other oustanding personal qualities.The sympathy of the members of this House is extended to Lady Kingsmill in her bereavement. I move -That this House expresses its deep regret at the death of Senator Sir Walter Kingsmill, K.t., B.A., a former member of the Western Australian Parliament and Minister of State of Western Australia, and at the time of his decease a member of the Senate of the Commonwealth Parliament, of which he had been President, places on record its high appreciation of his long career of distinguished public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow in her bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR THE HON.

The deceased gentleman, who will be particularly remembered for his courtesy, his culture, and his amiable disposition, rendered very long and valuable service to the public of Australia in both the State and the Commonwealth spheres, and his death will cause a severe loss to be felt. On behalf of the Opposition, I join with the Acting Prime Minister in expressing the deepest sympathy with his widow.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR THE HON.

The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin) has referred to the outstanding qualities of the late honorable senator, and has said that he will be remembered for his personal attributes. One thing for which he will long be remembered, particularly by the people in Western Australia, was his opposition to the secessionist movement in that State, by reason of which, it is generally recognized publicly, he failed to secure the party endorsement that might have led to his re-election as a senator at the last general elections. It is good to find at times public men who have the courage to give practical effect to their convictions on big public questions, and to do what they believe to be right and in the interests of their country, no matter on whose corns they may tread.There is only one word that I wish to add. Upon the occasion of the State funeral of the late honorable senator in Sydney, we were informed that the health of his widow was not all that could be desired. My colleagues and I hope that she is now completely restored to good health, and join in the expressions of sympathy that are extended to her.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR THE HON.

The late honorable senator and I were elected to the Parliament of Western Australia in 1897, and were associated in the early stages of the development of that State. For many years we were colleagues in different cabinets, and during this time he won the respect and esteem both of his associates and of the people of Western Australia. Our friendship continued while he remained in the State Parliament, and I came to the Commonwealth Parliament, and subsequently while we were both members of this Parliament. Those who knew the late honorable gentleman recognized fully his personal charm, his integrity, and his honorable character. He had a very high personal reputation.  Few persons in Western Australia were more greatly honoured or held in higher esteem than was he. His death, coming as it did so suddenly, caused very great grief to many persons besides myself. I join with the Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page) and others who have spoken in expressing grief at the death of Senator Kingsmill, and in extending condolence to his widow, lady Kingsmill, in her bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR THE HON.

The late Senator Kingsmill was President of the Senate when I had the privilege to be the presiding officer in this chamber, and, consequently, we were closely associated in the discharge of our official duties. At all times I found him honorable in his dealings, and willing to give full and impartial consideration to every matter placed before him. He was at all times most approachable and courteous. In his death, Australia has lost a noble son who, in all circumstances, displayed the highest qualities of true manliness, and discharged his public duties faithfully and well. I join with those who have spoken in expressing sympathy with his widow, and the hope that she will soon be restored to perfect health.Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places.","N/A","DEATH OF SENATOR THE HON.

Prior to his election to the House of Representatives as a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament, he was a member of the House of Assembly of South Australia from 1S93, and held ministerial office as Commissioner for Crown Lands for a short period in 1899. While a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, Mr. Poynton served on several royal commissions and committees. He was Chairman of Committees of this House from 1910 to 1913, a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in 1917-1918, and a member of the Federal Parliamentary Recruiting Committee in 1917-1918. He first attained ministerial rank in November, 1916, holding office as Treasurer in the Hughes Ministry until February of the following year. He was an Honorary Minister in the Hughes Ministry from March, 1918, to February, 1920, and in that period was Acting Minister for the Navy, Minister in charge of Shipping, and Assistant Minister for Repatriation. He was Minister for Home and Territories and Minister in charge of Shipbuilding from February, 1920, to December, 1921, and Postmaster-General from December, 1921, to February, 1923.Mr. Poynton was honoured by the King in 1920, when he was appointed an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. His record of 30 years of public service is a notable one. He gained for himself an enviable reputation for integrity and honesty of purpose which will long be remembered by those who served with him. His earnest desire to serve his country and fellow citizens was uppermost in his mind, even in the years of his declining health.Our sympathy is extended to his widow and the members of the family in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

Alexander Poynton. For three years following my first entry into the Federal Parliament I was associated with him, but, later, when I was again elected, I found that he was no longer a member. During the time that he was a member of this Parliament, Mr. Poynton attended faithfully to his public duties, and brought to bear on all public questions a shrewd and intelligent outlook which must have been of great value to those associated with him. I regret that session by session, almost month by month, we have to record the passing of former members of this Parliament who have rendered service to the nation.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

The only member of this party who was associated with the late Mr. Poynton in this Parliament is the honorable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) ; but although I was not personally acquainted with the deceased gentleman, I recall the leading part taken by him during a crisis in the history of this country some years ago which made him well known throughout Australia, particularly to the younger members of the community. I join with the Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin) in extending to the widow and family of the deceased gentleman the sincere sympathy of this House in their bereavement.Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places.","N/A","DEATH OF THE HON.

During his parliamentary service, he was a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works from March, 1927, to November, 1931, and was chairman of that committee from February to September, 1929. In the last Parliament, he was a Temporary Chairman of Committees.During the closing stages of the last Parliament, Mr. Cameron suffered from ill health, but he courageously continued to discharge fully his duties as a representative of the people. Many honorable members present to-day who were closely associated with Mr. Cameron know that he enjoyed a wide measure of popularity and esteem. He carried out his parliamentary work with marked ability and much enthusiasm, devoting great energy to the discharge of his duties. He served the people faithfully and well.To his widow and family, we tender our deep sympathy in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF MR. MALCOLM D.

No one could fail to be struck by the manly way in which the late Mr. Cameron bore acute suffering during the last year or two of his life in this Parliament, yet was at all times of a genial and happy disposition. The Acting Prime Minister has truly said that he was one of the most popular members of this Parliament. We miss him from our assemblies; but our loss is small compared with that of his widow and family. To them we express our heartfelt sympathy in their bereavement.","N/A","DEATH OF MR. MALCOLM D.

Cameron, is the more fully realized by honorable members, because he was well known to most of us. As has already been said, the deceased gentleman possessed a genial disposition. Although a strong party man, there emanated from him such good- will that those who disagreed with him could not do other than honour him for standing to his political convictions. He approached every subject calmly and dispassionately. At no time did he display the least ill feeling towards those who disagreed with him. His nature was such that every honorable member regrets his passing. For several months towards the end of the last Parliament, Mr. Cameron obviously suffered a great deal, but he bore his affliction bravely. His decline was so rapid that his death was not entirely unexpected; but all of us are sorry that he has gone. I wholeheartedly support the motion that the sympathy of this House be extended to his widow and family.","N/A","DEATH OF MR. MALCOLM D.

Though I speak on personal grounds, I feel that the tributes which I am able to pay to him as a friend are equally merited by him as a public man, because I have found that the man who possesses a capacity for friendship and loyalty to his friends generally possesses also those attributes which make for an honorable and distinguished public career.","N/A","DEATH OF MR.

Alfred Deakin, a former Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, places on record its appreciation of her notable work in the interests of soldiers during and after the Great War, and in public, charitable and philanthropic movements, and tenders to the members of her family its deep sympathy in their bereavement.The news of the death of Mrs. Deakin, C.B.E., which occurred on the 30th December last, at Point Lonsdale, Victoria, was received with feelings of deep regret by those who at once recalled the magnificent public services of her husband, the late Honorable Alfred Deakin, and her own notable efforts in the causes of philanthropy and benevolence.It is now many years since the late Mr. Deakin was actively participating as a leader in the public life of Australia, but there is no memory more vivid in the minds of the Australian people than of this outstanding statesman, who, as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth :n the early years of federation, and in the period of endeavour and preparation which immediately preceded the inauguration of federation, did noble service in laying and consolidating the foundations of our national life. Mrs. Deakin possessed to a marked degree qualities similar to those which enabled her husband to serve Australia so faithfully and well. Hers was, indeed, a life full of noble deeds - a life devoted to helping others. The needs of soldiers who were engaged in the Great War were her especial care, and her continuous service in their cause was fittingly acknowledged and recognized by returned soldiers organizations. Up till the time of her death, she continued to interest herself in the care of disabled soldiers, and in the welfare of the children of soldiers. Prom the establishment of the Sir Samuel McCaughey Bequest in 1919, which made provision for the education of soldiers children, Mrs. Deakin was a member of the trust which administered the fund.Mrs. Deakin actively identified herself with many charitable and philanthropic organizations in the State of Victoria, and with movements having as their object the welfare of women and children. In addition to her many activities in the cause of social service, she maintained a keen interest in art and other kindred movements. It is appropriate that we should pay tribute to-day to the memory of one who was so closely associated with her late husband in his eminent work for Australia, and who, after his death, continued her work in spheres of great usefulness.Just prior to her death, Mrs. Deakin was honoured by His Majesty the King by appointment to be a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in recognition of her public services in this Commonwealth. To the members of her family, one of whom, as honorable members are aware, is the wife of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. White), we tender our sincere sympathy.","N/A","DEATH OF MRS.

It was a shock to most of us when we heard of it, because we were not aware that she was suffering from an illness serious enough to bring about her death so soon. The name of Mrs. Deakin cannot be mentioned in this House without recalling that of her husband, who is still remembered as a man who did much to raise the standard of public life in Australia. One need not have belonged to the same political party as he did in order to be able to pay that tribute to him. He was a man of high integrity, of great qualities, and of great brilliance. I am sure that Mrs. Deakin was an inspiration to him in his work, as, indeed, every good wife must be an inspiration to her husband, whatever may be his walk in life.","N/A","DEATH OF MRS.

The concluding words of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin) were most appropriate; it is undoubtedly true that the success of many public men is due largely to the help and influence of their wives. It is evident that Mrs. Deakin continued to perform good works even after the death of her husband, and it is my sincere wish that the memory of the many good deeds and kindly acts she performed during her life will be a source of consolation to the bereaved relatives and friends during this sorrowing period.Sir LITTLETON GROOM (DarlingDowns) [3.28]. - This motion takes ones mind back to the earlier days of the history of the Commonwealth. When I first came into this Parliament, Alfred Deakin occupied a dominating position in it, and Mrs. Deakin was standing loyally by her husband then, as she continued to do throughout his life. From the beginning of the Commonwealth Parliament until he left this House, Alfred Deakin continued to fight a strenuous battle for the truly national ideals of Australia. He fostered every good movement for the welfare of the country, and sought to make it a power within the Empire. And throughout all his struggles, stimulating his ambitions and supporting his high purposes, was his faithful helpmeet; she entered fully and completely into the work of her husband. She held her position with dignity, grace and charm, and inspired affection in all those associated with her. When her husband went to England in 1907 she accompanied him, and stood by him while he was making that great fight for those ideals which have since become established principles of our national life. She made an impression on the minds of the British people, who saw in her a type of Australian womanhood at its best. Her husband returned to Australia with his health undermined by his strenuous work overseas. While she assisted her husband in every possible way in his career, she had her own work to perform, and she was associated with Lady Northcote in organizing and carrying through a splendid exhibition of Australian womens work which was held . in Melbourne.That exhibition of Australian womens work, one of the finest events in the history of this Commonwealth, was promoted by women, consisted of exhibits by women only, and was entirely managed by them. In everything that had a cultural influence on the life of the nation, Mrs. Deakin expended her best endeavours. Those in pain and suffering, especially those who had suffered for their country in the Great War, came in for her particular attention. In this motion we are recording our appreciation of the life work, not of a great Australian man, but of his wife, a great Australian woman, who not only lived up to the highest ideals of sympathetic understanding, but also was possessed of a great national outlook and the aspiration to see her country become an even greater nation.Question resolved in the affirmative, honorable members standing in their places.Motion (by Dr. Earle Page) - by leave - agreed to -That Mr. Speaker be requested to transmit the foregoing resolutions respectively to the relatives of the several persons specified therein, together with a copy of the speeches delivered in connexion with the resolutions.","N/A","DEATH OF MRS.

The report contains, altogether, 25 recommendations, the first five of which particularly concern the present financial condition of the industry, and the steps which may be takento improve it. The other recommendations, which will have the immediate attention of the Government, in collaboration with the States and other bodies concerned, relate to scientific, economic, and practical problems associated with the production and marketing of wheat and flour.The first five recommendations of the commission are as follow: -That assistance be afforded by the Commonwealth to the wheat industry through the application of a home-consumption price for flour by an excise duty on flour used within the Commonwealth as recommended in the first report dated the 30th July, 1934, and in the supplement to the first report, dated the 27th November, 1934.That if, for any reason, it be found impossible or undesirable to apply the principle of a home consumption price through an excise duty on flour, it be applied in some other manner, as for instance, through the agency of the compulsory marketing scheme, as set out in recommendation (iii) below, or by such other means as may be considered desirable and appropriate.That, in any case, a compulsory marketing scheme for Australian wheat be adopted, provided that the majority of wheat farmers of each of three wheat-exporting States express their approval of such a scheme, and that the principles upon which the compulsory marketing scheme is baaed shall be those recommended in paragraph 273 of subsection6 of section V. of this report (Mr. Cheadle dissents).That action be taken by the Commonwealth to facilitate adjustment of debts within the wheat industry in accordance with the scheme submitted by the commission in sub-sections 4 and 5 of section VIII. of this report.That the desirability of increasing the rate of exchange between Australia and London be referred by the Commonwealth Government for the consideration of the Commonwealth Bank Board in view of all the facts relating to the wheat industry as detailed in this report.The Government has already provided for the financial needs of the industry in respect of the 1934-35 harvest, the funds for which are being made available, partly from a flour tax, and partly from general revenue. The advisers of the Government state that the only way, if at all, by which a compulsory marketing scheme could be established in respect of wheat produced in the Commonwealth, would be by the complete co-operation of the States with the Common-wealth, the States surrendering to the Commonwealth their powers in respect to intra-state trade in wheat. Other methods for the establishment of such a scheme would be open to doubt on the grounds of constitutionality or practicability. The fullest possible discussion and consultation between the Commonwealth and the States must therefore precede any legislative action. To this end copies of the report are being supplied forthwith to the governments of the States. This will enable them to consider its contents before the meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council, which will be held on the 15th April. At this meeting, the question of cooperation between the States and the Commonwealth will be fully discussed, and the action which the States are prepared to take in the matter will be ascertained. The action which could be taken by the Commonwealth can be determined only when the views of the States have been ascertained.So far as the adjustment of farmers debts is concerned, action has already been taken by the Commonwealth and the States. A general plan has been formulated, and the Commonwealth Government has agreed to provide up to £12,000,000 to the States over a period of years, free of interest, for the purpose of debt adjustment. I have given notice to-day that to-morrow I shall move for leave to introduce the necessary legislation. The recommendations of the royal commission in regard to the rate of exchange between Australia and London will be referred to the Commonwealth Bank for consideration. The determination of the rate is a matter which rests properly with the bank, and in reaching its decision it mustconsider the whole economic position of Australia.For the convenience of honorable members and the public generally I lay on the table a copy of the report and I move -That the paper be printed.Question resolved in the affirmative.","Recommendations of Royal Commission","WHEAT INDUSTRY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

During the same period, however, there was a great increase in our exports of mutton and lamb, from 21,000 tons to 74,000 tons.

As to the exchange position I can, perhaps, best reply to the honorable gentleman by reading, if I may, the following statement made a few days ago by Sir Claude Beading, the chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board: -The irresponsible statements, now being circulated that a change in the rate of exchange is imminent and unavoidable are without foundation. Exchange on London is freely available for normal requirements. The total funds held in London at the present time by Australian trading banks, together with the funds held by the Commonwealth Bank are ample to meet governmental obligations and all legitimate requirements. Since the Commonwealth Bank Board assumed responsibility for London exchange more than three years ago, the rate has been maintained at £125 Australian to £100 sterling, despite considerable fluctuations from time to time during this period in the volume of London funds. This was in accord with the deliberate policy of the Commonwealth Bank to maintain a steady rate and thus avoid the uncertainty which would exist with a frequently fluctuating rate. Tho Commonwealth Bank Board is si till of the opinion that stability in the rate of exchange is of the utmost importance.","EXCHANGE RATE","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[2]/answer[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This is the first opportunity I have had since the re-assembling of Parliament to draw attention to one of the most serious matters which can engage the attention of the House. I do not believe that the moving of the adjournment of the House can adequately meet the situation, but it is necessary to bring under the notice of honorable members what is taking place so that they may exercise their influence with the Government. This Parliament was elected six months ago, and in that time it has sat for 21 days. We have been given to understand that it is now to sit for less than twenty days, after which it will adjourn until September, so that, in its first twelve months, Parliament will sit for only 40 days. In the meantime, the reduced duties operating under this Government will continue an force, and will accentuate the Already grave position. I wonder how many ..honorable members have studied the latest statistics regarding the overseas trade position. I hope they all have, and I shall content myself now with quoting a few of the outstanding figures, -and with asking honorable members to consider them in the light of what has &aken place within the last few years.For the seven months from July, 1933, 4o January, 1934, imports to Australia were valued at £34,204,000, while for the corresponding period of 1934-35 they amounted to £43,618,000, an increase of £9,414,000. Our exports for those periods were £57,878,000 and £45,470,000. respectively, representing a decrease in the value of our exports of £12,408,000. Thus, our trade balance went to the bad during that period to the amount of £21,822,000. That reveals a most serious state of affairs, and one that cannot be treated lightly. 3?he Government seems quite complacent about it, however, and the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. White), who acted as spokesman for the Government when attention was drawn to (the matter a few weeks ago, said that the position would adjust itself automatically. What factor does he expect to work automatically? It has been suggested that, (by the manipulation of the rate of exchange, the trade balance can be made to adjust itself, but that remedy cannot be relied upon, as recent history shows. For many years, prior to 1930, there had been an excess of imports over exports with the result that, for seven sucessive years, there had been an adverse trade balance, a condition of affairs that was fostered by the policy of overseas borrowing. This went on until January, 1929, when our credit was stopped in London, and loans then being floated were left almost entirely in the hands of the underwriters. Imports still continued to flow into the country in excess of exports. Frequent rises in the exchange rate took place until finally it reached the level «f 30 per cent., but, despite that, it was found necessary to take drastic tariff action in order to save the country from bankruptcy. Eventually the excessive flow of imports was checked, the trade balance was corrected, and funds were accumulated with which to meet our overseas commitments. The rate of exchange fell to 25 per cent., and it would undoubtedly have fallen further had not the Commonwealth Bank pegged it at that figure in order to help our exporting industries. That was done with the consent of the government of the day, and has been continued with the consent and approval of successive governments. In normal times the exchange rate is regarded as a means for adjusting trade balances, but in the abnormal conditions which prevailed in 1929-30, it was found to be quite inadequate for this purpose; nor would the lack of purchasing power have operated in time to avert disaster. The Minister for Trade and Customs said that improved prices for wool during last year had made funds available overseas for the purchase of imports, but events have shown that excessive importing can continue without any such encouragement, traders being prepared to lodge funds here for the purpose in the hope of something turning up.Since the Lyons Government has been in office there have been frequent reductions of import duties, resulting in an ever-increasing volume of imports. The volume of our exports has not declined although their value has, and there is nothing in the suggestion that the trouble is due to import restrictions. We cannot by our own act raise the price of wool or other export commodities, but we can control imports. In 1927 I warned the Government of the day that the situation was becoming alarming, and two years later I was leader of a government which took charge during the crisis. Since the present Government has been in office, I have issued further warnings, and the reply has been that, with the help of the exchange rate, our adverse trade balance can be corrected.It is claimed by the Lyons Government that the Commonwealth Bank is free to fix the rate of exchange, and we were informed that it is the policy of the Government to keep that matter outside the realm of politics. Technically, it is outside, but, in fact, it is not free from the effects of political action. In the last Parliament the Government sponsored an amendment to the Customs Act in order to provide that, when an increase took place in the rate of exchange, import duties should be automatically reduced. Therefore, if the Commonwealth Bank increased the exchange rate for the purpose of adjusting our trade balance, its action could be off-set by the automatic decline of import duties.","Formal Motion for Adjournment","OVERSEAS TRADE BALANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","SCULLIN, James Henry","F4Q","N/A","N/A","N/A","24","24 F4Q 0 0 SCULLIN, James Henry Mr SCULLIN - I challenge the Acting Treasurer to prove that that statement is incorrect. It is further claimed, in justification of the complacent attitude of the Government, that the increases which have taken place in importations are a sign of prosperity and increased employment because, in the main, they represent tools of trade, machinery for industry, and raw material for manufactures. That statement might convince people who do not read the list of importations. It is true that some of the increases of importations can be accounted for under these headings, but not the whole of them. For instance, apparel, attire and textiles, which by no stretch of the imagination can be said to be raw materials, but much of which could be manufactured in Australia, show an increase for the first seven months of 1934-35 to £9,466,000 from £7,524,000 for the corresponding period of the previous year. The value of importations of paints and varnishes during the same period rose from £193,000 to £285,000, or an increase of £92,000; tobacco, which can be grown and manufactured in Australia, rose from £284,000 to £676,000, an increase of £392,000; china, crockery and household ware, the manufacture of which could be undertaken on a larger scale in Australia, rose from £643,000 to £851,000, a rise of £208,000. If, under this heading, there are included some things which cannot be manufactured in Australia who will say that they represent tools of trade and raw materials? The value of imports of jewellery and fancy goods during the same period rose from £471,000 to £648,000, an increase of £177,000. Under this heading, there may be many items which are not produced in Australia, but they are luxuries, and we do not need to import them if we cannot pay for them. The value of imports of motor bodies and parts rose from £25,000 to £104,000, an increase of £79,000. The honorable member for Adelaide (Mr. Stacey) should be interested in the increase under that heading. Foodstuffs of animal origin, including potted and concentrated meats, rose from £505,000 to £734,000, an increase of £229,000. I submit that fully one-half of the increases are in respect of items which could be produced or manufactured in Australia; many more are in respect of items which we do not need if we are unable to pay for them with exports. A proper analysis of these increases would probably show that their manufacture in this country would give employment to another 10,000 persons. It take9 time for an alteration of the tariff to have any beneficial effects, and so this Government has enjoyed the benefits of the increased tariff imposed by the Labour Government. By reason of the duties we imposed our opponents were able to claim before the electors that 60,000 workers have been employed in factories since the Lyons Government came into office. As it takes time for tariff increases to have effect, so also does it take time for decreases to have effect, and the full effect of the decreases made in the tariff schedule by this government are not yet apparent. What will be the position when their effect is being fully experienced ?To ward off criticism, the Government points to the reserves in London, saying that our overseas financial position is sound. I do not want to do anything to injure the credit of our country. When I issued a warning in 1927, 1 was charged by the present Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page) with raising a cry that would destroy Australias credit. But one cannot remain silent when the obvious facts show that the countrys credit is to be destroyed. It is difficult to check exactly what our London funds are, but it has been stated that the reserves amount to £68,000,000, after allowing for certain adjustments. The accumulation of London funds is due in the main to the drastic tariff action of the Scullin Government and the consequent scaling down of imports, which gave us a credit trade balance. But we must not be lulled. into a false sense of security. Before the advent of the Bruce-Page Government, the accumulated funds in London were more than double the present amount. Immediately before the depression; we had a very large credit there, mainly as a result of loans raised overseas. But these funds dwindled away as soon as the crisis came, and our credit was stopped. So we had to fall back on the drastic policy of prohibitions. That policy has been criticized; I was leader of the Government that introduced it, and I say that it is undesirable that there should be drastic and sudden changes in tariff duties such as were forced upon us in 1930. We should try to avoid such a desperate expedient, but if we had not resorted to it at that time Australia would have had no alternative but to default. It is true that we have credit funds in London which under present conditions, not allowing for droughts or restriction of exports, will last for approximately two years. At the end of that time we shall be again facing the dangers that were imminent five years ago. But we must take into account droughts and restriction of exports. Something may be said of invisible exports due to the revival of gold-mining, but I remind honorable members that this year we shall witness a tremendous exodus of tourists from Australia who will spend abroad millions of pounds; this expenditure is equivalent to an invisible import. The money taken out of the country by these people will offset any funds which come to us .through overseas investment in Australian mining. I ask honorable members to take warning from the failure of our last conversion loan in London, a failure due, in my opinion, very largely to the fact that our trade balance is not sufficient to meet our obligations, and pay for imports. We have to find nearly £30,000,000 overseas for interest and services in addition to paying for imports. It is estimated that this year we will fall short by £18,000,000 to £20,000,000. This is a grave prospect. I ask the House to remember January, 1929, when our credit was stopped. It took years to recover; only when a favorable trade balance was assured, did our position improve. Drastic and sudden restrictions are undesirable. Take time by the forelock and avoid the necessity for such action. When the latest reductions of the tariff take full effect the position will become more serious. I urge honorable members to take note of this position, and insist on keeping the Parliament in session so that the trade balance and other grave problems may be immediately grappled with.","Formal Motion for Adjournment","OVERSEAS TRADE BALANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","PAGE, Earle","C7E","Cowper","CP","Cowper","25",". - The eloquent speech made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin) has disclosed the fact that the lessons of the depression have made no impression on his mind. He made a speech in this House seven or eight years ago, in which he said that all our troubles were due to low tariffs, and to the fact that Australia had an adverse trade balance. Yet the country which today is suffering worst from the world depression and unemployment is the United States of America, which has had a vast favorable trade balance, and has maintained an almost prohibitive tariff for many years. It is quite obvious that a favorable balance of trade is not the saveall that the right honorable gentleman suggested. Unfortunately, there are other factors involved. He recited a list of imports which he said could be made here. For instance, he said that we are importing millions of pounds worth of textiles, but I remind him that during the two years for which he was Leader of the Government he did nothing to initiate the cotton textile industry in this . country ; he merely imposed a revenue duty of 5 per cent., and that rate applies to-day. The right honorable gentleman made no attempt to increase the protection, and it is idle for him to say now that we are importing millions of pounds worth of, not woollen textiles, but cotton textiles, which have never been made in this country. The right honorable gentleman referred to the importation of paints and varnishes. Included in the figures he mentioned are £19,000 worth of gums and resins, and £63,000 worth of linseed oil which have been imported for the purpose of making paint in this country. These are the raw materials of an important industry. If honorable members will examine the list of imports they will find amongst them many luxury items, includ- ing motor cars. What did the right honorable gentleman do to prevent the importation of motor cars? Did he not leave the duty as it was imposed by the Bruce-Page Government ? Of the increase in the value of imports, £1,200,000 represents motor cars, but £450,000 worth of iron and steel sheets and bars were brought into this country for the manufacture of motor bodies; these raw materials are not manufactured in Australia. Is it not a fact that we are able to- give a tremendous amount of employment by bringing to this country partly manufactured goods which form the raw material of manufactures?The right honorable gentleman went on to say that exchange should now be superimposed on the tariff as a protective measure. The Government which he led declared that it had raised duties up to 100 per cent, on everything that mattered in this country, so that no more protection was needed. But, during the period when that Government was in power, what was the position in regard to the exchange rate? For most of the time when these high duties were in operation, and when probably more than two-thirds of the tariff schedules brought down by that Government were tabled, the exchange rate was not more than 6 or 7 per cent., and the Scullin, Government thought that was ample protection. The protection which is now being given, in accordance with the recommendations of the Tariff Board, is that to which the local manufacturers are. entitled to enable them to carry on their industries. The Tariff Board itself states that the high exchange rate gives an additional protection, and that its effect is to bring into being a number of uneconomic or an excessive number of competing industries which prevent the economic industries from properly establishing themselves, the result being the collapse of useful industries with increased unemployment and loss of capital.According to the right honorable gentleman, because of the present trend of the trade balance, Australia is drifting to destruction. I draw attention to the position in regard to Australian employment and production in the last quarter of 1934. Concurrent with the reduction of duties that has occurred in the last threeyears, the number of persons employed in» factories has increased from 336,600 in 1931-32, when the Scullin Government went out of office, to 453,200 at the? present time, this being the highest figurereached in Australian history. Theamount of unemployment in trade unions has steadily declined from 27.4 per centin 1931 to 18.8 per cent, in the fourth* quarter of 1934. Yet the right honorable gentleman would have us believe that everything is going wrong. The value-, of building permits issued affords a useful index to business activity*. The following figures show that there has been a> gratifying increase in this respect : -N/AThe index figures in regard to the production of pig iron and steel show a similarly satisfactory position -N/AAlthough we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition a tale of ruin, people are being put back into work, and production is on the increase. The iron and steel industry is now proposing to export goods to other countries, as well assupplying the Australian market. Theright honorable gentleman said that the proper thing to do would be to revert to his tariff policy; but I point out that similar policies put into operation m other parts of the world constitute themain causes of the present dislocation and/ contraction of world trade. Let me quote the non-partisan opinion of that noted! economist, Professor D. B. Copland, who, in his book, Australia in the World Crisis, at page 32, states -The second step in correcting the external) position was to increase, early in 1930, thealready heavy import duties, and to impose prohibitions on some luxury imports. This, step was officially justified on the doubleground of checking imports and providing; employment. That it was a. false step i® -capable of ready demonstration. Higher tariffs at the moment merely served to sustain high prices in protected industry, and thus to support the level of costs for export industry, which added to the rapidly-growing difficulties of export producers. It was, moreover, a clumsy and tardy method of reducing imports. The theory behind the tariff policy of the moment was indeed wholly fallacious.Kt should also be remembered that during that period, because of the inaction of the Scullin Government, the exchange did not move, as it should have done, in the interests of Australian exporters, and the tariff policy of that Government was loading costs against them. Thus we can «ee that a scissors-like action of keeping 4he exchange rate down and at the same time raising the tariff was destroying Australian prosperity and reducing employment.The right honorable gentleman re marked that during this financial year 4here is a trend towards an adverse trade balance. As a matter of fact, the balance in respect of our commodity figures is net, yet adverse, but there is a tendency in that direction. It is true that imports as compared with exports are going up; but it is futile to base criticism of the present position on figures for only part -of the financial year. We must look at the figures from season to season, recognizing that throughout Australian history there has been a definite lag in the adjustment of import values to export values. The exports, of course, pay for the imports. This lag is shown by a study of the figures for the last six or seven years. It is also wrong merely to estimate credits by reference to visible exports. The right honorable gentleman discounted the taking into consideration of invisible exports on the ground that there were equal set-offs against them, yet he did not adduce any proof in support of fcls contention. Unquestionably the whole of the facts of the case must be taken into consideration. It is quite a travesty of She facts to suggest that government Action, unless it is of a violent and revolutionary character, is at any time a material factor in influencing comparatively short-term fluctuations in the value of our external trade. It is true that violent and revolutionary action may bring about results, but even the very violent action by the Scullin Government in imposing embargoes on imports was limited to a small percentage of our total trade.No such violent action has been taken by the present Government. It cannot be shown that any action by the Lyons Administration, from its inception up to the present time, has had an adverse effect on Australian trade. An examination of imports and exports for the last six or seven years discloses a very definite lag in the movement of imports following changes in exports. While the value of our exports dropped in the first year of the depression from £138,000,000 to £98,000,000, our imports, which stood in the previous year at £143,000,000, fell to only £132,000,000. They were being paid for by the exports in previous years.","Formal Motion for Adjournment","OVERSEAS TRADE BALANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

With the larger imports there was a greater degree of employment and comfort, and an expansion of local industries. There is a simple explanation of the lag in imports. It takes time for the reduced export value of goods to affect traders and manufacturers. If an examination be made of the position since 1930- 31, it will be seen that exactly the same situation that we now face occurred in previous years. Exports and imports were both at a low level in 1930-31 and 1931- 32. In 1932-33 and 1933-34 that wonderfully spectacular jump which occurred in the price of wool added nearly £13,000,000 to the value of Australian exports. That waB due, not to something done by the Government, but to the increased price of a primary product of Australia. The result of that increased price was that we were able to buy more goods overseas, and that our financial year closed with a credit balance of £12,000,000. The figures for the eight months of the present financial year show a credit balance in respect of the items of exports and imports that I have mentioned of something like £8,600,000. If the present volume of trade continues, the final figures for the year will show exports of merchandise and silver to be £82,500,090, and of gold production £6,500,000, making a total of £89,000,000 ; and our imports will show at £70,000,000, giving us a credit of £19,000,000. That will be the result of our trading if we are able to sell all of our wool and wheat. But even if we cannot sell all our wool and wheat overseas this year, we shall still have them for sale in the subsequent year, and will be able to build up credits overseas from the proceeds. One of the results of last years high price of wool is the very big increase of imports that is noticeable at present.The Leader of the Opposition has said that we are in a desperate position, and that the position of our London funds gives cause for serious alarm. But what is the position of our London funds? Since 1931 the London funds of the trading banks and the banking department of the Commonwealth Bank have increased by nearly £30,000,000 sterling. At the end of June, 1934, the total amount of our London funds was approximately £50,000,000 sterling. As was stated earlier to-night by the Acting. Treasurer (Mr. Casey), it was in these circumstances that the chairman of directors of the Commonwealth Bank issued his warning in regard to exchange. These reserves are undoubtedly ample to meet any adverse movement in the current year.I wish to refer for a moment to the nature of the imports into Australia during this year. The Leader of the Opposition has suggested that a tremendous quantity of additional material has come into Australia during the last eight or nine months. The position is that, although there has been an increase of £9,500,000 sterling in the value of our imports for the seven months of the financial year to the end of January, luxury goods and revenue items account for £4,500,000 of that amount, raw material, material partly manufactured, and capital goods, such as machinery and the like, which appear on our tariff schedule as duty free, and were actually admitted duty free under departmental bylaw by the Scullin Government, account for another £2,000,000, while other goods, not competitive with Australian goods, account for £750,000. Goods imported under protective duties account for only £2,000,000 of the increase of £9,500,000. These figures surely show how, little danger there is to our protective system in consequence of the imports that have occurred in the last few months.","Formal Motion for Adjournment","OVERSEAS TRADE BALANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

On the contrary, it has provided additional employment in many of our main industries, with the result that the volume of unemployment has been reduced. The Government recognizes that in times like these it must watch the position closely; but it does not consider that there is any need for panic. One way to improve the prosperity of Australia is to secure a larger market for its products in other countries, and an attempt is being made to do that.","Formal Motion for Adjournment","OVERSEAS TRADE BALANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","BEASLEY, John","JOM","West Sydney","N/A","N/A","28",". - The Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page) in his introductory remarks in reply to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin) suggested that that right honorable gentleman had learned nothing from the depression, and that for that reason his accusations could be regarded as being based on inexperience and lack of knowledge of the existing circumstances. If it may be said that the Leader of the Opposition has learned nothing from the depression, it may also be said that the Acting Prime Minister has learned nothing from his previous experience as Treasurer of the Commonwealth. During his occupancy of that office he earned for himself a reputation which has not attached to any other Treasurer. One of his own supporters - an honorable gentleman who is now a member of his own Cabinet - referred to him as the most tragic Treasurer Australia has ever had. As the result of the orgy of borrowing which was indulged in over a long period of years when Australia was prosperous, and when the Acting Prime Minister was Treasurer in the Bruce-Page Government, this country has had to suffer .very severely in the last four years. There can be no doubt whatever that the dire financial crisis which faced the Scullin Government when it assumed office in 1929 was caused by the present Acting Prime Ministers administration of the finances of this country. Within a few weeks of the accession to office of the Scullin Government, the then Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank, called for immediate action to remedy the serious disorders that had been left behind by the previous government. When he was asked why he had not called upon the previous government to apply remedial action he replied to the effect that he had brought the matter under its notice several times but no action had been taken.","Formal Motion for Adjournment","OVERSEAS TRADE BALANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","BEASLEY, John","JOM","N/A","N/A","N/A","29","29 JOM 0 0 BEASLEY, John Mr BEASLEY - The Government with which the right honorable gentleman was then associated was responsible for bringing this country to a desperate position by its absolute failure to afford sufficient protection to Australian industries.  I am not suggesting that that Government or the right honorable gentleman caused the depression, but I am directing attention to certain factors which had an important bearing on the economic and financial position of Australia at that time. If the Bruce-Page Government had adopted a long-range policy during those prosperous years, as the present Government professes to be doing in the matter of agriculture by planning for the future, the country would not have been compelled to face the serious situation in which it was when the Labour Government assumed office. During unguarded moments, some honorable members opposite pay tribute to the Scullin Government for the way in which it met the situation; but at other times they contend that there was no necessity to prohibit the importation of a large number of commodities which were then being imported, and for which we could not pay. I believe that the present High Commissioner, in his speeches at Ottawa, endorsed the Scullin Governments tariff policy. The Acting Prime Minister should. at least, be generous enough to admit that the circumstances in 19-29-30 were such as have been outlined by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin). His generosity reached1 the stage of fairness only in his concluding remarks, when he admitted that the position is serious, that it must be watched closely, and that circumstances may arise to call for action. This motion has been moved because the circumstances are serious, and the position must be watched closely. We have information to-day which was not available to the House when attention was drawn to the position overseas by the present Leader of the Opposition in 1927. The statistics which the Acting Prime Minister has quoted do not alter facts or disprove that our trade balance has reached an alarming point. Although he may quote lists of commodities imported to assist our secondary industries, the fact remains that our trade balance has reached a stage at which it should be carefully handled. Attention should be directed to these facts, particularly as our opportunities will be limited owing to the short period during which the House is likely to remain in session. The right honorable gentleman quoted figures showing the extent to which unemployment has .been reduced. Reliable figures concerning unemployment are not those supplied by statisticians, but those based on the census. The estimates periodically furnished by the Commonwealth Statistician in the ordinary summaries are not reliable.","Distress Greater Without Protected Industries","TARIFF AIDS IN THE DEPRESSION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","WHITE, Thomas","KZR","N/A","N/A","N/A","30","30 KZR 0 0 WHITE, Thomas Mr WHITE - I shall deal with what the right honorable gentleman said tonight. Considering the Leader of the Opposition is usually precise, I am surprised that he should say that when the exchange moves against us duties are automatically reduced, he should know that the law only provides that when the exchange rate is reduced the duties are automatically increased in order to maintain the protection of Australian secondary industries. The right honorable gentleman takes great credit for the action of his government, -which he said saved the Commonwealth. At that time he said  These proposals are not in any way associated with the Governments protective policy . He also said  This is an emergency measure; it proposes emergency action , but he now suggests that these prohibitions and surcharges should be continued five years later. As leader of the Federal Labour party he should be interested in the unemployment figures, yet during the regime of his government prohibitions and surcharges were imposed in order te adjust the then adverse trade balance. The present Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Forde), who was Minister for Trade and Customs in the Scullin Government, said over and over again that employment could be increased only by imposing higher duties, but this, Government believes in pursuing a reasonable tariff policy, and by that means providing employment. In the metals industry of New South Wales, including Broken Hill, concerning which the Labour party should be intensely interested, the number employed during the height of prosperity in 1927 was 18,071, whereas in 1932 it had decreased to 8,400. The number employed in that industry is now 18,436, or higher than it was in 1927. The number em-, ployed in factories, in Hew South Wales, exclusive of all others, in 1932 was 126,300, but in 1934 it was 153,000. Those in New South Wales who were previously out of work, but who are now employed will not be impressed by the eloquence of the Leader of the Opposition. The general reduction of unemployment in few South Wales during the regime of the Lyons Government has been 33 per cent., while the value of production in that State has increased by £4,473,000. In Victoria the position is equally satisfactory. The right honorable gentleman would like us to believe that this Government is displacing men in industry. Nothing could be further from the truth. Increased purchases this year are the aftermath of high wool prices. For instance, the imports of motor cars, chasses and parts for the seven months period referred to by the Leader of the Opposition totalled £2,528,000 as against £1,315,000 for the corresponding period of the previous year, an increase of £1,213,000. These chasses, I would remind honorable members, are imported duty free from Great Britain, and at a high rate of duty from foreign countries, and their importation gives a considerable amount of work to motor body builders in Australia, as well as to manufacturers of batteries, tyres, and motor parts. Would the right honorable gentleman deny this additional work to Australians engaged in those industries?","Distress Greater Without Protected Industries","TARIFF AIDS IN THE DEPRESSION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","WHITE, Thomas","KZR","N/A","N/A","N/A","31","31 KZR 0 0 WHITE, Thomas Mr WHITE - In Australia we produce only about one quarter of the annual consumption. Although there is a great deal of tobacco grown in this country, we are not producing largely of the leaf required for cigars and cigarettes. Consequently, an increase in importation and consumption of tobacco means that purchasing power is returning to some people who, for so long, were out of employment. The Lyons Government, in furtherance of its policy to rehabilitate industry, also removed the primage on raw materials required for Australian manufactures. This had the effect of giving a definite stimulus to industry, and bringing down costs of production and increasing efficiency. There have been increased importations of copra, fibres, gums and resins, linseed, hessian and jute piece goods, cotton and linen piece goods; all nf these are raw materials for manufacturers, or capital goods of a class not made in Australia.The alarming story unfolded by the Leader of the Opposition about the imminent risk of a grave financial crisis, due to the present state of the trade balance, is completely exploded when one examines the figures. No one will,, however, deny that the situation, has to be watched. On this point the right honorable gentleman misquoted me when alluding to a statement which I had made recently. He gave the impression that I had informed the press that this was a matter which would automatically adjust itself. He omitted to mention that I had first spoken a warning about the trade position, and had said that thi3 matter would have to be watched from year to year.At the present time we anticipate an approximate favorable trade balance of £18,000,000 this year. Our commitments abroad for interest, exchange and other charges are about £26,000,000, so there may be a shortage. If, however, we were to build up excess funds on the other side the exchange rate would drop, whereas if we have a shortage it will move forward. At the moment there is no great advantage in having a large surplus of funds in London. The essential consideration is that all our people shall get into employment as quickly as possible, and that our industries, both primary and secondary, shall prosper. The Government will, in future, as it has in the past, watch carefully the financial situation.I deprecate the attempt by the honorable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) to vilify the Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page), who was Treasurer in the Bruce-Page Administration. The honorable member referred to him in terms that were most uncomplimentary, and were wholly undeserved. The Acting Prime Minister was responsible, in an earlier administration, for the establishment of the Loan Council, which prevented the then Premier of New South Wales, Mr. Lang, from carrying out a financial policy which would have wrecked the Commonwealth.Further, as to the effect on the unemployment situation of the increased importations disclosed in the latest figures available, I would remind the House that, although the im- portations of machinery duty free under customs by-laws have increased, their effect is to assist the mining and other industries. The list of importations of other capital goods not manufactured in Australia includes sheepshearing machines which increased in value by £11,000, and iron, steel and tinned plates for the canning industry, which increased by £146,000.","Distress Greater Without Protected Industries","TARIFF AIDS IN THE DEPRESSION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[4]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

Had the Prime Minister been present he would, no doubt, have made some attempt to reply to the charges formulated by my leader. Unlike the Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page) he would not have airily evaded the issues involved. It was quite apparent that the Acting Prime Minister was exceedingly uncomfortable while the Leader of the Opposition was speaking, because only a few months ago when we were on the hustings he warned the people of the dangers ahead if the Lyons Government were returned to power. The right honorable gentleman, as the Leader of the Country party, who was the greatest protagonist of independent political action in Australia said, in effect, that it would be calamitous if the Lyons Government were returned to office. So rapid have been the changes in the views of Ministerialists, that now the right honorable gentleman is leading that Government !The motion for the adjournment of the House, moved by the Leader of the Opposition has a very important bearing on trade, sound finance and unemployment. This being so, I am completely at a loss to understand why so much hostility is being displayed by Ministers and their supporters to this very timely warning of the dangers ahead for the Commonwealth if the trade position is allowed to drift as it has been drifting during the last few months. The Leader of the Opposition very rightly pointed to the increase of £9,400,000 in imports, and the decline in the value of Australian exports by £12,400,000 for the seven months period ended on the 31st January of this year compared with a similar period ended 31st January, 1934. A drift in the trade position of £21,000,000 in that short period cannot be lightly disregarded.The Acting Prime Minister to-night made the same ranting speech that we heard from him when the Leader of the Opposition discussed a similar danger in 1927. Mr. Bruce, who was then Prime Minister, treated the matter very lightly, suggesting that there was nothing to worry about, and that it was not necessary to take any drastic action. We who heard him on that occasion have lived to read the very eloquent speech which he delivered more recently, as Resident Minister in London. The Journal, issued by the London Chamber of Commerce for J January, 1933, contains the following report of the speech delivered by Mr. Bruce on the 2nd December, 1932 :-For the year ended 30th June, 1930, there was an adverse trade balance of £34,000,000, but as a result of the steps taken, by the end of June, 1932, this had been completely wiped out and Australia had a favorable trade balance of over £30,000,000. These figures show what a tremendous task had been accomplished . . . Faced with the heavy fall in the value of its export trade and the necessity for providing some £30,000,000 for interest overseas, Australia had ruthlessly to cut down imports and the curtailment effected was from £131,000,000 in 1929-30, to £44,000,000 in 1931-32. This curtailment was effected by prohibitions or embargoes, surcharges and very heavy increases in all customs duties ... No other course was open to the Commonwealth if it were to meet its external obligations.That was a frank admission by the former Prime Minister, but the right honorable gentleman did not give credit to _ the Scullin Government for having had the courage to put into operation a policy which pulled Australia out of its difficulties. The Acting Prime Minister, who a few years ago was well described as the  tragic Treasurer , refused to apply the necessary correction to the trade balance although there was ample evidence of grave financial difficulties before the Bruce-Page Government was removed from office. The honorable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) to-night mentioned the interview which the chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board had with the Scullin Ministry upon its accession to office. His statement that the preceding administration had disregarded the advice given by the bank board was absolutely true. Sir Robert Gibson said that something would have to be done immediately. Instead of reverting to the old system of large importations even when overseas prices rise we should be making the great bulk pf the goods we require locally, thereby keeping down imports and providing employment in Australia. But instead of doing that the Minister for Trade and Customs boasts of alterations he has made in tariff duties. It is true that since the Ottawa agreement he has reduced duties on over 1,500 items and sub-items of the tariff. The boasted Ottawa agreement which was to be such a tremendous boon to Australian industry has been a washout , and even its champions, who, a few years ago, said it was going to save the dairying and beef industries are ashamed to talk about it to-day. It has subjected the Australian manufacturer to unfair competition with the British manufacturer who pays much lower wages and works his employees much longer hours than operate in industry in this country. Clauses 9 to 14 of the Ottawa agreement provide that the Tariff Board must take cognizance of certain facts, and give the British manufacturers equal opportunity on the Australian market with the Australian manufacturers who are giving employment to our people. The Minister for Trade and Customs dealt a staggering blow to the cotton industry. He has vacillated a great deal and changed his policy in regard to the indUstry a dozen times. He has faced large deputations of cotton-, spinners who employ hundreds of our people and who could give employment to many more hundreds if it were not for the destructive policy of this Government in meddling with these tariff duties at the behest of importing; interests. Thedreadful spectre of unemployment faces us; 400,000 persons are unemployed in the. three eastern States and every year 50,000 additional boys unsuccessfully seek work. How are we to face this problem if we continue the policy of tearing down the tariff wall ? What is the policy of this Government? It is explained by half a dozen voices. The honorable member for Calare (Mr. Thorby), one of the members of the Government, speaking recently in Sydney at the Hotel Carlton before members of the Constitutional Association, said that  in the interests of Australias overseas trade, artificially bolstered up industries would have to be sacrificed. The right honorable the Prime Minister disagreed with his colleague. He said that Mr. Thorbys views did not represent the views of the Government. Infact he gave his colleague a public rebuke. What are the views of the Acting Leader of the Government on this matter? Does he support Mr. Thorby or the United Australia party which secured a large vote in the great industrial centres of Australia by saying that it stood for a protectionist policy? Professor Copland has been quoted to-night. Certain extracts were read from a report made by Professor Copland over five years ago. I will now quote from a more recent article written by Professor Copland which was published in the Melbourne Herald, of the 7 th March, 1935, in which the writer said,  Clearly at the moment we are importing beyond our capacity to absorb imports.","Distress Greater Without Protected Industries","TARIFF AIDS IN THE DEPRESSION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In. reply to the. statement that to-day there are 117,000 more people employed in secondary industry, I claim that that improvement has been due to the. policy followed by the Scullin Government, and not by the destructive policy of this Government, which is placing in jeopardy the great labour-employing secondary industries.","Distress Greater Without Protected Industries","TARIFF AIDS IN THE DEPRESSION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/interjection[2]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

I would refer him to the Statement made by the right honorable gentleman when he disclaimed any desire to do violence to the interests of the country by bringing down a motion of this nature. The ex-parte and rather biased statements made by the Leader of the Opposition were such that it is necessary in the interests of this country to offset against them facts that are expressive of the true position of the Commonwealth. Replying to a statement made by me earlier in the evening, he said that I was incorrect in saying that the Commonwealth Bank Board was in control of the exchange rate. The right honorable gentleman attempted to bear out his argument by pointing out that there was an automatic adjustment of certain protective tariff rates in accordance with variations in the exchange. At that point I ventured to interject, but the right honorable gentleman persisted in his statement. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. White) answered the right honorable gentleman by pointing out that the automatic variation of duties applies only when the exchange is reduced, and then in a way to benefit Australian industry. The Minister further explained that the adjustment did not apply when the. exchange rose. I repeat without fear of contradiction that the Commonwealth Bank Board is in complete control of the exchange rate. The subject of this debate calls for an examination of, first, the trade balance, and then the balance of payments. On the figures for the first six months of this year the trade balance is in our favour to the amount of just under £5,000,000. The estimate, and it can only be . an estimate, for the twelve months, is that on trade both ways, plus merchandise gold, there may be a positive balance in our favour of £19,000,000.","Distress Greater Without Protected Industries","TARIFF AIDS IN THE DEPRESSION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That is assuming that there will not be a big carry-over of unsold wool or wheat. If there should be, the total amount will be increased. These figures  are necessarily only estimates. For the first six months of the year, payments for our exports are usually comparatively low.","Distress Greater Without Protected Industries","TARIFF AIDS IN THE DEPRESSION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[1]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

I am impelled to reinforce certain remarks of the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. White) by saying that early in the last financial year, and in the financial year which preceded it, the right honorable gentleman attempted to draw from the figures then available inferences as to what would be the position at the end of the twelve months. Imports come in remarkably evenly throughout the year, but the money for exports is received very largely in the second half of the year. Consequently, the figures for the first six months do not give a true picture, and therefore it is most unwise to draw from them conclusions as to what the position will be at the end of the twelve months.","Distress Greater Without Protected Industries","TARIFF AIDS IN THE DEPRESSION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[3]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

But what we are concerned with is the balance at the end of the twelve months. Australia is dependent very greatly upon seasons and prices, and for that reason a fairly large balance is maintained in London to act as a shock absorber, in order to meet situations such as that which now exists. As the right honorable the Leader of the Government has said, there has been since 1931 a building up of London funds to an amount of approximately £30,000,000. We know that, on the 30th June last, there was in London approximately £50,000,000, apart altogether from the note issue reserve, to meet periods of adverse trading conditions. It is impossible to keep on building up London funds year after year. If that were to happen automatically, there would be no necessity to keep London funds.","Distress Greater Without Protected Industries","TARIFF AIDS IN THE DEPRESSION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[4]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

On two previous occasions, the right honors able gentleman drew such deductions early in the year, and was proved catastrophically wrong. No attempt has been made to argue that there is any real possibility of our having a favorable trade balance in the present financial year; but I do say that any adversity in our balance of payments is not such as to cause the slightest alarm. In support of that contention I refer the right honorable gentleman to the statement of the Chairman of the Commonwealth BankBoard that I read earlier, which categorically established the fact that the London funds are quite sufficient to take care of the position.","Distress Greater Without Protected Industries","TARIFF AIDS IN THE DEPRESSION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/continue[6]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","LAZZARINI, Hubert","L07","Werriwa","N/A","N/A","36",". - I have only a few observations to make on the subject now before the House. It seems to me that the arguments advanced from both sides may be aptly described as tweedledum and tweedledee. A wordy battle, similar to that indulged in by a number of lawyers, has been waged, but little of a convincing nature has emerged to indicate what is likely to rectify the economic position not only of our own country, but also of the world generally. We have had high protection to the point of prohibition, with negligible results of a favorable character. Unemployment has increased, and the burden of economic woe has been more severely felt by the worker. Low tariffs, approaching to freetrade, have had exactly the same result. Like the tides on the sea shore, the trade balance has ebbed and flowed, first becoming a little . better and then a little worse. The budgetary position improves slightly to-day, and becomes less favorable to-morrow. The operation of the existing system reminds one of a dog chasing its tail. There is an old saying that figures do not lie, but liars can figure. Figures are used in different ways in an endeavour to illustrate this or that side of the question, but the fact remains that in Australia and the world generally the economic position of the people is becoming worse as time goes on. There are greater thinkers and economists of higher standing than Professor Copland, who to my mind writes and speaks as he is paid to do, in the interests of a system that he is trying to bolster up, a system which he knows is decaying and tottering. In spite of high or low tariffs, in spite of adverse trade balances between one country and another, the world generally has yet to pass through the most gruelling period of the depression. The evils that confront us, the economic ills that affect Australia and the world to-day, are due not to either high or low tariffs, but simply to the conflicting and hopelessly chaotic conditions that have been brought about by the capitalistic system under which we live. In all discussions of this kind we are like the ostrich, which when in danger buries its head in the sand; we are afraid to face the issue, but try to persuade ourselves that a solution of our problems can be found in discussions such as this. In every discussion in this Parliament we merely beg the question unless we are prepared to have an organized system of society under a managed economy, whereby the forces of nature will be used in the interests of all the people instead of with the object of profiting a few. We must be prepared to harness the machine and use it for the benefit, instead of for the degradation, of the race. I listened more in distress of mind than with interest to members of this National Parliament indulging in what I can only term a game of make-believe - trying to make one another believe that in this or that way we shall solve our problems. Had we the intelligence which we should possess as members of this Parliament we should know that our problems will not be solved in that way. I hope that this Parliament will set itself to deal with the economic problems confronting this country, although while the present Government remain in office that may perhaps be only a pious hope. We should, however, get to grips with the economic problems with a view to establishing Australia on a sounder footing. I repeat that all that is happening in the world is that the financiers lift the burden a little to-day only to squeeze a little harder to-morrow. The position of the world is as hopeless as is an attempt to get rid of a dent in a rubber ball; we remove one dent only to make another. If one country becomes a little more prosperous another gets deeper in trouble. There is a continual see-sawing from one nation to another, and the people are gulled into the belief that some day relief will be afforded. In respect of human values, Australia is in a worse position to-day than at any time previously. We hear a great deal of the relief of unemployment, but what is the position? We should be ashamed to describe as employment the conditions under which many in our midst are called upon to work. Fathers and mothers of Australian children are forced to live under conditions which are disgraceful; capitalism and the money powers must get their pound of flesh, come weal or woe. The Arbitration Court and the powers of the Commonwealth are used to destroy and tear up wage conditions and arbitration awards; men are put to work on great constructional undertakings at dole rates of pay. If such things continue, the whole of our people will before long be reduced to the same low standard. This discussion has made very little impression on me, other than to depress me. In this game of make-believe we try to persuade ourselves, as well as the people who sent us here, that along the lines advocated by some honorable members will Australias problems be solved and this country rehabilitated, whereas any one who analyses the position intelligently must know that none of these expedients can possibly put Australia on an even keel.","Distress Greater Without Protected Industries","TARIFF AIDS IN THE DEPRESSION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A commission for painting the portrait was entrusted to John A. A. Berrie, R.C.A., and the work has now been completed. The picture is a threequarter length portrait of His Majesty in the service uniform of Field-Marshal.In proposing to the Government that a portrait of His Majesty should be acquired, the War Memorial Board suggested that not only would this be an appropriate act on the occasion of the jubilee of the Kings reign but that it was also desirable that a portrait of the King, who wisely guided the Empire through the difficult years of the war, should be hung in the National Memorial. With these views the Government agreed and the High Commissioner was requested to inquire if His Majesty would consent to a portrait being painted.The Government has been informed that the King has shown a personal interest in the proposal and expressed the . wish to be painted in the uniform of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army. That was the uniform in which the King was seen by the Australians when His Majesty visited them on the battle-fields in France, and in military hospitals, and when they attended investitures at Buckingham Palace. His Majestys choice was therefore most appropriate. The portrait is expected to arrive in Australia a few weeks hence. It will be hung in the War Memorial which is now being erected in Canberra.The War Memorial Board believes that there are throughout Australia many public bodies and private citizens who would like, on the occasion of the jubilee, to acquire a recent portrait of His Majesty. In accordance with powers conferred by the Australian War Memorial Act the board will therefore arrange for facsimile colour reproductions to be made. The distribution of the reproductions will provide employment for returned soldiers, portion of the proceeds will be donated by the board to the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australias distress funds which the board has been assisting during the last six years, and the remainder will be used to further the aims and objects of the War Memorial itself.The board has received from the press requests for photographs for reproduction. It realizes the desirability of making photographs available not only to those who have made such requests, but to all editors who wish to reproduce the portrait. The board will therefore issue an authorized photograph of the portrait to the press for this purpose, as soon as this can be done without affecting the distribution of the colour reproductions the board will have made. The board will be grateful if any newspaper which may receive an unauthorized photograph of the portrait or of the reproduction the board is publishing, will refrain from using it, as the board believes that such use would adversely affect the distribution of the colour reproduction, and thereby prejudice the attainment of the objects the board has in view.Motion (by Mr. Archdale Parkhill) put -That the question be now put.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The position is somewhat complex, but may be explained thus. When the note issue was handed over to the Commonwealth Bank in 1020, the total accumulated interest, amounting to £7,780,000 derived from investment of the funds, was retained by the Commonwealth, and applied to the redemption of debt. It is not the practice to allocate debt redemptions to specific items of loan expenditure, vide page 89 of budget papers, which shows the. total amount of loan expenditure on various works, and, at the foot, shows a deduction of redemptions in one amount. For the purpose of this question, however, it may be regarded that, of the total of £5,300,000 borrowed from the Notes Fund, the proportion redeemed out of earnings retained by the Commonwealth was approximately £3,428,000. On this basis the existing debt is £3,232,000, of which £1,872,000 is due to the Note Issue Department of the Commonwealth Bank, and the balance is due on account of other borrowings partly from the public and partly from the Commonwealth trust funds.The interest is paid partly to the Commonwealth Bank for credit of the Notes Fund, partly to the Revenue Account of the Commonwealth in respect of investment of trust funds, and partly to the public.See answers above.","East-West Railway","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
