Honorable members will recollect that an arrangement was made by which the Government was to pay certain gratuities to all who had rendered war service. We were to pay ls. 6d. per day to every member of the Naval Forces and to every member of the Australian Imperial Forge who went on active service outside Australia, the period for which payment was to be made being from the date of embarkation of each man to the 28th June, 1919. It was arranged, too, that we should pay a gratuity of ls. per day to each man who had enlisted for active service but did not embark, and the maximum period for which this gratuity was to be paid was six months. To carry out these obligations it was estimated that £30,000,000 would be required, and as that was considered at that time a sum that would strain the financial resources of the country, having regard to our other heavy war obligations, it was decided to issue bonds bearing interest at the rate of 5i per cent., free of taxation, and redeemable in 1924. The original understanding was that this would be a three years .arrangement, and that the total amount involved would be £30,000,000, but it seems to me now that when all liabilities have been met in connexion with the issue of these bonds the expenditure wik, be within £28,000,000.","WAR GRATUITIES","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[6]/answer/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The bonds .actually issued to the 30th April represented £25,831,936. Some claims have not yet been lodged-why, I do not know; perhaps some soldiers or dependants do not intend to lodge them. Others -have been lodged, but have not yet been determined. All sorts of complications arise, even in so simple a matter as determining who is the rightful claimant. Sometimes there are two claimants for the same bond. Many other phases of the kind are being investigated by the Board set up for the purpose . A great many claims are only now being sent in. But I should think that another £2,000,000 will cover the balance of our liabilities. Of the £25,831,936 worth of bonds issued, cash payments have been made by the .Government through the banks to the amount of £6,000,000. In .addition, cash payments have been made directly by the Government totalling £2,276,372. Other bonds have been cashed by employers, traders, life assurance companies, and others, to a value of £5,136,799. The total cash or cash equivalent received by the soldiers and their dependants to the end of April amounted to £13,413,171. The bonds still held. by soldiers and dependants, total £12,418,765. It. will be seen, therefore, that of the total bonds issued more than half have been already cashed. The Government have all along continued the practice of cashing bonds in necessitous cases, ,and for soldiers wishing to marry.If a soldier is in particularly necessitous circumstances he applies to the Treasury, and after investigation of the mans position we cash his bond.","WAR GRATUITIES","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[6]/answer/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I hope the bulk of the holders of the remaining 150,000 will continue to held their bonds, for I cannot help feeling, as I have said all along, that those who do hang on to them will be glad in the sequel that they did so. The bonds are returning good interest, the income from them is tax free, and I am quite sure that any soldier who can hold them will be glad that he did so. At the time the bonds were issued, certain requests were made to the Government for the payment of cash, and an arrangement was made by which £6,000,000 worth would be cashed immediately through the bank?. We promised, further, to liquidate another £10,000,000 worth by the end of the present month. We placed first in the category of those who are to obtain cash out of the £6,000,000 provided by the hanks widows of members of the Forces, and next in order of preference come widowed mothers of unmarried deceased members of the Forces, mothers of deceased members if they were dependent on the deceased members, blind or totally and permanently incapacitated members of the Forces, members who married after discharge, and persons found by the War Gratuity Board to be in necessitous circumstances. All other classes of persons were to be paid by non-negotiable bonds maturing not later than May, 1924.The Government also undertook that a further sum of £10,000,000 would be provided in  May of this year. The moment I realized our liability for May, I set to work to try to move off the bonds as safely as possible, taking all the care we could to insure that the soldier was not dealt with unjustly in the cashing transactions. I do not pretend to say that some soldiers have, not fallen in. I know only too well and regretfully that they have done so. But we cannot avoid all these happenings whilst human nature is what it is. We have done our best to prevent the, soldier being  taken down, and I believe with very successful results, on the whole. My idea was to get out as much cash as possible in anticipation of the obligation falling due this month, and the result is that at the present moment nearly £14,000,000 worth of cash is in the hands of the soldiers or dependants.","WAR GRATUITIES","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[6]/answer/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

After having discussed the whole matter with the representatives of the soldiers, they agree with me that we cannot get a better tribunal than the one which we already have. Criticism has, of course, been levelled against them, but they have carried through a task of great complexity and difficulty, and, upon the whole, have carried it through with striking success. One reason for that is that all the members of the War Gratuity Board are themselves returned soldiers, and therefore may be expected to be in sympathy with those who are claimants for this cash. General Wisdom, who was the President of the first War Gratuities Board, is at present the administrator of New Guinea. His administrative experience at the Front stood him in good stead. In addition to being an able man possessed of plenty of good common sense, he has had all the experience of a soldier, and knows the psychology of a soldier, and all these things, I have no doubt, helped him to make the cashing of these bonds the success that it was upon the whole. The position, therefore, is that when an additional £2,000,000 has been found we shall have discharged the promises we made to the soldier in full. Indeed, we shall have more than discharged what was in our minds at the time those promises were made. Then, the idea was that there would be about £30,000,000 worth of these gratuity bonds issued, and the estimate that £16,000,000 worth of them would be redeemed by the end of May was based upon that issue. We propose to give the soldiers £16,000,000 cash, notwithstanding that the bonds actually issued will really fall £2,000,000 short of the original estimate. I have no need to occupy further time. That is the proposal which we are making. It has been approved by the executive of the Soldiers League, with whom I have been a good deal in consultation, as well as by as many more members of the Forces as I could get into touch with. They all agree that out proposal represents a broad and generous discharge of the obligations which we incurred to the soldiers at the time these bonds were originally issued. I hope that when the ?16,000,000 worth of bonds has been redeemed we shall be in a position to redeem still more of them should the occasion require it. I hope, however, that very little more will be asked for by the soldiers before the maturity of the bonds, because I profoundly believe that those who hang on to them will, in the end, be both proud and glad that they did so.","WAR GRATUITIES","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[6]/answer/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
27,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CHARLTON, Matthew","JXA","Hunter","N/A","N/A",8658,".- In the early part of the session I took action with a view to bringing under the notice of the Minister for Repatriation the position in regard to war pensions and other allowances which are administered under the Repatriation Act. Since then no improvement has taken place. I would have included in my motion the question of the administration of War Service Homes, but for the fact that in connexion with that administration in New South Wales, a report is to be placed upon the table of the House in the near future. Upon that account I refrained from the action which I had contemplated. The matter which forms the subject of this motion is one of considerable importance, because it affects a very large section of those men who were in the fighting-line, and who, when leaving Australia, were promised that ample provision would be made for them in the event of their suffering any disability, either of a permanent or a temporary character. Yet, to-day we find that there are hundreds of complaints from returned men who are partially, or in some cases wholly incapacitated, because their pensions have either been reduced or discontinued. I remember reading the debate which took place in this chamber when the Repatriation Bill was under consideration. Upon that occasion it was pointed out by honorable members upon this side of the House, and particularly by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Tudor), that the transfer of war pensions from the Old-age Pensions Department to the Repatriation Department would prove very unsatisfactory to the soldiers themselves. I also recollect the honorable member for Hume (Mr. Parker Moloney) moving to recommit that measure for the purpose of reconsidering this phase of the question. His motion was defeated by only nine votes, clearly demonstrating that at that time there was not a very large majority in this chamber in favour of transferring war pensions from the Old-age Pensions to the Repatriation Department. Since then it has been amply proved that the transfer was a mistake. The change has in no way reduced the cost of administration. As a matter of fact, the administrative costs under the Repatriation Department are greater than they were under the Old-age Pensions Department. In the latter Department we had officers who, by reason of long experience, knew exactly how to handle the claims of applicants for pensions. These officers were also very sympathetic with the claimants. They understood precisely how to deal with old people and with our soldiers. When the war pensions were transferred to the Repatriation Department a considerably increased staff had to be employed.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am altogether dissatisfied with the way in which the clerical work of the Repatriation Department is performed. Most honorable members have a large correspondence with that Department in connexion with these matters, and my own experience is that when it forwards replies to my communications it frequently omits to name the township in which the particular applicant concerned resides. . I have, therefore, either to keep a complete list of the names of the applicants who are communicating with me, or else to request the Department to forward me the address of the particular applicant whose claim is the subject of a departmental letter. One would naturally expect that the Department upon receipt of such a communication would immediately forward the address of the soldier in question. But instead of doing so it merely sends a formal acknowledgment of the request with an intimation that the matter will be given consideration. Then, probably in three or four weeks time, another letter from the Department will come to hand. Upon the last occasion that this matter was discussed, we were told that the House had taken away from the Government the power to deal with this particular Board.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He makes his investigations, asks such questions as he may deem necessary, comes to certain conclusions, and testifies thereon that So-and-so is now only two-thirds, or one-third, incapacitated, and that his pension should be accordingly adjusted.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The only construction I can put upon the consistent way in which these reports go against the views of the regular medical attendants is that the officer from Sydney desires to justify his appointment by the actual amount of saving which he is able to make for the Commission in respect of pensions paid.Section 26 reads -EachBoard shall be charged with the duties of -determining whether the death or incapacity of a member of the Forces in fact resulted from an occurrence happening during the period he was a member of the Forces, and, in the case of incapacity, the nature and extent thereof;determining whether the death or incapacity of a person enlisted or appointed for service in connexion with naval or military preparations or operations in fact resulted from his employment in connexion with those preparations or operations;determining the extent to which persons alleged to be dependent upon a member of the Forces were in fact so dependent; andassessing the rates of pensions of members of the Forces and their dependants, and determining the dates of the commencement of such pensions.The Commission may at any time direct that any particular case or cases of a particular class be referred to it for assessment or determination.The wording of the section testifies beyond doubt that when this Parliament was dealing with the subject of pensions it sought to make the whole matter as clear as possible for the guidance and assistance of the administering body. Rather than that it might be said that the Act was in any way ambiguous, Parliament deliberately inserted the words - resulted from an occurrence happening during the period he was a member of the Forces, and, in the case of incapacity, the nature and extent thereof.When previously addressing myself to this subject, the Minister desired me to bring forward particulars of specific cases. I did so, and I wish to add now that of those which .1 indicated one has been settled satisfactorily. The person concerned has been paid right back, and in full. In connexion with others, however, the State Board has refused to reverse its earlier decisions. I wish to draw attention again to the case pf a man named Schubert. The Board has intimated that it cannot see its way clear  to alter its former decision, because - in effect- the man was for four: months in camp in Australia and only a little more than one day in the trenches in Prance, after which he became afflicted with gout. The Board added that it is plain that such affliction was not occasioned by the mans participation in war-like operations. The comment is attached that Schubert received the same kind of food while he was in camp in England as he would have had if he had been at home. His pension has been taken away, although he cannot work and has a family to keep. Does the section say that before a soldier may become the recipient of a pension he must have been struck down by a bullet or by a shell fragment? I repeat that it is framed in most definite language: an occurrence happening during the period he was a member of the Forces. Let me put it that I am eligible, and that I have offered my services. I am examined by the official medical officers and am passed. That is to say, I am presumed to be fit for active service abroad. If, after having passed the medical test, and having gone into camp, I develop some ailment and am unable by reason thereof to go overseas, and, following my discharge, I am unable to take up my usual employment, is my family to starve? Am I not entitled to say that - from whatever cause, known or unknown - my disability occurred after I had offered myself and had been accepted by my country for service in its behalf? Does not section 26 most clearly and specifically cover such a case, and the case of Schubert also? This man actually went to England and France. He reached the trenches.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

41,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CHARLTON, Matthew","JXA","N/A","N/A","N/A",8660,"- Maybe o so; but that is an entirely different matter Once a man has been accepted, the Government must take the responsibility for his care; it is an inescapable obligation, and it was never intended that the definite terms of the Act should, or could, be so twisted as to render the Government free of liability. I guarantee that if a vote of the people were taken the unanimous answer would be that, after a man had offered his services, and had been accepted, if any hurt or ailment accrued, his care and support should become the nations obligation.I have still another case, that of a man named Amos, who is married and has five children. He has informed me that it is impossible for him to do a days work; and it is a fact, I understand, that he has not done a days work since his return. He was at one stage in receipt of the full pension, but the medical officer sent up from Sydney examined him and certified to the Board that he was not totally incapacitated. He is now regarded, therefore, as being only two-thirds incapacitated, and his pension has been proportionately reduced. Seeing that the man cannot work, it is self-evident that he is totally incapacitated. While he was just as fully incapacitated as he is to-day, Amos was receiving the full pension. I appealed to the Board to review its decision, but have been informed that it is not able to see any reason to make an alteration. I wish to refer now to the case of a man named Taylor. The following letter from the chairman of the Repatriation Commission, addressed to myself, and dated 24th May, 1921, gives the particulars-William R. Taylor, 2426, Private, 36th Battalion.With reference to your representations to the Acting Minister regarding the case of the above-named, I have to inform you that careful consideration has been given to this case by the Commission, and, in view of the medical evidence, it cannot be considered that Ms incapacity is the result of, or was aggravated by, his military service. -His service record shows that a fortnight after he disembarked in England he was admitted to hospital, and he was almost continuously in hospital up to the time of embarkation to Australia. Moreover, according to his own admission, his condition was pre-existent. Under the circumstances, he was liberally treated in having been paid pension of one-half of the maximum rate from 15th July, 1917, to 27th January, 1021, and the Commission regrets it cannot approve of continuation of payment.In this case it is said that the applicant admitted that the complaint was pre-existent; but if the man was affected when he was accepted and went overseas, his illness became more acute, and, as he cannot now work, there is no justification for the Government breaking away from the promises made. We said at the outbreak of war that if the manhood of our community came forward and enlisted we would stand by them; but now, on the least possible pretext, the Government are endeavouring to get away from their obligations. I admit there may be malingerers, and if there are some who are deliberately endeavouring to obtain a pension on false pretences, they should be dealt with, because they should not take advantage of the concessions which the Government are providing for men who have actually been disabled. If men are able to work they should be prepared to do so; but, on the other hand, if some are incapacitated, or partially so, as the result of war service, and they were passed by the medical examiner, the obligation of attending to them until restored to health is resting upon this Parliament.Another case has been brought under my notice, but as the person concerned is in the electorate of the honorable member for Robertson (Mr. Fleming), I forwarded the communication to him for attention. I am mentioning the matter, however, so that honorable members may be aware of the position. The man, who is named Skillicorn, is a miner by occupation, and states that on his return from the war he was granted a pension. Like an honorable man, when he had recovered sufficiently, he notified the authorities that he was able to resume his occupation, and requested them to discontinue his pension. A short time after he had resumed employment his old complaint returned, and he was as bad as ever, with the result that it was impossible for him to work. He found that the trouble which arose at the war had returned, and he applied to the Board for a renewal of the pension, but it absolutely refused to grant it.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In order to show honorable members how this matter affects returned soldiers, I shall read a letter from the Maitland and District sub-branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, dated 21st May, 1921. It reads :-My Committee desire me to convey to yon their appreciation of your very fine efforts in the House of Representatives on the question of pensions. We feel sure that you are sincere in your efforts for the betterment of our disabled comrades and relatives, and hope that you are granted the health to pursue this question to a successful issue- >This is what I wish to direct particular attention to -It is very hard, indeed, to have the fact brought home to us in such a dastardly manner that we are so soon forgotten, but very pleasant, on the other hand, to know that we still have friends who are not afraid to champion the rights we fought so hard for. We have some very distressing cases in our district, whose British pride alone keeps them from publicity, and we can only wait and hope that such cases will soon benefit by the result of your excellent efforts.That, is a communication from a representative of the returned soldiers. These men opposed me at the last election ; but I am fighting for what I think are their rights. During the great crisis in 1914 and the following years, when men were being asked to go to the Front, we offered every inducement to those who were prepared to volunteer by saying that we would stand by them and see that their interests were protected. We said that they should not want as a result of their patriotism; but, although the war has only been over for two and a half years, the returned soldiers are beginning to realize that they are almost forgotten.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I made promises in this Chamber in common with other honorable members, and I am going to see that they are carried out. I sincerely regret that there is a tendency to forget these men who did so much for us during that trying period. It does not reflect to our credit when we realize what is. actually occurring. Even to-day we hear much of patriotism and the freedom we enjoy under the British flag, but the very men who have been prating about their loyalty are not prepared to stand behind the soldiers who went forth to preserve our liberty. On every hand inducement was offered to men to go to the Front, but now it seems that their noble efforts are to be forgotten. The men are beginning to see the true position, and it is up to this Parliament to do something to rectify their wrongs. We can only create loyalty by making the masses contented and happy, but that result will not be achieved if we are constantly taking advantage of those who sacrificed so much for our liberty. We told them that they would have to endure hardships, but that when they returned it would be our duty to see that their wants were provided for. Are Ave to ignore our promises? I trust this House will do its duty, and that the Minister will take the whole matter in hand. I do not wish him to send these complaints on to the Commission, but to personally investigate them, and set up some standard for future guidance. It is the duty of the Minister to let the State Boards and the Commission know that .this House will not allow them to take advantage of the soldiers simply because they were not struck by a bullet or shrapnel. If men were accepted for service, and are now unable to follow their usual occupation they should be provided for. There are some instances in which -men who are performing light work are receiving one-half or two-thirds of what they did previously. In any case in which a man is unable to do any work, he should be given the full pension. I ask the Minister to give this matter his very serious consideration. I hope that he will give the Commission and the State Boards to understand that Parliament is deeply concerned with the interests of the soldiers, and expects them to administer the Act which it passed, and that unless they do so they must give way to persons more competent to carry out the job.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It really appears to me as if the majority of the present Commission seem to think that it is their duty to cut down every pension they can, with a view to saving money, and without consideration for the rights and justice of the cases of different individuals.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I wish to refer to some of the  T B  cases of men in different sanatoriums. I refer, first of all, to the case of James P. Cooke. This man enlisted and went to France. While at the Front, he was sent into hospital, and it was discovered that he had this fearful disease of tuberculosis, and he was sent back to Australia. He was put into a sanatorium, and it was there recognised that he was entitled to a pension. His health improved, and he was allowed to leave the sanatorium. His pension was continued for a time after he left the sanatorium, and then it was suddenly reduced, and he was granted £1 per week. The reason given for reducing his pension was that he had suffered - and this was admitted - from what is medically termed empyema. This really means an abscess on the lungs, for which an operation is performed, the pus is let out, and the abscess removed, but a scar is left on the body. Every one conducting a medical examination of the man must have seen this scar, and, by making inquiries, could have found out the cause of it. However, the man was passed as medically fit, .and went to the Front.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He was passed by the medical officer as fit for active service, but now, apparently, because of the operation of which the scar is evidence, this mans pension has been cut down to £1. This is given as a sort of act of grace, and this man suffering from this awful disease, which requires all the nourishment he can get, is now asked to exist on £1 per week. It is an absolute scandal upon this Parliament and upon every one responsible for the work of repatriation that mou should be treated in this way. Like others similarly afflicted, this man is trying to keep life in his body as long as he can, and he is confronted with, the knowledge that his inability to obtain sufficient nourishment reduces his chance of living. I shall read a letter received from the medical officer of the BedfordPark Sanatorium in connexion with this particular case. It is dated 26th February, 1921, and is as follows: -Mr. J. P. Cooke is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, and his present condition is due to war service.The empyema for which he was operated upon may or may not have been tuberculosis. The empyema operation scar was visible at all examinations, and the man must have been in good condition to justify the medical officers accepting him for active service in spite of the history of empyema, about which, so Cooke tells me, special inquiries were made.I shall not read the whole of the letter, but it goes on to say that this man might have gone through the war. He was perfectly fit for active service, which bears out what the honorable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) has said. The operation performed upon him did not necessarily prevent him being a strong, healthy man, and as Dr. Hayward, the writer of the letter, says, any medical man examining him must have noticed the evidence that he had been operated upon. He was passed by the medical officer in spite of this. There was no attempt to deceive the medical officer when the man submitted himself to examination, and yet, after all this time, we say to him,  You can live as best you can on £1 per week. That is all that your country is prepared to do for you.I wish to refer now to another case. I shall not mention the name, because another honorable member is dealing with the case, and the only point I desire to mention in connexion with it is that Mr. A. H. Teece, a member of the Repatriation Commission, was approached by the Returned Soldiers Association of South Australia in connexion with it, and made the following statement in reply:--Where the Repatriation Department alleged that a disability was existent before the war, and the -pensioner claimed that it was not, the onus of proving otherwise rested with the Department.In this case, the man has been able to produce doctors certificates and other evidence necessary to prove that there was not a suspicion that he had suffered from this complaint or was likely to suffer from it. After receiving a pension for a short time this man is left to-day with absolutely nothing, although he is suffering from this awful disease.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have to refer to two other cases, those of Messrs. Shaw and Sinclair, which are somewhat similar to those to which I have already referred. It was not denied, in either of these cases, that the men, prior to being passed by the examining medical officer, had suffered years before, and there was a suspicion that they had suffered from this complaint. There is no suggestion that the medical officer was deceived or that the men attempted to deny the facts. He passed them as medically fit; they were enlisted, went through all the camps, and went away from Australia.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They came back, and to-day are suffering from this complaint; but the Commissioners say that they were suffering from it before they went to the war, and refuse to give them a pension. In effect, the Commissioners wipe their hands of these men, and leave them to live as best they can. When we were appealing to the able-bodied men of this community to enlist, every man who offered his services was cheered, as the honorable member for Newcastle (Mr. Watkins) has said, and men were allowed to leave for the Front only after competent medical officers had certified to their fitness. The two men to whom I refer, in common with others who enlisted, were examined, not once, but on several occasions, and were submitted to a final examination just before they embarked. How, then, can it be said that they were suffering from tuberculosis before they went away? They received a pension for a little while after their return, and were then informed that it would no longer be payable to them. What is the reason for this treatment? Is it that the Commission are out to save money by treating returned soldiers in this scandalous manner, or is it because they have not a proper appreciation of what were the views of this Parliament in passing legislation with the object of doing the fair thing by our men who went to the Front?I propose now to refer to the case of a man named Bromley, who does not come under the  T.B. category. He enlisted, was passed as fit, and went to the Front. While there he met with an- accident, went into hospital, and ultimately was returned to Australia. On his discharge, he was given a pension, which, later on, was reduced, and finally was stopped on the ground that he was fit to follow his usual occupation. The actual facts are that as soon as Bromley was able,, after his return, to get about, he Was given employment at the Keswick Barracks. He was suffering from spinal trouble, and could not stoop; but the work allotted to him at the barracks did not involve any stooping, and he was able to carry on. While at the barracks he received a pension. Owing to the gradual reduction- of work at the barracks, Bromley left, and got another job where he had to stoop, The consequence was that he was taken ill, and went into the Keswick Hospital. Before he went there, however, his pension had been stopped on the ground that he was able to follow his usual occupation. He remained in the hospital for months, and, although he is out to-day, he is told by medical men that he must always wear a spinal jacket, and on no account do any work which will involve his stooping. And yet the authorities say that he is fit to follow his usual occupation, and refuse to give him a pension.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Their sole object is apparently to cut off as many pensions as possible. They seem to think that by making reductions in this way they are carrying out their duty. I do not think they are, and will join with others in an effort to force these gentlemen to realize what the Parliament wants them to do in the direction of carrying out effectively the duty of Australia to those who fought for it.- The honorable members time has expired.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
77,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"ANSTEY, Frank","JLY","Bourke","N/A","N/A",8665,".- The Minister (Mr. Rodgers) said a few moments ago that I was one of the most favoured members of this House. As to that, I can only say that I realize that one can get nothing but of the Departments by running hostile to their official chiefs. If a man cannot get anything out of t.hem when he has the influence of the Minister behind him, then there is absolutely no chance of obtaining redress. If honorable members generally get no more satisfaction from the Departments involved in this matter than I do - notwithstanding that the Minister says that I am one of the most favoured of members - then God help them! In my twenty years of parliamentary experience, I have not known a Department to show a more callous indifference to the requirements of members than that shown by the Departments dealing with war pensions and war gratuities. One can write letter after letter to them, get the support of the Minister, and yet not obtain a definite settlement. I have written to the Minister, obtained his support, received from him an acknowledgment of my letter and a statement that it has been sent on to such-and-such a Department, but month after month has gone by without any definite settlement. That has frequently been my experience. Here are two cases that are typical of dozens with which I have had to deal. The first relates to a man whose position is very much like that of the returned soldier to whom the honorable member for Adelaide (Mr. Blundell) has just referred. He was called up and asked why he did not enlist. He said he was not able to go to the. Front; that he was physically unfit, inasmuch as he had an hereditary complaint. He was passed, however, as fit, went into camp, developed the complaint to which he had said he was liable, and asked to be paid off, but was kept there for nearly two years. He was finally paid off because he could not stand up. To-day that man is a derelict, living on the charity of his friends, and can get no relief from the Department. I agree with the honorable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton) that the responsibility for the proper treatment of these men rests with the Government themselves. This man told the authorities that he had an hereditary complaint, but he was told to come up, was passed as medically fit, and sent into camp. I am concerned, not so much with the decisions arrived at by the Department from time to time in regard to various cases, but rather with the delay in dealing with matters submitted by honorable members. Surely when I address a letter to the Department, I am entitled to an answer. If I write to the Assistant Minister for Repatriation (Mr. Rodgers) in regard to a particular case I at once receive from him a letter to the effect that the case has been sent on to such-and-such an officer to be dealt with. But there the matter ends. I wait month after month, but hear nothing from the Department. Finally the man concerned comes to me and asks what I am doing in the matter. I reply, I wrote to the Minister months ago, got an answer from him, and wrote to the Department, but no settlement of the case is forthcoming. Then I have to go through the whole procedure once again. The Department seems to absolutely ignore the cases submitted to it by honorable members, There is one more case, which is typical of dozens. A woman whose husband was killed at the war had adopted a child from a few weeks old, and she was told by an officer that if she complied with the conditions of legal adoption she could get a pension for it. This the woman did, and was duly given a pension ; but it was suddenly cut off, and no reason given. I wrote to the Minister on her behalf, and the case was sent on to the officials, and I received an acknowledgment of the receipt of my letter. But no reason was given even then for depriving this woman of her pension. Why are not definite answers given to communications of the kind ? Apparently the Minister then forgot all about the case, but finally a letter came to say that the woman should inform the Department as to which officer it was who told her to legally adopt the child. How could the woman tell which officer it was 1 What does it matter who gave the woman that information ? The fact remains that she complied with the conditions, and yet the pension is cut off. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, when an honorable member writes to the Minister about such matters there is no definite answer.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We ought not to talk of creating a crisis. This is not a party question, and the Minister is thoroughly sympathetic, as we know from the efforts he made at the inception of the repatriation scheme. At the same time, there are unfortunate people who cannot obtain clothes and food for themselves and their children, although promised that they would be looked after, and they have been crippled and ruined by the war. I invite the Minister to look into matters for himself, and then inform the House that there is to be a change. I do not know that the officials in charge are unsympathetic, but, if not, they have a curious way of showing their sympathy.

I also indorse the statement that once a man was passed by the proper medical authorities and sent overseas, from that moment the Government accepted the fullest responsibility for his future welfare, whether the decision as to his medical fitness for service was right or wrong. No doubt other honorable members have received, as I have, numerous letters complaining of f aulty  administration of the Pensions Act, the frequent excuse for refusing to pension being that the injury received was not due to warlike operations. I may mention the case of a Gurkha, a steady, hard-working man, married to a white woman, and with a family of three children, whose injury the Department declared was not due to the war. As a matter of fact, that man had never had a days illness in his life before he went to the Front. After being in the trenches for about, six months, he was blown up one day and was injured in the abdomen by a piece of the falling timbers. Since then he has frequently been vomiting blood. Upon representations being made to the Department he was subsequently allowed a pension of 7s. 6d. per week and a few shillings for his wife and children. Whether his pension was reduced because he is a coloured man I cannot say, but, at all events, there was an admission that his injury was due to war-like operations, though he has been denied full pension rights. I may also quote the case of a man who had an injury to the knee of many years standing, but prior to the war it was practically all right, and he was passed for active service. As the result of excessive marching and hard work in the trenches, his knee gave way again, and it is now contended that as the injury had been sustained prior to the war, his claim for a pension cannot, be entertained. I could recite case after case in a similar strain, and I have no doubt that honorable members on both sides can do the same. I know of a consumptive boy who contracted the disease on active service, and for the last six months has been looking in vain for a convalescent home in New South Wales. I had a letter from him only this week stating that he was obliged to return to his own home because he could not get into a Government institution.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Though I do not wish to repeat the instances given by honorable members who have already spoken, of soldiers injured on war service not being sympathetically treated, I desire to point out that this lack of sympathy and consideration for returned soldiers is not confined to the Pensions Department.

On the other hand we have evidence that the small saving made by interfering with the comfort of these people, who deserve our best sympathy and proper treatment, is wasted in other directions. When I had the opportunity of speaking a week ago in regard to the assets that would remain to the Commonwealth in connexion with the expenditure incurred in building war service homes and settling soldiers on the land, I was asked to give definite instances of actual waste, the cause of which is exactly the cause of the trouble in regard to pensions, and that is lack of proper organization. Undoubtedly if the administration of war pensions had been left in the hands of the Department which had been accustomed for many years to deal with pensions, the results would have been much more satisfactory. In the same way if the building of war service homes had been left to people who had been building homes for workers in the various States we would not have had the evidence of waste that confronts us to-day. I 4want to point out the lack of sympathy displayed towards soldiers who desire to obtain homes for themselves, and to urge that the Minister (Mr. Rodgers) should seize the earliest opportunity of effecting a complete change in the whole method of the administration of the War Service Homes Department. Indeed, the opportunity presents itself now by reason of the fact that there is no War Service Homes Commissioner. The Minister told us, in speaking on this subject last week, that about £10,000,000 had been spent on the building of these homes, but when we examine the way in which the money has been spent, and the return from the expenditure, we are met with evidence such as appears in a paragraph in this mornings press, informing us that of fifteen houses built at Maryborough, Queensland, by the War Service Homes Commissioner eight are not utilized by soldiers, but are let to others.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But I have risen particularly to refer to one or two instances of inefficient administration. Members could speak for hours on the general disorganization of the Department without making any progress; but as we are constantly being invited, when discussing grievances of this nature, to bring specific cases under the notice of the Minister, I shall direct his attention briefly to two. A soldier, who had had considerable service overseas, returned suffering from heart trouble, shell-shock, and fits. In the Caulfield Hospital he was subject to frequent fits, but was discharged from the institution without a pension. When he made a claim for pension rights, the generous Pensions Department opened their hearts to the extent of giving him a miserable 10s. per week for himself, a wife, and two children, although he was totally unfitted to follow his pre-war occupation. Another case is mentioned by a lady who wrote to me on the 14th May from a place in the Corio electorate. I do not mention her name, because it is not fair to persons who write in this way that their distress should be advertised. I have here the case of a soldiers widow, who was for a time receiving £5 9s. per fortnight in pension and allowances, but, under the new regulation, which has been administered very drastically of late, she gets only 27s. 6d. per week, or £2 15s. a fortnight. In a letter that I received from her this afternoon, she thanks me for the interest I have taken in her affairs, and tells me that her husband died of pneumonic influenza after being sent back from overseas as medically unfit, and she goes on to say that unless the Department comes to her assistance, the home, or, as she terms it, the hut, built for her try her deceased soldier husband must be sacrificed. She cannot keep the wolf from the door, feeding and clothing herself and her children on the miserable pittance she gets from the Department. I may be chided by the Minister for having mentioned this case before taking it to him, but complaints of this kind are general among honorable members. There should be no need to go to the Minister with these grievances. What is needed is sympathetic administration, and the sooner the work is intrusted to persons having a little of the milk of human kindness in their composition, the better it will be for those whose cause we champion.Time allowed for the discussion of the motion extended to 5.15 p.m.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Minister is sympathetic, but, unfortunately, he puts too much reliance on certain officials, and, apparently, takes their word for everything. I acknowledge that in several cases I have got satisfaction from him, but in others there has been considerable delay, and, in one instance, nothing has yet been done. In this last case, an unfortunate soldier was drawing the full pension for a little while, and was suddenly deprived of it. Within a fortnight he claimed an invalid pension. Honorable members know how difficult it is to obtain that pension, unless the applicant is absolutely incapacitated.Mr.Hector Lamond. - It should be much easier to get a war pension.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
118,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MCGRATH, David","KRD","N/A","N/A","N/A",8671,"- Yes. This man has a wife and five children. He appealed to the Department, but it was three months before his first letter was answered, and for that time he and his family were starving. I then wrote to the Minister, and got from him an immediate reply; but there was a further delay of three weeks. Finally the man was told that he was suffering from a pre-war injury, and was not entitled to a war pension. Now, those who volunteered for active service had to undergo a stiff medical examination, not once, but a number of times, and there was a final examination just previous to sailing. This man must have been in pretty good health to be accepted by the authorities. I do not know whether he went beyond England, but he was certified to by the doctors in Victoria as medically fit when he left Australia. Had he been suffering from any complaint previous to enlistment, the doctors who examined him should have discovered that fact. This man was willing to do his bit, and, of course, if he had suffered from rheumatism prior to enlistment, the trouble would have become worse in camp here, and would have been further increased by the life on board ship. But the man was accepted as fit, and no doctor can now say definitely that he had rheumatism before he enlisted. A doctor can merely guess at what may have been the original state of things. There seems a desire on the part of some doctors to cut down the war pensions as much as they can. I asked by interjection a little while ago if the Minister had instructed the doctors to do this, and he said that no such instruction had been given.Mr.Rodgers. - I now repeat that statement.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Weeks have gone by, and they are still waiting for a further examination; but they will have to wait months unless definite action is taken with the Commissioner or the Deputy Commissioner of Repatriation. Not long ago the allowance of a Mrs. Young was reduced. She has a sickly daughter, who . sometimes earns as much as 30s. a week, and she lost a boy in the war.

She gets a pension of 30s. a week, and 2s. 6d. for a girl of thirteen. A son of eighteen also lives with her, and the Department told her that it was the duty of this son to help to support his mother. He is a good son, but a boy of eighteen does not earn very much. It is all very well for an official who is being paid £1,500 a year to make these suggestions; but it should not be forgotten that we promised the soldiers who went away that their widows and mothers would be given a fair and square deal.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Probably in this case the Department would say that, because the boy who was killed was not earning more than £1 a week at the time of his enlistment, he was worth only 15s. a week to his widowed mother, it being forgotten that had he not answered the call he would to-day be earning £4 or £5 a week, and be worth so much more to her. I hope the Minister will give consideration to these cases.Now in regard to vocational training. A number of men who were being trained at the Ballarat School of Mines have been ordered to Melbourne. They are nearly all of them partly incapacitated, and most of them are married men. They are learning the trade of carpenters, and I believe that 90 per cent. of those trained for that work have proved efficient. Now, in order to centralize everything in Melbourne, these men are being ordered to Melbourne, almost at a moments notice. They are to receive a miserable 25s. a week to maintain them while completing their training here. The Minister is surely opposed to this centralization policy.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/continue[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It was shown at the meeting last night that 95 per cent. of the men turned out from the local schools have proved efficient, and that they have made £5,000 worth of material which has been sold for the benefit of the Repatriation Department. If the men cannot get at country centres training as good as is given in Melbourne, the Department should be prepared to make the small financial sacrifice involved in sending an instructor from Melbourne. I do not agree that the soldiers cannot get proper training at Ballarat.  If, however, the Commissioner or the Industrial Training Committee puts that argument before the Minister, I hope he will order that an instructor be sent from Melbourne. I ask the Assistant Minister to have the fullest inquiry made into individual cases, and also to call the chiefs of the Department together and give them a lecture, telling them particularly to deal with appeals a little more readily than they are doing at present. When a man- lodges an appeal against the amount of money paid to him the matter should be finalized within a fortnight. I feel sure that instruction from the Assistant Minister to the head of the Department and the doctors to be a little more sympathetic in their dealings with incapacitated soldiers will have a beneficial effect.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without making it clear to the Minister that I am quite in accord with the protest which has been voiced by the honorable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton) and others who have spoken on this motion. It is astonishing to me that action similar to that which has been taken to-day has been necessary at least three times this session. I am surprised that the Assistant Minister has not been able to do something to, at any rate, modify the grievances that are constantly brought before him. The fact that protests have been made from every part of the House is proof that there are good grounds for complaint. Of course, the Assistant Minister realizes that honorable members are not animated by any desire to attack his administration; they have said that they have found him hardworking and full of sympathy for the soldiers. But the House cannot be satisfied with that: We must have a change quickly, for I am afraid no Government could survive for long attacks such as are being made on the administration of the present Government in respect of soldiers I rose to emphasize two matters in particular. I hold that the question of whether or not a man suffered incapacitation from warlike operations should not be considered when dealing with his claim for a pension. With other honorable members, I say that if, .after a man was passed as medically fit for active service, he became incapacitated either in warlike operations or after his return from abroad> there should be no inquiry as to whether or not the trouble was existent prior to enlistment.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If the Assistant Minister agrees with the House generally that once a man has been accepted for war service the Government must shoulder their responsibility in regard to his incapacitation, I need say no more. These cases should be rectified at once, because they are the subject of general complaint, and I agree with the honorable member for Ballarat (Mr. McGrath) that no medical man can say definitely, in a large number of cases, whether or not the cause of incapacitation was pre-existent.Another trouble arises in the determination of persons who may be considered dependent upon a deceased soldier. Other honorable members have mentioned that the claims of mothers of deceased soldiers for pensions have been refused because the soldiers had not been contributing towards the support of their mothers before they went to the war. The cases of these mothers are amongst the hardest of those dealt with by the Department.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

140,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BELL, George","JOS","N/A","N/A","N/A",8673,"- One honorable member has already effectively argued that a young fellow who was, say, eighteen years of age when he enlisted would probably be earning very little, and his parents might not, at the time, need his help. Even though he was not contributing to the maintenance of his parents then, it is reasonable to suppose that he would be doing so if he were alive now and five or six years older than when he enlisted. The provisions of the Act governing these claims should he administered more generously, and regardless of whether or not the deceased soldier was contributing towards the keep of his mother before he enlisted she should be entitled to a pension if she is in need of it.In regard to the general question of pensions administration, I admit that I supported, the Bill to place under the control of one Department all activities relating to soldiers. I thought that by this change soldiers affairs would be administered more effectively and more economically. However, the responsibility for the change is immaterial; the fact remains that the administration of pensions by the Repatriation Department is not what it should be, and there is no reason why the evils complained of should not be corrected. In the first speech I made in this House I complained that certain soldiers were not receiving the pensions to which they were entitled, whilst other persons who were not entitled to pensions were receiving them. At that time war pensions were administered by the same Department as controlled old-age and invalid pensions, and even in those days we had ground for complaint. Shortly after the publication of that speech I received a letter from the Commissioner of Pensions asking me to cite cases in support of my allegations. I immediately cited the cases of several soldiers and dependants who had been refused pensions to which I considered they were entitled, and I am glad to say that in most cases adjustments were quickly made, and the persons concerned received their dues. The Commissioner then invited me to mention persons who were in receipt of pensions to which they were not entitled. I replied that I was not prepared to do that. I did not consider it my duty to tell the Department of parents who were drawing pensions although they were not in need of such assistance. I remember that one case that I brought before the Commissioner was that of the mother of a deceased soldier; he was eighteen and a half years of age when he went to the Front, and the mother was sixty-five years of age and the father seventy-one years of ac;e. The mother was told by the Department that she was not entitled to a pension because she was not dependent upon her son before he enlisted. As a matter of fact, the parents were assisting the lad to pay for his education, and it was unfair of the Department to raise the question of dependence. That was realized ultimately, and the mother received her pension. I hope that this is the last occasion upon which the House will require to take action to expose the administration of soldiers pensions. I do not often make threats, because I realize that a threat must be carried out if the maker of it is to be respected. But I repeat that no Government can long withstand criticism such as has been hurled against the present Ministry on several occasions in regard to the administration of the Repatriation Department.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[10]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Having regard to the seriousness of this complaint, and in order that I may have more chance of having it dealt with effectively, I shall forgo the remarks I intended to make on other subjects and concentrate wholly upon it. Briefly, the facts are. these: The woman concerned was living with her family of three or four children, the youngest of whom was a little girl aged about one year and ten months. This woman deserted her husband and family in the most callous fashion for another man, and when the war broke out two of her sons enlisted. One of them was killed at the Front, and after his death a question arose in regard to the allotment of his war gratuity. The woman applied for the payment of- the gratuity to herself. The Repatriation League at Wagga took a very active part in endeavouring to secure its payment to the little girl, who was living upon the charity of a woman in the neighbourhood. The childs father had died in the meantime, so that she was practically an orphan, without any means of support. This matter was put before the Board, whose lack of sympathy I am wholly at a loss to understand, because when it was called upon to decide between the woman who had cruelly deserted this little girl and the child herself, it decided in favour of the former. In opposition to all common, sense and to all the dictates of humanity, it gave thewar gratuity to the mother.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As a consequence, little or no trouble has been experienced in connexion with those allowances. In Western Australia there has scarcely been a complaint in regard to them. When this motion was launched by the honorable member for Hunter, he referred in a very gentlemanly way to the many persons who during the progress of the war had waved flags, and who generally indulged in a perfect frenzy of patriotism. He. spoke also of the promises which were made to the men who enlisted. In Western Australia I took a prominent part in a recruiting campaign, and I frankly admit that from almost every platform I told the people that the best which we could give them was not too good for. those who volunteered. I still hold that opinion. But there is no party in this House which has a monopoly of that view. There are just as loyal men on one side as on the other. I can only speak for my own State, but I am bound to say that the people of Western Australia, not only talked patriotically, but worked patriotically, with the result that they contributed £1,750,000- more than £3 10s. per head of the total population - to assist our returned soldiers. Until the Repatriation Commission took over the administration of pensions every case which came up for review, after an application had been refused, was passed on to me for investigation. I am not prepared to say that those who are administering pensions today are hard-hearted. Neither can I say that the medical officers with whom I have come into contact are at all callous.As for these complaints regarding pensions, they are, after all, comparatively few:","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is not fair that one member of Parliament, who may have a strong political pull, should be able to show that he can get things done, while others equally active in the interests of their constituents, and equally sympathetic towards returned men, cannot secure similar results. The honorable member for Ballarat (Mr. McGrath) remarked) with respect to review and investigation of cases of complaint, that they ought all to be settled within a fortnight. I assure him that that could not be done, since inquiries, one way or another, often take much longer.Irecall an instance to show that particulars of cases, as they are made public in pursuance of a policy of criticising the pensions administration, will not always stand investigation. The circumstances of a certain family weTe taken up prominently by the press in my State, under such headings as,  Scandalous treatment of a soldier. It was my task to make inquiries, and I found that the family was getting £6 2s. 6d. from governmental sources. Yet, before leaving for the war, the head of that family had never earned so much per week. Every case has to be dealt with on its own peculiar merits. In my opinion, there should be a committee of review established in each State, or in each district among a number into which every State should be cut up. The task of such committees should be to investigate every case of complaint. Thus there would be brought about what honorable members desire. The committees  should have the right of reference, not only to the Commission, at headquarters, but to the Minister also. That would insure that every person got a fair deal.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[12]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member for Hunter (Mr. Charlton) stated that the responsibility for the administration of the Repatriation Act, and of pension matters generally, was cast upon the Government, and upon the Minister directly concerned. On behalf of the Government, I accept full responsibility for the policy laid down in the Act, and for the establishment by the Government of an administrative Commission. I may interpose here that pensions matters have now reverted to the Minister for Repatriation (Senator E. D. Millen), while it will be my task to continue to administer the War Service Homes branch. . The appointment of the Repatriation Commission was in response to a general demand on the part of the press, the public, and the soldiers organizations, that the whole subject of pensions administration - both in regard to the actual assessment of pensions and to administration generally - should be removed from political control and vested in a Commission. The Government accepted that widely-expressed desire as a matter of policy, and thereto this Parliament assented. Sub-section 1 of section7 of the Repatriation Act states -For the purposes of this Act there shall be a Repatriation Commission, which shall, subject to the control of the Minister, he charged with the general administration of this Act.Machinery is provided. First, there is a Central Commission for the assessment of pensions and for general administration. Then there are the State Boards. There is a medical organization, which consists of the principal departmental medical officer assisting the Central Administration, a departmental medical officer assisting each State Board, and an advisory Medical Board assisting the Commission generally.This Board consists of some of the most eminent men in the medical profession, and, when required, the services of the most highly-qualified specialists are called upon to deal with particular cases.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A pension is assessed after the examination of the complete medical records of a soldier abroad, and at home upon his discharge, and afterwards by personal examination by the departmental medical officer. The soldier has the right of appeal to the State Board, and a further right of appeal direct to the Commission, and the latter body has scope of reference to the highest medical authority in the land. I mention these details to show that the Government have provided machinery for the reasonable assessment of pensions, and have fortified themselves and the Commission by power of reference to the best medical advice available. I wish to say here that, during the whole of the war period and since, the Government have been under a deep debt of gratitude to the Australian medical profession.The gravamen of to-days complaints is more against the law, as it stands, than against its administration. I remind honorable members of the duties cast upon the Commission.These are very heavy, and they cover a wide range. I have had close association with the three Commissioners for some months, and I can testify that they have earnestly endeavoured to fulfil their obligations to the country and to the soldiers individually, according to the terms in which their tasks are expressed in the Act itself. I call the particular attention of honorable members to the matters which the Commission and the State Boards are called upon to determine. They are set forth in section 25 as follow: -Determining whether the death or incapacity of a member of the Forces in fact resulted from an occurrence happening during the period he was a member of the Forces, and in the case of incapacity the nature and extent thereof;b ) determining whether the death or incapacity of a person enlisted or appointed for service in connexion with naval or military preparations or operations in fact resulted from his employment in connexion with those preparations or operations;determining the extent to which persons alleged to be dependent upon a member of the Forces, were in fact so dependent; andassessing the rates of pensions of members of the Forces and their dependants, and determining the dates of the commencement ofBuch pensions.I listened very attentively to the remarks of honorable members, and endeavoured to got a general idea of the opinions held concerning the administration of the Department which, in their judgment, is defective. In the majority of cases it seems that the whole burden of their effort was to place upon the Commission, the responsibility for refusing to grant pensions to those with pre-existing complaints.","War Pensions","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[14]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If there was a pre-existent condition which has been aggravated by war service allowance is made for that aggravation; but a returned soldier is not granted a pension as a right because a pre-existent condition was not observed at the time of his enlistment. That is the chief cause of complaint against the administration.

Prom information placed at my disposal, and from the attitude of the Minister, I am led to the conclusion that there is almost an absolute disregard of how the Tariff proposals affect the importation of various articles by the public. They are so mixed up in different items as to make the administration of the Tariff very difficult for the Customs Department and for the public, and necessarily, on that account, more expensive for the people generally. It seems to me that throughout this Tariff the Minister has accentuated this difficulty. I know that his desire is to make the Tariff more complete, but it is possible to go too much into detail, and I must say that all the other Tariffs I have read appear to me to have been framed with far greater simplicity than this. I point out, for instance, that if a person imported a knife,, fork, and steel in a single case, it would be found that each of the articles is placed for duty under three different items. That is carrying detail to an absurdity. Most of the articles covered by the items now under consideration are imported for purposes of manufacture, and the Minister desires that they shall be admitted free of duty, but he has transferred some of the items to other items in the Tariff under which they will be dutiable. In the case of small articles of this kind I think that is not justified. I move -That sub-item a be amended by adding: -  And on and after 27th May, 1921, buttons for attire not being partly or wholly of gold or silver; cotton featherstich braids; plain braids of one colour; piping; bindings; ferretings; fillettings; statute galoon; edgings for attire; webbings, n.e.i.; tinsel thread; boned beltings; boot laces other than leather; stay laces.These articles are required for manufacturing purposes.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Although, this Parliament may place a duty on certain goods, the Minister, by notice in his weekly Tariff circular, can transfer them to the free list. Later on he can, if he thinks fit, transpose them once more to the dutiable list. The question of whether or not an article should come in free should rest, not with the Minister, but with the Parliament itself. The alteration qf the wording of the item in connexion with buttons, i am advised, is merely a simplification. I am told that, at the request of the Chamber of Manufactures and the metal interests, we are to have a proposal for a duty on buttons. I shall deal with that proposal when it comes before us.

At present they are included under item 106b, but are delivered free by the Minister as  minor articles.If the Committee decides to put a duty upon them, that duty should remain until the Parliament otherwise determines.

The local makers have great difficulty in getting a footing. They cannot expect the importing houses to help them, and unless they can deal directly with the retailers they are in a very peculiar position. Unfortunately they do not get that assistance which they need from the retail houses. At present large quantities of Swiss artificial flowers are imported, but as Switzerland has never been noted as a country which manufactures these articles, we are of the opinion that they are German flowers. I hope the Minister will consent to increase the general Tariff by another 5 per cent. I have seen womens hats in milliners windows for sale at about £1 10s. each. The straw in one of these hats would be worth about 6s. wholesale, and the artificial flowers on it about 4s. 6d. wholesale, but the price of the article is increased considerably because of the number of hands it has passed through. The wholesale people may possibly pay 1s. per dozen for sprays, but by the time they are fixed in a ladys hat the price is possibly increased by 300 per cent. The importance of this trade is not generally understood. There is an establishment in my electorate making artificial flowers, and employing about sixty hands but in New South Wales the business is on a much larger scale.

My lady buys a very expensive article, and other -women buy according to their means, but all use imported corsets.

British and 15 per cent, general was nothing more than a revenue duty.. There was no considerable manufacture of corsets in the Commonwealth. It is quite true that a certain number of expensive corsets were made locally, but the corset most generally worn by ladies was not made in Australia. The Inter-State Commission in its report on corsets said -The Commission is of opinion that this industry presents greater claims for consideration than some of the industries already enjoying substantial Tariff assistance, and that it is anomalous that it should receive different treatment from that extended to ordinary apparel. Compared with many articles of apparel, it involves a greater amount of labour, and, further, it is of advantage in the boxing, labelling, and printing, which are necessary for marketing the article. There is no reason why the claims of the corset manufacturers should not have equal treatment to that already extended to other manufacturers of apparelThe Commission therefore recommends that item 106 (b) in the 1908-1911 Tariff, namely, Corsets, ad val., 15 per cent, general and 10 per cent, preferential, be omitted from the Tariff, and that corsets be included in item 106 (a), apparel and attire n.e.i., 40 per cent, general and 35 per cent, preferential.That recommendation has been followed. Anticipating- that this item would be subject to some criticism, I made it my business to acquaint myself with the facts concerning the present extent of manufacture in the Commonwealth, and the prospects for the future. During the last twelve months, over 18,000 dozens of ordinary corsets have been manufactured in Australia. I have seen a large number of girls and women engaged in making corsets, and there is no question that the industry is being carried on on commercial lines.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[23]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Corset manufacture is carried on very extensively. I know that one large factory is now being established in Sydney in a six-story building, which is to be devoted entirely to the manufacture of corsets, whilst another large firm is making preparations to start manufacture in the Commonwealth. It is indisputable that, although this duty has been in operation for only a short period, the industry is in a fair way to become well established. I have followed the recommendation of the Inter-State Commission, which cannot be accused of having suggested any duties that were not really warranted. I assure the Committee that the corset-making industry is being established on sound commercial lines, and that within a short space of time the local manufacturer will be able to cater for practically the whole of the Australian trade.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[23]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I, too, have seen it. The company engaged in this industry are erecting a large building, which they intend to extend as opportunity offers. The Minister has also stated that other large corset manufacturers propose commencing operations in Australia.  They intend to follow the example of the manufacturers of other commodities overseas, who have intimated their intention to establish businesses within the Commonwealth. I was one of those who thought that this could not be done. I am glad to know that my opinion was not well founded. We have been told that the proposed duty will be a sex tax. But the duty under the old Tariff was merely a revenue duty, whereas this is a protective duty, which will encourage the manufacture of corsets in our midst. I do not pretend to be a better judge of a corset than is any other honorable member, but I claim to be quite as good a judge. The article which is being locally manufactured is an extraordinarily good one, as anybody conversant with the drapery trade will admit. As a matter of fact, the more expensive style of corsets has been manufactured in Australia for many years. Ladies who could afford to pay £3 3s., £4 4s., or £5 5s. for a superior article have always been able to obtain it. But the present is the first attempt which has been made to manufacture corsets for general female use. The question which we have to determine is whether we desire that Australia shall become a manufacturing country. I am a Protectionist, and I want to see these goods manufactured here upon an increasingly large scale.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[25]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I wish-, also, to stress the fact that the women of Australia will be obliged to pay in the future considerably more for their corsets than they have done hitherto, on account of the duty which it is now proposed to levy upon them. The estimated value of the corsets imported into the Commonwealth during the year ended June, 1919, was £875,000, and the estimated value of the corsets manufactured within the Commonwealth represented only about 3 per cent. of our requirements, or a total value of £26,000. As a local industry, the manufacture of corsets has never been a success.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[26]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

329,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GREGORY, Henry","KFE","N/A","N/A","N/A",8693,"- Oh, yes, it has. But the corsets manufactured in Australia have been made chiefly for abnormal figures, and also in connexion with surgical cases. These must necessarily be made from measurements, and that class of corset has been manufactured locally. But no record has ever been kept of the value represented by these manufactures. The present price of corsets is something like 100 per cent. more than it was before the war. During the year 1919-20, nine months of which was covered by the Tariff of 1914, and the remaining three months by the present Tariff, the duty collected upon corsets amounted to £65,200. That period comprised nine months under the 1914 Tariff and only three under the Tariff of 1920. Had the duty been in force for the full year, the amount collected upon corsets from the United Kingdom would have been £99;166, and from the United States of America and Canada £41,981 - a total of £141,147. Canada and the United States of America, by the way, are about the only sources outside the United Kingdom from which corsets are imported. The total value of French corsets for the same period under review was only £394, and of Belgian corsets £217. Added to the total of £141,000 which I have just mentioned, there is always the 10 per cent. put on by the Customs Department, which involves another £7,000. Then there is to he superimposed the importers profits. He adds a further 15 per cent., and in addition there is the retailers profit on the amount paid in duty. Honorable members should realize what all these increases mean to the women of Australia when paying for their corsets.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[26]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

331,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GREGORY, Henry","KFE","N/A","N/A","N/A",8694,"- Either the Ministers eyes have been shut or he is talking nonsense. It will be the same old story as during the war. The local manufacturer, behind this protection, will put up his prices as near as he can to the cost of the imported article. The total amount involved in the importation of corsets for 1920, including the 15 per cent. added to the duty by the importer, is about £170,000. That is the extra gum which Australian women had to pay. It is of no use to say that the industry when started in Australia can immediately supply the demand. It has to be built up gradually. There is the important factor of the hygienic characteristics of the modern corset, and it involves grave consideration to any one undertaking local manufacture. The main reason, I suppose, why so large a proportion of the imported corsets comes from the United States of America is because greater attention is given there to the matter of hygiene. The Industrial Australian of 5 th May remarks, regarding corsets, that the ever-changing fashions demand the assistance of the artist and the expert to produce a beauty of form and deportment to coincide with the mode of the moment. This is well put, but the writer should have taken into consideration the vital point of hygiene. Almost every woman in civilized communities wears corsets, and has done so for generations, so that there has evidently been some natural and physical reason for their universal adoption. This being so, it is imperative that the health and comfort of women should be safeguarded by expert and scientific manu facture. It stands to reason that such skilled manufacture can only be obtained at its best by long apprenticeship and acquired dexterity, and that, in evolving new fashionable shapes, the assistance of medical surgery must be invoked for the featuring  of successful and healthful models. In the journal which I have just quoted, it is also stated that one-third of the local output at present - that is, after some years of work in the local factories - is discarded and sold at reduced prices as such. This shows that the Australian corset manufacturers, to gain their experience, have to supply a large number of corsets to the feminine public which cannot, from the very fact of present manufacturing inexperience, conform to hygienic standards, thereby constituting a menace to the healthy motherhood of the community. Women buy the corsets that suit them best, and their own instinct advises them that the corsets which are most comfortable to wear are most suitable to their health in every respect. I repeat that experience is necessary for the manufacture of the type of corset which women ask for to-day.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[26]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He has made some remarkable statements which indicate, as a matter of fact, that there is the possibility of a valuable industry being established in Australia. He failed to hit the point at which he aimed when he drew a comparison between the prices of a few years ago and of to-day. This was chiefly due to the fact that the type in fashion nowadays is utterly different. There has been a marked change in the character of this particular manufactured article - a difference which has had to do with hygiene. Apart from that altogether, however, women of to-day are asking generally for a very much superior article. And the very fact that it is a superior class of corset which women want nowadays makes the item as reasonable a one for protection as any other fancy article. I will cite, as an illustration, made-up imported costumes. A few years ago these were imported in huge quantities. However, the local manufacturer was given sufficient protection to establish the industry in Australia on an extensive scale. There is no reason why the same results should not accrue from a reasonable protection in connexion with the manufacture of corsets as have resulted by imposing a duty on costumes and other articles of attire. Encouragement should also be given to the establishment of the industry in Australia, because boxed corsets, being light and bulky, add considerably to the cost. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) said that a six-storied factory had been erected in New South Wales. No one is likely to establish a six-storied factory in Sydney, where the land values are very high, unless there is a reasonable prospect of success. It must be admitted that a good deal of skill is required in the manufacture of modern corsets, and men who put their capital into costly buildings in Sydney and elsewhere will not be operating long before they will be able to produce an article quite as good as the imported. I admit that the Minister is asking for an extravagant rate, and if it is similar to that charged on costumes I shall support it. I cannot understand why this important industry was not established in Australia before, and I feel quite sure that the Committee will be prepared to give it the protection to which it is entitled.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[27]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Those engaged in the industry are keen business men, and know that if they do not produce a good article they will be unable to sell it. I may remind the honorable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) that ladies who can afford to purchase the best type of corset do not purchase the imported article, but have them made to order by local manufacturers, whose operatives work under favorable conditions. Probably manufacturers have to import some of the raw material, but that cannot be used as an argument against the establishment of the industry, because when we commenced building we had to import lead, and slates, and other necessaries. When we first undertook the construction of locomotives it was said that they would cost considerably more than if they were imported, and every argument which has been used against the corset industry has been brought forward at different times in connexion with others. It is quite true that the business people of York-street, in Sydney, and Flinders-lane, in Melbourne, are endeavouring to get honorable members to keep the duties as low as possible. What for ? Not to enable them to employ more, but to keep themselves in a nice, comfortable position. The Minister is taking a step in the right direction, and we should endeavour to encourage this and similar industries by imposing a Tariff which is sufficiently protective. Every honorable member was asked on the hustings whether he was a Free Trader or a Protectionist. I said I was a Protectionist, because I wanted to see Australia self-contained, and I am now acting up to that promise.

The honorable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) has showed great concern for the wool felt hat-making industry, and has expressed the opinion that the Government are rightly protecting that branch of the trade. Has he nothing to say in regard to the duty on fur hats? We have in this Parliament honorable members who are never tired of attending big loyalty meetings in the Town Hall or Empire Day celebrations, and saying, most fervently, God bless the Empire. With a sob in their voices, they talk of the wonderful Empire of which we form a part, and refer with particular pride to that dear old Free Trade country, England. But when it comes to showing some practical preference towards the  dear old Mother Country, it is represented by a duty of 24s. per dozen on hats. I do not care how much the duties are raised against the foreigner. The hat mills here, particularly the Denton Mills, are paying exorbitant dividends, and yet we find high duties imposed in their favour from Tariff to Tariff. This duty against British hats amounts to prohibition. The honorable member for Grampians (Mr. Jowett) was only stating the truth when he told! us that when he went into a shop he was shown imported hats for which exorbitant prices were asked. I have been offered an imported hat, for which the price quoted was £4 10s. I should want a suit of clothes for that price.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[41]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As a matter of fact, cotton socks, as one item of expenditure for the working man, would be considered by an ArbitrationCourt or Wages Board in arriving at a cost-of-living estimate, and to that extent it would influence the finding. Therefore, does it matter very much to the working class whether we have a Tariff of 100 per cent, or no Tariff at all?

A .profit of 6d. ought to cover all wholesale and retail profits on an article which is turned out by the factory for ls. I can also produce a pair of stockings made in Victoria. The quality is excellent,, but I cannot quote the price. These samples I have .ought to. convince honorable members that cotton stockings can be made in Australia; I was surprised at the quality of the articles produced in the. New South Wales factory. I want to point out to the ladies that the wholesale and retail houses are robbing, thom by the prices they are charging for so-called silk stockings. . Artificial silk -stockings, made in Sydney,, are sold to the wholesale houses for fs. 6d. per pair; but I saw the same stockings marked at the retail prices of 82s., 6d. and 2ns. a .pair in Sydney. While we. insist on  the manufacture of these articles in Australia, we ought also to be given power to deal with those who make undue profits out of the consumers.Progress reported.","In Committee of Ways and Means","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[46]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
