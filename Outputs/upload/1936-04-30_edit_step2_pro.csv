27,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"LYONS, Joseph Aloysius","F4O","N/A","UAP","N/A",1043,". - by leave - After a thorough review of all sources of production, and of technical reports bearing upon flow oil, shale oil and oil from coal, the Commonwealth Government has decided to make available a sum of £250,000 for advances by way of loans to approved companies or persons on a £1 for £1 basis, for the purpose of drilling operations in connexion with a search for flow oil in Australia. This fund will be administered by a sub-committee of Cabinet comprising the Minister for Defence (Mr. Parkhill), the Minister for the Interior (Mr. Paterson), and the Minister in charge of development (Senator McLachlan). The sub-committee of Cabinet will, in turn, be advised by a technical committee consisting of Dr. W.G. Woolnough, Commonwealth Geological Adviser, Dr. L. Keith Ward, Director of Mines of South Australia, and Dr. Arthur Wade. Dr. Woolnough will act as executive officer.The Government is determined to investigate every means of giving to Australia some independence in oil supplies. To that end it will obtain definite information concerning the possibilities of well oil production in Australia and New Guinea. If the result is negative it will at least serve to obviate the further expenditure of large sums of money in the search for oil. If, on the other hand, oil is found, it will add immensely to the prosperity of Australia, and will meet an essential defence requirement. Information in the possession of the Government indicates that the prospects of finding well oil in commercial quantities in Australia and New Guinea are now rated more favorably than has hitherto been the case.It is necessary again to emphasize that the moneys, which it is proposed to provide, will be for the purpose of drilling for oil, and are not for preliminary geological surveys. While it is recognized thai geological surveys are pre-requisites to drilling, it is felt that a good deal of this work has already been done, and that the immediate need is to drill favorable areas. It is recognized, also, that the major expenditure associated with the search for oil is in connexion with drilling.In connexion with the shale oil industry, very full technical information ia available regarding the economics of production. It has become evident that, in order to establish the industry, it would be necessary to exempt it from the payment of excise duty over a period of years. This would involve substantial inroads into revenue. The Government has, however, examined the position from every angle and, in the light of more recent world developments, it feels that it is compelled to ignore the economical aspects of production, and place the defence requirements superior to all others.Newnes is capable of producing at least 7,250,000 gallons of petrol per annum, and production can, in case of national emergency, be changed over immediately to fuel oil or to fuel oil and petrol. It can, with some expansions which can be arranged at short notice, produce at least the nucleus of the Commonwealths basic requirements of oil and petrol for the defence services. In view of this, it has been decided that petrol production from shale in Australia, up to a maximum of 10,000,000 gallons per annum, shall bc granted protection over imported petrol to the extent of customs and excise duties at present operating for a period of twenty years. The effect of this would be that, if the present customs duty of 7d. a gallon on imported petrol, or the excise duty of 5 1/2 d. a gallon on petrol produced from imported crude, are reduced during the next twenty years, a subsidy equivalent to the amount of such reduction will be paid on petrol produced from Australian shale up to the maximum of 10,000,000 gallons per annum.Offers will be publicly invited from companies or persons desirous of operating the Newnes shale oil undertaking on this basis. The Commonwealth Government at present holds the option over plant, machinery, &c, at Newnes, which originally cost considerably more than £1,000,000, and which can now be secured for £34,500. In connexion with this invitation, it should be clearly understood that the Governments of the Commonwealth and New South Wales regard it as essential that any company selected to operate Newnes must have personnel with high engineering and technical qualifications, in addition to substantial capital resources. The Newnes Investigation Committee has set down capital requirements at £600,000. At the present time, coal petrol in England enjoys protection of Sd. a gallon; shale petrol has never paid excise duty, and has been protected by customs duties for a period of years. In Germany, coal spirit enjoys preference over the petroleum product in the form of remission of taxation of approximately ls. 8d. a gallon.There are two known methods for the production of oil from coal. These are by low temperature carbonization, and by hydrogenation. In connexion with the low temperature carbonization process, certain investigations are now taking place. The Government will have something more to .say on this when these investigations are complete.With regard to the production of oil from coal by the hydrogenation process, approximately twelve months, or possibly longer, will elapse before Imperial Chemical Industries Limited is in possession of sufficient experience of the working of the demonstrational unit at Billingham-on-Tees to determine whether it will be practical and desirable to establish a similar unit in Australia. The construction of such a unit would occupy some time, so nothing can bo expected from this source of supply in the near future.The Government regards the question of the production of oil from coal as of such importance that it is determined to obtain the best first-hand scientific advice about it. Therefore, arrangements have been made for Sir David Rivett, Chief Executive Officer of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, who is also chairman of the Commonwealth Hydrogenation Committee, -a bodyrepresentative of the Commonwealth and the States., to leave Australia next month for the purpose of going closely into the processes now operating in England and Germany for the production of oil from coal by both hydrogenation and low temperature carbonization. Sir David Rivett is eminently fitted for this work. While in England, Sir David Rivett will discuss with Imperial Chemical Industries Limited, the whole question of the establishment of a hydrogenation unit in Australia. This organization has promised its fullest co-operation.","OIL PRODUCTION IN AUSTRALIA","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[10]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

F. W.Parkinson, P. Campbell and H. McTaggart, the commissioners appointed for the purpose of distributing the said State into divisions, in their report laid before Parliament on the 13th March. 1935. and that the names of the divisions suggested in the report be adopted with the exceptions that the name Ballarat be substituted for the name Ballaarat, and that the name  Deakin  be substituted for the name  Mernda .Honorable members will remember that, following the census taken on the 30th June, 1933, and the receipt by the then Minister for the Interior of the chief electoral officers certificate of population furnished in pursuance of the Representation Act, commissioners were appointed on the 15th December, 1933, to propose a redistribution of the electoral divisions in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia.The authority for this action is contained in section 25 of the Electoral Act, which provides that a redistribution may be undertaken -whenever an alteration is made in the number of members of the House of Representatives to be elected for the State;whenever in one fourth of the divisions of the State the number of electors differs from the quota ascertained by dividing the whole number of electors in the State by the number of members of the House of Representatives to be chosen for the State, to a greater extent than one-fifth more or one-fifth less; andat such other times as the Governor-General thinks fit.Reports were duly received from the respective commissioners appointed for the purpose, submitting proposals for the redistribution of the electoral divisions in each of the States specified, and those reports were tabled in Parliament on the 28th June, 1934.-The proposals for New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia were subsequently adopted by Parliament, and were given effect to in those States prior to the general election held on the 15th September, 1934.The commissioners original proposals for Victoria and Western Australia were, however, disapproved by the House of Representatives, and, as time did not permit of fresh proposals being obtained and dealt with before the dissolution, the 1934 election in those States necessarily had to be held on the existing boundaries. The motion agreed to by the House of Representatives on the 5th July, 1934, in relation to the original proposals submitted by the commissioners for Victoria was as follows: -That this House disapproves of the distribution of the State of Victoria as proposed by the Distribution Commission and requests the Minister to return the same to the commission with the view of a fresh distribution being made of this State, having regard to community of interests and the margin of allowance provided for in section 19 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act.Pursuant to this motion, and sub-section 2 of section 24 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which reads -Ifeither House of the Parliament passes a resolution disapproving of any proposed distribution or negatives a motion for the approval of any proposed distribution, the Minister may direct the Distribution Commissioners to propose a fresh distribution of the State into divisions, the Minister for the Interior directed the commissioners for Victoria to propose a fresh distribution, and the House is now being asked to approve of the commissioners fresh proposals for the distribution of Victoria. These involve no alteration of the number of electoral divisions in Victoria or of the number of members of the House of Representatives to which that State is entitled upon the population as disclosed by the 1933 census, which is twenty, but, as will be readily seen from the table furnished in the distribution commissioners report, a realignment of the boundaries of the division in Victoria is very necessary in order to provide a more equitable basis of representation than now exists. For instance, in the metropolitan area, the division of Henty, as at present constituted, contains more than twice as many electors as are embraced in the division of Melbourne, and, as regards the country divisions, Flinders contains over 30,000 more voters than Ballarat.Honorable members will recollect that the first proposals submitted by the distribution commissioners for Victoria provided for the elimination of the country division of Corangamite, and the substitution for it of an additional metropolitan division. The fresh proposals now submitted by the commissioners are, however, less drastic, in that the present basis of ten metropolitan and ten country divisions is preserved, and, whilst the marginal difference in enrolment between the average of the metropolitan divisions and the average of the country divisions has been increased from 2,930 - as provided in the first proposals - to 8.068, the numbers allotted to the several divisions under the fresh proposals are, in all cases, well within the margin of allowance permitted by the law. Section 19 of the Electoral Act reads -In making any proposed distribution of a State into divisions the distribution commissioners shall give due consideration to -Community or diversity of interest;means of communication;physical features;existing boundaries of divisions and subdivisions ;State electoral boundaries; and subject thereto the quota of electors shall be the basis for the distribution and the distribution commissioners may adopt a margin or allowance, to be used whenever necessary, but in no case shall the quota be departed from to a greater extent than one-fifth more or one-fifth less.Having regard to the circumstances and the provisions of the section which I have quoted, I commend the proposals now before the House as providing for a fair and reasonable distribution of the electoral divisions in the State of Victoria, and I urge their approval.It may be pointed out that the adopttion of the proposals submitted would not affect any by-election that may become necessary during the life of this Parliament, inasmuch as it is provided in section 24 of the Electoral Act that, until the next ensuing dissolution or expiration of the House of Representatives, a redistribution shall not affect the election of a new member to fill a vacancy happening in the House of Representatives ; hut, for the purpose of any such election, the electoral divisions as theretofore existing, and the rolls in respect of those divisions, shall continue to have full force and effect.Honorable members will observe that it is proposed to take the opportunity presented by this redistribution to modernize the manner of spelling the name of the division of Ballaarat, so as to bring it into conformity with that now in general usage.","N/A","ELECTORAL DIVISIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The late Mr. Deakin commenced his parliamentary career in the Victorian Assembly in 1879, later holding office in Victoria as Solicitor-General and Commissioner for Public Works, and as Chief Secretary. He took a prominent part as a representative of Victoria in the federal movement, and was a member of the dele gation sent to London in 1900 to secure the passage of the Constitution Bil! through the Imperial Parliament. The late Mr. Deakin was a member of thin House from the inception of the Commonwealth until his retirement in 1913. He held office as Attorney-General in the first Commonwealth Ministry, and subsequently on three occasions guided the destinies of this country as Prime Minister with great wisdom and ability. Several divisions in other States bear the names of notable men associated with the foundation of the Commonwealth: Parkes, Barton, Reid and Watson in New South Wales; Griffith in Queensland, and Forrest in Western Australia; and it is thought fitting that as the opportunity now presents itself the name of Deakin should now be similarly perpetuated in Victoria.Debate (on motion by Mr. Curtin) adjourned.","N/A","ELECTORAL DIVISIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[1]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

R. H. Bandy, J. P. Camm and S. B. H. Roberts, the commissioners appointed Tor the purpose of distributing the said State into divisions, in their report laid before Parliament on the 13th March, 1933, and that the names of the divisions suggested in the report be adopted.The. report referred to in the motion is the second furnished by the Distribution Commissioners for the State of Western Australia appointed on the 15th December, 1933, for the purpose of proposing a redistribution of that State. The proposals contained in the first report received from the commissioners, and tabled in Parliament on the 28th June, 1934, were disapproved by the House of Representatives on the 6th July, 1934, when the following motion was agreed to :--That this House disapproves of the distribution of the State of Western Australia into electoral divisions as proposed by the Distribution Commissioners, and requests the Minister to direct the Distribution Commissioners to propose a fresh distribution of the said State.Pursuant to that motion, and to subsection 2 of section 24 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, which provides that, if either House of the Parliament passes a resolution disapproving of any proposed distribution, the Minister may direct the Distribution Commissioners to propose a fresh distribution, the commissioners for the State of Western Australia were duly directed to propose a fresh distribution, and it is their fresh proposals for the distribution of the divisions in that State that this House is now invited to approve. The redistribution involves no alteration of the number of divisions, Western Australia being entitled on its population, as revealed by the 1933- census, to return five members to the House of Representatives as at the present time; but, as there is * marked disparity between the enrolment, for certain of the divisions as now constituted, a revision of the boundaries is necessary so that the basis of representation may be a more equitable one.In their first report, the commissioners proposed that the marginal difference in enrolment between the average of the two metropolitan divisions - Fremantle and Perth - and that of the three country divisions in Western Australia should be 1,751 only, but in the fresh proposals now submitted the average marginal difference provided for is 7,360; and, whereas in the first report the number of electors allotted to the proposed division of Kalgoorlie was 43,419, t] number of electors allotted to this division in the fresh proposals is 39,658 only, that is, 6,041 below the quota for the State. Having regard on the one hand to the vast area comprised within this division, and on the other to the limitation imposed by section 19 of the Electoral Act that the quota must not be departed from to a greater extent than one-fifth more or one-fifth less, the proposals now before the House are commended as providing a fair and reasonable distribution of the electoral divisions in the State of Western Australia, and their adoption is urged accordingly. It may be mentioned that, in making the requisite adjustment between the divisions of Kalgoorlie and Swan, the commissioners have adopted the boundaries of State electorates. The State electorate of Avon, which lies along the gold-fields railway, has been transferred bodily from the division of Swan to that of Kalgoorlie, whilst on the coastal side the proposed division boundary coincides with the boundaries of the State electorates of Irwin-Moore and Mr Marshall. Similarly, the proposed boundary between the divisions of Swan and Forrest, which runs slightly north of the existing boundary, follows the line of State electoral boundaries throughout. The result, if these proposals are adopted, will be that the divisions of Kalgoorlie and Forrest will be comprised wholly of complete State electorates.Debate (on motion by Mr. Curtin) adjourned.","N/A","ELECTORAL DIVISIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As honorable members may remember, there was provision in the bill that limited the amount of refund to the amount of tax that had actually been borne by the holder of the flour, and it was inserted principally to deal with the case of Tasmania. Tasmania, as a State., had been recouped by the Government by monthly payments which turned out to be the equivalent of £21s. a ton. The Tasmanian Government passed this amount of £21s. to the millers, with the result that flour stocks on hand at the termination of the tax bore tax only to the extent of11s. 6d. a ton. The Flour Tax Refund Bill made provision for refunds to the extent only of the difference between the tax of £2 12s. 6d. a ton and the £21s. a ton, i.e., to provide that stockholders would not get a greater refund that the amount of the difference. But during the passage of this measure through another place the department had brought to its notice the case of the manufacturers, wholesalers, and large retailers who were holders of self-raising flour. This commodity is sold in small packets of 1 lb., 2 lb., or a few pounds weight, and it was not always possible to adjust the price of self-raising flour to the basis of the exact amount of the flour tax. I understand that different brands of self-raising flour had included in their prices certain provision for flour tax, but it was always less than the actual amount of tax involved. The Senates amendment sets out to remedy that position and to make a full refund of the £2 12s. 6d. a ton on flour contained in self-raising flour to holders of more than 1,000 lb. of that type of flour.","N/A","FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/para[4]","N/A","N/A"

It may have been paid by the manufacturers in the first place, or it may happen that, in a few isolated cases, we may be making a refund to the actual holder of the flour slightly more than is justified ; but the Government has, in all cases, collected £2 12s. 6d. on the flour content of self-raising flour. The flour tax was lifted when this Parliament was not in session, and the difficulty was not anticipated. We would only be able to give the exact refund if we knew the brands of self-raising flour held on the 24th of February, and records were not taken of the exact brands of flour. The difficulty, however, is a relatively minor one, and substantial justice is being done. This additional refund, I am assured by the department, will be quite immaterial in the total amount. The Senates proposal is to have a wider proviso, dealing with the Tasmanian case, and, in addition, covering self-raising flour. The Senates other amendments are verbal and consequential.

There was no intention on the part of Parliament that on the date on which the tax was annulled by proclamation there should be held by the Crown sums which it did not intend to hold. My only difficulty is that, while the Crown is discharging money it has collected in full, it is unable to assure itself that it is paying back to those who have actually paid the tax, amounts that they have actually paid. But I am satisfied that more justice is being done by the amendment than would be the case if we did not agree to it. Probably, some people will get something that they have not paid, but on the balance, having regard to the fact that we have agreed to the lifting of the tax, there appears to be no other course open to us than to accept the amendment.Motion agreed to.Further verbal and consequential amendments agreed to.Resolution reported; report adopted.","N/A","FLOUR TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That removed an injustice from a number of companies in Australia, inasmuch as, if the Commissioner could not collect tax from the debenture holders abroad, those companies had to bear the burden of it and could not recoup themselves. The amendment which I have just moved carries that position a stage further. The previous alteration of the law still left on the Commissioner the responsibility to issue assessments to these debenture holders in England with respect to debentures held in Australian companies, even though those debentures were raised and domiciled overseas. Having no alternative but to obey the law, the Commissioner issued large numbers of these assessments, some of them for very small amounts. This caused great irritation, particularly in the City of London. The present proposal merely removes from the Commissioner the obligation to perform this barren operation.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/para[5]","N/A","N/A"

But in the memorandum which accompanies the bill, the Treasurer has been good enough to include particulars of an amendment which he proposes to make to the schedule, stating the alternatives allowed to taxpayers for the valuation of the natural increase of their stock. It is quite reasonable to provide for higher valuations in a number of cases. In certain circumstances, it is. to the advantage of the revenue that taxation should be paid at a higher conventional value than was previously the case when natural increase was taken under the old schedule of alternative values. But what I take exception to is, that the minimum rate has been increased. That, over a run of years, must have the effect of inflating slightly the liability of the taxpayer. In districts where the chances of the progeny of cattle, sheep or horses surviving are most uncertain, it is important that the rate at which the young animal is taken in for income tax purposes should not be excessive.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Queensland Income Tax Assessment Act contains a. provision which for some time has worked quite successfully and has given considerable satisfaction to small dairy farmers.

It is true that up to the present, the preparation of returns by small or large primary producers has been complicated, but that has been largely remedied. The clause may seem complicated, but I venture to believe that it will prove very much more acceptable, combined with the relative clauses in the State bills, than the previous arrangement. I remind honorable members that, although a clause designed to cover all branches of primary industry must necessarily be comprehensive and, to some extent, complicated, to any individual interested in only one branch of primary production its requirements will prove simple enough.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The existing provisions are so complicated that a man almost requires the services of an expert in order to comply with them, and those farmers living, in remote places are, of course, not able to obtain such advice, even if they could afford to pay for it.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At the present time, there is a considerable difference between the valuation set on natural increase by the Commonwealth, and by that fixed by certain of the States. The Commonwealth method is a great deal fairer that the method which applies in Western Australia, where different values are placed on natural increase in the north, in the centre, and in the south. The lowest values were fixed in the north, higher values in the centre, and the highest of all in the south. In actual practice, it has been found that the values should have been the reverse of those arranged. The State is placing a value of £4 a head on calves in certain parts of the State where, during the last two years, the actual market value for such calves has been less than £1. Fullgrown three and four year old cattle have not been realizing the price which the taxpayer is called upon to place on calves.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

104,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"LAZZARINI, Hubert","L07","Werriwa","N/A","N/A",1054,".- Representatives of the Country party in this House are once more making an attempt to obtain special concessions for their own class. The honorable member for Wakefield (Mr. Hawker) quoted an instance in which a certain value was placed upon natural increase for taxation purposes, when, in fact, sheep in that area had no value at all. If that were so, then the taxpayer in question must have been mad to be trying to raise sheep there. Such a man should not be on a farm; he should be in a lunatic asylum. I take it that the value placed upon natural increase is intended to be some indication of the value of such stock at birth. If the farmer chooses to rear that stock to maturity, he must accept the risk of their living or dying, but if they die he can claim an allowance in respect of them in making out a subsequent income return. In this respect, the man on the land is in no different position from the business man who incurs losses, and who is granted an allowance in respect of them. If he does not get the allowance in the year in which the losses are incurred, he can claim it for the next year. Usually the farmer will know, by the time he is making out his return for the year, whether the stock born that season will, in favorable circumstances, survive to maturity, but if they should happen to die after the return is made, he may claim allowance for them in his next return. I maintain that the primary producers are receiving enough concessions already at the expense of the taxpayers, and the Treasurer (Mr. Casey) should not give anything more away.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is now competent for every stockholder to include in his income tax return the natural increase of stock at market value at the time he makes up his return or at some value within the range of from 2s. 6d. te 10s. a head stipulated by the Commissioner. The proposal now before the committee is that the present range should be raised. Primary producers are not asking for a concession. While they hold that there is no justification for raising the rate, the point is not material, because, whatever amount, 4s. or 10s., the grazier may accept to cover the natural increase, this merely acts as an instalment as the real income tax is based on the price at which he subsequently sells. But a point to bo considered is that in Australia to-day, many lambs are marked in May and June and the return of income tax is made up to the 30th June, when the lambs may be two, three, or four weeks old.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If lambs are dropped in, the middle of June they will be two weeks old at the 30th June. In such cases, they are not worth 4s. each. But the difference is not vital, and it is adjusted on sale. Many taxpayers include them at their actual valuation on the 30th June when, in some cases, they may be four or five months old, or saleable suckers, worth 18s. a head. Provided a grazier maintains a. regular practice in assessing the value of his lambs, he is all right. But he cannot take them in at 10s. one year, and at market valuation the next; he must either keep to market valuation or include them at the appropriate figure within the range prescribed by the department. It is not a vital matter, and seeing that the whole of the States have agreed to this schedule, I will accept it. I merely rise to remove the idea which seems to be in the mind of the honorable member for Werriwa, that graziers are looking for some advantage out of this proposal. Every producer, whether of lambs or of cattle, is bound to include eventually in his return the amount which he receives for the sale of his stock. The impression which the honorable member for Werriwa seemed to have is entirely incorrect; no request has been made in this regard for any concession to primary producers. It is merely a question of the time and method of including the natural increase as income.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[9]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
111,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HAWKER, Charles","KOC","Wakefield","N/A","N/A",1055,". - I doubt if there could be any better evidence of the anti-primary producer attitude of honorable members opposite than that furnished by two or three Opposition members during this debate. The honorable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) is so absolutely against any lightening of the conditions of people engaged in the primary producing industry that he jumps to all sorts of conclusions, and attacks even a request for further information. He questions whether there are places where stock is of practically no value. Undoubtedly there are places in Australia where, during the last few years, grown cattle have scarcely been worth £1. In parts of the Northern Territory, for instance, grown cattle have been purchasable at 10s. a head, and even at that price have been a drug on the market. In other outlying districts, where the risk of young live-stock not reaching maturity is very considerable indeed, and where it is difficult for producers of stock to finance their properties during periods of depression, the necessity of paying taxes on their stock before they have a chance to market them is a handicap against successful settlement. The suggestion that it is fair that the minimum amount in the range for lambs should be lower is not made with a desire to evade taxation, because, when live-stock are sold any profits received by the producer are automatically included in his income tax return. It is only a question of how much should be taxed in advance before the animal is actually marketed. As the honorable member for Riverina (Mr. Nock) has pointed out, thi3 is not a matter of fundamental importance, however much of a minor injustice it may be. Since the Treasurer (Mr. Casey) and the Commissioner have explained to me that the range has been prescribed in the interests of uniformity between the States and the Commonwealth, I do not propose to press the matter to a division. I am prepared to accept, the assurance of the Treasurer and the Commissioner that cases of actual hardship will be dealt with on their merits, and that the option of the Commissioner will, in practice, be freely exercised.Clause agreed to.Clause 35 - (1.)

In the definitions clause  trading stock  includes -Anything produced, manufactured, acquired, or purchased for purposes of manufacture, sale, or exchange, and also includes livestock.The words  and also includes livestock  have been added. The reason given for this is that it is proposed to tax all sales of livestock, including sales of breeding stock where they are sold or not sold on a walk-in walk-out basis. The explanation of clause 36, which appears at the bottom of page 46 of the Explanatory Memorandum, states that this clause has been drafted in accordance with the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Taxation. It is said that, because the taxpayer obtains a deduction of the cost of purchasing or producing breeding stock,, it is only fair that when he disposes of them, whether to end his business or otherwise, the profits of the sale should be taxed. I submit that that is a misleading assumption, as all stocks on hand at the end of an accounting period, including purchased stock or natural increase, have to be brought into account and the deduction of the cost of purchasing or producing stock is offset by the value placed on the stock on hand at the end of the accounting period for which the income is being assessed. When a station business is sold, that part of the livestock representing the capital of the business is deleted from the livestock trading accountby crediting it with the cost -value of the stock, so that it will be seen that no benefit accrues to the taxpayer by reason of his having been allowed a deduction of the purchase price or cost of production. The sale of breeding stock of a station business in a walk-in walk-out sale represents the realization of capital, and any profit made on the sale of this asset is an accretion of capital. I submit that, in the case of a station property, the breeding stock could be put in the same category, as, say, in the case of a lathe-manufacturing business, the lathes used in the business to manufacture other lathes. In the case of the sale of such a lathe-manufacturing business the lathes which comprise the plant must be regarded as part of the capital. Is it suggested that they would be brought into account?","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Similarly, breeding stock used on a station for the production of other stock obviously should not be subject to taxation.Another point requires some consideration. It seems to me that this clause will, in the future, provide ample grounds for litigation. The purpose of this measure is to impose a tax on incomes, and, although it is possible for Parliament to decree that certain things may be regarded as income for the purposes of income tax, which, in truth, are not income at all - and a court preferring not to invalidate a taxation act, may agree with that view - Parliament should not include in a measure that it passes any provision which is ultra vires the Constitution. Section 55 of the Constitution provides that -Laws imposing taxation . . . shall deal with one subject of taxation only.I submit that to impose a tax on capital by means of an income tax act would be clearly ultra vires the Constitution, although I admit that in the particular circumstances with which I am dealing the decision would depend upon the interpretation of what breeding stock really are. Breeding stock, in my opinion, must be considered as plant or means of producing other stock, which is the business of the farmer or producer. There is no question, of course, as to what should happen in the case of sales of breeding stock too old to use for breeding purposes. When such stock are sold, the receipts are taken into account in the accounting period which is the subject of taxation. But I am directing attention to the sale of a station property, or part of a station property, on a walk-in walk-out basis, and I contend that, in such a case, the breeding stock is part of the capital of the concern. Income tax should not be imposed on the proceeds of such a sale.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[16]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
130,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CASEY, Richard","JWE","Corio","UAP","Treasurer",1058,". - This is, of course, an important clause, in which it is proposed to remove an exemption allowable under the existing law. At present, proceeds from the sale of livestock used for breeding purposes are not taxable. In order that honorable members may have a clear understanding of the issues, I direct attention to the relevant remarks of the royal commission, on page 105 of its report, and I must admit that I cannot get away from what seems to me the inescapable logic of the commissions contentions. In referring to the pressure brought to bear upon it to maintain the present exemption the Commission stated -Witnesses representing the various associations of graziers were insistent in their request that we should recommend that this concession should be continued, and that it should he extended to all States. The arguments advanced to justify this request, however, do not appear to us to be convincing.The claim is based upon the argument that live stock used for breeding purposes is equivalent to plant, and that when it is sold the proceeds should be regarded as a realization of capital. But the grazier does not take this view when he buys it, for the. cost is debited to his working account, and he is allowed a deduction in full for the amount so expended. If breeding stock is sold otherwise than upon the realization of a business, the proceeds are brought to account as ordinary income, and the grazier is taxed on the profit or allowed for the loss on the transaction. If the argu-mont that breeding stock is capital be sound, it should be treated consistently in all circumstances, and in that event its cost would not be allowed as a deduction, nor would any profit upon its realization be taxable.The truth is that live stock possesses some of the characteristics both of a fixed asset and a trading asset. Although an animal may be acquired primarily for breeding or wool growing purposes, its ultimate sale is in many cases by no means a minor consideration. The life of any stock is limited to a few years, and it must be eventually realized or replaced.Another aspect of the subject may be commented upon. The offspring of stock acquired for breeding may bc omitted from the accounts of the taxpayer or brought in at a low value. Tn either case the payment of tax on the real profits of the business is delayed. In the event of realization the resulting profit is increased either because of the omission of natural increase or because of the low value at which such natural increase has been brought into the accounts, and in these circumstances, the profit does not represent a capital profit which is due to an appreciation in values, but a profit which is due in part at least to the fact that the cost of the breeding stock sold lias been reduced by the operation of the regulations to a sum which is less than its true worth. It is clear, therefore, that a grazier who either omits natural increase or who brings, natural increase into his accounts at a low value, derives a benefit which is not enjoyed by a grazier who does not avail himself of either of these options.In our opinion there is no real justification for the continuation of this concession. There can be no real grievance, as in almost every case no less than the full cost price of every hoad of stock purchased or reared has been allowed as a deduction. We should point out that a grazier is not permitted to claim any loss resulting from the sale of breeding stock upon the realization or discontinuance of a business, and that as a matter of fact the concession only operates to his advantage when the values of stock are relatively high.It appears to us that the claim for the exemption of profits in these circumstances is really based upon the fact that the business is to be terminated, and not upon the nature of the stock sold. If this be admitted it is difficult to see why the profit on trading stock realized by a merchant in similar circumstances should not also be exempt from tax.This was, in fact, the position until the Commonwealth Act was amended to make such profits taxable, and there seems to be no reason why an exemption denied to the merchant should be permitted to the grazier.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[17]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The law was then amended to exempt the value of that wool from being counted as income. I think that the alterations recommended by the commission will make those who have an income pay tax, and allow those who suffer a loss to escape it.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[18]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I agree with him that in regard to sales of breeding stock during the carrying on of a business, the proposed alteration of the law will make the position more equitable, and much simpler than in the past. It will avoid the duplication and dissecting of accounts, and the keeping of different accounts separate. However, in the winding up of a business, that part of the assets represented by the breeding stock is undoubtedly part of the capital of the business. We should not tax a capital increment due to improved conditions, possibly all over the world, and certainly in Australia. This is a tax which graziers feel is an unjust addition to all the other imposts. I fail to realize how the Treasurer can say that this bill does not increase income taxation. Surely we are not to deny to the grazier the benefit of a principle universally recognized. The proposed alteration means, not an extension of taxation year by year, but an extension in great hunks from time to time. As it involves a denial of the principle that an increment in the value of capital assets on their sale belongs to the taxpayer, I support the honorable member for Grey (Mr. McBride) in his request that this established principle shall not be abrogated, and that the owners of breeding stock shall not be denied the freedom from tax enjoyed by owners of other fixed assets throughout Australia, such as cit, and town .property.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[19]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

After operating for a short time the new provision would cause no disadvantage, because every grazier would show in his returns of the previous year the value of all stock on hand. If he sold on a walkin walk-out basis, and there was a separate price for the stock, the only amount on which he would pay tax would be the margin between the value in the previous years return and the amount realized on sale. If he realized less than the amount at which the stock was valued in the previous years return, a credit would be shown in the current return. If the grazier or farmer has the right to include natural increase of lambs at 4s. a head, and to take them in as breeding stock, and if those- lambs are worth £J a hoad when he sells them, it is fair to pay tax on the increased sale value. After the provision has been in operation for a few years, I do not think that any objection will be taken to it. A trader who sells out and obtains only £900 for £1,000 worth of stock on hand gets a credit of £100 in compiling his next return. If the goods realize £1,100, there is a debit of £100.

The point has been raised by the honorable member for Darling Downs (:Sir Littleton Groom), and in other places, as to the use of the word  necessarily . The position is that the present disallowance section, both in the Commonwealth and the State acts, provides a rigid test, in that the expenditure to be allowed must be  wholly and exclusively incurred in the production of assessable income. In the bill, the general allowance clause, in respect of business deductions, has been considerably widened. The bill also combines in the one clause, both the general allowance and the general disallowance sections of the present act. The clause, as drafted, was adopted only after the most careful consideration.Although the word necessarily does not appear in the New South Wales bill, it does appear in the uniform bills drafted for the acceptance of other State parliaments. The representatives of the States concerned were only persuaded into the acceptance of the new clause in the interests of taxpayers,, by due regard to the proper limitation of the section by the insertion of the word necessarily. It must be borne in mind that there are taxpayers who will attempt to exploit such a section with all types of deductions of a personal nature on the ground that they are incurred for business purposes, and of course the law cannot allow exploitation of something which is meant to be strictly limited to business activities. Such an example would be that of entertainment expenditure.Any deduction disallowed under this clause in a taxpayers assessment is as much the subject of an appeal against the Commissioners decision as any other item in an income tax assessment.I might mention that, in England, a deduction is not allowed if the expense is not wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of the business. It has been held in that country that an expense, in order to be deductible, must be essential to the earning of the gross receipts. In the United States of America the law provides that  the business expenses deductible from gross income include the ordinary and necessary expenditure directly connected with or appertaining to the taxpayers trade or business.Honorable members will, therefore, see that the word  necessarily  has not been chosen at random. I believe that it is essential, and I repeat that I am firmly of the belief that, if the word had not been included, the other governments, with the exception of New South Wales, would not have accepted the broader provision.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[23]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The clause reads - (1.) All losses and outgoings to the extent to which they are incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income,-That is to say, however unwise or stupid may be the expenditure in gaining or producing assessable income so long as that expenditure is incurred, it is allowable. The clause goes on - or* are necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing such income, shall be allowable deductions except to the extent to which they are losses or outgoings of capital, or of a capital, private or domestic nature, or are incurred in relation to the gaining or production of exempt income.This is where the Commissioner is entitled, as it were, to act as a sort of arbitrator as to whether a business is justifiably incurring expenditure for the purposes of carrying on business in order to gain or produce income which is taxable. It appears to me that the entrepreneur may not always be able to justify to a third-party expenditure on the improvement of a business. He may fail to satisfy the Commissioner of Taxation, particularly on a matter in which the Commissioner is to exercise discretion. That is to say, when the Commissioner becomes an umpire in regard to technical requirements of industry, it imposes on him a discretion which I am not prepared to say he is any more capable of wisely exercising than is the business man himself. While it may be true that the clause could be exploited and the tax evaded, every form of taxation has about it these privileges, which admit of improper exploitation. As a matter of fact, every deduction allowed in taxes, and every concession lends itself to undue exploitation by -the taxpayer, and can be used probably for purposes beyond the intention of Parliament. In this case, it appears to me that the business man has to justify to the Commissioner certain expenditure. It is true that if the business man were dissatisfied with the Commissioners ruling, he could appeal, but I venture the opinion that if he failed to satisfy the Commissioner he would probably be induced not to appeal. Therefore, because he has made investments in an endeavour to extend or improve his income, he is to bear the net loss. I do not think that that is reasonable.Clause agreed to.Clause 52 (Loss on property acquired for profit-making).","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[24]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I was informed, however, that had he made a profit on the sale, that profit would have had to be returned, and that, had he made a loss and a profit in the previous year, the one counteracting the other, both would have been allowed, but in the case of a loss in one year, and a profit in the succeeding year, the loss would not be allowed, but the profit would have to be included.

But in some cases it is most difficult to define exactly the purpose of improvements. The homestead building is definite, and so is the garden which surrounds it. Frequently, however, there is a water supply which is used partly for the purposes of the homestead and partly for the needs of a considerable area of grazing country. That is particularly the case in Queensland, and in the flowing-bore areas of northernNew South Wales, the north-west of Western Australia, and a small corner of South Australia. In those areas there may be nearly 100 miles of water reticulation from the one bore. I should like the assurance of the Treasurer (Mr. Casey) that the fact that that improvement also serves the purpose of a domestic water supply does not render it ineligible for depreciation with respect to its other use. This applies also to other improvements which are used partly for one purpose and partly for another.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[29]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The acts provide that the annual sum to be deducted may be a percentage sum fixed by that commissioner, or may be based upon the estimated life of the article to be depreciated. The taxpayer has the option to select either of those two methods. The law goes on to provide that in the event of a sale should the selling price of the property be less than the depreciated value shown, a further sum equal to the loss shall be allowed to the taxpayer as additional depreciation in the year of sale and that, should a higher figure than the depreciated value be realized, the difference shall be brought to account as taxable income, but only to the extent to which the depreciation has been allowed.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[31]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

169,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CAMERON, Donald Charles","JUB","N/A","UAP","N/A",1065,"- I understand that the existing law does not define  depreciated value  but that in this measure, and in. the measure introduced in the Queensland Parliament in cases in which depreciation has been allowed, it is defined as being the cost of the property less the amount of all depreciation allowed or allowable; and, where depreciation has not been allowed or is not allowable, the cost of the property. These provisions certainly seem absolutely fair. It is feared, however, that in practice they may inflict hardship, particularly on those who are engaged in the grazing industry and in primary production generally. When a taxpayer sells his property, he generally has what may be called an extraordinary income, and if a profit has been made on the improvements it is inflated by the amount of the depreciation which has to be included as income. We realize that, in many instances, improvements are erected by the labour of a taxpayer and his family, and are not brought into account in depreciation values, because there has been really no cost to the taxpayer. Consequently, the landholder is taxed partly on the effort of himself and those members oP his family who have not been paid for their services. In many instances, taxpayers have not bothered to be particular about depreciation values in returns. Proper records have not been kept, and upon the sale of the property any omission will, of course, increase the amount of income. The Federal Government did not allow depreciation on fences and buildings until 1926. The Queensland Government had been allowing depreciation in respect of those items for many years before that, and when the Federal Government finally did allow depreciation, graziers in nearly all instances inserted the depreciation values shown in their State income tax return, so that the amount of depreciation already written off under the State act will now be brought into consideration in calculating the income arising out of the sale of the property. In the case of the sale of property, or of the resumption of part of the property by the Crown, it is almost impossible to arrive at the depreciated value of the improvement on the sold or resumed portion, as details are not usually kept of. the cost of each particular line of fencing, &c. It is felt that, under the present law and the proposed law, a taxpayer will never be able to destroy any of his income tax records, as he will always be under the necessity of keeping a record of the depreciation allowed in past assessments, and of the depreciated value of his property. It is considered that depreciation should be determined annually, and should be fixed; that it should not be subject to revision 10, 20 or even 30 years later. The present law, I suggest, should stand as to the amount of depreciation to be written off annually, either on a percentage basis, or upon the basis of the estimated life of the improvement, but any further loss arising from the sale of the property, or any profit arising from a sale, should not be taken into account. In other words, each year should stand complete, as far as depreciation is concerned. In the alternative, it is suggested that the law be amended, and that depreciation be not allowed on buildings and fences, and that depreciation should be allowed only on plant, motor cars, and perhaps windmills, bores, tanks and troughingIn the Queensland income tax law it is provided that sales of real and personal properties, which have been held for a period of seven years - other than leases - shall not be taken into account for income tax purposes, if any profits result from the sale. Under the Commonwealth law, a person is not liable to tax on profits arising from the - sale of any real or personal property, other thanleases, unless the sale is made in the course of the business of buying and selling property. The present depreciation provisions of the act destroy to sonic extent the exemption, as, irrespective of how long the property has been held, there is always the calculation to see .if excess depreciation has been allowed to the owner during the period he hasowned the property.Last night, the Treasurer (Mr. Casey) gave an undertaking that he would submit to the members of the Royal Commission on Taxation, for further investigation, the question of taxation on the sale of Crown leaseholds for grazing purposes. I now ask him whether it would be possible to arrange that a further investigation be made into this matter of depreciation.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[31]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

171,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MAHONEY, Gerald","KLC","Denison","N/A","N/A",1066,".- The purpose of this clause is, I understand, to allow farmers to make deductions in respect of depreciation on fencing, &c. If that deduction is to be allowed, a similar concession should be granted to the owners of city property, when they are called upon to repair fences and buildings on property from which they derive an income. At the present time, the city property owner receives no allowance for repairs; they are called improvements. In my opinion, it is proposed to make to the farmers concessions of too liberal a nature, and it is time we called a halt. It is evident that farmers, as a class, are not too heavily taxed, because the figures show that they pay proportionately less income tax than do other sections of the community. The granting of concessions of this kind to the farmers means that heavier burdens are thrown on taxpayers in general. This is not a uniform income tax bill; it is a measure to grant special privileges to a favoured few who dominate the policy of this Government, and who are tolerated by the Government because their support is necessary to keep it in power. Repeated representations have been made by taxpayers in general for relief from the burdens that are oppressing them; yet the Government proposed to grant further concessions to a specially-privileged class. I appeal to the Treasurer (Mr. Casey) to proceed very cautiously when dealing with applications for special concessions to wealthy primary producers, who are living in the lap of luxury.

I desire now co deal with the technical definition of  embezzlement and larceny  which I consider is not wide enough to cover the whole of the defalcations that take place from time to time. The South Australian bill includes the word misappropriation, and I suggest to the Treasurer (Mr. Casey) that the meaning of the words  embezzlement and larceny  might be considerably widened to include misappropriation, defalcations, and all kinds of theft and fraud. This would bring the clause into conformity with what the Treasurer actually has in mind. But why is this allowance to be confined to persons carrying on business? For example, a property-owner may employ a person to collect rents, and as rent is income from property the holding of property for investment purposes can hardly be termed a business. The Treasurer might well make some alteration of the definition to cover that point. Again, honorable members may he forgiven for asking why the deduction is to be restricted to cases in which funds are embezzled by employees. There are many relationships between agent and principal, in which the agent is not technically an employee. It would be interesting to learn why the discriminations have been made. The Treasurer apparently fails to appreciate this. Another point is that the deduction is restricted to embezzlement and larceny of money which is, or has been, included in the assessable income of - a taxpayer. An employee may embezzle the funds of his employer by means of a forged cheque, and thus obtain money from his employers current account and, in some cases, it would be impossible for the employer to say whether that money was income or capital. Both are frequently held in the one current account.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[35]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not know what the strict legal definition of the words  person employed  is ; I expect it would be a person in employment who is in receipt of wages or salary. If that be so, a person in receipt of a commission would not be included. I have a feeling too, that the word  business  is so limiting in its significance as probably to mean that certain taxpayers who have suffered from misappropriations of funds will get the benefit of this concession, while others who have suffered losses of a similar character will not do so because they are not engaged in business. A man may have investments in house property, and employ an agent to collect the rents. If the agent misappropriates rents collected, such a man may not be covered by the definition on the ground that he is not engaged in business. If he were buying and selling houses he would be engaged in the business of buying and selling houses, and would come within the definition. Here there are two phrases each limiting in their application, and therefore, creating an anomaly between one taxpayer who suffers losses from misappropriation and another who also suffers from the same cause. I suggest that the ambiguous and anomalous words. in the clause should be struck out and that it should provide that if any taxpayer is able to prove to the Commissioner that he has suffered lossthrough embezzlement or larceny of money which is or has been included in hisassessable income, that loss shall be deductible from the income for that year. If the Treasurer accepted my suggestion the provision would be widened to embrace all taxpayers who suffer loss by embezzlement and larceny of money which has already been included as income.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[36]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Unless we take very careful steps to safeguard the position, thousands of pounds will be claimed in refunds of taxation for which no real justification exists. The ordinary storekeeper, when taking stock, does not concern himself with the actual amount of profit he has made on particular articles. He may make 5 per cent, on one article, and ar percentage up to even 200 per cent, or more, if he can get away with, it, on other articles ; but in taking stock he does not ascertain the actual position of his business in every respect. A periodical writing-down of stock occurs, but the exact margins in a mans business are very rarely ascertained with sufficient exactitude to justify any claim for consideration under such a provision as that now before us. The enactment of this clause in its present form will amount to an invitation to dishonest people to evade taxation. Everybody knows that, if it were not for the dishonesty of individual taxpayers in seeking to evade their lawful obligations, two-thirds of the provisions of this bill could be dispensed with. I notice the Treasurer nodding his head in assent to my remark, and I assure him this provision would, if passed, encourage taxpayers with dishonest tendencies to persevere in their endeavours to evade taxation. The ordinary wholesale business man takes stock much more accurately than the ordinary retailer, for he works on very different margins. On some items, such as sugar, a retailer may make very little profit, whereas on others he may make substantial profit. In his stocktaking he does not enter into fine considerations as  to cost price and selling price, such as would enable him to say that he had suffered a loss of £1,500, £1,000, or even £500 in a particular accounting period.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[38]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The obvious intention is to allow the taxpayer deduction in the case of embezzlement or larceny, but the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) has asked why that deduction should be allowed only in the case of the embezzlement or larceny being by a person in the employ of the taxpayer. It seems to me that the Leader of the Opposition has taken a reasonable stand, but the Treasurer has made no reference to it. If the Government intends to make provision for such a deduction as is provided for in the clause I cannot see any reason why it should apply only to defalcation by a person in the employ of the taxpayer concerned, and not to defalcations by any other person, which may be suffered by that taxpayer.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[44]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If an employee is prepared to accept the stigma of being branded as a thief, then he is of little moral worth. That, of course, also implicates the employer, and an employeewho lends himself to such practices should be prosecuted to the maximum of the law. The Treasurer (Mr. Casey) answered,  That maybe so, and that seems to be stretching the case a little too far; but I am reconciled to the Treasurers statement that, arising out of a discussion with the Commissioner, he was assured that the Commissioner, . where there is no shadow of doubt, may accept a confession of guilt, although, in any other case, he will insist on a conviction.

Larceny  means different things in different States. The criminal codes of Western Australia and Queensland define as larceny offences which are not larceny in Victoria. For instance, in Victoria, in 1896, we copied provisions from the Canadian criminal code to deal with things which the Victorian court said were neither larceny nor embezzlement, if the matter is one to be left to the discretion of the Commissioner, less technical words should be used. The Commissioner will have to insist on conviction as proof of dishonesty. 1 cannot see the Commissioner safely accepting mere confessions, of guilt. There are difficulties about the admission of guilt. An admission of guilt may be extorted on the plea that, if the guilt is confessed, there will be no prosecution, and if it is not confessed there will be a prosecution. An admission of guilt may be obtained by collusion or threats. As in practice, the Commissioner will properly insist on conviction as the only proof of dishonesty, and this will have the consequence of employers prosecuting men whom they would not otherwise prosecute. The past practice of this legislature in not accepting provisions of this type was a wise one.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[47]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Therefore. I am inclined to say that, as the provision is an entirely new one, and as the act which this bill amends does not include this provision, the advice tendered by the honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) is the best advice that the committee can get. I should be prepared to accept the provision contained in the clause, were the Treasurer ready to apply it generally, but he is not disposed to do that. He proposes that only those taxpayers who have suffered loss through embezzlement or larceny by a person employed in the taxpayers business shall get the benefit of this deduction. It was pointed out earlier that there is a large number of conceivable forms of loss, from such causes as misappropriation, embezzlement, larceny, or fraud committed by persons not actually engaged in the business. We give special concessions to primary producers in one clause, and special concessions to business men in another clause. This sort of thing clutters up the act with concessions not generally applicable to taxpayers. If we desire that larceny or embezzlement losses shall be deductible from assessable income, then any taxpayer who can prove such losses ought to have the benefit of that deduction. The clause does not make that provision.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[48]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

238,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"HAWKER, Charles","KOC","Wakefield","N/A","N/A",1073,".- The attitude of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) is understandable, because he does not believe in either remissions of taxation or concessions, his idea being to maintain at the peak revenue from this source in order that it might be expended for different purposes. Though not sharing his general attitude- towards taxation, I sympathize deeply with his objection to the drawing of a distinction between taxpayers of different types. This concession is not really the allowance of a loss occasioned by theft, larceny or embezzlement. If the loss is ascertained, the amount is not included in the return of the taxpayer, and is, therefore, not assessable. The object of the clause is to meet the case of losses which are disguised by the cunning 6f the embezzler, and not discovered until the expiration of the period within which the amendment of ar assessment is permitted. The intention is that such losses shall be deducted in a. later assessment, or that the deduction shall be made retrospectively. In the case of the collector of rents cited by the Leader of the Opposition, if the rent is not paid to the person who should receive it, he obviously is aware of his loss, and can claim an allowance with respect to it in that year. But if there are cases in which the theft is not detected, and income tax is paid on the amount which the taxpayer is supposed to have received, I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that they are exactly analogous to the case of a business man whose employee embezzles his money. If the honorable gentleman were to move for the deletion of the words to which he has directed attention, I should urge the Treasurer (Mr. Casey) to accept the amendment. It is unlikely that there would be extensive embezzlements, the estimates of which had been included in taxation returns and upon which tax had been paid, from other than business sources. I therefore strongly suggest to the Treasurer that, such an amendment would cost the revenue practically nothing, and that it would tend to simplify returns by effecting uniformity over the whole field of income taxpayers.I am prepared to accept the assurance of the Treasurer that the definition of  embezzlement or larceny  does not exclude certain cases in which the prosecution has not been proceeded with, or in which there has not been a conviction, and therefore shall not move for the extension of the definition. I strongly urge the Treasurer not to withdraw this concession, which is a legitimate one, and one which the taxpaying public were led to expect would be incorporated in this measure.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[49]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In the case cited by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin), the property owner nothaving received the rents, they would not be taken into account, and therefore would not be assessable. I venture to disagree with the suggestion that the clause gives a peculiar concession to a certain class of taxpayer. Only in businesses are taxpayers exposed to losses of this description.

I support the honorable member for Bourke (Mr. Blackburn) in the two points which he has raised. The first is that an open invitation is given to every employer to take proceedings against an employee who has been guilty of the theft of a small amount of money, with a view to the obtaining of a conviction so that he might deduct from his assessable income the amount involved. I do not think that that is a desirable feature in national taxation legislation. The second point is that if the Treasurer or the Commissioner did not insist upon a court judgment against the guilty person, the door would be wide open for the practice of fraud. Let us Sup pos- that an employer discovered two years after the commission of the offence that an employee had stolen £10 or £15 from him. If he wished to reduce his assessable income in order to lower it in the graduated scale, what is to prevent his saying to the unfortunate chap,  I have you now. I can send you to gaol. Como with me to the Commissioner and admit that you have taken £100, £150, or more, and I shall let you go  ? Many employers would take that stand.

My impression is that the receipt of the money by the employee would, for the purposes of taxation, biregarded as receipt by the employer, and that the employer would bc liable to pay income tax on it. The more important point, however, was that raised by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin), namely, whether it is right that this set-off against losses by theft, &c, should be enjoyed only by people engaged in business. I do not think that the limitation is right or logical. When a taxpayer suffers loss by theft he does not during the year of the assessment enjoy the benefit of the money so lost, and therefore, he should not be taxed on it. A bookmaker, for instance, handles large sums of money and, on a Saturday night, often has to take this money to his home. If, as sometimes happens, he is robbed, perhaps of hundreds of pounds, he should be allowed to make a deduction in respect of that loss, even though the money was not taken by an employee. In the same way, business people sometimes have to keep considerable sums of money in safes, and a safe may be broken open, and the money stolen. In that case, also, the loss should he an allowable deduction.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[52]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Treasurer (Mr. Casey) said that if an agent did not hand over rent to his principal, it would not be included in his assessment, and therefore he would not be taxed on it. I do not believe that the Treasurer desired to mislead honorable members, but the fact is that an agent, in those circumstances, would be regarded as an employee of the taxpayer, and, in the eyes of the law, the taxpayer would be deemed to have received the income when it was received by his servant, and therefore was assessable. In my opinion, the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Curtin) is worthy of consideration. There arc cases in which owners of property have gone overseas, and left the collection of rent, and the management of their estate, in the hands of agents who may make out false income tax returns on behalf of their principals. However, I do not desire the clause to be lost altogether, and if the suggested amendment cannot be accepted, I am prepared to accept the clause as it stands.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[53]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I submit that we might very well extend the provision still further, so as to include the expenses of all persons nominated for election to Parliament. As the clause now stands, the deduction is allowed only in the case of successful candidates, or of such unsuccessful candidates as are retiring members of Parliament. A cynic might remark that the provision is drawn in this form because the Government rightly anticipates that a large number of retiring members will be defeated at the next election, and that the alteration will be of benefit to many of those who enthusiastically support the Government at present. I put it to the committee that expenses incurred by a candidate for election, regardless of whether he be elected or not, are expenses which he incurs in the performance of what may be regarded as the highest obligation of citizenship. He offers himself to the people for service in an Australian parliament, and whatever fate he may suffer at the ballot, the expenses he incurs should be an allowable deduction from his income. It is not probable that a large number of persons will nominate for election merely to take advantage of this provision, because the Electoral Act will still contain that section which requires the candidate to deposit £25, which will be forfeited if he polls less thaw the stipulated percentage of votes. The clause gives an advantage to a person elected to Parliament who was previously not in Parliament, and also an advantage to a candidate who has been a member of Parliament, but who has been defeated. Thus, there is a distinction between an ordinary taxpayer, not a member of Parliament, but who is elected to Parliament, who is permitted to deduct election expenses from his assessable income, a member of Parliament who is not re-elected, but who can also deduct his expenses from his assessable income, and the other party, a candidate who is probably trying out his possibilities as a public man for the first or second time, and including one who is systematically defeated, who is not permitted to deduct his election expenses from his assessable income. I again point out the anomalous consequence of this clause which appears to be in keeping with the anomalous incidence of many clauses of the bill. The honorable member for Wakefield . (Mr. Hawker) chided me with being opposed to exemptions. I am for good reasons. I regard every exemption which is not capable of general application, as objectionable. If the Government proceeds to grant exemptions in respect of this, that or the other clause, my purpose is to make those exemptions as wide as possible, so that every taxpayer can obtain the benefit of them.

Is it the intention that clause 74 shall also limit the exemption to £100? As the sizes of the various electorates throughout the Commonwealth are so varied, it will be seen that what might be regarded a reasonable deduction in respect of one electorate may not apply to another. Take, for instance, the electorates of Kalgoorlie and Kennedy. In the latter, there are no railways and a good deal of travelling has to be done by motor car. The same conditions apply to other electorates throughout the Commonwealth.

Such an extension is not called for. The persons particularly concerned in this are those who have had a seat in Parliament, but who have been defeated at an election.

The reason why I did not move-, an amendment when I first rose to speak was because I believed that the fairness and common sense of my remarks would appeal to the Treasurer, and that he would accept my proposal. But, apparently, he is not prepared to do so.It is not equitable that deductions from assessable income in respect of expenses incurred at elections should be confined only to those taxpayers who are members of Parliament, or who will be elected to Parliament.

Profiting by that experience which comes to those who have lived a full political life, I certainly do not account myself as one. You, Mr. Chairman, in your long experience of political institutions, may have observed that some of those persons who have been called upon under the Electoral Act to contribute £25 to Consolidated Revenue, or in other words to forfeit their deposits, have afterwards been returned to Parliament, and have enjoyed distinguished political careers in the service of the nation. The electors are privileged to change their minds if they wish to do so, and often a change of mind by the electorate has been fully justified. I should not have to search far in this Parliament to name an honorable member who on one occasion lost his deposit, and was afterwards returned to Parliament. It was, of course, no reflection upon that gentleman that he had the bitter experience of losing his deposit; on the contrary, it was to his credit that, in spite of such an adversity, he won public confidence, and was able to give meritorious service to the community in the legislature. I can see no justification for allowing an exemption to a person who is a member of Parliament when he nominates and denying it to another individual who is not a member when he nominates. The electoral authorities are not slow in collecting the deposits of candidates who fail to secure a sufficient number of votes. Citizens should be permitted to seek the suffrages of the electors on equal terms. As far as possible, absolute equality of conditions should apply to any deductions in respect to the legitimate expenses of candidates for Parliament. Members of Parliament, at any rate, should not seek to hamper those who are not members but seek election. The clause now under consideration challenges, in a measure, the corporate honour of Parliament, for it seeks to give an unprecedented privilege to persons who are in Parliament. Hitherto, it has been the proud boast of Australians that our Constitution and electoral law alike leave it open for any citizen to submit his name to his fellows for election to Parliament. It may be true, as some contend, that the party system has limited the choice of the electors; but it is somewhat flattering to the Labour party, which has organized itself on certain important basic political principles, that other individuals in the community, with other political views, have also formed themselves into political parties.I understand from what my leader has just told me that the Treasurer has been impressed with the arguments submitted in support of the amendment, and I therefore have no more to say.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[60]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This clause will not benefit the small farmer so much as it will the man with a large holding. The latter will have an excellent opportunity to evade the payment of income tax. A large grazier could say that he had expended £500 in the eradication of pests on his property, and the department would have difficulty in disputing his statement. In the case of the small man, an evasion of tax could be more easily detected. This is a graziers bill, resulting from the influence which the graziers have over the Government.

I have heard honorable members tell us that the country would go to the dogs if the farmers went off. the land. If three-fourths of the farmers went off the land, they would soon be replaced. The trouble is that they never do go off it, because this Commonwealth has had a succession of munificent Treasurers, who have led the Parliament into the granting of bounties, and into feeding the farmers from the general revenues of the country. This * is a travesty on ordinary common justice. Some honorable members will consider that I am not stating the case fairly, but, first of all, there . is the ease of a man who, with a large estate, wants to drain it in order to make it good pasture land, or fiats for lucerne. Money spent in that direction is to be exempt from taxation. The cost of ploughing or grassing of land for grazing purposes is also to be exempt. On the one hand if a man in Sydney erects a building on a block of land, not only has he to pay for the improvements, but they are also added to the cost of the property and taxed. On the other hand, if a farmer improves the quality of land, he is not only recouped for his outlay by increased production, but is also able to claim exemption from income tax on th expenditure involved. In fact a farmer is exempted from taxation on all sorts of expenditure connected with farming. If it is right to do that for the farmer, it should be just as right to do it for all other sections of the community. If it be genuine expenditure on the development of land, it should be deducted from income, but why put it here in this form in which no charges can be made for any improvements made? I admit that small men engaged in the regeneration of the soil have some claim on this account, but it is the big man who has these swamps on his property still awaiting improvement, and who, after affecting these improvements, instead of selling his land for about £1 an acre, will probably get £4 or £5 an acre for it.

The man in the city should be granted a similar concession. Instead, if he effects improvements for his tenants he is taxed to the utmost on them. The men in the city are the greatest taxpayers of this Commonwealth, and I fail to see why we are pandering to one section of the community while the majority, the taxpayers of the city, who made representations for general tax relief to the Treasurer in Melbourne the other day, are ignored. This bill represents preferential treatment to a section of the population for the specific purposes of a section in this House, which is able to dominate this Government. There is a motive behind this provision, and although I am not against putting the struggler on the land on a basis on which he can survive, I am against the exemption of wealthy squatters who are in a better position to pay the tax than are the men. in the city areas who have received no rent from tenants because the tenants, through unemployment, have not been able to pay rent. The Government has done nothing for that section of the community. I am confident that the majority of the people will show their disgust at legislation of this kind when the time comes for them to vote at the next general election. I know that the people are going to dump out of office this Government because the less favoured sections who are asking for relief, even in respect of the payment of municipal rates, have made their appeals in vain.The extent to which the Country party dominates this Government is shown in the provision under which a man who takes up an area of land on which there is good timber and dears it at a profit by selling it for firewood at high prices in the city will not be called upon to pay tax on the money spent in the clearing operations and the consequent acquisition of profit. It will be realized that the growing of the timber has cost him nothing, for nature has seen to that. It is not a correct attitude for the Government to adopt. If we are to be consistent, we should exempt city people who are taxed on everything they use. At present they are on the starvation level. Every business expansion which would increase the volume of employment is discouraged by restrictive legislation. We must be consistent by making exemptions from taxation general in their application. If it is right for one section of the community to be given an exemption, it is right for another to receive it. Rents are taken into account in the determination of the basic wage. The owners of houses arc entitled to the same protection as that which is enjoyed by the primary producer.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[69]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member for Denison (Mr. Mahoney) has spoken of the exemptions granted to the lessees of large pastoral holdings. I point out to him that the area of Tasmania is only about one-tenth of the area of my electorate. The whole of that State is not equal in size to one large pastoral holding. The big pastoral lessees having shifted to North Australia or the Northern Territory, this taxation deals not with them but with the farming community, such as is to be found on the Atherton Tableland and in parts of Tasmania that I have visited. It may interest honorable members to learn that in Queensland the selector of a block of land is not entitled to the timber on it; that remains the property of the Crown, and is marketed by the Forestry Department. The cost of clearing ranges up to as high as £20 an acre. After scrub land has been cleared in a district like the Atherton Tableland, the selector has to grass it to make it capable of raising stock, and providing food for the wealthy masses in the cities who enjoy the benefits of the cinema, the trams, and other social amenities. I invite those honorable members who have spoken of farmers riding about in motor cars, to make themselves acquainted with their conditions. It surprises me greatly to find politicians struggling along on the pittance which they receive when they could participate in the enormous rake-offs which some believe are associated with the tilling of the soil.

In Queensland there is practically no freehold, but a lease system, under which a man may occupy the land for only 30 years. In addition, there are certain resumption rights. Grazing farm selections have a tenure of 28 years, with certain priority rights. Then there is the agricultural farm system, under which there are also resumption rights. Under all three classes of tenure, the land is liable to be resumed at the termination of the lease.

Income tax is the fairest method of taxation. A man who improves the assets of this country by the sinking of bores, the fencing, clearing and grassing of the land, and the extermination of pests, is certainly entitled to some exemption. The farmer has not the protection which is given by way of the tariff to the manufacturer. In the last analysis, the primary producer and the consuming public pay the taxation which is levied. It is unfortunately a fact that during the last five or six years a very small percentage of the sugar farmers, dairy farmers, and wheat farmers have paid income tax. One of the principal factors retarding the progress of this country is the lack of development due to the small percentage of the total population which is. engaged in farming operations. A Labour Government in Queensland has placed on the statute-book of that State the best farming legislation in the world. Primary producers in that State are subject to the operation of rural awards. By means of closer settlement, Queensland has increased its population at a more rapid rate than any other State. There is proportionally a bigger rural population in Queensland than in any other State, and that is because we have given proper protection to the farming community.

There may be a rural award in operation in Queensland, but there is none in New South Wales. In that State, the rural awards have been suspended by the action of the combined United Australia party and Country party. What some honorable members seem to overlook is that, if a farmer is not obtaining a taxable income, he cannot be taxed upon it. I know of one instance in which a wealthy squatter, who already had more land than he was entitled to, took advantage of the poverty of another landholder to buy his weed-infested land at one-tenth of its value. He spent a few thousands of pounds clearing the weed, and turning the land into good grazing country, but he was allowed exemption on the money which he thus used to create a capital asset. The Treasurer (Mr. Casey) told the honorable member for Franklin (Mr. Frost) that he could not, in any circumstances, agree that the cost of plant used for spraying fruit trees should he allowed as a deduction, and no doubt he was moved to take that view by the fact that most of the fruit growers are in a small way. He said that money spent for that purpose would be capital expenditure; yet he maintains that, when the squatter puts a fence around his land, he. is not engaging in capital expenditure, and should be granted an exemption in respect of the money spent for this purpose. What sort of reasoning is that? If that is typical of the intelligence that has gone to the framing of our taxation legislation, it is no wonder that the act is full of anomalies, and that it has to be amended every year. Some honorable members spoke about farmers having to spend £20 an acre to clear land of big trees. I remind them that, because the big trees were on the land, the farmers were, in the first place, able to obtain it for a nominal sum, and, in any case, they knew that the land would be of no use until the timber was cleared. Such men should be treated no differently from men who invest their capital in a business. All these concessions are really being made for the benefit of the wealthy land owners who, as we know, contribute liberally to the ministerial party funds. We have been told that concessions of this kind are necessary to encourage people to go out and open up the land, but the fact is that those who will benefit from the concession are the men whose fortunes were made under the rotten slavery conditions of last century, such conditions as prevailed during the shearers strike of the nineties, when the squatters hunted the workers over the countryside with bloodhounds. I do not object to this Parliament giving assistance to those in need of it, whether they be on the land or in the city, but I sh::ll always oppose the granting of special concessions to those who arc already well off. As a citizen, the farmer is entitled to all expenses legitimately incurred in the production of his income, such as those involved in shearing, fertilizing, ploughing, &c, and there is no occasion for granting him any further concessions. If, in one State, specially favorable conditions are enjoyed by farmers, so much the better for them, but they are not entitled on that account to obtain still further concessions from this Parliament. No honorable member on this side of the House has ever raised any objection to proposals for using the resources of the country to assist people in distress, whether such people are engaged in primary or secondary industries, but I protest against the granting of special concessions in order to placate a small coterie of members of this Parliament who, for the time being, are in the position of the tail that is able to wag the dog.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[71]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That may be so, but they are not necessarily right because they are old. From time to time we change our opinions on the subject of taxation, and we are as much entitled to change them in respect of this exemption as of anything else. For the last four years we have listened to harrowing .tales in this Parliament of the destitution among primary producers, but I draw attention to the fact -that no representative of the Country party has spoken in favour of the granting of these special income tax exemptions to the farmers, or drawn attention to this aspect of primary production. In the past, we have been told that the vast majority of farmers do not earn £1 a week for themselves, let alone a taxable income, and, moved by those stories, Parliament has agreed to grant millions of pounds to assist the farmers. Now we are considering proposals for exemptions that benefit not all primary producers, but only the wealthy section of them. If the story which we have continually heard from members of the Country partyregarding the extent of the destitution that exists among the primary producers of this country is true, then only a very small section of the primary producers, the wealthy section, will derive any benefit from this proposed exemption. This is sectional legislation because it grants a special exemption to persons engaged in a special industry, and denies it topeople who have invested their money in. other industries for the purpose of providing a livelihood, not only for themselves, but also for others. It is classlegislation because, as I have already indicated, only one class among that section which it purports to benefit will gain by it.The honorable member for Kennedy told a very heart-rending story of the poverty that exists among the poor farmers in his electorate. He made- out quite a good ease for the poor farmers, but the real fact of the matter is that these people will gain no benefit from the exemption provided in this clause, because it applies only to those who have a taxable income. If a struggling farmer out of his modest income encloses his land with wire netting, clears it, and drains it, and his income subsequently falls below the taxable level, he gains no benefit from the proposed exemption. The exemption will be enjoyed only by those farmers who improve their holdings by fencing, clearing and draining the land, who are fortunate enough to have a taxable income. Unquestionably, a farmer who so improves his holding increases the value of his assets, whether he makes a taxable income or not.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[72]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If a man in the city who owns a factory extends it, and thus creates more employment for others, he is not extended the exemption conferred upon the farmer who does precisely the same thing with his holding. An interesting point lias been made by the honorable member for Franklin (Mr. Frost), which again shows that sectional interests will benefit under this legislation. The honor able member referred to the question of the exemption of expenditure by orchardists on spray pumps and other equipment necessary for combating the ravages of pests in their orchards. The Treasurer (Mr. Casey) said that expenditure of that nature is regarded as capital expenditure, and could not b6 exempted. It is difficult to understand why discrimination of this sort is exercised. On the one hand, an orchardist is not permitted to claim exemption in respect of expenditure on spray pumps necessary to protect his asset from the ravages of insect pests while, on the other hand, a squatter who surrounds his holding with a wire fence for the purpose of keeping out pests, is entitled to it. If expenditure incurred in an attempt to combat the ravages of insect pests in an orchard is regarded as capital expenditure, surely that incurred by a squatter in fencing his land to keep it free from pests should also be considered as capital expenditure. In both instances that expenditure is for a similar purpose end enhances the value of the holding. My chief objection to this clause is that it sorts out a particular section of the community, and confers upon it a benefit denied to other sections . of the community with equally just claims for consideration.It has been said by the honorable member for Kennedy, that a farmer increases the value of his holding by fencing and draining the  land. That is true, and it is also true that a man who- spends his money in extending a city factory, thus creating additional employment, increases the value of his property; but while the farmer, if he has a taxable income, is granted an exemption in respect to his expenditure, the owner of the factory is denied it. We have been told repeatedly that the great majority of the farmers are in a bad way, and have been able to make ends meet only by the provision of bounties and other aids to production. Those farmers will derive no benefit from this exemption, because they are not in receipt of a taxable income.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[72]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is for that reason that the members of the Country party, the so-called champions of the country people in this House, have not ventured to participate in this discussion.

I refer particularly to kang:1. roos. It is unfair that orchardists should be denied an exemption for expenses incurred in combatting orchard pests. Nowadays, orchardists are obliged to spray thirteen or fourteen times a year. In fact, they are almost continually spraying to combat one pest or another. These unfortunate people have, in many instances, incurred heavy expenditure in clearing forest land. Some orchardists who, four or five years ago, were worth £20,000 or £30,000, and were taxed on that scale, could not, to-day, write their name to a cheque for £1,000. It is, therefore, not too much to ask that Parliament should give these people every possible consideration. Since the value of our wool, wheat, butter, and other commodities has increased somewhat, city people have been able to spend huge sums of money in building flats at Manly and other places; but it is actually the country people who pay all the time. The only real wealth is in the country.I make an appeal to the Treasurer (Mr. Casey) to give consideration to the orchardists, not only in my own electorate, but throughout the Commonwealth. It is true that fruit is at present bringing a fair price in the market, but that is no compensation to orchardists who have very little fruit to sell. New pests seem to require attention every year. Some orchardists who had from 8,000 to 10,000 bushels of fruit on their trees this year, will be able to market only 3,000 or 4,000 bushels in consequence of the ravages of pests. A certain grub has infected orchards in Tasmania recently with the result that nearly 1,000,000 bushels of fruit have had to be destroyed this year. I therefore earnestly appeal to the Government to make provision for an exemption in respect of expenditure incurred in eradicating orchard pests.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[73]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is now the responsibility of the State government to supply the wire netting. A man who takes up a dingo-infested holding cannot use wire netting unless he is in a position to incur the expense of constructing the fence to carry it. The State governments make certain concessions to leaseholders in respect of wire netting. The land laws of Queensland are different from those of the other States. Under the leasehold system in my State, a person who is allotted a block is required to reside on it for seven years. Take a holding of 100,000 acres in an area infested by dingoes. The original holding may be cut up into ten selections, and occupied by ten separate families. Assuming the average number of persons in each family to be seven, this means that 70 permanent residents are established on the land and provided with a profitable occupation. Probably the land was originally used for cattle raising, but, on the elimination of the dingo, it is suitable for sheep. By converting this into sheep country its economic value to the State is greatly improved. The settlers, instead of fencing their individual blocks, decide to place a ring fence round the whole area. Why should not deductions be allowed with respect to the cost of the whole of the fencing, in view of the improved value of the land? The rental for cattle-raising country might be 10s. a square mile, but once it is converted to sheep land the rental value increases to 6d. or 9d. an acre. The ten families employed upon it secure a better return from their sheep than would be obtained by the raising of cattle, because their commodity commands a higher price. In addition, they have taxable incomes. We are told that one of the ways in which to eliminate the danger of war is to give security to the people, and we should endeavour to do that by placing people in permanent and useful occupations on theland.The Treasurer (Mr. Casey) mentioned yesterday that this bill had been before the public for five months. A Royal Commission has investigated the subject of simplifying the taxation laws, but I venture to say that the great majority of the members of this Parliament who engage in mixed farming are unable to prepare their own income tax returns without the assistance of an expert. I urge the Commissioner to allow as a deduction from income the whole of the cost of fencing farming land.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[75]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Mr. Lindsay appealed to the court; and the judge held that the expenditure, being necessary to enable the appellant to obtain a taxable income, was deductible. Even if the deduction of the cost of wire netting erected for the purpose of eradicating vermin were not provided for in this clause, I doubt whether the department could refuse to allow such a deduction. Australia is largely dependent upon its export products, 97 per cent, of which are primary products. Take a property that is protected against the rabbit pest by wire fencing, and is used for sheep raising or wheat-growing. If it were not for the invasion of the rabbit the expenditure incurred on fencing would not be necessary, and that land could be used in the production of either wool or wheat, which would be of great advantage to both the man on the land and the country as a whole. If that property had not been wire-netted against rabbits, the owner would have derived no revenue from it, and the taxation department no revenue. As a general proposition the proposed exemption is therefore sound from the national point of view. The honorable member for Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini), in the discussion on the preceding clause, took exception to the exemption of expenditure incurred in clearing virgin country. He entirely overlooked the fact that although certain land might be worthless in its original state, the cost of clearing it in order to make it productive might amount to as much as £20 an acre. Apparently the honorable member would prefer to see land overrun by dingoes, because he objects to a deduction being made in respect of expenditure which brings virgin land into a state of productivity and enables the owner to obtain a taxable income from it.

These proposed exemptions have to be considered on their merits. If a business man spends £10,000 on the erection of a factory, and during the time of its construction obtains no return from his capital expenditure, he is not expected to contribute to revenue by way of income tax ; but if in the succeeding year he obtains from his venture an income of £2,000 or £3.000 he is expected to pay his share of the income tax. Honorable members of the Country party are forever talking about the wealth that is created by the man on the land, and the amount which he contributes to the national income. I put it to the committee, however, that a man pioneers new country not from patriotic motives, but for thedefinite purpose of making money.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[77]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It relates to expenditure over which the land-owner has no control. If flood waters came down suddenly upon a property the owner would be forced to construct banks to protect his holding, and would be entitled to deduct such expenditure when preparing his income-tax returns. Expenditure to check the invasion of the rabbit or dingo was also unexpected when pioneer settlers in Western Australia took up their land. Almost every farmer in Western Australia has been compelled to net his property against rabbits. In many instances the ordinary developmental work had been completed when the rabbits made their appearance, making inevitable heavy expenditure for wire netting. Unfortunately, a wire-netting fence does not last more than fifteen or twenty years. This expenditure is entirely different from any other, and, in the circumstances, there should be no objection to the exemption provided in this clause.Amendment agreed to.Clause, as amended, agreed to.Clause 77 agreed to.Clause 78 - (1.) The following shall, to an extent in the aggregate not exceeding the amount of income remaining after deducting from the assessable income all other allowable* deductions except the deduction of losses of previous years and of the statutory exemption, be allowable deductions: -Gifts of the value of one pound and upwards made by the taxpayer in the year of income to any of the following funds, authorities or institutions in Australia: -a public authority engaged in research into the causes, prevention or cure of disease in human beings, animals or plants, where the gift is for such research ;","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[78]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Such institutions are as deserving as a governmental or a semi-governmental institution. As honorable members know, there is a large institution in the United States of America which is investigating the disease of cancer. Similar institutions may be established in Australia, and donations made to them should be allowed as a deduction. The Australian Pastoral Research Trust was formed to inquire into and give relief in cases of diseases in stock, animal plants, and edible plant life, and any diseases harmful to plant life. As the clause stands, such an institution would not be regarded as a public authority, but under my amendment it undoubtedly would. It, and similar institutions, would be of enormous value to the community in regard to investigations into the health of human beings, and diseases in animal and plant life. I urge the Minister to agree to this small but important amendment.","N/A","INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT BILL 1936","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[79]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This is the second instance within two weeks on which I have had occasion to make a similar complaint. To-day I submitted the following question to the Prime Minister: -. Does the Government agree with the statements by the High Commissioner (Mr. Bruce) and the Minister for External Affairs that sanctions against Italy have failed?If so, does the Government consider that further sanctions, either of an economic or military nature, should be imposed on Italy, or that the present sanctions should be withdrawn ?The answers I received were -Neither the High Commissioner nor the Minister for External Affairs has stated that sanctions against Italy have failed. The reports from the Secretary-General of the League of Nations show that sanctions are having a constant and cumulative effect.The question of the imposition or withdrawal of sanctions is not one for individual State members, but for collective decision by the whole of the League.The Prime Minister stated definitely that neither the Minister for External Affairs (Senator Pearce) nor the High Commissioner (Mr. Bruce) has stated that sanctions have failed. I direct the attention of honorable members to the fact that the High Commissioner as president of the Council of the League of Nations, speaking at Geneva on the 20th April, said -Certain economic and financial sanctions have been imposed. Because of the nonuniversality of the League and of the necessity that all action must be unanimous, that pressure has not been sufficiently strong to achieve its objective. It is clear that the whole system we have established for collective security must be re-examined. To allow nations to be lulled into a false security where in fact none exists, and to be led to rely on assistance which will not be forthcoming, is not a contribution but a menace to the peace of the world.Senator Sir George Pearce, speaking on the subject of sanction on the 24th April, said -They have not proved sufficiently drastic or rapid enough in their operation to prevent military success on the part of the Italian armies. We are now faced with the position that the machinery set in action by the League to uphold the principle of collective security has, in the present instance, proved insufficient to prevent an aggressor from continuing to pursue his object. A decisive effect cannot be achieved by the imposition of sanctions unless they are universally applied.Both statements are direct admissions that sanctions against Italy have not achieved their object. When I ask questions in Parliament I expect to receive reliable answers. Those I have received in connexion with this subject are not only misleading, but also false.Question resolved in the affirmative.","Italo- Abyssinian Dispute - Sanctions","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The public works on which the Commonwealth can embark are, however, of a limited nature, as most public works come within the control of State governments. The Commonwealth has accordingly substantially helped the States to provide increased employment, partly by increased grants of money to the States for public works purposes and also by leaving the loan market as far as possible to the States, thus enabling them to undertake additional public works. At the same time, the present Commonwealth Govern-; ment, by maintaining a sound policy of finance, has enabled private enterprise to absorb a large proportion of the unemployed. The general effect pf the action of the Government  can be seen in the great improvement in - the position of employment, the percentage of unemployed having been reduced from 30 per cent, in the June quarter, 19.32, to 13.4 per cent, in the March quarter,-1936. For the future, the Commonwealth wiT continue to do all in its power to provide additional employment. As regards the Federal Capital Territory, the position is that married men registered for employment have for more than two months been receiving full-time work, and will be given full-time work until the end ofJune at least, whilst single men will have their ordinary quota of work considerably i ncreased.","Winter Relief for Unemployed","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[9]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
