7,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FINLAYSON, William","KEX","N/A","N/A","N/A",9120,"- I am glad that the newspapers admit this morning that the circular to which attention was drawn by the honorable member for Wentworth was absolutely innocent. The House must be satisfied that the honorable member bit off more than he could chew. When he rises in this chamber, one is always in doubt as to whether he intends to be cynical, satirical, or funny at the expense of his fellow members. However, I intend to take him seriously in this instance. The Prime Minister was very modest yesterday. Perhaps he did not care to read the translation of the circular to which his attention had been drawn on the previous day, because it contained a eulogy of the Administration of which he was a prominent member. He was, therefore, content to move that the document containing it be printed. Fortunately for myself and for the House at large, the translation is available. I wish now to let honorable members and the country know which is the political party that is associated with the Germans in this country. The honorable member for Wentworth tried to make it appear that I have been seeking German support during the war, and I therefore call attention to advertisements which were published in Brisbane, in a German newspaper, in May, 1915, some eighteen months after the war broke out.The State elections were then proceeding, and I have here a photographic reproduction of German advertisements, giving reasons why German citizens should vote for Herr W. H. Barnes, instead of for the Labour candidate, Mr. McMinn; for Mr. Denham, the Liberal candidate, instead of for Mr. Jones, the Labour candidate; for Mr. Tolmie, the Liberal candidate, instead of for Mr. Alke; and for Mr. Kessell, the Liberal candidate, instead of for Mr. Carter. In a later issue they were asked to vote for Mr. Walsh, a Liberal candidate, as against Mr. Bertram, a Labour candidate. This was at the time when we had reason to fear the results of the fighting. I propose now to read extracts from a leading article which appeared in the newspaper in which these advertisements were published. This is the English translation of the original German -Have not we Germans sufficient reason to be thankful to the Liberal Government for the friendship and respect which they conferred upon us, and still grant us - especially just now. On 22nd May is the opportunity to show Herr Denham and the Liberal party in general that we are thankful, by voting for the indorsed Liberal candidates. . . .You can easily see from Herr Denhams speech what might happen if the Liberal Government were defeated, and men like Herr Denham, Herr Barnes, &c, who are a great pillar (prop, stay, or support) for you and Germans in general, had to give up the Treasury benches. . . .When one can do no more (work) in his own home if he so desires and, moreover, children and dependants are set (the verb really means stirred up, or incited to rebellion), against their parents, it is just about time to put an end to this political activity by merely putting a cross opposite the names of the Liberal candidates in the different districts on polling day. . . .On Saturday morning last the first news was received in Brisbane of the sinking of the great English ship, the Lusitania. The Cunard liner left New York last week with 1,300 passengers for England. The first news announced that the ship had been sunk by a German submarine. . . .We have before us a pamphlet which bears the signatures of the deputy-leader, and secretary of the Labour party, E. G. Theodore and J. Fihelly.  Tampering with the Franchise  is the heading, and on the other side there is a cartoon of the German Crown Prince and Herr Denham. The Crown Prince has a large sack in his hand with the inscription,  Booty stolen in Belgium, while Herr Denham holds a similar one with the inscription  Votes stolen from the workers. If anything should cause a right-thinking voter, and especially us Germans, not to give our votes this time to the Labour party, it is this insulting (offensive, scurrilous, or disagreeable) picture! Those signatories expect the Germans to vote for them.This appeal for German support during the war received, as one may imagine, considerable notice in other newspapers published in Brisbane, but it did not prevent the appearance of further advertisements in German. I have more advertisements by Liberal candidates appealing, in the German language, for the support of German electors.","Appeals to Germans","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Not a single Labour man has appealed to the Germans for support during the war ; such appeals have come only from Liberals. During the Queensland State elections, in May 1915, the Liberal Government published in German in the News Budget, a German edition of the weekly Courier and in the German newspaper, their manifesto for the election. The honorable member for Wide Bay was a member of the party at the time, and, therefore, identified with that publication. Not only that, .but the leading Liberal organ in Queensland, until March last, published weekly a News Budget containing three pages in the German language, giving all the news of the war and other information. I propose to tell honorable members the kind of news that was thus being published weekly for the information of German readers. An advertisement appeared each week inviting contributions, and asking that they be addressed to the German editor of the News Budget, Courier Buildings, Brisbane. I have here a digest of the news that appeared on 22nd January, 1916. There were several poems, in one of which was an appreciative reference to the Kaisers little daughter. The word  Kaiserlich  occurs often in this poem. The reference is not to the present Kaiser, but to some past monarch; but, nevertheless, the appeal to German national sentiment - not Australian or British sentiment - is unmistakable. There is an account of a German wedding, at which a  real German wedding breakfast  was given, and the usual toasts were honoured. Then there is an interesting reference to the confirmation services and other good work done by Pastor Franck, and it is an interesting coincidence that a German pastor of that name, presumably the same man, was one of two interned as  disaffected subjects. Pastor Franck was one of the most active electioneering agents in the Wide Bay district during the by-election in December last.","Appeals to Germans","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In this German paper, issued from the office of the Liberal newspaper in Brisbane, there also appeared, during this time of war, a serial story called .  The Green Spy.

28,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FINLAYSON, William","KEX","N/A","N/A","N/A",9122,"- I wish to show who are the politicians in this country who are courting the German vote. Here is an appeal issued by the Honorable J. G. Appel, ex-Home Secretary of Queensland -To the Electors of Nundah.German Countrymen,As a candidate for the next election of a representative for the electorate of Nundah, I take the liberty of asking for your votes, and depend upon your support, because I am the son of a man whose cradle, same as yours, stood in the German Fatherland.To the most of you I am known since the days of my early infancy. As the son of a German farmer, I have always been so thoroughly impressed with the fact of my belonging to the German nation that I have made it my duty to learn the German language, and now speak and understand it.I believe that our beautiful colony must be settled with that class of farmer to whom my father and you belong, who have contributed more than anything else to bring the land to its present state of development.As you know, I have great interests in the country, and will, if elected, do my best to create prosperity. My services will be at all times at your disposal, and as I count nearly all of you as my friends, you cannot only speak to me as your representative, but as your friend, and in your mother tongue.That was issued about twenty years ago. May I remind the honorable member for Wentworth of what I said yesterday, that they laugh best who laugh last. This is what Mr. Appel says now -I was born in South Brisbane,In his previous statement he emphasized his fathers cradle in the Fatherland - and on the maternal side as a Queenslander of the second generation; my children and my grandchildren being of the third and fourth - a distinction enjoyed by but a small section of Queenslanders. I leave it to the House and my fellow British subjects of this State to say whether any stigma, imputation, or reflection can be cast upon my position as a British subject.That is another illustration of the attitude towards Germans of the political party opposite. To-day they denounce the Germans; previously they fawned on them, and flattered and cajoled them; and even now, when they are out for votes, Germans are fellow-countrymen and compatriots of theirs. In 1911, two dredges were required for Queensland. Tenders were not called, but seven firms were asked to quote. Messrs. Schichau, of Elbing, Prussia, were the lucky people, and £45,800 went direct to Germany. Tenders were not invited in Australia. Subsequently, a few other firms were asked to tender privately for a dredge for Cairns. The succesful tenderers were again the fortunate Messrs. Schichau, of Elbing, and another £42,000 went to Germany. Yet the men who were responsible for letting those contracts to Germany are those who to-day are most active in the advocacy of conscription and the denunciation of the Germans.","Appeals to Germans","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[15]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

30,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FINLAYSON, William","KEX","N/A","N/A","N/A",9123,"- Here is another translation of Liberal electoral matter published in the German organ in Queensland -The German voters of Queensland, and especially the workers, should not forget this treatment when they go to the polls next Saturday. The Labour party is desirous of obtaining the votes of the Germans to get the reins of government, and at the same time they allow their members to treat the German workers (who for the most part are unionists themselves) in such a manner. Do, then, the leaders believe that the German electors will, in these circumstances, vote for the Labour candidates? If so, they are on the wrong scent. To do so would be equivalent to Germans turning the other cheek. ... If the German voters in Maree, which, as is well known, is the safe refuge of Deutschtum (this word is translated according to Cassells Dictionary,  German spirit and manners, or ardent patriotism), in Brisbane, are on this occasion united, and do not split their votes, there can be no other result than the return of Herr Walsh as conqueror.The point of these extracts is that, at election time, the Liberal candidates and the Liberal Governments of Australia are pro-Germans, but when it suits them to advocate conscription they are most emphatically anti-German. In the issue before the war of a leaflet to Germans in the German language there was nothing wrong; there was nothing to which any one could take exception. It was a perfectly legitimate and reasonable thing to do and was done in every State by every party, but since the war began which party was it that published in the German language appeals for German support? It was the honorable members opposite.","Appeals to Germans","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But the honorable member who now with his customary appearance of candour, asks us to believe that some iniquity was practised by both political parties in the State of Queensland in seeking the votes of duly enfranchised citizens of Queensland, was one of the loudest supporters of the ex-Prime Minister when he announced the duty of the Federal Government towards Germans in our midst. I think that I may be permitted to refer to that statement by Mr. Andrew Fisher, the man with whom the honorable member for Brisbane always obsequiously toured Australia. Mr. Fisher was asked by an honorable member in this House whether, with a view to assisting recruiting, he would dismiss persons of enemy origin from the Public Service, and his answer was -The Government will do nothing of the kind. Those citizens of Australia within the law and complying with the law, and who are carrying out their duties as good citizens ought to do, should have extended to them the same consideration as our own people.

I refer to the reverend pastor mentioned by the honorable member for Brisbane, and I have to say that, owing to the fact that a large portion of his congregation were Labour, while some of them were Liberal, he never took . any part in politics. The assertion that that gentleman went around cany assing and advocating my return is absolutely without any foundation. It ought to be pointed out that for many years past, and, indeed, until the lady died recently, the Labour party in Maryborough employed a Miss Gehrman as their organizer, and another, a Mr.. Gehrman, in the same capacity. Then again, in Gayndah, the secretary of the Labour organization was a Mr. Schiber, another German. It has been said that I was returned on the German vote, but if Germans did vote for me, it only shows their common sense in giving me the support they gave to Mr. Fisher. I challenge any honorable member to say that, either on the public platform or by circular, I asked Germans to give me their vote. Such a denial is only just to me as a true and loyal Britisher, who not only has done all he can himself to help the Empire, but has sons, one who fought in Gallipoli and two are now fighting in Prance. Under the circumstances, I have the right to stand up and say that these gross, mean, contemptible insinuations are not worthy of the honorable member for Brisbane. At the last election for Wide Bay I heard from scores of people that the honorable member for Brisbane stood up in front of t>he Royal hotel, Maryborough, arid, before a large audience, declared that this is a capitalists war. What was the object of that but to keep people from enlisting - 4;o keep people from fighting for the Empire to preserve the liberties that .Labour adherents, as well as others, enjoy? Men like that are the very last who ought to criticise others who have undoubtedly shown their loyalty. I have shown mine in a way that the honorable member does not seem to be able to. Has he sent his sons to the war - those big .strapping fellows? No. He has not helped in the slightest degree.","Appeals to Germans","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is useless for honorable members opposite to endeavour to fasten pro-German views on those who take a different view of the situation, for such an attitude can only rebound on themselves. The honorable member for Wentworth made reference to a threat said to have been made by the honorable member for Brisbane in Sydney. I have made no such threat, and I am prepared to respect anything said to me in confidence. There is, however, a limit to this. When I hear gentlemen making statements on the platform that are in direct contradiction to statements which they have made in secret, what can be done to refute them? Either the statements made on the platform must be untrue or the statements made in secret must be untrue; and they must not be allowed to put those who disagree with them in a cleft stick.

The men who lived in the rebel year of 1848 were my teachers, and these were the men who, if they had their way, would not allow a kaiser or a king to exist, and who helped to drive the grandfather of the present German Emperor out of Berlin. Their sons and their sons sons I believe to be as genuine Australians as any born here, and unless they are proved to be guilty of disloyalty, it is only decency on our part to give them credit for loyalty. Their fathers left their country to escape the infamy of conscription, and we ought to treat them as good citizens, unless we find them unworthy of trust. There are guilty Germans who ought to be interned, but who are allowed to walk the streets of Melbourne simply, in my opinion, because they are possessed of wealth. I am now alluding to those connected with the well-known rubber company in Australia, one of whom was so contemptible that when he was naturalized and swore fealty, changing his name in the process, he must have been a spy. He was a major in the Forces, and, as a member of the Automobile Club, was gaining information about our roads ; and yet that swell frill and feathers club, the Army and Navy Club, allowed him to resign. That man ought to have been put in gaol, for internment is too good for him. There were two oaths and two pledges of honour given in this connexion, but his rich colleague in the company is drawing a big salary, and, just because he is a rich man, he can calmly smoke his cigar up Collins-street. The introduction of this subject this morning is most unfortunate, and I do not suppose there are three honorable members opposite who do not regret it. The honorable member for Wentworth spoke of the self-importance of the honorable member for Brisbane, but those who heard the former gentleman. in spite of all his advantages of a university education, beating the wind in an endeavour to cover up what he had said, must have thought they were listening to some barnstormer.

The Prime Minister was asked the date of the document when it was first produced, but he was conveniently deaf. There is, however, no escape for the right honorable gentleman, for the honorable member for Riverina, passing by him at the time, told him that honorable members had asked for the date of the document. However, neither the honorable member for Wentworth nor the Prime Minister were  game  enough to give the date, although it was on the document, not only in German, but in English.

Yet the Prime Minister has thought fit to have this document printed, and is not man enough to be present to hear the explanation, and I venture to say that he will never trouble to read the Hansard report. Is that the way to fight fairly ? Will the Prime Minister permit the explanation to be published in the same way as the document was published? The action of the honorable member for Wentworth is unworthy of him, and I am only sorry he is not here at the present moment. When the honorable member used a word sounding like  coward, he recalled to my mind a time in the Victorian Parliament when the late William Shiels assailed the late Sir James Patterson, and by using the words  cowered in a corner conveyed a meaning quite different from that of the words themselves. Just as if the honorable member for Brisbane would tremble at this whipper-snapper! It is laughable to think of such a thing. The honorable member for Wentworth, in the course of his remarks, said that he would do away with the German language if he could. The honorable member, as a university man, ought to know that, at the Melbourne University, no one is allowed to pass in modern languages in the Public Service examination without showing his proficiency in German. I regret that I cannot speak German. Had I been able to do so, I should not have been landed in a police office in Berlin in 1911 because of my friends bad accent. The German police were the only civil functionaries that we discovered on that occasion. A great American author has stated that most of the words in the English language are Saxon, which is the pure German tongue of the German race. Our university, some of whose professors are yelping as loudly ,as they can on the public platform, should give students the choice between, say, French, German, Italian, and Russian, instead of compelling them to learn German and French. I resent the compulsion to learn any language. The attitude in regard to modern languages is nearly, as bad as used to be the attitude in regard to ancient languages. God knows how many heads have ached and minds have wearied in the learning of Latin and Greek, which has been of so little use to those who have learned them ! I commend the honorable member for Brisbane for having defended himself, and I am sorry that the honor able member for Wide Bay got into the position in which he was placed. When a stone is thrown from the other side it is sure to rebound.","Appeals to Germans","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

What has occurred does not tend to increase the good feeling between honorable members. The honorable member for Wentworth loves to cause an outburst, and then to laugh and joke about it. He is never really serious. He made use of a word which sounded like  coward, but no one would accuse of being afraid, the happy-tempered, pleasant-minded member for Brisbane, who has always a smile on his lips and a laugh in his eyes, and can take the hardest hits good temperedly. Is there anything wrong in this appeal -Mr. Finlayson is a member of the Labour party, and he has loyally supported the legislation of that party which has extended the old-age and invalid pensions.A good many Germans draw pensions as a reward for many years residence in this country. Old souls in my district have told me that they regret the war, and hope to a man that the Kaiser will be eliminated with the short shrift of a rope. Is it thought that the Liberals would have brought in old-age and invalid pensions, or would have reduced the age limit to sixty years? How many times will it be necessary to make these walls echo with the statement that the honorable member for Flinders reduced the Victorian allowance for old-age pensions from £200,000 to £150,000 ?

It has troubled me very much since the beginning of the war that honorable members should consider the effect of their attitude towards the war upon the German vote. No nation can be safe whose representatives consider first the opinions of citizens of enemy origin. Our duty is to go straight ahead regardless of nationality. Roosevelt has said that he despises the man who has to be continually reminded of where he was born. That is my attitude. The honorable member for Melbourne said that the Prime Minister was conveniently deaf when asked to give the date of the circular to which the honorable member for Wentworth drew attention. As a matter of fact, there is no date on it, and the only clue to the date is the appeal to vote for the honorable member for Brisbane on the 31st May. We know that, in 1913, the Federal elections were held on that date. The honorable member for Brisbane has made a rather poor case for himself. His action reminded me of that of an innocent-looking fish which I once saw at a sea-side resort near Brisbane. On being touched with a stick, it scuttled away, leaving behind a cloud of inky fluid. The honorable member for Brisbane scuttled away, leaving a mess behind him. He threw out so much dirt in order to cover up something which may come out before the question is settled.Question resolved in the negative.","Appeals to Germans","ADJOURNMENT (Formal)","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The length of platform face fronting the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge is 720 feet.It will be noted that the length of 4-ft. 8½-in. standard train will be approximately 690 feet.The main station building is 100 by 48 feet. It consists of two floors. The ground floor contains refreshment room, waiting room, parcels office, and offices for ordinary traffic requirements. Provision is made for fenced yard on northern end of station, wherein is situated accommodation in connexion with the railway refreshment room and outbuildings. The second floor provides office accommodation for district officers and their staffs.There is a carriage shed to be provided for cleaning and stabling of cars for express trains.The goods shed is situated at the wharf, and has been erected some time.The brick facing for the platform has been completed for a length of about. 300 feet, and on the longest face approximately 700 feet has still to be done.Excavation for all foundations is complete, and about 75 per cent, of the foundations are laid. Twenty per cent, of the steel stanchions for the lower floor are erected, and 75 per cent, of the timber forms for concreting the piers on the eastern front of the building are erected in position; 2,200 cubic yards of stone are on the site for the erection of the building.Contracts have been called for practically all material for the station building. Tenders for joinery and timber and verandahs cantilevers, &c, have already been let.Timber, galvanized-iron, &c, are on order for the carriage shed. Work in connexion with preparing the site is now in hand.Brick and concrete only have been used.Estimated cost: - Station building, £16,000; platform, £1,950; carriage shed, £8,000.Cost to date is recorded as £1,001. This does not include cost of material for which tenders have been arranged, but represents actual work on the site at Port Augusta, as recorded by the costs accountant there up to a few days since.Norris G. Bell,Engineer-in-Chief and Acting Commissioner.Per Edward Simms.Submitted in response to Ministers request.I understand that in addition to the £1,001 already spent, tenders and quotations for material to the value of about £5,000 for station building have been accepted.So far as I can gather, the accommodation provided and the cost, judged by the standard of Victorian country junction stations, is not excessive.Walter D.

If the honorable member has information on the subject I shall be pleased to get it from him later on. I cannot get the information asked for in my third question,  What is the estimated number of evasions? I do not blame the Minister, because he had very short notice, which, however, was not wholly my fault. I have had on another matter a serious difference with the Minister. A wrong done to a man in the Income Tax Department was brought to my notice. I felt I would injure that unfortunate man by trying to get his case before the Minister. I mentioned that to the Minister at an interview, and do not blame him for being a little stormy. Possibly I deserved it. As I did not wish to injure the man, I bowed to the storm. I understand the man was accused of using departmental stationery by men who had got. into trouble in connexion with their income tax returns. The Minister showed me a letter on departmental paper which the man had used, in my opinion, wrongly; but if public servants were to be called to account for using departmental stationery or envelopes, about 95 per cent, of the Commonwealth servants would be in trouble. Later on, the Minister justly said that Mr. Nelkins answer should be made in writing, to which I agreed. Mr. Nelkin then left to make out his statement. I understand that a letter was then sent to him requesting that he should put in a sworn statement. That was the first time I have ever been asked to get a sworn statement from a citizen about a matter of which he had only a hasty knowledge through portions being read to him by the Minister. It is also the first time that. I have ever been asked that a trade unionist and Labour man should make a sworn declaration on charges that had not been put before him. He went to a magistrate, who wrote to the Treasurer for a copy of the charges that he was to answer on oath. I do not know whether all the charges were sent to him, for the Minister knows that I handed the case over to a senator in order not to prejudice the mans cause on account of the difference between the Minister and myself. i","Second Reading","ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is commonly stated that no tax imposed is the cause of so much lying, deceit, and injustice as is an income tax, although, with all its faults, it will be admitted that there is no better means of raising taxation. We have wisely, in our income tax legislation, differentiated more widely than has been done in Great Britain between incomes derived from land and property and incomes derived from personal exertion. I believe that honorable members are in agreement with me when I say that considerable difficulty arises from the fact that we have both Federal and State income taxes. Some procedure should be adopted to avoid the necessity for the making of separate returns for the State and the Commonwealth. I make the suggestion to the Treasurer that, at the earliest opportunity, he should frame regulations under which Federal income tax returns might be based upon returns sent in in connexion with the State income tax. This would save a very great deal of work. It would prevent the duplication of work by Government Departments. It would save time, paper, and postage.

In response to applications from honorable members, and from correspondents throughout the Commonwealth, the Government have agreed that elderly people who are now receiving pensions should not be called upon to undergo unnecessary suffering owing to the increase in the cost of living. Ministers, believe that the Commonwealth can pay the increase. It will amount to about £850,000. per annum. Time does not permit me to discuss certain economic considerations attaching to the payment of pensions, but one is the fact that payment of money to individuals by the State may affect the position of wage-earners. For instance, when an allowance was made in Great Britain to cover unemployment, certain employers took advantage of it to decrease the rate of wages. Any Government in establishing a pensions scheme must take into, consideration the possibility of certain individuals in the community taking advantage of the Government grant in order to make people work for lower wages.","N/A","INVALID AND OLD-AGE PENSIONS BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Provision should be made to meet the case of any person who, by reason of paralysis depriving him of the use of a limb, is unable to follow an occupation or earn sufficient to keep him. That person should be entitled to the invalid pension, but cannot obtain one through not being totally incapacitated from following any employment. It is very difficult for those who are incapacitated by paralysis to find employment. Employers will not employ them.

In a country district there are only the hospitals for the old-age pensioners to go to, and the Treasurer, by refusing to amend an anomaly in the law, makes a pensioner a beggar when he knocks at the door of such an institution. But the Commonwealth, having undertaken to provide old-age pensions, should not throw a pensioner back on the State when he becomes ill. The hospitals are willing to take charge of old-age pensioners, and are doing so, but they should be put by the Commonwealth in the same position as other institutions. When a pensioner goes into a public hospital he is deprived of his pension, and nothing is paid to the hospital for his keep. The Government did right in taking over from the State the business of dealing with old-age pensions, and it should not throw pensioners back on the States when they become ill. Our public hospitals are kept going only through the efforts of those who undertake their management without charge, and are supported by public contributions and small State subsidies. What I ask is that hospitals may be placed in the same position as benevolent asylums. Under the present law it is the big centres of population that benefit, because they are able to maintain benevolent asylums in addition to hospitals. Old persons very often hang round poor mining districts because of early associations, and when they become ill they must go to the local hospital for treatment. I propose to amend section 45 by adding the following proviso -Provided that out of the amounts so suspended and not paid to the pensioner by this section, a sum equal to 10s. 6d. per week shall be paid to the treasurer of any hospital in which such pensioner was an inmate, for the term during which the pension was not paid to the pensioner.Under that provision the pensioner would receive 2s. per week and the balance would go to the hospital.

Section 46 of the Defence Act provides -The Governor-General may, in time of war, by proclamation, call out the Citizen Forces or any part thereof for active service.The proclamation shall state the reason for calling out the Forces.If the Parliament is sitting the reason for calling out the Forces shall forthwith be communicated by the Governor-General to both Houses of the Parliament.If the Parliament is not sitting at the date of the issue of the proclamation, it shall be summoned to meet within ten days after that date.If the House carries this motion it will be deprived of the opportunity of discussing the proclamation and the reasons for it. I believe that the Government do not intend to call out the men under the Defence Act. I believe that they intend to use the War Precautions Act for the purpose, and thus avoid submitting to Parliament reasons for their action. They should adhere to the method laid down in the Defence Act, a measure which was passed in times of peace. At any rate, they should be candid enough to tell the House what method they intend to follow. I am raising no factious opposition to the motion, but I feel that Parliament should meet after the proclamation is issued. We have never had anything like this position in the history of Australia. We know that Che peculiar action that is to be taken on Monday is disturbing the minds of the people. The Prime Minister has told us that these men are not to be called up for home defence, but are to be prepared to go to the front if the referendum be in the affirmative. If that be the case, why make any pretence about the proclamation ? In view of the fact that it would be illegal to issue a proclamation with that object under the Defence Act, I am of opinion that the Government intend to resort to the War Precautions Act, and I do not think that is a fair thing to do in a country like this, when the matter might be laid before Parliament. It is a precedent which I should very much regret to see followed on a future occasion. I have approached both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, and, while from the latter I could get no definite information, the Prime Minister told me that he did not intend the House to meet next Wednesday.","N/A","SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

290,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"MATHEWS, James","KNH","N/A","N/A","N/A",9145,"- The honorable member, in asking that question, tries to look very innocent; but, while I am not aware of the opinion of individual Ministers, I candidly admit I  hae m doots. The Act distinctly says that the Governor-General shall give his reasons, per medium, of course, of the Prime Minister or Minister in charge at the time; and in the drafting and consideration of the Defence Act, both originally and in the several amendments made since, due consideration was given to the seriousness of issuing a proclamation of the kind. I well remember that, when the Defence Bill was before Parliament, honorable members on both sides were determined that no power should be placed in the hands of any Ministry to do as they thought fit on such occasions, and provision was made for a proper discussion of the matter by Parliament, as is shown by the fact that if Parliament is not sitting at the time it must be called together within ten days. Of course, in other Acts the Ministry very properly have the power to issue proclamations, the time being left to their discretion. This was the case in the amendment of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, when the age of the women pensioners was reduced to sixty, the idea being to allow the Government to issue a proclamation when in their opinion the finances of the country would permit of the change. The same sort of discretion might be left in the case of a Tariff change, it being left to the Government to say when, in their opinion, the inrush of foreign productions was imperilling the industrial life of the country. In the case of the Defence Act, however, that cannot be done, for the reasons I have stated. It would be quite possible for any Government, when the House was not sitting, to issue a proclamation which they knew would result in their overthrow had Parliament been in session. I desire to know from the Government the constitutional reasons they have for their action, for, up to the present, we have had no reasons of the kind. The Prime Minister told us that if, at the end of the month, 32,500 men had not enlisted voluntarily he would act under the sections of the Defence Act relating to home defence ; but as I have already said, he has also told us that the men are being called up, not for home defence, but in order to be trained for foreign service. That is a reason that could not be given according to the Defence Act. It is pretty evident that under the War Precautions Act anything may be done; and there is a case in point in the Government action in fixing prices, which had been declared ultra vires by Mr. Justice Griffith and Mr. Justice Barton. If Parliament has no power to do certain things, it certainly has not the power to delegate others to do them. If the Government may resort to the War Precautions Act to do anything they desire, it will not be long before we have martial law, and Parliament will not be necessary. Under martial law, or even under the War Precautions Act, the Government could deny the right of Parliament to deal with the finances, and take the management into their own hands. If honorable members permit the introduction of the thin edge of the wedge in this way, they, as caretakers of the peoples rights, are running great risks. I, for one, do not intend to take any risks, and, therefore, I voice my objection to the proposal before the House. The Prime Minister ought really to tell the House under what law he intends to make the proclamation on Monday, for it is only just that Parliament and the people should know. It requires no stretch of imagination to believe that, after the proclamation is issued on Monday, there may be great unrest in Australia. Indeed, it has come to my knowledge within the last hour that the unrest has already started, although no information of the fact has been made public in Melbourne. On Monday night, at Broken Hill, forty policemen, armed with batons, made a raid on a meeting. They knocked several men senseless, locked up a number of others, and, in the course of the trouble, batoned several women.","N/A","SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When the Government realizes that sane things are not injurious, they will get over their trouble. Those who have studied the history of the world know that Coercion Acts, and the prevention of free speech, so far from stifling any section of the community, have only given them greater strength, numerically and otherwise. The objects of these people may be foolish and ridiculous; they may be faddists, and have an idea of upsetting the Constitution by argument, but so long as they resort to no methods to bring about personal injury they ought to be allowed to voice their opinions. As I have said previously, magistrates who fine men £100, and sentence them to twelve months imprisonment, instead of inflicting the nominal fine of 1s. for a nominal crime, only show their unfitness for their positions. Every man knows that if you try to suppress public utterance you strengthen instead of weaken those whom you coerce. A Labour Government has no right to allow armed police, forty strong, to attack a body of men and women who are merely talking. If sabotage were being indulged in, if fire-sticks were being carried round, such interference might be justified; but no Government of any sense would use force, as was done in Broken Hill, merely to prevent people from talking. The presence of women at the meeting to which I refer was evidence that there was no intention to commit a riot. All that was intended was to utter the opinion that certain actions of this Government are inimical to the interests of the people. When the proclamation has been issued, and you begin to gather in the young men who will not join the ranks voluntarily, you will create the determination to resist, and no Government would have the right, under such circumstances, to prevent parents and sisters from expressing their objections to the compulsion that was intended.

The purpose of the adjournment is a public one, known to every citizen, and I can conceive of no reason which would better justify this adjournment than that which renders it necessary. We are adjourning in order that we may put before the people - the masters of Parliament, whose mouthpieces we are - our views on the greatest question ever submitted to the citizens of any nation in any age. If that cannot be taken to justify the adjournment, this Parliament must be regarded as- an undemocratic institution. A democratic Parliament should always reflect the opinions of the people. That is the essence of Democracy. Although the views of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports differ from mine, he will not deny that the question for the people to decide is one upon whose decision the destiny of the country may turn. No one will deny that the decision is fraught with grave import to the future of the nation. Parliament cannot continue to transact business while its members are addressing the electors upon the referendum. The people must have an opportunity to decide the question on its merits. We intend to dispel the mists of ignorance, prejudice, and misrepresentation that have been spread everywhere throughout the land. We are going- to put the case before the people, so that the humblest and most indifferent citizen may know what it is that he is to be asked to decide. I say, without hesitation or reservation, that we- can best serve the interests of parliamentary- government, and prove ourselves worthy to represent a free people, by adjourning in order to go. before the electors, who have the right to- demand the expression of our views on the great question that is to be referred to them. They are going to hear, those views.Now let me say a word about the proclamation. It might be thought from the remarks of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports that the proclamation is being issued without notice, whereas the intention to issue it was announced as part of the policy of the Government in my statement of the 28th August. It will be issued under powers derived from an Act that has been in force for fifteen years-. We propose to issue a proclamation under a law which for fifteen years, has been unassailed, and has, indeed, won the encomiums of every citizen during the- time that it was not necessary to exercise it, but which now, when it is necessary to show that there is some virtue in it beyond a mere doctrinaire assertion of the right to call upon a man to fight for his country, when it is no longer a mere platitude for use on the platform, but- a piece of practicable machinery to be put into- operation, we are told is a violation of the fundamental principles of Democracy. The nature and scope of this proclamation and the authority from which it derives its power are perfectly well known and settled. There remains nothing more to be done, since Parliament has been debating this policy for a month. The intention to issue the proclamation was perfectly well known when the Referendum Bill was before the House, and it was discussed at length. We hear sinister rumours as to what will take place outside. This is a democratic community ; the- majority are going to rule, and rule in a constitutional manner, and they are not going to rule in any other fashion. The laws of the country are to be observed. This law is no new thing that is being shoved down the peoples throats. It is a law approved by the general consent of all parties, and it has to be put into force at the most critical juncture in the history of the nation. If any section, in the community endeavours to snatch from the hands of the constitutional advisers of the Crown and the representative Government of the people the reins of authority, it remains to be seen who shall govern the country. But that is- a question which can be settled when the necessity arises. It is an issue which, perhaps, cannot be evaded. But I hope that common sense and loyalty, not only loyalty to the Empire but loyalty to themselves, will inspire the citizens of the Commonwealth at this moment. I hope that no man, no matter what his private feelings may be, no matter how much he may oppose the proposals of the Government, will endeavour to take the law into his own hands. I appeal to every person in this country to have respect for the laws for which he or she, as the case may be, is responsible. In this Commonwealth the laws are made, not by some dictator, not by some despot, or by some narrow clique who have snatched to themselves by some means the power to govern the country, but the whole body politic. There is no man whose circumstances are so mean but that he has a vote equal to that of the most powerful and wealthy in the community. Therefore, to revolt against the Government in those circumstances is to revolt against themselves. The citizens of a free country make its laws, and if they make them they must abide by them. When they like those laws no longer let them repeal them in a proper and constitutional manner. That is the position, and upon it this Parliament may safely stand. We are not going into recess. We do not propose to enjoy a period of leisured inactivity, but are going to brave the storms of popular criticism and to speak to the people that which we believe to be right. If there is any man in this House who seeks to stop us, who seeks to debar the people from exercising the fundamental rights of citizenship, let him so declare himself, but unless he does so, he is bound by the principles of Democracy to welcome, and not retard, the motion to allow Parliament to get before the people. So I say the Government have nothing to apologize for. We cannot, and we ought not to, deviate from the course we have laid down. It is a course compatible with the gravity of the situation in which we find ourselves and with principles of government to which all parties in the country have given their adherence. I hope that in this coming campaign members on both sides will remember that they are citizens of a free country, and that they will come to the consideration of this, the gravest question that has ever been presented to the citizens of any Democracy, in a spirit of pure reasonableness. I know that I should waste my breath in urging that counsel upon all men, but I do urge it upon those men who are entitled to he called Democrats and who by their acts prove themselves worthy of the privileges of citizenship in a free country. If we do that, whatever the issue may be, we shall have no cause to reproach ourselves. Whether the country assents or dissents upon this question, we at any rate will have done our duty; but if we endeavour to silence reason by abuse, and to cloud the real question by a thousand and one side issues, and to distract public attention and fill the peoples minds with vague and misleading ideas, then upon our head will be the responsibility. I, for one, am going to tell the people what I believe to be true and necessary. I have said over and over again that every member of the House has the opportunity to put his views before the public without fear and without favour. There is no restriction upon others, and there is none upon me. When we reassemble the issue will have been settled. Parliament will then have to meet the situation as it exists, and if we fight this battle honestly and fairly I do not think there is any one of us who will need reproach himself with the position as he then finds it, no matter what that position may be.","N/A","SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

So far as concerns the referendum which is to be taken. on the 28th October, I think the position is quite clear. It is in the highest degree unfortunate that the Prime Minister was ever deluded into initiating a policy of violence in this country, a policy which rests upon the violent seizure of Australian citizens for military service abroad. He has done that, and I intensely regret it. I believe, with other honorable members, that the vast majority of the people in this Commonwealth will repudiate the proposals and reject the referendum by a negative vote. That, however, relates to something which is to occur on the 28th October. What I should like some information upon, and that is a point which the Prime Minister has skilfully evaded, is the proclamation which he says it is proposed to issue at an early date. That proclamation is to be issued under powers which were vested in the Government by a Defence Act for what is well known as home defence. And although there are persons in this chamber now who would have us believe that there is no distinction between home defence carried on in a foreign country and home defence in Australia, there is not one of them but knows well that the Defence Act in its present form would never have been passed if that vital distinction had not been insisted upon.","N/A","SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If the distinction had not been recognised the principle of compulsion in the Defence Act would never have been accepted. Nay, there is scarcely a public man who would not have been hooted off the platform if he had dared to say that conscription under the Defence Act included compulsion of Australian citizens to go 13,000 miles outside the Commonwealth to fight in a foreign country. I have addressed myself at sufficient length already to that aspect of the question. But I wish to know where the Prime Minister stands in regard to this proclamation. Under the Defence Act he has power to call up the citizens of Australia for home defence, and if Parliament is sitting the reasons for that drastic and extraordinary action must be put before the House immediately. If the House is not sitting, so urgent is the matter that members must be called from the four corners of the Commonwealth within ten days to hear the reasons why the proclamation is issued. The Government are under a legal obligation to put their reasons before the House, and that obligation they propose to evade.","N/A","SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/speech[3]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If some special set of circumstances had arisen in Australia, if a state of war within the confines of the Commonwealth of Australia was threatened or impending, or if some special emergency was arising, the Prime Minister would have the right and the. power to exercise this extraordinary authority; but on the platform and in the House he has already stated that the object of exercising this special power, which was given to him for defence within Australia, is to yard men for the purpose of sending them outside Australia if, unfortunately, the people of Australia should give him the authority to do so. My belief is that the proposed proclamation is wholly illegal. It is said that the Governor-General may, in time of war; issue such a proclamation. What is the definition of war?

Is our danger of an attack on Australia greater to-day than it was when the legions of the Kaiser were rushing on to Paris; is our danger of attack greater than when the German armies were said to be triumphant on every front; or is it not a fact that the danger, so far as Australia is concerned, will be on this fixed date immeasurably less than it has been on many dates in the last two years? The Prime Minister has left the chamber without giving us any explanation of his proposed illegal act, as I conceive it to be. He has urged the people to a condition of mind of sweet reasonableness in regard to the whole thing, though he has initiated a policy which, as to the referendum, was conceived in violence and is proposed to be carried out in violence, and, as to the proclamation, proposes to throw the whole of the Commonwealth into a condition of chaos and confusion. The Prime Minister proposes to withdraw men from their occupations, and to throw industry and production into confusion. He proposes to bustle into camp a body of men, hundreds of whom will be physically unfit, and hundreds of whom will be exempted in other ways, and allow them to wait there while leisurely tribunals will determine whether they are fit to serve or not. I have never heard a more impracticable policy than that which was put before the House by the Prime Minister this afternoon in so airy a fashion. He asks us to accept it with sweet reasonableness. It is the very antithesis of sweet reasonableness, and, from its nature, will lead to confusion, chaos, and loss, and is bound to end in disaster.","N/A","SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/speech[3]/continue[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Then, as to the Naval proposal, which I had the honour to put through the House on the 24th November, 1909, it was set out that we were proposing to create a newPacificFleet,and I said -That is a plain unvarnished statement of fact. That Fleet is, as honorable members are aware,toconsistofthree squadrons, namely, one with its base at Bombay, another with its base at Hong Kong or Singapore, and another with its base in Australia.Provision was made in that scheme for these three divisions of the Imperial Fleet to manoeuvre together and to be away from Australia, either at Bombay or at Hong Kong, all working and training together for service overseas, and every trainee -entering the Australian Navy was to be prepared togo overseas wherever the ship was, and do his fighting in other parts of the world than our own. It is too late to-day to begin this talk that all our Australian war preparations have been for the defence of our own miserable skins here. That was never the intention of those preparations. On the contrary, the very genius of them, as well as the genesis of them, was for a quite different purpose. The training of the Navy was all to be standardized; the training of the land Forces was all to be standardized - man for man, gun for gun, and organization for organization.The whole of our Forces was prepared by Senator Pearce to be fitted in with the Imperial Army at any time, and in any place, and in any circumstances in which the Army was called for in the defence of the Empire.

The Prime Minister came down this afternoon and addressed us in a most excellent manner, cooing in sucking-dove tones, and I shall reciprocate his kindly attitude. But honorable members must have noticed the change in the right honorable gentleman. What Christian influence has been at work to bring about this change in our dear friend? He told us that we are all equal before the law, and that one mans vote is equal to another mans vote. That is all right if a man gets a vote. However, I know there is no election for me next year, and I am happy. According to the Prime Minister, there will be no abuse - nothing but argument and appeal to reason; and I hope honorable members note the fact. So far as. I am concerned, no man shall be able to say that, during the campaign, I have uttered one word of personal abuse. There was a time, I admit, when that was part of my vocabulary. Like the honorable member for Balaclava, I was brought up in a school where it was supposed to be an essential part of the curriculum. Now, however, I am beginning to think that such methods do neither oneself nor ones cause any good. If a man is fighting a righteous cause, he has no need to descend into the gutter of abuse, but may rely upon his arguments and the facts as he sees them.At the start of this Parliament, when I, together with the honorable member for Ballarat, was expressing opinions which have since proved to be largely correct, but which were hostile to. the . members on this side, who does not remember how the Prime Minister, when he felt himself strong and buttressed, not only by the support of the Opposition, but by the support of men on this side, spoke? Did the right honorable gentleman not travel up and down the country referring, in the most opprobrious terms, to men who, a little minority, held views identical with mine? Who were the .parasites and devils to be cast out? The Prime Minister, who now talks of loyalty, with no appeal to violence, and of all men being subject to the law, when he thought he could handle the organizations, urged them to fall with the ferocity of Bengal tigers on men who held views akin to myself. He went to England and came back to find that, in the meantime, rightly or wrongly, and for good or evil, there had grown up in this country a vast opinion which was not prepared to follow him. The Prime Minister was the first man in this campaign to resort to vituperation, and he has brought strong language upon himself.","N/A","SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/speech[5]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Postmaster-General assures me, however, that the necessary documents have not come from the Court. This is hard on men who had to wait some time before they could get to the Court. They will not now, be able to benefit by the award until after Parliament has re-assembled. It seems a pity that some effort . was not made to give these men their rights earlier. . Just as the . House was adjourning some time back, papers regarding another award were laid on the table. 1 understand that the original award applying to the . postal mechanics did not sufficiently emphasize the payments to certain sections, who were unable to get what they should . have got. The award has been, altered . to. give them their due, and . it is unfair that they cannot benefit by the -alterations -because -the necessary papers have not been laid on the table.

The fate of the sugar industry in Queensland is at stake. It has had a most potent influence on the settlement of the coastal districts of the State, and we need settlers. The Prime Minister said yesterday that the salvation of the country lies in men on the land. As far as my lights go, the Federal Government have the settlement of this question in their own hands, and in the interests of the industry and the people of Australia, it is their duty to deal with it at once.","Export of Metals - Military Service Proclamation - Postal Electricians - Referendum Campaign: Freedom of Speech - Sugar Industry - Use of Secondhand Bags - Censorship","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I notice that those persons are already preparing to evade that taxation, and to pass it on to the masses of the public. Unfortunately, the. great bulk of taxation in this country in the past has been passed on to the masses, and under the new proposals of the, Government, which I admit to be wise and sane,. I am afraid that the burden will be transferred to the general body of the public. I do not know whether the Treasurer intends to propose means by which this passing on. of taxation can be prevented. This matter has always presented a problem, and it will have to be solved- in some way, because the masses of the people cannot stand further burdens than they are bearing to-day.","Export of Metals - Military Service Proclamation - Postal Electricians - Referendum Campaign: Freedom of Speech - Sugar Industry - Use of Secondhand Bags - Censorship","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

363,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FENTON, James","KEV","N/A","N/A","N/A",9155,"- I have not a ready-made scheme to propound to-day, but I ask the Treasurer to take into serious- consideration the devising, of means to. prevent the evil of which I am complaining. Otherwise it seems to- me that it will be useless to pass new taxation measures; and, for my own part, unless I am assured that the great body of the people are not to have further burdens placed upon them-, I shall, not support some of the- proposals when the Treasurer introduces them. I hope that the Treasurer will make the meshes of his net so small that- those upon whom the. tax. is intended to fall shall not escape.Another- matter to which I wish to call attention is the peculiar position of some men who are in the service of the Commonwealth. An order was issued by the ex-Prime Minister (Mr. Fisher) that no promotions or appointments were to be made in the Public Service- during the- term of the- war. On the face of it that instruction appears very fair, because we do- not wish to penalize those public servants who have gone to the front. As far as is possible, the positions and promotions of those men must be protected. But we have a large body of men, particularly among telephone mechanics and others associated with postal work, who, though qualified for permanent appointment, do not know what day their services will be dispensed with. They have gone to considerable expense in qualifying themselves, and are- still attending technical schools, and to-day they are asking whether they are to continue doing this, to be- told later that their services are no longer required. Something should be done to give them a sense of security and permanence- in regard to their position. They may be preparing themselves for positions that will never be open to them, and then they will be obliged to start life afresh in a new sphere. They are ih an unfortunate position, and ought to be reassured by the Postmaster-General at the earliest possible date.In addressing the Chamber on the Referendum Bill, I expressed the hope that in the coming campaign a fair deal will be meted out to every man who takes the platform. Whether a man is a conscriptionist or an anti-conscriptionist, he should receive the same treatment from the press, in order that the people may arrive at a fair decision on the all-important question of compulsory service. The press will be acting unfairly to the people if they do not report at least some of the chief speakers on the anti-conscription side. Often it is the cutting down of speeches, and the consequent misrepresentation in the press, that irritates a large number of men, and makes them feel that they are not receiving that fair treatment which is essential in dealing, with a question like this. I should have liked to have seen the arguments for and against conscription published at equal length in a manifesto to the people, and if that had been done I doubt very much whether it would have been necessary for members of Parliament to take the platform in order to educate the people on the subject. It would have been a good thing if we could have refrained from platform controversy. Unfortunately, that is not possible, and the duty devolves upon all of us to endeavour to impress our convictions upon the public. In doing that I hope that we shall all so comport ourselves on the platform that, after the decision is given, we may return to our places with the feeling that we have done nothing to be ashamed of. We shall have done our best, and, whatever the verdict is, it will be for us as a Parliament to honour and abide by it.","Export of Metals - Military Service Proclamation - Postal Electricians - Referendum Campaign: Freedom of Speech - Sugar Industry - Use of Secondhand Bags - Censorship","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I wish to bring under the notice of the Treasurer a matter of much importance to the farmers. Producers have been under a considerable disability of late years owing to the high prices ruling for bags, and it seems to me that steps might be taken to permit of the use of the secondhand article. I believe that it would be possible to treat bags chemically, so as to render their use a second time perfectly safe. If the Treasurer will ask the Minister for Customs to look into this matter, it may be found possible, notwithstanding an answer to the contrary given by the Prime Minister to the honorable member for Calare, to do something in the direction suggested, and so give considerable relief to a number of producers.","Export of Metals - Military Service Proclamation - Postal Electricians - Referendum Campaign: Freedom of Speech - Sugar Industry - Use of Secondhand Bags - Censorship","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Finally, I offer my protest to conscription as we will have it under the proclamation to be issued on Monday. As the Prime Minister told us to-day, the provision has been on the statute-book for fifteen years, and it could have been utilized for calling up men for the defence of Australia for home service; but the assumption on which they are to be called up on Monday next is that, if the referendum vote is cast in a certain way, they are to be used for service abroad, and there is no essential difference between that method and calling up men for compulsory service outside the Commonwealth. Men will be called up in a way that is quite antagonistic to the democratic principles of the people of this country, and yet it is being done in the name of Democracy. We have had several dissertations from the Prime Minister, in which he used that glorious word Democracy, but next month we shall be engaged in a campaign in regard to a matter that violates every principle of Democracy. We are going to ask the people to vote on a matter which affects a section only, and which does not concern a great many of those who will go to the ballot-box. It -will affect the democratic spirit in another way, because if what has taken place so far can be taken as a guide there will be only one side in this great issue that will be able to put its case in an unhampered manner.","Export of Metals - Military Service Proclamation - Postal Electricians - Referendum Campaign: Freedom of Speech - Sugar Industry - Use of Secondhand Bags - Censorship","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/continue[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Many of the young men whose services will be required in the direction of repairing a great deal of the ruin that has been occasioned will have to present themselves to the military authorities on Monday ; and, owing to the number of Courts,, tribunals, and places of appeal that they will have to pass through, the war will possibly be over before they can get away again; because, if we are to be guided by the prediction of the Prime Minister, the war will be over by June next. I have already received letters asking me whether young fellows will have to present themselves on Monday next, and I know that there, is sadness in some of their homes, because, besides sustaining damage to their property, they have lost relatives through the floods. In addition to the injustice of the matter, their positions will be rendered very much worse by their having to present themselves to the military authorities at this particular time-.

There must be some misapprehension.

These matters, will not be insisted on- if the Treasurer, will: only proceed with the inquiry at once. The honorable member has asked the honorable member for Moreton whether the mill-owners and the cane-growers will consent to this arrangement. I have in my possession telegrams from the United Cane-growers Association and the Sugar-millers Association, stating that they are prepared to accept the appointment of the Inter-State Commission to hold this inquiry. There remains the third party - the labour employed. I do not see how the Treasurer can be sincere in asking any honorable member what the labourer wants. It is the cane-grower and the sugar-miller who have to provide the means for paying- for the labour. The labourer need- not work unless he gets the pay that he wants. The two parties who are interested in this question are the sugar-growers and- the mill-owners, and, as they have given their consent, I hope that the Treasurer will not delay this all-important matter, and that he will allow the crop to be taken off.","Export of Metals - Military Service Proclamation - Postal Electricians - Referendum Campaign: Freedom of Speech - Sugar Industry - Use of Secondhand Bags - Censorship","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The treatment of the soldiers in withholding their pay will also cause them to vote, against conscription.. These men are waiting for their money,, because their records have not been sent from the front; and, in the. meantime those who are unable to work have to beg for food in the streets of Melbourne. I must compliment the honorable member for Bourke on the fact that he was quite right when, in the early part of this session, he declared that the- Government, under the War . Precautions Act; had full power- to control prices. This was contradicted by the Prime Minister and other members of the- Government; and. on. their assurance I thought the honorable member for Bourke was wrong; and on that account I now tender the honorable member an apology. The Government now tell us that, under that Act, they have power to do anything, even to taking any mans liberty away.

Any censorship ought to be exercised all -along-the -line. In a leaflet issued -by -the Australian Peace Alliance, the censor -censored the word  merest  before the word  suspicion, -and also the word  jingoistic  before the word magistrate. Then, again, in the sentence, The suspicion may be baseless, the seizure unwarrantable, the last three words are struck out. The following part of the leaflet was . also censored : -Facts to FaceUnder this regulation the premises of theAustralian Peace Alliance were raided and searched by two officers, and thousands of copies of two leaflets -were seized and taken. They arc detained now, and the military authorities refuse . to return them or to give any information concerning them. One leaflet is by the well-known writer, John A. Hobson, and was published in England ;(in the Nation), andin Victoria, presumably with the censors permission. It is a striking article - it deals with -the question of peace - but the military . say that people shall not see it. The other deals also with peace, and was published in the Labour Leader. It is calledWomen and Children first. But our military authorities will -not allow it to be distributed here, and the public are at their mercy. The Socialist partys . premises have been raided and searched ; so, too, have those of . the No-Conscription Fellowship. Printed -matter was seized, and its fate is unknown. Boss, of the Socialist party, was accosted in the street . and threatened withsapertsonal search there and then; . and they have the power to-do this to any man (see Reg. 506) on the merest suspicion.If. some of this matter, which was written by Mr. . Hobson, is dangerous in Australia as a means of, . giving information to the Germans, . how. much more dangerous must -it be in -England, which is -nearer the -seat of war? Such censorship -must only tend to lower us in German opinion. The Argus, and, I think, the Age, piiblished a large portion of this circular, and it seems pitiable that a small newspaper should be confiscated, while others, with circulations in . the neighbourhood -of 100,000, are allowed to escape.Mr.Finlayson.- - The article to which I objected most -strongly in the Herald was never submitted to the censor.","Export of Metals - Military Service Proclamation - Postal Electricians - Referendum Campaign: Freedom of Speech - Sugar Industry - Use of Secondhand Bags - Censorship","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I -should now . like to . refer to the -censoring of a letter written to the Age by Mr. E. S. -Boss, the secretary of the Socialist party.

Wishing -to . help set -at rest -the rumours . current in Melbourne, T asked, . per wire, for definite information.

I say that a censorship imposed to -.prevent us giving tidungstto Germany is -being utilized to . prevent us giving tidings to each -other.The following was permitted : -Again the Prime Minister (also according to your columns) insists on but two restrictions as being operative in the censorship.The following was censored: -My experience in two papers as recent as this week proves otherwise.The following was permitted: -The censorship is a political censorship, applied to purely domestic politics. It is a censorship, also, which prohibits any discussion of itself as an institution. It is in operation exasperatingly vexatious-The next two words,  and insolent, were censored, but the remainder of the sentence was permitted - to any man taught, as I was taught, as an Australian, that it was a good and great national characteristic to think, and to dare to speak what one thought. It ought to be abolished forthwith.The concluding sentence, as follows, was censored -As a remedy it is worse than the disease.The freedom of our Australia, and the ease with which we occupy these benches, have caused dry-rot in the great Labour party. There is not the big fighting phalanx in the Commonwealth Labour party in this House that there is in the State House of Victoria, where they know how to fight. But I sincerely hope that an election will come, when we may present ourselves to the people who sent us here. I hope that we shall come back with a number of younger men to take up the work of us veterans, with all the fighting pluck that has been shown in the past. If the split and break comes, as I can see plainly it will, it may damage us for a little while; but we must remember that the man who scored the highest number of votes in Australia at a Commonwealth election, and who sought to break up the Labour party in Victoria, is now in political oblivion. If the path of the Prime Minister be directed to England, he will never come . back, though God knows many hearts would not pray for his happy return. If he does go, I do not know any man who could do more good there. It is possible that he might bring about some reform in the Conservative ranks, so that the 16,000,000 people who, up to the present, are disfranchised, may find themselves in the possession of votes, and cause the abolition of the odious system of entail, so that the . wealth of the country may decently contribute to the common weal of Great Britain and Ireland. But he wants to print the brand of slave upon every Australian, and force him to fight. Even in our school days, a boy who would not fight was not compelled to do so. Others might step into his place. I have every appreciation of the efforts of my fellow countrymen, who were sacrificed like cattle at Gallipoli because of the ineptitude and inability of leaders and generals. For a month or two the fleet was firing at the forts, giving the Turks notice to prepare for an attack, and yet they were not provided with sufficient men when they did attack. That brutal descendant of the traitor Marlborough, who starved his soldiers to put money into his pocket and took bribes from the King of France - Winston Churchill - has dared to say that the winning of the Dardenelles was a sporting chance. Why did not the cur go himself ? I hope to see him impeached for taking a sporting chance with human life. He tried to lull the men of the British Cabinet into a false security, which might have brought about the loss of the British Fleet. My reading of history, the knowledge I have garnered from those older than myself, the lessons I have learned from my teachers, tell me that never in the history of the world has a people put conscription upon itself by popular vote. Does any one think that if they were not compelled by conscription, the Germans would be fighting for l£d. a day ? Would the German Emperor have been able to make this war had not conscription provided him with millions of soldiers ? Would France, which has led the world in the arts and sciences, find men to fight, if it were not for conscription ? Would not they rather be tilling the fields- of their beloved country ? So with Italy and with Russia. It is not men who are wanted at the front. Any one with a knowledge of war will tell you that it is big artillery that is wanted. The war will be won, not by men, but by the blasting power of heavy ordnance. On the word of one who has been in three revolutions, and who has seen two Presidents elected, a consul now living in Melbourne, I say that the Allies could blast their way to Berlin in two months if they had ten heavy pieces of ordnance to every one possessed by the enemy. Any one who says that I wish to buy Russians to fight for Australia is a liar.","Export of Metals - Military Service Proclamation - Postal Electricians - Referendum Campaign: Freedom of Speech - Sugar Industry - Use of Secondhand Bags - Censorship","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1/speech[9]/interjection[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
