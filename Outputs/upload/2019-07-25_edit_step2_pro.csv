4,0,0,0,1,1,"Morton, Ben, MP",265931,"Tangney","LP","N/A",978," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.The Royal Commissions Amendment (Private Sessions) Bill 2019 enables the private sessions regime in part 4 of the Royal Commissions Act 1902 to be applied to other royal commissions. The private sessions regime was inserted into the act in 2013 to support the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse.Private sessions allowed that commission to hear from survivors and victims about their experience of abuse in a private and supportive setting. Participation was voluntary. The commission heard over 8,000 personal stories in private sessions.For some survivors, telling their story in a private session was the first time in their life they had told someone about their abuse. For others, it was the first time they had been heard by someone in a position of authority.One survivor told the royal commission: After 50 years I finally feel Ive been heard. People have listened to me before, but no-one has really heard me.The substantial work of that commission is well documented. The government is committed to ensuring it comprehensively and appropriately responds to that work. This includes the national apology delivered by the Prime Minister in this parliament, on behalf of all Australians, to the victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse.The chair of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, the Hon. Richard Tracey AM, RFD, QC, and the chair of the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability, the Hon. Ronald Sackville AO, QC, have told the government that private sessions will assist in their important duties.These are challenging and confronting royal commissions. They are tasked with identifying what should be done to improve the quality and safety of aged-care services in Australia and what should be done to prevent violence and abuse against Australians with a disability.These inquiries will help identify how systems can be strengthened to prevent and respond to this conduct in the future. Like the child sexual abuse royal commission, both inquiries are engaging with people about their experiences of mistreatment or abuse.Subject to passage of this bill, it is the governments intention to recommend to the Governor-General that both the aged-care royal commission and the disability royal commission are able to use private sessions.Private sessions are just one way that the royal commissions can gather sensitive and personal information from individuals. Their use can have implications for the constitution of a royal commission as well as funding implications.For that reason, the bill provides that private sessions are enabled through a regulation. That mechanism will require a discrete decision on whether private sessions will be useful for a particular inquiry.The bill largely preserves the framework for private sessions used for the child sexual abuse royal commission. However, some changes are proposed to supplement the way that a commission gathers information and to give more flexibility to a commission.However, limitations on the use and disclosure of information given at a private session will be retained. Sessions are conducted in private and are not open to the public. Private session information can only be used in a report if its deidentified or if the information is also given in evidence.Other limitations include a secrecy offence and a provision that overrides other laws that compel the production of records—for example, subpoenas. Information can be disclosed with the consent of the individual who gave the information.Private session records are also excluded from the operation of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and are treated in the same way as census records under the Archives Act 1983. That means that these records will not become publicly available until 99 years after the year the record was created. These limitations on use and disclosure are designed so that people are not discouraged from sharing their personal stories.Importantly, as private session information is not given on oath or affirmation, these provisions also serve to protect the privacy and reputations of other individuals.In practice, commissioners and members of the staff of a royal commission need to engage with individuals before and after their private session. Before a private session, a royal commission may need to gather preliminary information about the individuals story so that the attending commissioners or assistant commissioners are familiar with the persons situation.After a private session it may be appropriate for a royal commission to contact the participant to discuss any concerns arising from the private session and to offer counselling or support.To achieve consistent protections, it is proposed to apply existing limitations on use and disclosure of information obtained at a private session to this kind of information.For some, attending a private session to talk about mistreatment or abuse they have experienced may be traumatising. It is proposed that the protections will apply whether or not the private session is ultimately held.Under the model used by the child sexual abuse royal commission, only a commissioner could hold a private session. Under this bill, private sessions must be held by a commissioner unless the chair or sole commissioner considers that there are circumstances that justify authorising assistant commissioners to hold private sessions.Assistant commissioners must be appropriately qualified and senior staff members are to be authorised to hold private sessions. These individuals would be authorised by the chair of a multimember commission or, if an inquiry is constituted by a single commissioner, that commissioner.This provision is to give more flexibility to the commission. It may enable more sessions to be held, particularly in the case of a royal commission that has only one or two commissioners.Royal commissions are the highest level of public inquiry and are reserved for matters of significant public importance. The private session framework can be a very important format to supplement the way that a commission gathers information to complete its reporting obligations.Debate adjourned.","Royal Commissions Amendment (Private Sessions) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr MORTON (Tangney—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister and Cabinet) ","(09:32):"

At the same time, for transparency about funding for the balance of the year, we also introduced annual appropriation bills for scrutiny by the estimates committees.Following convention, the pre-election version of the annual appropriation bills then lapsed when the parliament was prorogued.The re-introducedAppropriation Bill (No. 1) 2019-2020, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2019-2020and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2019-2020, form the principal bills underpinning the governments budget.These bills are substantively the same as the bills of the same names that were introduced into the previous parliament in April this year.Minor changes have been made between the pre-election and post-election versions of these annual appropriation bills to reflect new machinery-of-government changes resulting from the Administrative Arrangements Order and new decisions made since the 2019-20 budget.Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2019-2020 seeks approval for appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of approximately $58.4 billion. The provisions in the bill seek authority for appropriations broadly equivalent to seven-twelfths of the 2019-20 annual appropriations and other measures. Together with the Supply Act (No.1) 2019-2020, this bill provides appropriations for the ordinary annual services of government for the full year of 2019-20.I will now outline the significant items provided for in this bill.First, the Department of Defence will receive just over $19.7 billion to protect and advance Australias strategic interests through the provision of military capabilities, the promotion of security and stability, and the provision of support to the Australian community in accordance with government direction. Included in this amount is funding to support ongoing major Defence operations, including operations OKRA, ACCORDION, HIGHROAD, RESOLUTE and MANITOU.Second, the Department of Health will receive approximately $6.3 billion to continue to strengthen health services for all Australians. This will include funding for: new medical research, including administration of the Medical Research Future Fund; better mental health and drug and alcohol support services, including the expansion of the national headspace network; further support for improved access to quality of aged-care, residential and home care services; and workforce priorities, improved access to medicines and implementing the Sport 2030 National Sport Plan.Third, the Department of Social Services will receive just under $5.6 billion, including funding for the Commonwealths contribution to the fourth action plan to prevent violence against women and their children, the expansion of the cashless debit card to tackle drug, alcohol and gambling misuse, and the establishment of the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability.Fourth, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will receive just under $3.2 billion to advance Australias international strategic, security and economic interests and to manage and distribute Australias official development assistance.Fifth, Services Australia will receive just under $2.7 billion to support individuals, families and communities to achieve greater self-sufficiency; and providers and businesses through convenient and efficient service delivery.Sixth, the Department of Home Affairs will receive just under $2.5 billion, which includes funding for national security, the management of noncitizens within onshore and offshore detention, facilitation of people and goods across the border, and the provision of refugee and humanitarian assistance.Finally, the Australian Taxation Office will receive just over $2.1 billion to manage Australias taxation and superannuation systems, including through helping people understand their rights and obligations, improving ease of compliance and access to benefits, and managing noncompliance with the law.

10,0,0,0,1,1,"Evans, Trevor, MP",61378,"Brisbane","LNP","N/A",984," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.This bill contains important measures making amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006.The bill will transfer regulatory oversight for offshore greenhouse gas storage environmental management and well operations from the responsible Commonwealth minister to the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, or NOPSEMA. Currently, NOPSEMA is the regulator for offshore petroleum environmental management and well operations.The reason for the division of petroleum and greenhouse gas responsibilities is largely historical. NOPSEMA did not have any environmental management functions in 2008, when the greenhouse gas regulatory provisions were introduced into the act. With the potential for an increase in greenhouse gas storage activities in future, there is a renewed focus on the adequacy of regulatory arrangements.NOPSEMA has developed expertise in the regulation of offshore environmental management and well operations through its responsibility for regulation of offshore petroleum activities. The Australian government proposes to transfer regulatory oversight for offshore greenhouse gas storage environmental management and well operations from the minister to NOPSEMA. This will ensure we have an experienced and independent regulator for offshore greenhouse gas operations. The proposal will be effected through a suite of amendments.The minister will retain responsibility for major resource related decisions concerning the granting of greenhouse gas titles, the imposition of title conditions and the cancellation of titles, as well as core decisions about resource management and resource security.The amendments in this bill will strengthen and clarify the powers of NOPSEMA inspectors to determine whether regulated entities are compliant with their obligations under the act and associated regulations.The amendments will expand and clarify the categories of premises that inspectors may enter without a warrant to monitor compliance with environmental and occupational health and safety obligations. This will include premises of a body corporate that is related to a titleholder—","Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[5]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr EVANS (Brisbane—Assistant Minister for Waste Reduction and Environmental Management) ","(09:56):"

12,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation",61378,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr EVANS: The amendments will expand and clarify the categories of premises that inspectors may enter, without a warrant, to monitor compliance with environmental and occupational health and safety obligations. This will include premises of a body corporate that is related to a titleholder, such as a parent company which may make decisions about operations carried out under the title. It will also include the premises of titleholders contractors, including entities who have agreed to provide response equipment in the event of an oil spill.The amendments in this bill will also enable inspectors to undertake inspections without a warrant to monitor compliance by titleholders with well integrity-related obligations under the act and regulations. These powers will be equivalent to existing powers that inspectors may exercise to conduct environmental or OHS inspections.In the context of a high-hazard industry, its particularly important that the regulator has sufficient powers to ensure that regulatory obligations are being complied with. Noncompliance may increase risks to health or safety or to the environment, with potentially serious consequences. The requirement to obtain a warrant may impede NOPSEMAs ability to conduct inspections. This is due to the difficulty in accessing offshore facilities and changes to titleholders operational decisions on the timing of well activities. The requirement to obtain a warrant may also impede NOPSEMAs ability to respond quickly in an emergency.Inspectors will still be required to obtain a warrant before exercising any powers to search for or gather evidence of contraventions of provisions.The bill further amends the act to introduce enforceable undertakings. This will enable the minister, the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator and the CEO of NOPSEMA to accept and enforce undertakings in relation to compliance with provisions of the act and regulations. The introduction of enforceable undertakings form part of a graduated enforcement framework.Although regulators currently have access to a range of enforcement tools, enforceable undertakings offer a unique benefit. Existing tools can require a duty holder to cease an activity or reach a minimum standard of compliance. Enforceable undertakings can go beyond these enforcement tools to effect meaningful changes to overall compliance culture.Enforceable undertakings allow the regulator to secure more timely and cost-effective outcomes than a prosecution. For example, a prosecution may take months or years to achieve a result, whereas an enforceable undertaking can require the duty holder to take steps to comply as soon as the undertaking has been accepted by the regulator. Enforceable undertakings remove the need for the regulator to pay the potentially sizeable costs associated with prosecutions. Undertakings also enable the regulator to tailor the enforcement response, taking specific titleholder and broader industry considerations into account.In accordance with a graduated enforcement framework, regulators will determine if it is appropriate to accept an undertaking given by a person, taking into account a range of factors. These factors include the circumstances in which the undertaking is given and the compliance history of the person giving the undertaking. The bill includes specific circumstances in which the regulator must not accept an undertaking in response to an alleged contravention of an OHS provision of the act or regulations. For example, the regulator must not accept an undertaking if an alleged contravention contributed to the death of another person or if the alleged contravention involved recklessness. These express limitations are considered to be appropriate in the context of a high-hazard industry.The bill was previously introduced into parliament on 28 March 2018 but lapsed when parliament was prorogued for the 2019 federal election. On 28 June 2018, the Senate referred the provisions of the bill to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee for inquiry and report. In its report, the committee recommended that a two-year review period for enforceable undertakings be inserted into the bill to ascertain if enforceable undertakings are the most suitable way of ensuring compliance with the act.The bill has not been amended to provide a two-year review period specifically to consider the effectiveness of enforceable undertakings. However, the government will ensure that this matter is considered within a suitable period after the commencement of the relevant provisions of this bill.The bill also amends the act to retrospectively designate particular areas as frontier areas for the purposes of the designated frontier area tax incentive, to correct a recently discovered historical administrative oversight.The DFA tax incentive was designed to encourage petroleum exploration in Australias remote offshore areas. It was active between 2004 and 2009. Under the scheme, the resources minister could designate up to 20 per cent of each years offshore petroleum acreage release areas as frontier areas. Where a permit was awarded over an area designated as a frontier area, the registered holder or holders of the permit could claim up to 150 per cent of exploration expenditure as a deduction for the petroleum resource rent tax, or PRRT.Under the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987, the resources minister was required to formally designate frontier areas in writing. Due to an administrative oversight, this requirement was not met for the 2005 acreage release. As a result, four petroleum exploration permits were awarded over areas promoted in 2005 as frontier areas which were not validly designated.This bill will amend the act to retrospectively designate these areas as frontier areas. This will remove any doubt that the relevant titleholders are entitled to the uplifted PRRT deductions. No persons will be disadvantaged by retrospective application.Finally, the bill makes technical amendments to the act to futureproof specific references in provisions of the act to regulations made under the act.There are several sets of regulations made under the act dealing with separate matters, such as safety, environmental management and resource management. Each of the regulations are scheduled to sunset over the next few years. There is a risk that current references in the act to the specific titles of regulations will become ineffective when the regulations sunset and are remade with a new title. The amendments made by this bill are necessary to ensure that the act does not need to be amended each time regulations under the act sunset and are remade, with associated risks to the ongoing effective operation of the act.Effective references to regulations are critical to the operation of a number of provisions of the act, including provisions which set out regulations subject to monitoring and investigation under the Regulatory Powers (Standard Provisions) Act 2014, and polluter pays and financial assurance obligations.The amendments will enable the titles of the regulations, or provisions of regulations, relevant to each affected provision of the act to be prescribed by regulation. When the title of a set of regulations changes as a result of remaking those regulations, the reference can be updated by regulatory amendment.Overall, this bill underscores this governments ongoing commitment to the maintenance and continuous improvement of a strong and effective regulatory framework for offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage. Further, it ensures the frameworks currency and alignment with international best practice.I commend this bill to the chamber.Debate adjourned.","Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[5]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[14]","N/A","N/A"

The amendments to the OPGGS Act will transfer regulatory oversight for offshore greenhouse gas storage well operations from the responsible Commonwealth minister to the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, or NOPSEMA.NOPSEMA operates on a fully cost-recovered basis through levies and fees payable by the offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage industries. This includes well related levies imposed in relation to petroleum titles. To ensure NOPSEMA can also recover the cost of its oversight of well operations under greenhouse gas titles, this bill will amend the levies act to extend the application of the well related levies to greenhouse gas wells.This bill also amends the levies act as a consequence of amendments, which commenced on 1 January 2016, made to well related regulations under the OPGGS Act, or the Wells Regulations.Prior to the amendments to the Wells Regulations, a new well operations management plan was required to be submitted every five years. The amendments instead provided for a single plan to cover all stages of the life of a well and required revision of the plan every five years. Currently, under the levies act, well activity levies are only imposed on applications for acceptance of a new plan. To ensure NOPSEMA continues to be fully cost-recovered, this bill will amend the levies act to impose a well activity levy on submission of five-yearly revisions of plans.The amendments to the Wells Regulations also removed the requirement for a titleholder to apply to NOPSEMA for approval to commence well activities. This bill removes well activity levies that relate to those applications.The bill also makes technical amendments to the levies act to futureproof specific references in provisions of the levies act to regulations made under the OPGGS Act. The amendments are equivalent in purpose and effect to the amendments made to the OPGGS Act by the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2019.Effective references to regulations are critical to the operation of a number of provisions of the levies act, including provisions which impose levies to fund the operations of NOPSEMA on a cost-recovery basis.I commend this bill to the chamber.Debate adjourned.","Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Amendment Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[6]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr EVANS (Brisbane—Assistant Minister for Waste Reduction and Environmental Management) ","(10:10):"

The government recognises that many people wish to return to their country of birth or to be with family and friends. (Quorum formed) Therefore, it is not unreasonable to expect a large number of Australian pensioners to retire overseas. In fact, Australia pays a pension to approximately 96,000 Australian pensioners who live overseas.It is a longstanding policy of successive Australian governments to recognise that Australian pension recipients have contributed to Australia and are not required to remain in Australia to participate economically and socially. Australia has international social security agreements with 31 countries that allow people who have lived part of their working life in Australia to claim an Australian pension while living overseas.The effect of this bill is that, from 1 September 2019, pensioners aged 80 years and over and residing permanently overseas will need to complete and return a proof of life certificate to continue receiving their pension overseas. This will confirm that Australian pensions are only being paid to pensioners who are still alive.The government estimates that approximately 25,000 pensioners who are aged 80 and over and live overseas will be required to provide proof of life. Limiting this process to pensioners aged 80 and over will minimise the administrative burden on pensioners, while helping to ensure that Australian pensions are only being paid to pensioners who are still alive.This measure is expected to help modify, where needed, the behaviour of some Australian pensioners and their families living overseas by reminding them of their reporting responsibilities. It is possible that there may be some misunderstanding by pensioners and their families overseas that Australian pensions may be bequeathed to, or inherited by, partners or family. Many overseas pension or national insurance schemes contain survivor or reversionary provisions that may be payable to partners or family.This misunderstanding can be compounded when a person is concurrently receiving pensions from Australia and another country, and the other pension remains payable to a widow or widower under the laws of that other country.The introduction of the proof of life process brings Australia in line with current international practice. Many other countries have regular assurance processes for people living overseas and receiving a pension from that country. For example, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, France and Italy all have processes to verify that a pensioner living overseas is still alive, including a requirement to complete a proof of life certificate.The measure proposed in this bill would require age pension, disability support pension, widow B pension and carer payment recipients who are aged 80 and over and permanently living overseas to complete a proof of life certificate every two years to continue receiving their payment. If a pensioner does not return their completed proof of life certificate after 13 weeks, their payment will be suspended. If the pensioner does not provide the certificate after a further 13 weeks, making 26 weeks in total, their payment will be cancelled.The measure includes safeguards to reinstate a living pensioners payment if they are suspended or cancelled. If the pensioner makes contact with the Department of Human Services and provides a completed proof of life certificate, the Secretary of the Department of Social Services or an appropriate delegate will have the discretion to reinstate the payment. A pensioner who has their payment reinstated will be paid any arrears to which they are entitled. This process will make sure only people entitled to an Australian pension continue to receive it, while minimising the impact on pensioners who do the right thing.To help protect against fraud, there is a requirement that the certificates are verified. Pensioners will have a range of options available to have their certificate verified. These may include, but are not limited to, a judge or magistrate of a law court, a medical doctor who is registered or licensed to practice in that country, or an Australian official at an embassy, consulate or high commission. This will provide overseas pensioners with multiple options for verifying their proof of life certificates, making this process as easy and practical as possible.This government is committed to maintaining a welfare system that is fair and sustainable. The measure introduced in this bill strengthens the integrity of the welfare system by making sure that Australian pensions are only being paid to pensioners who are still alive.Debate adjourned.","Social Services Legislation Amendment (Overseas Welfare Recipients Integrity Program) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[7]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FLETCHER (Bradfield—Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts) ","(10:14):"
17,0,0,0,1,1,"Fletcher, Paul, MP","L6B","Bradfield","LP","N/A",990," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.Today I rise to speak on a bill that continues the governments work on one of the most positive developments in welfare for decades and demonstrates our commitment to make a real difference to the lives of all Australians.The Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Cashless Welfare) Bill 2019 makes a number of important changes to the trial of the cashless debit card that operates in the Ceduna, East Kimberley, Goldfields and Bundaberg and Hervey Bay regions.The cashless debit card program is delivering significant benefits for these communities. The program has the objective of reducing immediate hardship and deprivation, reducing violence and harm, encouraging socially responsible behaviour, and reducing the likelihood that welfare recipients will remain on welfare and out of the workforce for extended periods.The program is showing positive results. There have been over a dozen pieces of research done on both the cashless debit card and income management programs. Most recently, the baseline report into the Goldfields trial site has confirmed previous findings, with its key findings including decreases in drug and alcohol issues, decreases in crime and antisocial behaviour, improvements in child health and wellbeing, improved financial management, and ongoing—and even strengthened—community support.These findings are not new. The independent evaluation released in late 2017 states that the card has shown considerable positive impact in the initial trial sites, including:41 per cent of participants surveyed who drank alcohol reported drinking less frequently;48 per cent of participants surveyed who used drugs reported using drugs less frequently; and48 per cent of those who gambled before the trial reported gambling less often.The most consistent themes across all of this research mirror those of the two pieces of research I have just quoted.The bill continues the operation of the cashless debit card program but improves the processes introduced through recent non-government amendments for participants to exit the program.The amendments were put forward by the opposition to the Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Income Management and Cashless Welfare) Act 2019 in April this year.The government agreed to include these opposition amendments to allow cashless debit card participants to apply for an exit from the program on or after 1 July 2019 if they could demonstrate reasonable and responsible management of their financial affairs as a primary consideration, taking into account a number of secondary factors.The amendments also outlined that the local community body is the decision-maker for those who live in a trial area where there is a community body. For other trial areas, the Secretary of the Department of Social Services is the decision-maker.Since this amendment was introduced, consultation in all four of the current cashless debit card trial areas have identified concerns regarding the exit process.The government is introducing this legislation, following these consultations with communities, to ensure that there is an effective, consistent and fair process for participants to exit the cashless debit card program, while also continuing our commitment to provide the best support to people, families and communities in places where high levels of welfare dependence co-exist with high levels of social harm.To improve the operation of processes for participants to exit the cashless debit card program, the bill proposes a number of reforms to the application process and decision-making framework.Firstly, the bill provides that the Secretary of the Department of Social Services is the decision-maker for all cashless debit card exit applications. Community body representatives have stated that they do not support the exit process as it is currently designed, particularly the role of community bodies as the decision-maker.While ongoing consultation and engagement on the impact of the new exit process will continue with communities, including community bodies, providing that the Secretary of the Department of Social Services is the decision-maker for all exit applications will ensure consistency and fairness for all participants in the program.The bill also broadens the criteria for the exit provisions to allow the secretary to take into account a persons ability to manage their affairs generally. For example, the bill will enable the secretary to require the person seeking to exit to not only meet the criteria based on financial grounds but also take into account matters such as contact with authorities for non-financial reasons, such as child protection or family violence issues.The bill also enables the secretary to require the person seeking to exit to be able to demonstrate that they are acting in the best interest of children, family and the community, such as positive school attendance outcomes.The development of this change followed consultations where stakeholders stated that any process to exit the cashless debit card program should be based on a participant meeting social norms, consistent with the objectives of the program, as well as the current criteria relating to the management of their financial affairs.It is critical that we listen to this feedback and ensure that the cashless debit card maintains its focus on reducing social harm.Finally, the bill also clarifies that exit applications need to be in a form that is approved by the secretary and makes a number of minor amendments to move the exit and wellbeing exemption arrangements for the cashless debit card program under one subdivision in the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, without any alteration to the existing wellbeing process.The bill will not change the effectiveness or day-to-day operation of the program. It simply proposes administrative amendments to the exit application process and streamlines legislative provisions around cashless debit card exit and exemption pathways in the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999.The government remains committed to the continuation of the cashless debit card to provide a strong social welfare safety net through reducing social harm in areas with high levels of welfare dependency and supporting vulnerable people, families and communities.I commend the bill to the House.Debate adjourned.","Social Security (Administration) Amendment (Cashless Welfare) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[8]/subdebate.2[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FLETCHER (Bradfield—Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts) ","(10:23):"

This is something which is absolutely extraordinary in this debate. There are 77 members of the government in this chamber. How many of them spoke? How many of them put their names to speak? How many of them had the courage to set out in this place why they think the medevac system should be repealed? There were none. Not a single member other than the minister—the minister who had to introduce this legislation—spoke. I ask members on this side and members opposite to have a look at his second reading speech and to think about how much he had to say in working through the complex and detailed arguments that go to providing medical treatment for people in need in offshore centres. His speech couldnt have lasted more than 90 seconds, and yet it remains the sum total of the governments position in dealing with this critical question. He didnt even make a contribution to the summing up on this bill.And let us remember that this is a bill that will not, that cannot, come before the Senate until November. The government, this opposition in exile, put this legislation in the House and then had nothing to say about it—absolutely nothing to say about it! Im concerned that there are members on the government benches who may have thoughts on the operation of this medical treatment process, who may have concerns about the governments agenda, but it is very disappointing that they did not embrace the virtues that they claim are part of the Liberal Party—the opportunity they have to speak their minds in this place, to put their values before the parliament.","Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[9]/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GILES (Scullin) ","(10:41):"

He hasnt set them out into the Hansard. He has used inflammatory and divisive language entirely consistent with the tone of the government the member for Cook leads. He had the opportunity to work through any concerns he had with the process. He chose not to do so. That is perhaps the most telling indictment of the governments position on this. It is all politics.Consistently, we on this side of the House have shown our determination to put politics aside, to make sure that sick people can get medical attention based on medical advice. Its a pretty simple proposition, isnt it?There is at least one doctor on the other side of the House who I would have thought would have had some views on this matter. It is disappointing that we have not heard from the member for Higgins. Perhaps she was not allowed to make a contribution to this debate. I think we could all have benefited from her views on the operation of medical treatment, particularly for children.

Why do we support this legislation? We support it because of our commitment to basic humanity. That basic commitment says that if someone is sick then you should look after them and give them care. It is a basic proposition that says that these people are our responsibility. Its a basic principle that you shouldnt just turn your back on suffering. Thats why we worked, and tried to work, across the parliament—and particularly worked with the crossbenchers—to achieve this outcome last year.The fact is that the only person undermining border security at the moment is the minister with his rhetoric. He sends a message each and every day, at every opportunity, that somehow legislation such as this undermines our national security and undermines our border security, when, in fact, he knows that this is not true. Then again, this is a minister who is an expert at inflammatory rhetoric. Its not surprising that, on other issues that are being debated in the national political arena at the moment, such as a voice to this parliament for First Nations people, the minister has stuck with the line that its a third chamber. Even the member for New England has reversed that position but, then again, he did walk out on the national apology. We should always remember that that was his response there.The minister knows full well that the border argument is nonsense. The legislation passed by this parliament only applies to the people who were already, at the time of the passing of the legislation, on Nauru and Manus Island. Anyone who arrives by boat, or attempts to arrive by boat, simply isnt eligible and isnt relevant for this legislation. Its as simple as that. That was a sensible proposition to ensure that—if there was any doubt about it—this legislation could not provide a pull factor. That is why this is simply not a fact from the minister.The way that the minister told it, the moment the medevac legislation was passed, the horizon would be full of an armada of boats. Remember that?They were all going to be here within days. Everyone on Manus and Nauru were going to be here and thered be an armada on the horizon.

But they had that extraordinary press conference in order to create fear and promote division. Of course, none of their rhetoric has matched the reality. Were now in July, some seven months after the legislation was carried, and what have we found? Weve found that, of those people who have been brought to Australia to receive medical assistance, less than 10 per cent of those have been brought under this legislation. More than 90 per cent were brought without this legislation. Ninety were brought here under this legislation, but pretty close to 1,000 people had been brought here already.The ministers own rhetoric is that the boats that have attempted to come here since this legislation was carried have been from the north. They havent been from the north; theyve been from the west. Theyve been from Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka had a devastating terrorist attack over Easter. In the wake of that there have been some boats arriving here. I dont know the motivation of people, because Im not privy to that. The government, of course, is privy to that, and so are journalists briefed by the government about these national security issues for political partisan purposes. What I do know is that those asylum seekers have been returned. Thats the governments policy. Thats Labors policy. Thats not an issue for this legislation whatsoever.Maybe the minister could actually have a read of his policy just to jog his memory about it. He could take up the Prime Ministers dictum of, How good is reading your own policy? Maybe that would be a good thing. When you have 1,000 people brought here by the government and only 90 going through the medevac process, its hard to see why the government is putting this position forward. Even for someone who appears to struggle with basic facts as much as this minister, the legislation is very clear. Its very straightforward. It allows for the minister himself to appoint the committee that makes the decisions about medical evacuations. Really, the ministers position on this is a vote of no confidence in himself because he appoints the committee that makes the decisions and he says thats a disaster, so the minister is calling himself a disaster in terms of his position. You would think that that had escaped his knowledge, but the legislation is working. It works as it was designed. A number of the objections have been upheld by the committee when the issues have been raised. Given that his committee has been a success, the minister shouldnt be coming here with this legislation. He should be giving himself a little pat on the back for doing so well. He could even practise his smile. Remember that? How good is the smile? Cheer up, son.

He said, When your politician starts preaching religion reach for your shooting iron. We have a basic mistrust of ideology. We find that ideology is usually at our expense when we live in a world where we have to grow something and produce something to get paid for it.This debate has always fascinated me. I have written and published a history book by Murdoch press. Kevin Rudd was kind enough to launch it to over a thousand people in Sydney and Barrie Cassidy was kind enough to launch it to over a thousand people in Melbourne.In that history book, I touched upon the refugee problem, particularly concerning Jewish people in Europe. There were seven million refugees at the end of the war and none of them got on boats to come to Australia. They were fleeing across the border for their lives, firstly from the Nazis and then from the communists. The poor Jewish people—our country will wear the black mark on its soul forever that we took 15,000 of those poor people and six million of them perished in the death camps. Well have to live with that as a nation. Some will say, You are doing the same thing again now. No, were not. These people fled in terror across the border to get away. This is not fleeing across the border. Theyre not fleeing from. They are going to.The Burmese that have fled are in Malaysia. The people in the Second World War were in Europe. Have a look at your globe. They are on one side of the globe and Australia is on the other side of the globe. Thats not fleeing from; thats going to.Where are they going to? People say, You know, your mob out there—Ive got at least one forebear that came from the Middle East. I come from an area where very heavily the Afghan camel drivers are most certainly huge numbers of our people—I might argue theyre the greatest of our citizens. So, whats different? They came to this country because they knew there was an opportunity to provide a service, have a business, make a lot of money and improve their lot. They came here and they knew they could make a contribution and make money out of it. Now, that is a hell of a difference from people that are jumping on a boat and going to Sydney and sitting on welfare. Well, youve got your chance. You can have your say, my friend, but youre the same mob that refused to let the Jews in. And, quite frankly, our policies at the present moment are not very partial to the Sikhs, the Jews and the Christians.If youre going to let people in from the Middle East and from Africa, surely, precedence should be given to the clearly identifiable persecuted minorities. The Sikhs, depending on who you want to listen to—4,000, or maybe 20,000, were murdered in one year in India and Pakistan. Surely the Sikhs—and I make no apologies for being their representative in this place—should be given precedence over someone who decides to get on a boat and travel right around the world to come to a nation where our welfare payments are $60,000 and theyre coming from nations where their income is $5,000. Surely, the preference should be given to the Sikhs, the Jews and the Christians—identifiable persecuted minorities from this area.Ive used the example of refugees—Burma, World War II. There are two nations—I have read about in the newspapers and the media—that do not take refugees in the Middle East. Those two countries are Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Theyre not going to take them. Saudi Arabia, the leading nation in the world promoting, defending and protecting the Islamic religion, will not take refugees. Why? Because there are grave dangers in taking refugees. And I can speak with authority, because the gentleman that walked out here couldnt sit and tolerate this.There were three people stabbed to death in the Kennedy electorate—this is not in Sydney; this is in North Queensland. The gentleman yelled out proselytising comments while stabbing three people to death in Clare, a farming area. One of them came back to life. The other recent mass murder was in Sydney, where, again, that person would fit into the category of refugees. So, you bring them in but you leave others behind and say: No. No Sikhs can come here, no Christians can come here, no Jews can come here, but well take these people any time they want to climb on a boat. You will live with the same shame and the same condemnation that those governments before the war lived with and our poor nation has to live with, because we, on racial lines and ideological lines, refused to allow those people to come to this nation.Why would you not leave those countries? Almost every single one of them is on fire. You would desperately want to leave those countries. And why wouldnt you want to go to a country with the highest welfare payments probably in the world?Ill make a political comment here. The ALP, according to the figures that have been provided to me, allowed 80,000 people to come in on refugee boats. So, anyone who decides they want to jump on a boat, under the ALP, can get in here, right? Youve got to think about that. There are some decent people on both sides of this parliament. To the decent people in the ALP, please think about this. If youre saying that anyone can get on a boat and come any time they feel like it, think about that. Why wouldnt the whole of Egypt climb on a boat and come over here? Its arguably the poorest country on earth, and it comes across to what should be the richest country on earth. Why wouldnt all of them come here?Now, under the LNP—and Im no great fan of the LNP; were about to have a big fight over industrial matters, but in this case I have to give them full marks—they have simply stopped that from happening. Before that, anyone who decided to get on a boat could come to Australia—80,000 of them. Under the LNP, no, you cant get on a boat and come here any time you feel like it. Everyone in this parliament wouldve seen decent people that wanted to come to Australia get knocked back. We can only take so many people, so weve got to knock some back. But you dont have to be knocked back if you come on a boat, if the ALP is in power.I plead with the good people in the ALP to think about what Im saying. If this medevac act is fair dinkum—and I dont know if the report is correct; I have no way of verifying it, but Id appreciate it if the minister would verify it. According to TheSydney Morning Herald, I think,there were 332 applications, out of some 400 people on the island, the day after the medevac bill got passed or put into the parliament. Immediately they saw it as a way of getting into this country, simply as a ticket. People that could climb on a boat, knowing they could come here, came here but got caught. Now theyve found theres another way of climbing on a boat and getting here. Its called medevac.As a person who has published a history book, as an aspiring historian with a great knowledge and love of my country—as I hope everyone else here has—I would say that we have the shame of what happened before the war. Six million Jewish people were murdered. Hitlers first preference was for them to leave. He ordered them to leave, and no-one on earth would take them. We wouldnt take them. And I hate to say it, because my family are very strong people— (Time expired) The question is that the bill be now read a third time.","Migration Amendment (Repairing Medical Transfers) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[9]/subdebate.2/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KATTER (Kennedy) ","(10:56):"

42,0,0,0,1,1,"Albanese, Anthony, MP","R36","Grayndler","ALP","N/A",1002," This is, indeed, uncontroversial legislation but theres been anything but an uncontroversial lead-up to it being presented in this parliament. It must be said that some of that lead-up has not done a great deal for Australias standing as good neighbours to one of the newest nations on the planet. But Labor will, of course, be supporting this legislation because it is critical, as we move forward with our friends in Timor-Leste. Indeed, I am looking forward to travelling with the Prime Minister to Timor-Leste next month for the 20 years commemoration of the popular consultation which led to Timor-Lestes independence. The treaty enforcement will be an important component of that.It is important that this legislation pass the parliament during this fortnights sitting so that the Prime Minister and I can indicate to the leadership and, importantly, to the people of Timor-Leste that Australia does indeed mark that commemoration as friends, not as people in conflict over what is the absolutely critical single factor in economic growth and, therefore, an improvement in living standards for the people of Timor-Leste.The treaty replaces the treaty and joint administration arrangements between our two nations made in 2003, and the treaty recognises new maritime borders for Timor-Leste. We on this side of the House are proud of the role that we played as a political party. Of course, many people in the Australian Labor Party—I think of my friend Robert Tickner and many others—played a very long role. I think of Laurie Brereton, of the member for Lingiari and of the member for Solomon and the critical roles that they have played. The former member for Page, Janelle Saffin—a very close friend of the leadership and people of Timor-Leste—and, indeed, the member for Sydney, who was shadow minister for foreign affairs, raised the issue of ensuring that Australia behaved honourably on these issues.While Timor-Leste now has the petroleum rights within its maritime boundaries, it recognises Australian oil and gas companies current operations in the Timor Gap. The treaty allows for a Greater Sunrise special regime area to be established. That includes the Sunrise and Troubadour gas fields. The special regime area will be jointly administrated by Australia and Timor-Leste, with a revenue-sharing arrangement expected to benefit Australia by between $2 billion and $8 billion over the life of the resource. Two international areas will also be implemented for gas pipeline corridors. The government will introduce a tax amendment to the treaty bill that ensures that no Australian company will be worse off because of the treaty. The treaty demonstrates Australias commitment to international law and rules, Australias intention to have robust bilateral relations with Timor-Leste and to jointly develop the Greater Sunrise gas fields.Labor warmly welcomed the signing of the historic treaty in March 2018 between our two countries, establishing their maritime boundaries in the Timor Sea. The treaty brings to an end more than 40 years of uncertainty over our shared maritime border and vindicates the strong position taken by Labor to take decisive steps to settle our dispute with Timor-Leste. Labor believes the maritime boundary dispute with Timor-Leste strained our bilateral relations and that it was very much in the national interests of both our countries to resolve this dispute in a fashion which didnt see a winner and a loser but saw a winner and another winner. We believe that this is what this legislation codifies. Were therefore very pleased that this treaty is the first ever to be achieved by conciliation under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.Australia and Timor-Leste have agreed that, from the date that the treaty enters into force, Timor-Leste will receive all future upstream revenue derived from petroleum activities from the Kitan oilfield and Bayu-Undan gas field. Previously, both Australia and Timor-Leste received benefits from revenue derived from petroleum activities in the JPDA, including these two fields. In addition, Australia and Timor-Leste have agreed that the Buffalo oilfield, which previously fell within the continental shelf of Australia, will fall within the continental shelf of Timor-Leste and that Timor-Leste will receive all future revenue from that oilfield.The development of the Greater Sunrise fields is expected to yield significant revenue over the life of the project. The divergent revenue estimate of $2 billion to $8 billion is dependent on the terms of the development concept that is still to be agreed between Australia, Timor-Leste and the Greater Sunrise joint venture for the development of the Greater Sunrise fields. The exact financial benefit to Australia will depend upon a range of factors, including this concept, as well as the economics of the project and prevailing market prices for oil and gas.In the previous parliament these bills were referred to a committee and evidence was provided that the length of time required for a treaty that recognised Timor-Lestes claims to be negotiated and signed had in some quarters undermined Australias international standing. It is important that Australia is recognised as a trusted partner with our closest neighbours. The Australian government has had six years to work on the treaty and now there is timing pressure to pass the bills before those 20th anniversary celebrations. Yesterday the government introduced tax legislation to ensure that the treaty can come into force. Labor has agreed to not send the tax legislation to a committee, because we want to make sure that there is speedy passage of this legislation over the next fortnight. It is, indeed, time critical. It shouldnt be viewed that this is a precedent for how we deal with tax legislation. We recognise this as a one-off occasion. It is in our national interest that this occurs.It is important to recognise though—and I say this to the new Leader of the House, whos struggling with the procedures before this House—that these bills were first introduced on 28 November last year and were not dealt with in the 45th Parliament. It is up to the government to prioritise its legislation. I suggest they prioritise legislation based upon the national interest rather than play politics. This is a good example of bills that should have been an absolute priority. Labor will ensure that they go through.Ive been very pleased to have an association on a personal level with Timor-Leste. Tom Uren was my father figure and mentor. Tom was captured in Timor in World War II before he went on what he called his tour throughout Asia, which included the Burma-Siam railway, Changi Prison in Singapore, and Japan, where he saw from a distance the second nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki. He never forgot the support that Australian troops were given by the people of what we then called East Timor. Australia has particular obligations to this fledgling nation because of the sacrifice that they made to assist Australias troops during our darkest hour in World War II when our nation was under threat. Australia hasnt always repaid that debt in an appropriate way. This legislation does that.When Tom passed away, having received the highest honour from the government of East Timor—the Order of Timor-Leste medal—the government issued a release describing him as a man of dignity and courage, who always stood up. The one memorial in Australia to the troops who were captured in East Timor—and its a joint one acknowledging the sacrifice of the people of East Timor—is in my electorate in Marrickville Park. Its unfortunate that there is not more recognition of what occurred.In June I appointed the member for Solomon to head our special regional trade task force of the caucus to work with the shadow minister for trade and to work with caucus colleagues. That will focus on trade links with the Asia-Pacific region. It is particularly important that we increase our engagement with Timor-Leste, as well as with Papua New Guinea—and I got to meet the PNG Prime Minister earlier this week—Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia.There is a real prospect of us being good neighbours in terms of how we deal with them. We need to deal with them in a way that is mutually beneficial to our economies. We live in a region in which we are seeing an explosion in the growth of the middle class. The growth in our region is the fastest economic growth that we have seen at any time in human history, including the Industrial Revolution that spurred Europe into dominance for a long period of time. That pales into insignificance compared with the growth were seeing in our region at the moment. We need to be good neighbours. We need to recognise the opportunity that is there to assist our neighbours, particularly assisting people to get out of poverty. That is in our interest. It is also in our economic interest and our interest in the way that we stand in the world, our place in the world, to be good neighbours. Because its gone through a conciliation process rather than the big guys trying to use their power over the little guys through economic dominance, this is a very good thing indeed. I commend the legislation to the House, I thank the shadow minister for the work that he has done and I look forward to being in Timor-Leste next month.","Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019, Passenger Movement Charge Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019, Treasury Laws Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Leader of the Opposition) ","(11:17):"
43,0,0,0,1,1,"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP","8K6","Hunter","ALP","N/A",1004," I begin by congratulating the Leader of the Opposition, who just demonstrated here in this place his deep understanding of the people of Timor-Leste, his deep understanding of the relationship between our two countries, his very strong knowledge of the history between our two countries, his deep commitment to further developing and strengthening our relationship and, most importantly, his remembering what the East Timorese people have done for Australia in the past and the importance of remembering and acknowledging that whenever were engaged in conversation or negotiation with our near neighbour.Next month, as the opposition leader reminded us, our friends to the north will celebrate 20 years of independence. Its a source of joy for all of us that this treaty will be ratified in time for the celebration of that occasion. As the opposition leader indicated, Labor will not ask again for this bill to go to any committee process, because we want to ensure that it is ratified in time for that very important celebration.As the opposition leader also said, this is an uncontroversial bill, but the path to securing this place has been anything but uncontroversial. Weve been too long arriving here, and as a nation we have to be frank and say we have not covered ourselves in glory. Its been a rough road, a tough road and a long road. Like the Leader of the Opposition, I want to acknowledge some people in our party who have played significant roles in bringing us to this point today. The first is my good friend Laurie Brereton, the former member for Kingsford Smith, who in my view pushed the greatest shift in foreign policy in this country that weve seen since the Second World War but did so from opposition. In my view, that is an extraordinary achievement. As the Leader of the Opposition did, I also acknowledge the member for Sydney who, as the shadow minister for foreign affairs, recommitted Labor and redoubled our efforts to ensure that the treaty negotiations were put back on track and absolutely committed us to subjecting ourselves to international legal arbitration and to accepting the outcomes of that arbitration and conciliation. It was something, sadly, the Howard government refused to do.As defence minister, I had the very good fortune of visiting East Timor on more than one occasion. My last visit there was on 6 March 2009, and it was a particularly rewarding one. I was joined by then Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao to officially open the specialist training wing for the East Timor defence force, which we had built for them. We flew by helicopter to Metanaro and opened that facility, and it was most rewarding to know we were doing such substantial things to assist them in their efforts to keep stability in the country and to protect their sovereignty as a nation. Of course, that defence cooperation program was not begun by the Rudd government; it was well and truly commenced by the Howard government, and I acknowledge that. There was good work done by both the major political parties on that front.I just want to acknowledge a couple of other people. First of all, there is the member for Lingiari. I have with me, just by chance, speeches by the member for Lingiari that go back to 1987. I spoke about the Leader of the Oppositions full comprehension of the history of East Timor, both the positives and the negatives, the happy and the sad. But, in my view, no-one in this place would have a more comprehensive understanding of the issues and the people of East Timor than the member for Lingiari, who has been a very solid defender of their interests in this place for all of that time. Not all his words have necessarily been totally consistent on every occasion with the policies of the Australian Labor Party, and I give him very great credit for that. Its something of which he should be very proud. Over that time he has scoped well beyond the issue of maritime boundaries to the complexities of our relationship with Indonesia, the role of oil and gas companies—particularly throughout the 2000s—our attitude on the maritime boundaries and our intervention through the defence forces. Of course, the member for Lingiari was the Minister for Veterans Affairs when I was the Minister for Defence. Hes had a deep-seated interest in these matters for many, many years.The Leader of the Opposition referred to the enormous assistance that the East Timorese gave Australia throughout the course of the Second World War. He reminded me that, in 1942, the 2/2 and 2/4 independent companies—now known as the commandos—were well known to many Australians who were actively engaged in East Timor. But he also reminded me that some 40,000 East Timorese lost their lives throughout the course of the Second World War. That should be something thats always at the forefront of our minds when were entering into negotiations with our near and, of course, very, very poor neighbour. It is a country with, we all trust and hope, a very bright future. But it is a country still very much in its developing stage. It is a country that will have a lot of work to do if it is to meet our aspirations for it and, of course, its own peoples aspirations for their own country.I also want to mention the member for Solomon. I was just referring to the commandos, and the member for Solomon is himself a former member of the commandos and, of course, the Australian Army. Hes done his country great honour with his contribution as a soldier under the Australian flag, but he continues to make a contribution towards our relationship and towards the growth and prosperity of Indonesia here, as a member of parliament. Indeed, his brother, Lieutenant Colonel Dan Gosling, is currently serving in East Timor. His family has made a magnificent contribution.Im not going to read into the record the technical details, because the Leader of the Opposition has done that for me by taking the opportunity to speak first. For those listening in galleries, Im going to try to simplify what were trying to achieve with these bills, which will give effect to or ratify a treaty, a treaty which has been 15 years at least in the making.Below the oceans, in the gap between our two countries, are very, very rich oil and gas fields which will deliver in the future great revenues to a very poor country. But for many, many years, weve had a dispute about who owns those revenues. Weve had various attempts to change the boundaries in a way which delivers a better outcome for the East Timorese people. So, obviously, if a gas field, or oil field, on one side of the boundary is closer to Timor-Leste, its their revenue. If its on this side of the border closer to Australia, its our revenue.There are two approaches to where those boundaries historically lie. Theres the idea of using Australias continental shelf. There is still a land mass beyond our seashore or taking an equal distance approach—that is, the halfway line between the two countries. We, for many years, took a continental shelf approach, which delivered more ownership for Australia at the expense of the poor fledgling nation of Timor-Leste. It gets more complicated than that because, for a period, we had a joint development area which was a sharing arrangement. However, finally this treaty will give effect to a new boundary which is much closer to Timor-Leste—sorry, the other way, actually—and will put more of the resources into the area of that underground land mass which falls into the jurisdiction of Timor-Leste.This treaty will give them enormous amounts of revenue—probably more than we ever give in foreign aid. It will give them a new source of independence. Its very, very good news for them and its very good news for us because what we are doing today is honouring what we say about our own approach to the international community, our approach to social justice and our approach to fairness and equity. Its exactly where Australia should be, and we can all collectively be proud of where weve landed with the consideration of these bills.The oil and gas industry is a very, very important one to Australia. Im very proud to be, once again, serving as the Labor Partys spokesperson in this area. I said at a petroleum and gas function here in Parliament House last night that the Leader of the Opposition has put me in this role as a clear signal to the industry that we support it, we acknowledge its importance and we recognise its amazing contribution to the economy and to jobs in this country. I intend to ensure that that is Labors very strong message and that we will continue to produce policies conducive to facilitating more and more investment in the sector and therefore more growth in the sector, more output in the sector and more jobs in the sector. Im very happy, in terms of doing that work, to have the member for Burt assisting me as the assistant shadow minister with a particular focus on Western Australia—Western Australia, a resource-rich state, critical to our national economy and a state in which we want to help further develop revenue opportunities in the near and the long-term future. I was very, very happy to attend a celebration last Wednesday night in Perth, hosted by Shell, where we marked the occasion of the first shipment of LNG from the Prelude project—a massive undertaking. Its a project now providing very significant jobs in the west, adding to the economy and providing much-needed gas to both Australia and the rest of the world.We need to be facilitating more gas exploration and exploitation in this country. Our economy—our manufacturing industry in particular—desperately needs supplies of gas. As a parliament, we need to be facilitating, at every opportunity, the further exploitation of those valuable reserves.I said last night that sometimes government can get in the way by doing things but government can also get in the way by not doing things. Our reluctance to extract more gas from our ground is a threat to our local economy. For example, dragging out decisions on tenements can be almost as bad as denying applications for further exploitation. We need to be very, very aware of that and conscious of it. We do need to work with state jurisdictions to ensure that, while we apply the most stringent environmental tests and put the appropriate hurdles in the way of these projects, we dont put the hurdles so high that they become unviable. This is not just important for our economy and our manufacturing sector but also important to households in Australia who desperately need affordable supplies of gas to their homes. The only way were going to put long-term downward pressure on consumer prices and prices for businesses is to get more supply into the market, and its absolutely critical that we do so.Going back to the bill, the Leader of the Opposition made the point that there will be amendments to our taxation arrangements to ensure that no Australian company is disadvantaged by the changes to the maritime boundaries. Well do so by ensuring that the capital expenditure can still be deducted into the future, even though there wont be revenue sources from those same areas of investment—thats very, very important. The opposition supports those changes. There are also changes to the passenger movement charge, which make absolute sense. On that front, well be supporting those changes. We are very pleased, after a long and unhappy period of time, that the government is now putting these issues to bed. I wont have the opportunity to be there celebrating, as will the Leader of the Opposition, the 20th anniversary next week. I would dearly love to be there.My engagement with the people of Timor-Leste, both here and in their own country, leaves me with very, very fond memories. They were all very, very happy occasions. They are a wonderful people and they deserve to be given every opportunity to meet their aspirations and the aspirations of the international community for them. Lets hope that, together, we watch them rapidly grow and prosper over the coming decade. Theyve certainly earned that right. The road to independence, of course, wasnt an easy one. In fact, it was a violent one and an unhappy one, involving at one point the attempted assassination of President Ramos-Horta. They were very, very difficult times. I very fondly remember spending some time with the now Prime Minister—the chief of the defence force at that time. Im just going to call him TMR, as most people do, because I have no idea how to pronounce his name properly, so I wont try. But I could see in his eyes, each time I had a conversation with him, the pain of many years in the jungles fighting for his people, and it was a wonderful thing to see him now in uniform, heading, at that time at least, the defence force. Hes a remarkable person and a person Ive developed a great deal of respect for.So, we all look forward to the ratification and the celebrations. It will be a good day for Australia, but it will certainly be a good day for Timor-Leste.","Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019, Passenger Movement Charge Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019, Treasury Laws Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FITZGIBBON (Hunter) ","(11:31):"
44,0,0,0,1,1,"Gosling, Luke, MP",245392,"Solomon","ALP","N/A",1008," I want to acknowledge the Labor leader for his contribution to this debate on the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019 and related legislation, and also the member for Hunter. Hopefully well hear from the member for Lingiari, my colleague from the Northern Territory, whos had a very long history working in solidarity with the people of Timor-Leste and supporters of Timor-Leste in Australia to assist in getting us to the position were in today where we can have a fairer treaty thats a credit to both nations. The Labor leader acknowledged my friend Janelle Saffin, formerly the member for Page in this place. I really got to know her through my time working in Timor-Leste, and she did an enormous amount to get us to where we are today.Theres a lot of history in these bills, which Ill refer to later. Ive been very privileged to be part of Timors story in more recent years through a time of development, through a time of restoring their independence. As the member for Hunter said, my brother Daniel is a lieutenant colonel in the Australian Army and is currently the team leader for the Defence Cooperation Program in Timor-Leste and continues to do a great job over there. I might be a bit biased in saying that my brothers doing a great job, but he really is. As a Portuguese and Tetum linguist, he was one of the first troops ashore with INTERFET 20 years ago, and hes there again now, continuing to assist the F-FDTL become a professional force and helping them to establish their own international peacekeeping capability, which is very important and a great credit to all of those countries and of course a great credit to TMR—Taur Matan Ruak—whom the member for Hunter mentioned was a guerrilla leader who became the chief of their defence force and is now the Prime Minister of Timor-Leste.So theres a lot of history here, and it would be remiss of me not to point out and get onto the Hansard some of it that we can be less proud of but also some of it that we can be extremely proud of. Kim McGraths book Crossing the Line: Australias Secret History in the Timor Sea sets out Australias role in negotiations with Timor-Leste over the maritime boundary between the two nations and, sadly, the bullying tactics Australia used to gain greater access to the oil wealth in the Timor Sea. Allegedly, these tactics went as far as the installation of listening devices in the room used by the Timorese negotiating team during the 2004-05 negotiations on the Sunrise field.The principal negotiator for Australia during this period was the foreign minister of the time, Alexander Downer, a former member of this place. McGrath describes how Downer pounded the table as he bluntly warned that Australia could leave all the Timor Sea resources where they were until he got his way. That period—and I was in Timor-Leste in that period—did great damage to our relationship. Alexander Downer at the time said, We dont have to exploit the resources. They can stay there for 20, 40, 50 years, whilst the Timorese tried to rebuild their country, one of the poorest countries in Asia, very dependent on that oil and gas revenue. The former foreign minister, Mr Downer, then retired from politics in 2008 and set-up a lobbying company with certain petroleum companies as his clients. Im glad that weve moved past that. Im very proud of the role that Labor has played to getting us where we are today, where the bills before the House give effect to a treaty between Australia and Timor-Leste recognising the extended maritime boundaries for Timor-Leste and making new arrangements for petroleum development and revenues.These bills go a long way to repairing our relationship with Timor-Leste, a relationship, as weve heard from the Labor leader, in which Australia has not always acted with honour.We did sign a new treaty in March of 2018, which did bring to an end more than 40 years of uncertainty over our shared maritime border. It also vindicated the strong position taken two years earlier by Labor under the leadership of the then deputy leader, Tanya Plibersek, the member for Sydney, where we took decisive steps to settle our dispute with Timor-Leste.I think it is worth reminding the House of what the member for Sydney said on 10 February 2016 at the National Press Club. The member for Sydney said:If we want to insist that other nations play by the rules, we also need to adhere to them.We have a good record in doing so, but not a flawless one.Timor-Leste suffered decades of war and starvation before gaining independence. Australia played a key role in securing that independence – a proud moment for many Australians.The maritime boundary dispute has poisoned relations with our newest neighbour. This must change, for their sake, and for ours.A Shorten Labor government will redouble efforts to enter good-faith negotiations with Timor-Leste to settle the maritime boundaries between our two countries.If we are not successful in negotiating a settlement with our neighbour we are prepared to submit ourselves to international adjudication or arbitration.It is in the national interest of both Australia and Timor-Leste that we do so, but just as importantly it is in the interest of the system itself that we are willing to freely participate in it.That address to the National Press Club was a result of many, many peoples efforts, and certainly the leadership of the member for Sydney on this issue, to get us to that point which provided the catalyst which changed the nexus of this issue and got us on a path towards the treaty being signed.I also wanted to mention the efforts of our current shadow minister for foreign affairs, Senator Penny Wong, who reconfirmed Labors commitment to multilateralism and a rules-based international system, and who said at the time of the treaty signing:We believe all nations benefit from abiding by international norms. If we want to insist that other nations play by the rules, we would adhere to them.We, of course, therefore are very pleased that this treaty is the first ever to be achieved by conciliation under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea. Now that that treaty has been signed, bringing certainty over this region in the Timor Sea—north of my electorate in Darwin—well see the development of the Greater Sunrise gas field for the benefit of both Australia and Timor-Leste. Ive indicated Labors position, and I am very pleased that the signing of this brings to an end more than 40 years of uncertainty over this maritime border.I also want to mention quickly another aspect of the bill, which was alluded to by the member for Hunter, and that is in relation to the passenger movement charge amendments. I just want to make a quick ad: the Australian carrier that you can fly to Dili with, Airnorth, flies from Darwin to Dili daily. They currently have great tourism packages where you can fly to Darwin and then go over to East Timor, have a tour and stay in great accommodation. In addition to the oil and gas industry, the tourism industry is going to become a really sustainable part of Timor-Lestes economic future. So I commend travelling to Timor to everyone, with a warning: once you travel to Timor-Leste, it gets under your skin and youll be going back again and again. My friend and former boss Jose Ramos-Horta—the former prime minister, foreign minister and President of Timor-Leste was one of the people I worked for when I was there—strongly believes Timor-Leste coffee to be to some form of aphrodisiac. So that is just a quick warning. Yes, its true. Indeed, thats from Jose Ramos-Horta, and Im not making it up.Just quickly, I want to acknowledge some of the people that introduced me to Timor-Lestes history. It has been a great privilege to get to know that country and people over the last 20 years. Ive worked over there in a variety of roles. I established a charity in Timor-Leste; we built schools in the mountainous and isolated regions of Timor-Leste, education being such an important part of their future. Maternal health—maternal morbidity and mortality—is a serious problem in Timor-Leste. Its improving slightly, but it requires more focus from us. I was proud that we ran maternal health education programs in the districts of Timor-Leste.Serving in the Australian military, with the Timorese military, gave me an appreciation for the resilience of those people who lived and fought in the hills of Timor-Leste to restore their independence over those very difficult decades when they were very much isolated and werent receiving much support at all. But some that were supporting the East Timorese during those difficult years were the veterans of the 2/2nd and 2/4th independent commando companies—Australian soldiers, like Paddy Kenneally.I want to acknowledge Paddy and his family—his lovely wife, Nora, and their children. Over the decades, Paddy never forgot the assistance that he was given by the East Timorese people. Hes gone to God now, but Paddy used to always say that the Australian soldiers in East Timor would not have lasted five minutes in 1942 without the assistance of the Timorese people, who sheltered them and fed the commandos in the hills as they conducted what has come to be known as one of the greatest examples of guerilla warfare in modern times.With the assistance of the Timorese, a couple of hundred Australian commandos, at the height of the Japanese occupation of Timor-Leste, kept 20,000 Japanese soldiers away from places like the Kokoda Trail, where those Japanese troops could have been very important and might even have led to the Japanese taking Port Moresby. Many people dont appreciate the importance of the Timorese support to Australia during those very difficult years. In fact, the bombing in my electorate, the bombing of Darwin, was to stop the counterattack on the invasion of Timor-Leste. The invasion of Timor-Leste occurred on 19 and 20 February 1942, and the bombing of Darwin on 19 February 1942 was very much to stop us from going into Timor. A couple of hundred Australian commandos, with the assistance of the Timorese, fought on there without assistance for many months. But one thing they were always gutted by was the fact that we had then gone and turned our back on the people of Timor-Leste.Im very proud to say that coming up is not only the 20th anniversary of them reclaiming their independence but also the 20th anniversary, on 20 September, of our Australian-led INTERFET force going back into Timor-Leste and helping to restore order, which, of course, led the way for the new nation of Timor-Leste to start self-governing. We wish them all the best. I want to again say how much I support this bill for both of our nations.Debate adjourned.","Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019, Passenger Movement Charge Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019, Treasury Laws Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GOSLING (Solomon) ","(11:50):"

46,0,0,0,1,1,"Martin, Fiona, MP",282982,"Reid","LP","N/A",1011," Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is an honour and a privilege to address this House today as the new member for Reid, and I thank the people of Reid for the trust they have placed in me to represent them. As the federal member for Reid, I have been elected to serve and advocate on behalf of my constituency, and it is a privilege to serve a community that I grew up in and that I will now raise my family in.I would like to acknowledge the Wangal people of the Eora nation, the First Peoples to inhabit what we now know as the Division of Reid, and I pay my respects to all Indigenous elders past, present and emerging.It is hard to believe that it was only two months ago that I was standing alongside the many volunteers who supported me and the campaign as we watched the results pour in from across the electorate. The campaign was a whirlwind. I found myself facing a five-week sprint to the finish line against an opposition who had campaigned for over 12 months. There were many people who believed it would be impossible to run a successful campaign in such a short period. Others simply could not understand what would motivate me to enter the race at all, especially at a time when meaningful engagement with our democratic system is as its lowest in generations. I believe that, as Australians, we should celebrate our democracy. We are privileged to have the opportunity to cast a vote in our nations elections and to take part in our nations debate. Our democracy is made stronger by the participation of more Australians in political conversation, and, as a member of parliament, it will be my priority to engage with as many voters as I can to ensure the voices of our quiet Australians in Reid are represented in this place. I have always believed it is honourable to serve your community and your country. We must be the change we wish to see. We must be willing to put up our hands to serve, and thats what I did. I am proud to be the first female member for Reid and to work alongside so many accomplished women in this parliament. It is so important that women are represented in all levels of government, because women can bring a broader range of issues to the table and can use different methods to problem-solve, and that can only make us stronger.There were a number of key factors that led to our convincing win in May. The first was good leadership. The Prime Minister led us to victory through his strong convictions, through his humility and by placing the Australian people front and centre. He sought to rebuild the nations trust in our political system by elevating the voices of quiet Australians. I can say with confidence that the strongest leadership is marked by authenticity, respect and a desire to serve—to place the needs of the public at the centre of every decision and debate. This is exactly what it means to truly serve your community.Good leadership requires one to be fixed on a goal but flexible on the details. As Sir Robert Menzies remarked in The Forgotten People speech, the ingredients of a good leader are flexibility of mind, constructive capacity and marked judgment. And as Australias longest-serving Prime Minister, he was clearly onto something. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has truly modelled this transformational leadership not only for our party but for our country. Today I honour the clear vision and drive he has demonstrated and will no doubt continue to demonstrate as leader of our nation.During the campaign, the majority of Australians were able to see the difference a strong economy makes. Investment in key infrastructure and services, delivering personal income tax cuts and support for small businesses and families were significant issues that needed to be addressed. And what a strong start as a member of parliament to be part of a government that has already delivered on tax cuts and is getting on with the work we were elected to do.As a small-business owner myself, I understand the hard work that goes into running a business, the pride you have in delivering your products and services to the community and the challenges and risks that small-business owners face. Reids thousands of small businesses are as diverse as our cultural heritage and theyre often family owned. As a government, we have never doubted the value of small businesses. Only we truly understand that small businesses are the backbone of the Australian economy and we can promise to never take for granted the business community or the jobs it provides.The electorate of Reid is named after the Right Honourable Sir George Houston Reid, a former Premier of New South Wales and the fourth Prime Minister of Australia. Like me, George Reid believed in liberalism and understood the importance of free trade and the benefits of free enterprise in building our countrys prosperity. Reid is a beautiful electorate to live in, to do business in or just to visit. It stretches from Drummoynes marina to its most western point in Silverwater, from Rhodes on the Parramatta River down to Strathfield. Its bustling urban setting is balanced by stunning waterfronts and green spaces. Reid is home to sprawling parks such as Bicentennial Park and historic sites including the Arnotts Biscuits factory in North Strathfield. Of course, Reid has flaunted itself on the world stage through its world-class entertainment and sporting facilities at Sydney Olympic Park. I remember, as a student of Rosebank College, standing with my peers in the early nineties at Homebush as we heard, And the winner is Sydney! and all the celebrations of the 2000 Olympics that followed.Reid is a corridor that links Sydneys eastern CBD to the growing western CBD. It was just over a week ago that I joined the Deputy Prime Minister and the NSW Premier in the opening of the first stage of WestConnex, a core piece of infrastructure that our city has needed. Im looking forward to improvements to Homebush Bay Drive and working with local families and businesses to tackle other local traffic blackspots to get us home sooner and safer.Im proud the coalition government has invested so much into local sporting and community infrastructure. I am passionate about sport and what sport offers to young people and Im so pleased that I live in an electorate where local sporting groups such as the Strathfield Strikers, the Inner West Suburbs Netball Association and the Wests Tigers offer these exact opportunities to youth. I am looking forward to continuing this work.Education is the pillar of our society. Effective school and family partnerships are necessary for children to develop, learn and thrive. Id like to acknowledge the outstanding government, Catholic and independent schools in Reid. It is our committed teachers and parents that make up our school communities and nurture our future leaders.It is important to acknowledge the role our heritage and personal history have in shaping our ways of leadership. My grandparents in particular were outstanding examples of everyday, ordinary leaders—leaders who served their families and communities.As the granddaughter of migrants, I understand the hard work, sacrifices and, in many cases, trauma, that motivated millions of people to come to Australia to build a better life for themselves and their children. My papou, Mark Barbouttis, migrated to Australia in 1926 from a small Greek island in the Aegean Sea, Kastellorizo. He would become a small business owner, trained in the Australian Air Force and eventually represented his local community as an alderman. His wife, my yiayia, Mersina Manettas, also from Kastellorizo, arrived a little later, in 1947. She lived through occupations and bombings, eventually became a refugee of the war and migrated to Australia in search of a better life. She and my papou had a desire to create a new home for their family in Australia.Australia is one of the most successful multicultural societies. We have become one of the most culturally diverse, yet socially cohesive, nations in the world. My electorate is one fine example of this—made up of people from different cultures, languages and religions. I have said on many occasions that being the member for Reid is like traveling around the world in one day. We have migrant communities from China, Korea, India, Italy, Greece, Lebanon and so many more, and the diversity of our people is visible in our streets. I have great admiration for those who, like my grandparents, uprooted their lives to make a go of it in this lucky country. It takes strength, resilience and courage to show that sort of leadership in everyday life.As a Liberal, I believe in the rights and freedoms of all people, including freedom to practice religion, culture and beliefs without intimidation or interference, as long as those practices are within Australian law. We respect and celebrate our diversity. And in the words of former Prime Minister John Howard, we should look to the things that unite us rather than the things that divide us.While Reids cultural diversity makes it unique, I have seen everyday leadership modelled through the strong veterans community that exists in our electorate. The service and sacrifice of our service men and women has shown Australia that leadership is not about obtaining authority or power, but is through exerting mateship, resilience and courage. When I look out of my office and see the Burwood War Memorial Arch, I am reminded of this. Concord hospitals historical ties to the Australian Army during the Second World War remind me of this. When I visit the Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway in Rhodes, I am reminded me of this.My maternal grandfather, George Kenneth Dashwood, was 18 when he and his brother James enlisted in the Australian Army. During World War II, Poppy Dashwood was stationed in Darwin with the Australian Infantry Battalion before being discharged five years later. His brother James had a more harrowing fate, becoming a prisoner of war in Changi, Singapore. Their stories are part of our veteran communitys collective story that again, to me, encapsulates what it means to be a leader.When I reflect on my years growing up in Reid, my education was instrumental in giving me the tools to be a good leader. After finishing school, I completed a degree in government and psychology—an odd combination at the time, but clearly something was emerging. My love of politics started at about 18 years of age when I joined the Young Liberals and became involved in student politics. During this time, I was surrounded by other young people who wanted to make a difference, many of whom remain friends to this day and supported me through the campaign, and some of whom sit in this place today.The values of the Liberal Party which I identified with as a young adult will pave the road I will walk during my time in parliament. I stand with a government that nurtures incentive and encourages aspiration. I stand with a government that protects the fundamental freedoms to allow democracy to flourish. I believe a society built on these principles is a strong society—one where we can protect those who may be vulnerable.During the completion of my PhD at the University of Sydney, my academic mentor, Emeritus Professor Susan Hayes, instilled in me the scientist-practitioner model and the importance of evidence based medicine, as well as the significance of early intervention in all aspects of disability and mental health policy. Consequently, much of my research has focused on early intervention for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, people with intellectual disabilities, improving the accuracy of childrens eyewitness testimony and the important area of resilience. Resilience is the foundation for good mental health.Resilience is key not only to our individual mental health but to the wellbeing of our society and our democracy. Our ability to recover from setbacks through flexibility and fortitude is necessary in federalism as much as it is necessary in our day-to-day lives. Good fiscal management is not in opposition to providing evidence based health services and supports, but rather it is the means through which it can be achieved. One of the biggest challenges our country faces in the 21st century is the mental and psychological wellbeing of our citizens. My professional career as a psychologist has infused me with a strong desire to see all Australians realise their full potential, develop resilience and better cope with lifes many challenges.I come from a unique position. Ive been a clinician for over 15 years and an academic researcher, and I am now a member of parliament. I have the opportunity to bring this experience from the front line to contribute to policy to help close the evidence-policy gap. The need for innovative research and a strong policy agenda represents one of our greatest opportunities and challenges in the field of not only mental health but health care more broadly. Placing an emphasis on prevention and early intervention is the key to addressing an array of mental health conditions so we can combat the many societal issues that arise from poor mental health.It is a tragic statistic that suicide remains a leading cause of death for Australians aged between 15 and 44. Few among us have not been impacted by suicide. It has become a silent epidemic. While the link between suicide and mental disorders is well established, many suicides happen impulsively in moments of crisis, with a breakdown in the ability to deal with life stresses. We must recognise that some groups are at greater risk. Suicide rates are higher among men, among Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander people and among our veteran communities.By far the strongest risk factor for suicide is a previous suicide attempt. Those most at risk are the people who have recently been discharged from hospital. And this is where effective discharge plans, follow-up care and support are vital. Suicides are preventable with timely, evidence based and often low-cost interventions. This is why our government is providing greater support for all Australians needing mental health and suicide prevention services. It is our national priority to work towards a zero suicide goal, and I look forward to using my professional skills and taking an active role in the work that must be done to reduce our suicide rates.Poor mental health often affects more than just the person and can have a terrible impact on those around them. Prioritising mental health is at the core of addressing a number of societal problems in this country, but particularly domestic violence. Living free of violence is everyones right and reducing violence is everyones business. We must continue to make reducing violence a priority. All forms of violence against women and children are unacceptable in any community and in any culture.We must acknowledge that women and children are far more vulnerable to family violence, often, tragically, leading to fatalities. More than three million Australian women have since the age of 15 experienced violence by an intimate partner. Police respond to a domestic violence incident every two minutes. People who witness partner violence as children are two to four times more likely to experience partner violence as adults.Since 2013 the coalition government have invested $840 million on programs and services for survivors of domestic, family and sexual violence. I commend the government in particular for its 1800RESPECT service, offering a one-stop shop to support Australians who have experienced or are at risk of experiencing domestic violence. Investment in womens and childrens safety is critical to the wellbeing and success of our nation.While intervention and recovery services for victims are absolutely essential, if we want to substantially reduce domestic and family violence, we must see domestic and family violence as a mental health problem. I am proud to be part of a government that has invested more money into mental health than any other previous government. However, scientific evidence should take a greater role in informing our decisions when it comes to mental health and domestic violence. There will always be more work to be done.Before I express my gratitude to the people who supported me I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge my Labor opponent. I wish him all the best in his future endeavours.Id like to thank my predecessor, Craig Laundy, the former member for Reid. He had been a strong and passionate voice for our community since 2013. His guidance, support and advice through the campaign were vital to our strong result in Reid. I know hes very happy to be back as a publican. Im looking forward to many more words of advice over the years to come.Mr John Sidoti, the member for Drummoyne, and our local team of Liberal councillors across Canada Bay, Burwood, Strathfield, Parramatta and Cumberland councils: thank you for the support you offered me during the campaign. I thank our Liberal leaders in New South Wales. It was an honour to have alongside me in Reid the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, and the New South Wales Premier, Gladys Berejiklian.The New South Wales division of the Liberal Party is led by the very dedicated Chris Stone—thank you for the support and guidance you offered me from day one. The federal campaign team was led by Andrew Hirst—congratulations on an outstanding campaign. I thank Kellie Sloane and David Miles, who provided advice and guidance in the early stages of my candidacy.Id like to thank the many ministers, MPs and Liberal Party stalwarts who stood on pre-poll, train stations and street stalls with me. My sincere thanks go to the Reid FEC and in particular members of the executive for their support and trust in this short sprint of a campaign. The work of our local branches can never be taken for granted.My campaign team was led by Olivia Simpson and Will Nemesh, who worked tirelessly for the six weeks of the campaign. I also thank my new team—Vanessa, Olivia, Klaudia, Jodie, Alex, Matthew and Chanel. Thank you for taking up the challenge of working with Team Reid.Many supporters and volunteers—many of them friends and family—backed the campaign and helped man booths on election day. Thank you for your time and energy that helped get us across the line in Reid. Im pleased so many of you could join me here today. I particularly would like to acknowledge the work of the Australian Chinese Political Forum, the Australian Korean Political Forum, the Liberal Friends of Korea and the Liberal Friends of Israel. Id also like to acknowledge Joel Hornsey and Shane Hale for the boost in manpower and morale.Then there is my family. Firstly, there is my 92-year-old nan, Marie Dashwood. Stand up. As she says, shes 92 and not out. Shes the matriarch of our mostly Irish-blooded Dashwood-Harvey clan. It is such a blessing to have you here today. Im only able to be here because of the sacrifices of my family, particularly of my husband, Nicolai. Nico, your willingness to embrace this journey makes it possible for me to be here. You have supported me to pursue this very ambitious goal of mine. Your attention to detail is often a frame of reference for me, as is your Danish sense of humour, which has helped me get through many life challenges.To my four children, Sophia, Zachary, Nicholas—who are in the gallery today—and little Olivia, who is having more fun at Capital Hill Early Childcare Centre, I am excited for you to learn about politics in such a hands-on way. I know it is not easy being the child of a politician. At times, it will be a great challenge having mum away from home, serving the country. I hope what you are able to take from this is the importance of contributing to the community and broader society. Particularly to Sophia and Olivia, you come from a long line of strong, independent women. I hope I am able to be a role model to you in the same way my mother and grandmother were to me. Kids, as the Irish say, When I count my blessings, I count you twice.Thank you to my mum, Kathy. Elle, Diana and I have all grown into confident and capable women because of the person you are. You are empathic, intelligent and hardworking. Thank you for everything you have done for me. To my Dad, George, who was part of the Australian soccer squad back in the day, your sporting career certainly inspired my competitive nature. You always emphasised the need to keep your eye on the ball. Ill be hearing your mantra for the rest of my life: When you wake up, the game is over. As it turns out, thats good advice for this place. Id like to acknowledge my sisters, Elle and Diana; my stepfather, Geoff; and Ben, Peter and Kate. Thank you to the rest of my family who have joined us here today. It takes a village to raise a child. I would like to thank the whole team of people who contribute to my childrens lives, but particularly Nicolai, Jeremy and my mother.Finally, and most significantly, thank you to the people of Reid, who have put their trust in me to serve and represent their issues in this place. Reid, Im ready for the challenge and I will not let you down. As Churchill said:I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.Debate adjourned.","Address-in-Reply","GOVERNOR-GENERALS SPEECH","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr MARTIN (Reid) ","(12:06):"
47,0,0,0,1,1,"Chalmers, Jim, MP",37998,"Rankin","ALP","N/A",1017," Before the member for Reid leaves the House, I congratulate her on her first speech—her first contribution to this parliament in the new term.I thank you for the opportunity to speak on these really important bills: the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019, the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019. Labor will be supporting these bills that give effect to the treaty between Australia and Timor-Leste, which extends the maritime boundaries of that country and establishes new arrangements for the development of petroleum resources in the Timor Sea.Its a pleasure to follow the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hunter and others, who have pointed out just how significant these bills are and just how important it is that we right what is essentially an historical wrong. There have been a lot of people in this parliament who have been supportive of this outcome for a long time, whether it be the member for Sydney, the member for Solomon, the member for Lingiari or others like the member for Kingsford Smith, who joins me here at the dispatch box. This is a really important development and a really important day, and I am proud to be able to speak on it.As members would know, 20 years ago almost to the day—20 years next month—the population of Timor-Leste voted overwhelmingly in favour of independence from Indonesia. Of course, as we know, there was widespread violence in Timor-Leste after that which left an estimated 1,400 civilians dead and resulted in the decimation of Timorese infrastructure. The World Bank Group estimates that 70 per cent of the countrys infrastructure and 95 per cent of the schools were destroyed during the violence that followed independence in 1999. Thats shameful. As a result, the newly independent country emerged as one of the worlds poorest nations, with over 50 per cent of the population living below the national poverty line in 2007. Although this figure has declined to around 40 per cent at the last estimate in 2014, and there have been some improvements in some of the development indicators, there is still a long, long way to go to get the people of Timor-Lestes living standards up to what most of us would consider to be an appropriate level.Todays bills are really about part of that effort. Like a lot of members in this House—I think especially on this side of the House—I have a connection to Timor-Leste, not as developed as some of my other colleagues, but I have spent time there. In 2007, I spent some time there doing some training for local political activists ahead of their next elections. What I observed there was heartbreaking. It was heartbreaking to be in Timor-Leste and to see, even where some progress had been made around the building of schools or the building of basic infrastructure, that some of the political conflict in that country that spilled over to physical conflict had impacted on some of the public infrastructure. I saw a lot of schools with roofs burned out. I saw a lot of infrastructure sabotaged. Its heartbreaking, as a citizen of a rich country like ours, to see a poor neighbour like Timor-Leste having to go through that kind of destruction as a consequence of some difficult politics. That really is part of my motivation for speaking on these bills today. We do have an opportunity to get some additional funding into that country. I hope that we can make and build a lasting difference in Timor-Leste. There are also tax aspects to this bill that are of interest to me and my Treasury portfolio.As honourable members would be aware, we Australians have been close friends with the people of Timor-Leste for a long time now—certainly since the dark days of World War II, when 151 Australian servicemen died during the Battle of Timor, and in the following years something like 40,000 to 70,000 Timorese civilians were killed by Japanese reprisals for supporting allied forces. Regarding the contribution that the Leader of the Opposition made earlier, particularly about Tom Uren, it really is fascinating to think that a remarkable guy like Tom Uren had a connection with Timor—thats where he was captured, of course—and that they have found ways in the opposition leaders electorate to mark that relationship, which exists on so many different levels, but it is certainly something that was important to Tom Uren. And if it was important to Tom Uren, its important to all of us in this place—a remarkable man.The support that the Timorese gave Australia was not something we forgot. Im told that during the closing days of the Second World War Australian warplanes dropped flyers over Japanese-occupied Timor saying, Your friends do not forget you. While we havent forgotten our friends in Timor, I think it is fair to say that we could have been better friends. We could have behaved as better friends to the people of Timor-Leste. One example of this, of course, is the maritime boundary dispute between our countries, which these bills and the treaty itself go some way to resolving.When the anniversary of independence is celebrated next month, it is important that this legislation be in place. So I support the steps that have been taken by the government, with the support of the opposition, to make sure that we can get these bills in place and the treaty in place so that when the people of Timor-Leste celebrate on 30 August, the anniversary of their independence, this can be locked in and can be something that becomes part of the celebration. The signing of the treaty brings to an end more than 40 years of uncertainty over that shared maritime border, and I think it does vindicate the strong position weve taken on this side of the House to take those decisive steps to settle our dispute with Timor-Leste. I want to particularly pay tribute to the member for Sydney for her role in that three years ago.To give some context as to why this is such a big issue, royalties generated from projects in the Timor Sea funded more than 95 per cent of Timor-Lestes budget in 2016. Thats extraordinary. Just imagine the challenges of being a country that is trying to rebuild virtually all your schools and your infrastructure and having a dispute over your primary source of revenue with one of the wealthiest countries in the world. Obviously resolving that international maritime dispute is a really complicated thing and it has taken us time to get to this point. But we as a country need to recognise how important it is and how this is part of doing the right thing in our region. We cant afford to turn our back on our international neighbours. Many of them face the challenge of dealing with the disastrous consequences of climate change, for example, as well as other challenges in our neighbourhood, in our part of the world, and we do need to do better in supporting our neighbours in their economic development.Across the Asia-Pacific were seeing a significant change, which makes it more important than ever that we work with people and countries to support their economic development and maintain international security and stability in our region. Labor believes that the maritime boundary dispute with Timor-Leste has strained our bilateral relations and that it is in the national interest of both Australia and Timor-Leste that this dispute is resolved in the way that we are attempting to do with these bills today. So were pleased that this treaty is the first ever to be achieved by conciliation under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. We welcome the resolution of this dispute with Timor-Leste, which will improve relations between our countries and provide ongoing benefits for both countries but especially for the people of Timor-Leste.Others have gone through the details of the bills that are combining here for this debate, the ones that we support enthusiastically—the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill, the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019 and, from my point of view, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019, which amends the tax arrangements for companies that operate projects covered by the treaty. As part of the treaty, Australia agreed or provided that Australian companies would face conditions equivalent to petroleum activities affected by the 2018 treaty, which is another way of saying that were ensuring here that Australian companies arent worse off. Some tax changes are necessary to enforce that agreement, and thats what is in the detail of this bill, which I wont go through in any more detail.In conclusion, three years ago Labor made it clear that we wanted to be constructive and work with East Timor to reach a binding international agreement to settle the maritime border dispute between our countries. As a country, Australia has worked with East Timor to reach a permanent resolution to the development of petroleum resources in the Timor Sea, and it really is terrific to see that this has finally been achieved. Thats why we are such enthusiastic supporters of the progress in these bills and in the treaty. To the people of East Timor, our friends to the north: on the anniversary of your independence next month, we wish you all the very best. Ever since the Second World War weve been proud to be your friends. We are grateful for the opportunity to rectify what has been a historical wrong, and we wish you all the best for the years ahead.","Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019, Passenger Movement Charge Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019, Treasury Laws Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr CHALMERS (Rankin) ","(12:35):"
48,0,0,0,1,1,"Claydon, Sharon, MP",248181,"Newcastle","ALP","N/A",1020," Its a great honour to rise today to speak in support of these bills before the House, the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019, the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019, which outline the new arrangements with regard to the Timor Sea maritime boundaries treaty. A number of Labor speakers have come before me, so I dont intend to speak to the detail of these bills that we now are debating in this cognate debate. Rather, I will just put on record the sheer joy I feel in the fact that the Australian parliament is finally dealing with what has been some particularly challenging unfinished business in this nation with regard to our relationship with East Timor.We had played a leadership role in the independence struggles that took place in East Timor, so it was to our great shame that, as time passed, our relationship became quite strained when it came to discussions around the maritime boundaries between our two nations. I was really honoured to be part of a delegation that visited East Timor last October in the term of the last parliament. The member for Flynn chaired that, and I went with senators Patrick Dodson and Rex Patrick from the other place. Whilst many extraordinary things happened during that delegation in terms of the people we got to meet in East Timor and the conversations that we had there, so many people raised with us the need to get these maritime boundaries settled.There is great excitement in East Timor about the upcoming celebrations of independence on 30 August—indeed, I met with the ambassador only last week—and people are rightly very anxious that the Australian parliament have its matters in order and that our legislation be passed. Its one thing to ratify this treaty, but theres a lot of legislation, like that before us now, that is required to implement that treaty. As I said, it remains unfinished business for Australia and East Timor, and until that takes place we wont really have reconciled the difference that grew out of some very strained relationships.There is a long history of people seeking to redress this past wrong around the maritime boundaries. I know a number of my colleagues have spoken of this. As the Leader of the Opposition did earlier in this debate, I would like to acknowledge the role and connection of Mr Tom Uren, a giant within the Australian Labor movement and a man who had a deep and personal connection with Timor-Leste, having been taken as a prisoner of war there. But there have been many champions on the Labor side to seek redress for Timor-Leste over these last few decades. I acknowledge the work of the member for Lingiari, who will be speaking after me, who has had a very long association not just with Timor-Leste but with this great project that we need to now settle with our neighbours.I also acknowledge the work of former member Janelle Saffin, who has long championed the rights of Timor-Leste people in Australia, and of my colleague the member for Sydney, both in her personal capacity and in her former capacity as the shadow minister for foreign affairs and international development. She is steadfast in her determination to have these maritime boundaries settled. I was very fortunate to attend the National Press Club luncheon in which she delivered a terrific speech outlining Labors approach now. It reminded us all that we call on other nations across the world to abide by international norms and to settle our disputes within rules based systems. She challenged us by saying, If we expect that of other nations then we need to actually adhere to that advice ourselves. We traditionally have had a good record in doing that, but it is far from a flawless record. Certainly, it drew attention to the situation in Timor-Leste at that point because Timor-Leste had suffered decades of war and starvation before gaining their independence. Australia played a key role in gaining that independence. That was a really proud moment for many of us in Australia.But the maritime boundary dispute poisoned relations with our new neighbours, and I dont think we should understate the damage that has been done. The member for Sydney rightly stated at the National Press Club in very clear terms that this was a situation that had to change both for the sake of Timor-Leste people and for our own sake, because we want to regard ourselves as good global citizens. I think it would be fair to say that that was the time at which Labor redoubled our efforts to enter into good-faith negotiations with Timor-Leste to settle those boundaries between our two countries. There were many representatives of Timor-Leste present at that National Press Club speech, and they were truly delighted to hear this news that there was going to be a shift in Australias approach.Not only did we say that we were going to seek to settle the maritime disputes but the then shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Sydney, made the important additional statement that, if we werent unsuccessful in negotiating a settlement with our neighbour, we would be prepared to submit ourselves to an international adjudication or arbitration system. That was a very important statement to make. We would subject ourselves to the international frameworks because it would be in the national interests of both Australia and Timor-Leste to do so. Thats because it was a matter that required settlement. We had both signed up to using these international frameworks and entering into a rules-based system for the settling of disputes. It was only right that we would be willing to freely participate and submit ourselves to that as well. It was a big shift of momentum in the debate.I believe this is one of those remarkable examples in which oppositions can actually lead and shape debates in the national interest and encourage governments to come on that journey as well. We stand here today, some years later. That speech that the member for Sydney delivered was back in February 2016. We are a few years on, but I am truly delighted that the government has also committed itself to the settlement of this unfinished business between Australia and Timor-Leste.As I said, it is critical that these bills get passed by the Australian parliament in this sitting. We need these laws to be enacted so that the treaty can do what it is intended to do. It should be the centrepiece of celebrations for Timor-Lestes Independence Day at the end of this month. Time is short. I am going to leave my speech there to enable my colleagues to continue with their contributions, but it is with tremendous joy that we get to take part in a parliament that might finally sign off on some of that unfinished business between Australia and Timor-Leste.","Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019, Passenger Movement Charge Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019, Treasury Laws Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CLAYDON (Newcastle) ","(12:46):"
49,0,0,0,1,1,"Snowdon, Warren, MP","IJ4","Lingiari","ALP","N/A",1022," I thank the member for Newcastle for her contribution on the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019 and associated bills and her acknowledgement of others who have participated in the debate not only in this chamber but also the Senate over the many years passed in support of the Timor-Leste people. She mentioned Janelle Saffin, and I do want to reaffirm the importance of Janelles advocacy and support here. Previously, of course, in former parliaments, advocates such as Ken Fry, Cyril Primmer, Tom Uren, Jean McLean and Jean Melzer were all very important in advocating around the issues to do with East Timor, particularly after the occupation of Timor-Leste, as it is now known, by Indonesia way back in December 1975.Since that time, neither side of this parliament has covered itself in glory. Today is a chance for us, as the member said, to rectify what has been an anomalous situation and, much to our shame, one where we have been the bovver boy. The member for Solomon mentioned the 2/2nd and 2/4th independent companies. The 2/2nd arrived in December 1941-early 1942, in East Timor. They were out by September or October. The 2/4th took over, and they left in December 1942. My father subsequently served with the 2/2nd, so I am fully aware and very cognisant of the importance of the role of these independent companies, later commandos, and the protection that was provided to them by the East Timorese, where we were able to contain 12,000 Japanese troops. But, at the same time, whilst that was happening, and post the departure of the Australians, 40,000 Timorese lost their lives. Theres a debt of blood here. In 1975 we saw the Indonesians march in, and we acquiesced. Subsequent to that Indonesian takeover, up to a quarter of a million East Timorese lost their lives. When you think about what that means to us and our responsibilities just as human beings, weve got to rectify this. And today we get a chance to do a bit of that.We had the Fraser government sitting by, complicit, as the events of 1975 unfolded, and subsequently giving de jure recognition, which was reaffirmed by the Hawke government, shamefully, in 1984. I remember these days vividly because I was involved in working with supporters of Fretilin in Australia post December 1975, and I had the great privilege of being involved—involved is a difficult word in this sense. After 1999, at last, under the Howard government, the Australian government took a position that was morally the right thing to do, to head INTERFET. That was very important, and that was referred to by the member for Solomon.My office in Darwin was really very active in talking and working with members of the East Timorese community, both in East Timor and in the Northern Territory, in particular. Today—and I should have said this at the beginning—we have in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly the first East Timorese person to be a member of a parliament in Australia, Sandra Nelson. Her mother, Rosa, is the sister of Jose Ramos-Horta—so hes her uncle—and the member for Solomon told me that her brother, Joao Carrascalao, was his medic when Major Gosling, as he then was, was serving in East Timor. So there are connections here.Post the start of INTERFET on 20 September 1999, I went to Dili—I think in November. Subsequently I had the great privilege of doing a number of things, but these most clearly stick in my mind. I had the opportunity to attend the first Fretilin conference after the Indonesian occupation. As well as being at the launch of that partys first campaign for the election of the constituent assembly, I also attended the National Council of the Timorese Resistance, CNRT, after the United Nations took over East Timor. I also had the great privilege of being at the opening of the Constituent Assembly when it was elected in June 2002. At that first meeting of the Constituent Assembly, the first meeting of the new parliament, there was no official Australian representative. That says more about Alexander Downer and John Howard than it does about the rest of us. But I went there, and the guests of honour on the floor of the chamber at the swearing in of the new members of parliament included the then Northern Territory Chief Minister.When you think that in a couple of weeks the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition will be in East Timor together, that is a good thing. That is a really good thing. But it really only marks the rebalancing of the ledger. It doesnt cover the enormity of whats gone on in the past and the bullying behaviour of Australian governments—the role of Alexander Downer in negotiating the Timor Gap treaty. I remember two things in particular. In 1989 there was the initial negotiation of the joint area between Australia and Indonesia with Ali Alitas, who was the Indonesian foreign minister, and Gareth Evans, the foreign minister for Australia, in Darwin. I can still visualise the media at the time of them signing a document in the air over the Timor Sea. That was all fine and terrific, except it excluded the role of the East Timorese; it was all about Indonesia and Australia.Subsequently, in 2002, when there was a renegotiation after Timor-Leste gained independence, there was still no permanent maritime border negotiated. Regarding Alexander Downer—and the member for Solomon referred to this earlier—Mari Alkatiri, who was a good person, was the Prime Minister and was negotiating with Alexander Downer over the Timor Gap. Downer, in a most belligerent fashion, stood over Mari Alkatiri. And here I quote from a book by Kim McGrath, a great Australian—Crossing the Line: Australias Secret History in the Timor Sea—in which she quotes Paul Cleary, who writes about those meetings and the interaction between the two. At the end of this interaction a lecture was being given by Alexander Downer to Mari Alkatiri in which he said:We dont like brinkmanship. I think your Western advisors give you very poor advice that public opinion supports East Timor in Australia. We are very tough. We will not care if you give information to the media. Let me give you a tutorial in politics—not a chance.What a disgrace. What an absolute bloody disgrace. And that was Australias foreign minister. We learned subsequently that theyd bugged the conference. Weve still got Australians in the courts for belling the cat, because of the role of an Australian government.Its about time we got over ourselves and treated people properly, fairly and with respect. This treaty gives us that opportunity. And I do lay credit at the feet of the member for Sydney, and the speech that was referred to by the member for Newcastle, in bringing this forward so that we end up with conciliation over the boundary issue and we end up seeing a proper allocation of resources from this area to Timor-Leste, and that is as it should be.We shouldnt be afraid of accepting the critique that weve really had our hands in their pockets for too long. It shouldve been 100 per cent from day one, not 80-20, 90-10 or 70-30—a very nifty drawing of boundaries to make sure we get a huge slice of the action at the expense of almost the poorest people in the world. So it is important that that situation is rectified, and it is rectified as a result of this legislation.I want to thank the government, although, as the Leader of the Opposition said, this stuff could have been debated in November of last year. Why has it taken so long? They had no business prior to the election; we knew that. But, nevertheless, its being done. It is important that we move forward but also have an eye to the past and understand the challenges that the people of Timor-Leste confront, that we appreciate their heroes that led them to the position that theyre in today and that we appreciate that we need to do a lot more than weve done in the past in working with our near neighbours.I commend particularly the member for Solomon for his ongoing relationship with the people of Timor-Leste and in the new role hes achieved and been given by the Leader of the Opposition in trade with our near neighbours. The Timorese are wonderful, forgiving people, really, and I think we should show our appreciation in a proper way. I had the great privilege of welcoming Xanana Gusmao to Australia after he was released from Indonesia, and I escorted him onto the floor of this House. That was a great honour, and it is a great honour to speak in this debate today to support this legislation to see, at least partially, wrongs of the past rectified.","Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019, Passenger Movement Charge Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019, Treasury Laws Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SNOWDON (Lingiari) ","(12:57):"

52,0,0,0,1,1,"Perrett, Graham, MP","HVP","Moreton","ALP","N/A",1024," Thank you, Deputy Speaker, Ill tell my wife. We have matching Queensland colours today, Deputy Speaker—good to see! I rise to speak on the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019 and acknowledge the great contributions from those from the Labor side already in this debate.Im just going to give a little bit of history first. Timor-Leste, previously called East Timor, was the eastern half of the island of Timor—the area colonised by Portugal in the 16th century. Why Portugal? Well, because the countries of Spain and Portugal sat down together—they were the big maritime powers of the time—and struck the Treaty of Zaragoza in 1529, which basically divided the world in two—on this side of the planet, on the 141st degree of longitude, which is basically that bit of the Queensland border west of Toowoomba. If you kept going west, from Haddon Corner down to Cameron Corner to the western boundary of New South Wales down until it hits the Murray—its actually not quite on 141st degree of longitude from the Murray down south, because Victoria actually stole 3½ kilometres off South Australia and went a little bit further west. There are lots of arguments as to what happened. They actually had a big argument for 60-odd years about that 1,800 square kilometres on the western side of Victoria that Victoria took off South Australia and it ended up in the Privy Council in 1914, where the Privy Council basically said: South Australia, youre never getting that back. Thats now a part of Victoria. I mention the world being divided in two because thats what this legislation is all about: where people draw lines on maps in terms of who owns what. Thats what this legislation, which I commend the government for, is sorting out.Timor-Leste was a Portuguese colony until Fretilin—the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor—declared independence. That lasted only about nine days before the Indonesians came in and declared East Timor to be the countrys 27th province in 1976. That continued until 1999, when, after the United Nations sponsored an act of self-determination, Indonesia relinquished control of the territory and Timor-Leste became the first new sovereign state in the 21st century on 20 May 2002. It has been a close friend of Australia ever since.The reason this legislation is here is mainly resources. Timor-Leste is a very poor country, with nearly half the population living in extreme poverty. It is one of our closest neighbours and a country to which Australia owes a great debt, because of the great work that the East Timorese people did in World War II supporting Australian farmers, but it is a very poor community apart from the fact that they have petroleum. The Timor-Leste Petroleum Fund provides most of the East Timorese governments income. In fact, the International Monetary Fund has called Timor-Leste the most oil-dependent economy in the world. So it is important to get this right for East Timor, a land where many people in villages are still relying on subsistence farming; anything we can do to assist our good friend and neighbour is a good thing, obviously.Previous speakers have touched on the fact that the call to correct this wrong and to get it right came mainly from the member for Sydney, Tanya Plibersek, in one of her recent speeches. She was calling for justice and not just because of that debt stretching back to World War II, when people like Tom Uren, who was a prisoner of war, were assisted by the East Timorese. Tom has been a great friend of the East Timorese. He was a prisoner of war on the Burma railway and the like, as the previous speaker, the member for Grayndler, mentioned. The member for Sydney called for justice to make it right, to repay the debt, because to do so is obviously in our national interests. Why? Because we must have a safe, stable community. Timor-Leste is a Christian country in the middle of Asia, a country that we have great connections with and a country that we need to make sure is stable, developing and growing. We obviously need to get the balance right.The Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019 gives effect to the treaty that has been struck between Australia and Timor-Leste that recognises the extended maritime boundaries for Timor-Leste, and makes new arrangements for the petroleum development and revenues and the opportunities that will flow from making sure that the East Timorese are able to access all of those resources. There is an area struck out—the special regime area—where the gas fields known as Sunrise and Troubadour have their own set of arrangements, which include protection for current Australian petroleum activities, because the Greater Sunrise Special Regime area is a joint venture between Timor-Leste and Australia. There will also be some international areas to do with the gas pipelines to make sure that we get the best possible outcomes in terms of the value of the resources, and there are a few other things we need to sort out in terms of taxation arrangements for the companies that are operating in this area. It is a great opportunity for this government to do the right thing and to do things that are in the national interest that will benefit Australians.We know that this coalition government doesnt have a big legislative agenda. This treaty was concluded on 6 March last year, so this could have actually taken effect much earlier. Instead, we see stunt after stunt from those opposite. Theyre all about the cheap politics and trying to wedge Labor rather than doing things that are in the national interest. This is important legislation on the world stage. We have a shadow over us because of the behaviour of past governments, as detailed by the member for Lingiari in her speech, which should be listened to and read. We have a shadow that springs from the Liberal and National parties and now theres a chance to do it right. Im glad to see that the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister will be travelling to Timor-Leste to make this right. But I would ask the coalition, the government of the day—the government about to enter its seventh year—to actually start focusing on the nation and on the people its supposed to be benefiting rather than on the cheap politics. I commend these bills to the House.","Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019, Passenger Movement Charge Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019, Treasury Laws Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PERRETT (Moreton) ","(13:12):"

I want to take this opportunity to join with the member for Newcastle to celebrate, if you like, that this legislation is before the House. Our relationship with Timor-Leste over decades has been a point of great shame for me personally. I have always felt strongly that the previous treaty did not do justice to our nearest neighbours and that the previous positions of Australian governments of both colours did not go to the fairness that Australians like to see themselves espouse. It is terrific to see the bills come into the parliament today and before us to ensure that the new treaty does represent the values of our great country. It is an incredibly important relationship with our neighbour to north.Like the member for Newcastle, I was incredibly proud when federal Labor changed its position in 2016 under then shadow minister Pliberseks leadership. I join the member for Newcastle in reading into Hansard a quote from the member for Sydneys National Press Club speech. She said:Timor-Leste suffered decades of war and starvation before gaining independence. Australia played a key role in securing that independence—a proud moment for many Australians.The maritime boundary dispute has poisoned relations with our newest neighbour.This must change, for their sake, and for ours.It is terrific to be here today to see that change forever, to see that the new treaty is going to be enacted, and to be able to proudly say that weve now come to a point where our values are driving our actions and our friendships with our nearest neighbours.Weve traversed the fact that we havent always been the best neighbours. Today is a proud moment for all of us in this chamber. This treaty demonstrates our commitment to international law and rules—and, I would add, to fairness. I commend Australias intention to have robust bilateral relationships with Timor-Leste and to jointly develop the Greater Sunrise gas fields, and I commend the bills to the House.","Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019, Passenger Movement Charge Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019, Treasury Laws Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms RYAN (Lalor—Opposition Whip) ","(13:21):"
54,0,0,0,1,1,"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",265980,"Mayo","CA","N/A",1026," These bills implement the first tranche of measures to implement the recent treaty on maritime boundaries between Australia and East Timor. Sadly, the history of Australian negotiations with East Timor over maritime boundaries has been shameful and fraught with scandal. Australia unlawfully bugged the East Timorese cabinet to give it an unfair advantage in negotiations on the original maritime boundary treaty—to give it the upper hand in dividing the benefits of oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea. That is a fact, and we did that to one of the poorest nations in Asia, which is really reprehensible.As I mentioned, East Timor is one of the poorest countries in our region, with little revenue base other than these oil and gas reserves. In 2012, after learning that former foreign minister Alexander Downer had become an adviser to Woodside Petroleum, which was benefiting from the treaty, an ASIS agent, now known as Witness K, followed the proper internal processes to raise his concerns about the unlawful bugging operation. And now our government is prosecuting Witness K, and—unprecedented—his lawyer Bernard Collaery, for speaking out.The case of Witness K and Bernard Collaery will likely stand for a long time as a landmark in Australias democratic history. The question is: what sort of landmark will it be? Will the case of Witness K ultimately demonstrate the power of individual conscience against the abuse of power by the state, or will it be another step towards a future in which government secrecy and the power of secret agencies crowd out democracy and the rule of law? That has yet to be decided, but much will depend on the campaign to support Bernard Collaery and Witness K and, more broadly, on the effects of bringing our intelligence and national security agencies under full and proper scrutiny and control. At the heart of this case is an illegal act. At the heart of this case is a government decision to use the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, our overseas espionage organisation, to spy on our small and impoverished neighbour, East Timor. Our government did not seek to protect our national security but to advance narrow commercial interests for financial gain.If there was ever a case of shooting the messenger, this has been the case. Collectively, we have worked with many members across the parliament, including former senator Tim Storer, and together we have referred the matter of the 2004 spying case on East Timor to the AFP. We ask the AFP to pursue the matter with diligence and rigour, knowing that no-one should be above the law, especially not our intelligence agencies. This disgraceful case of spying should never have taken place, and this is a very real moment of shame for this nation.What we have now is the opportunity to right the wrong. I hope that, to right one of the wrongs, our Attorney-General decides to drop the case against Witness K and Bernard Collaery. However, in returning to the bill, this bill does take a positive step in the right direction. I again urge the Attorney-General to drop the case, and in the meantime I commend this bill to the House.Debate adjourned.","Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019, Passenger Movement Charge Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019, Treasury Laws Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) ","(13:23):"

Sadly, Clem passed away on Sunday aged 95. To say Clem was a highly decorated soldier would be an understatement. Indeed, he served in more than three separate theatres of war over decades of service. Clem started his military service in the Second World War, where he served in Papua New Guinea. He also served in the Korean War, where he fought in the epic battle of Kapyong, and did two tours of duty in the Vietnam War. This is an incredible record of service on its own, but Clem also did peacekeeping in Japan, trained elite parachutists in the United States and became a regimental sergeant major in the Australian SAS.Since retiring, Clem has been a greatly respected member of the Newcastle veterans community. Hes a long-serving patron of the Newcastle and Hunter Region Vietnam Veterans and a member of the Waratah Mayfield RSL sub-branch. The home base for the Newcastle and Hunter Region Vietnam Veterans in Wallsend is named the Clem Kealy Centre in his honour. In addition to his service, Clem is well known in Newcastle as a true gentleman who would do anything to help others.

With hundreds of coal-fired power stations opening up around the world, it is an industry with a great future.After the election and the success of the Monash Forum, it now appears that there are many who want to get on board. This year weve had the member for Hunter argue the case for coal, saying that in this parliament he would argue with great energy and commitment. Weve also had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in a bit of a turnaround, say that the coal industry should be celebrated. With all this new-found support, I propose the formation of a parliamentary friends of Australian coal exports group. I intend to write to every member of the opposition, hoping to find a co-chair for that committee and inviting all of them to join. I look forward to coming back soon with a list of those who have signed up.","Coal Industry","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) ","(13:30):"

Deep in our hearts your memory is kept—to love, to cherish and never forget. Today I rise to speak about the life of a wonderful woman, Lisa Johnston. This month marks a year since Lisas passing. The circumstances of her death will not be how she is remembered in the hearts of those who knew and loved her. Lisa was a tireless student at Melbourne Polytechnic in my electorate of Cooper. After facing challenges during her young life, Lisa found herself in our TAFE sector. She was supported by her teachers and loved by her fellow students. She flourished in the TAFE learning environment. Although she faced challenges, Lisa never let life bring her down.During her time at Melbourne Polytechnic, she found her passion for advocating for individuals experiencing homelessness. This is what she wanted to dedicate her life to. The last assignment she handed in was on managing and promoting diversity. Lisa focused on the discrimination faced by individuals experiencing homelessness. When asked what she was planning to do with her completed assignment, Lisa said, Ill give it to my local MP, Ged Kearney. Shell know what to do with it. Sadly, Lisas life was taken before she could hand it to me, but her TAFE teachers did honour her wishes. I tell her story today to honour her work and I will continue to fight against the scourge of homelessness that Lisa so desperately wanted to work on.","Johnston, Ms Lisa","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms KEARNEY (Cooper) ","(13:32):"

It provides some very vivid and mesmerising firsthand accounts of military working dogs and their handlers in both the Australian Army and the Australian Air Force. I would like to encourage all members and, in fact, all Australians to read it so they can understand the unique efforts and sacrifice of military working dogs and their handlers. The book is easily available online for purchase, for those who wish to do so.I would also encourage all Australians, particularly Ryan residents, to observe Military Working Dog Day on 7 June as a way of recognising these efforts and this sacrifice on a yearly basis. In particular, I recognise in this place the sacrifice of Sapper Darren Smith and his explosives dog, Herbie, whose story is one of those recounted in the book and who were killed in action in the service of our nation on 7 June 2010. Again, congratulations to Mr Hulse both for his advocacy in this space as part of the Australian Defence Force Trackers and War Dogs Association and for the enormous work that he has put into this book.

The Annerley Community Bookshop on Ipswich Road has sold its last book. Im proud but sad to say that I was one of its last customers, picking up a few hardback treasures for my youngest son. With its creaking polished wooden floors and comfy crimson couches, this not-for-profit store sold well-priced, quality second-hand books to people across the south side of Brisbane for nearly 20 years. The bookstore has been a warm and welcoming place for many a book lover to spend hours browsing through the many books it had on offer, and it also provided a meeting place for many local groups.The bookstore was opened in 2000 by Anglicare Refugee and Migrant Services. At the time, it was a combined bookshop and literacy centre. It provided cheap books and language and literacy services for refugees and migrants. The shops and classes were run by community workers and volunteers. Over the years, the focus changed and the bookstore has run as a not-for-profit, channelling its funds into local community projects.But times change. People are buying more books online and, with the rise of ebooks, the sales in places like Annerley Community Bookshop have been in decline. With the decline in sales coupled with the cost of rent, times started to look pretty tough for the bookstore a few years ago, but it didnt go down with a fight. The management committee and the 50 or so volunteers tried hard to save the bookstore from going under. The local councillor, Nicole Johnston, also did a lot of work to help it out. Sadly, our community bookstore had nowhere else to go. I want to thank: Naomi Frampton, president of the management committee; Paul Hodges, the bookstore manager; and the many volunteers.","Moreton Electorate: Annerley Community Bookshop","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PERRETT (Moreton) ","(13:35):"

The Hornsby Gang Show has trained hundreds of Scouts and Guides in all aspects of stagecraft, acting, singing, dancing and behind-the-scenes skills such as lighting and prop building. Hornsby Gang Show involves members from the Sydney North region Scouts, Venturers, Rovers, leaders and Guides, with people aged 11 and up participating in the show. The production is enormous: 130 cast members and 250 crew. Bec Canty as production director, Yvonne Barton-Leach as musical director and Amanda Muxlow as general manager did an incredible job to pull the production together again this year. They were joined by highly capable and experienced people like Julia Ralton, Lauren Webb, Cameron Porter, Ben Dennis, Priscilla LeGuier and so many others.Community organisations like these are full of people who come back again and again to invest selflessly in the next generation. Special mention should be made of those who have done many shows—Barry Greenland, who has done 40; Penny Becchio, 37; Betina-Ann Campbell, 31; Doug Chilvers, 25; and Andy Davis, 20—all of whom have a combined 153 years in the show.The Hornsby Gang Show started in 1973 as the Hornsby Troop Concert. The show was set to run only one night but, because of its popularity, it added another, packing out the house on both nights.

In contrast, on that side of the House they made a commitment to give a third fully Medicare-rebated licence to Geelong, a city which is not as large as Wyndham and already has two licences to serve it.

James Miller is a quiet young man with a passion for electronics and building projects, and his last one was a drone.

There are 1st Glossodia scouts who have achieved Queens Scout awards, and various Blue Mountains Scout and Girl Guide units have shone in this area.What strikes me when I go and hear about their journeys to Queens Scout is the years of work involved and the commitment that they have.

We all know that those opposite do not believe in the notion of workers saving for their retirement to avoid being on the age pension.

At every stage they have voted against it. When Labor moved to establish compulsory superannuation in the 1990s, they voted against it.

As the member is aware, the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment (Ensuring Integrity) Bill 2019 is designed to see that our courts have the ability to ensure lawful behaviour on Australian worksites. It is a bill that will apply equally to employer and employee organisations, and there are a number of reasons why this bill is critical and why maintaining lawful conduct on workplaces is critical. Unlawful conduct adds to the costs of infrastructure borne by the Australian taxpayer. One of the very important reasons that unlawful behaviour on worksites must be stopped is that it puts the safety of workers at risk.We know that the CFMMEU has racked up $16 million in court fines for unlawful behaviour for over 2,000 breaches. What is less well known is that many of those breaches themselves relate to violations of occupational health and safety standards. Last year the full Federal Court found that a CFMMEU official had acted in an improper manner to a Victorian government occupational health and safety officer. The grotesque behaviour of the CFMMEU to that official is behaviour directed not at another worker or an employer but at a safety official.When we look at Queensland, there are proceedings that were commenced in December last year against a CFMMEU organiser for his behaviour towards a Queensland government occupational health and safety inspector. The construction site was Cairns Performing Arts Centre. The safety inspector was in the course of inspecting exit signage. He was confronted by the CFMMEU official, who within centimetres of the face of the safety officer said, You are an effing dog—not once, not twice but three times. And the upshot of all this— If the minister could pause there, Im just going to make a point Ive had to make before, about a year ago. I appreciate that the minister is seeking to—let me just say this: unparliamentary language cannot be introduced by way of a quote.

92,0,1,0,0,1,"Porter, Christian, MP",208884,"Pearce","LP","N/A",1040," I thank the member for his question. As the member is aware, the ensuring integrity bill would allow for a court to make a finding, for instance, that a person was not a fit and proper person to be a public official for a union—or, indeed, for an employer association; the bill applies to both instances. The court might make a decision that someones not a fit and proper person, for instance, because they had a significant history of breaking the civil law or criminal law in Australia, especially on criminal laws punishable by two years or more imprisonment. Why is that important? That is important because unlawful behaviour risks the safety of workers. It costs the taxpayer and it means that there is behaviour occurring in our workplaces that simply should not be tolerated.Unfortunately, the present laws have not provided sufficient deterrence to repeated unlawful behaviour of a small number of militant unionists. What sort of behaviour are we talking about here? The Leader of the Opposition says that John Setka is not a fit and proper person to be a member of the Labor Party. Why does he say that? Because of John Setkas record of law-breaking. What is that record? John Setka has, to this point, amassed around 59 court convictions for a multitude of offences, including: assault police, five times; assault by kicking, five times; wilful trespass, seven times; resisting arrest, five times; theft, attempted theft by deception and intent to coerce, nine times; coercion, 10 times. These things, now, finally, have formed the basis of a conclusion by the opposition leader that militant unionist John Setka is not a fit and proper person to be a member of the Labor Party.But, interestingly, the same remarkable record of offending has not also given rise to a view from the opposition leader that it is not fit and proper for Labor to accept the $1 million that John Setka sent to Labor as a Victorian branch secretary. Likewise, its remarkable that that criminal record doesnt now appear to be the basis for a view that it was not fit and proper for Labor to accept $13 million from the CFMEU in total.What we have here is a situation where the character of John Setka is now rejected fulsomely by Labor, but his cash is still warmly accepted—as much of it that can flow as possible. Who is actually standing up for workers here? Who is actually on the side of workers? Labor accept a million dollars directly from a man they say is not a fit and proper person to be a member of the Labor Party and, at the same time, the ABCC has just announced that it has recovered $1 million in underpaid wages for almost 1,400 workers.

You are right: in April last year, one of the first achievements after becoming agriculture minister, at my first ministerial council of all agriculture ministers—the states and myself—was to be able to get an agreement on a nationally coordinated approach towards supporting our farmers with the changing climate and adapting to climate. We were able to with the support of the Victorian government. I need to acknowledge the former agriculture minister there, Jaala Pulford, who took the lead on that and commissioned a report that was provided to the last ministerial council meeting in September last year, and the final report will be provided to the ministerial council in September this year.Its important that we get a coordinated approach between state and federal agencies to ensure that were not duplicating expenditure. But its also important to understand the work that our farmers and the government have already done, particularly since we first put a till in the soil. Our farmers have been adapting to a changing climate, and were putting in over $1.1 billion a year, between government and farmers, to give them the tools to be able to adapt to a changing climate—the cutting-edge research and development they need. Its also important that we continue to improve our landscapes. One point one billion dollars has gone to Landcare itself—a great movement that has changed the land practices of our farmers for the better, in terms of not only the environmental outcomes but also profitability.Only last night, proudly, this government, as a signature piece to drought policy into the future, was able to pass the Future Drought Fund—a $100 million dividend, year in, year out. It is legislated. We will be going out and consulting with the community. What a crazy idea that a government might go out and ask those whose money it is how it should be spent! We will look at things like climate risk, extension work and how we can actually ensure our farmers take up the research and development that weve got and better equip them to adapt to a changing climate.

106,0,1,0,0,1,"Porter, Christian, MP",208884,"Pearce","LP","N/A",1042," I thank the member for his question. As the member is aware, right now in Australia there is over $2 billion under management in what are known as workers entitlement funds. Those funds are meant to keep safe and secure money that may, in the future, be needed to pay for events such as long service leave, sick leave or, very importantly, severance and redundancy payments. There are nine large workers entitlement funds in operation. We described yesterday that one of those funds, known as Protect, transferred, just before the last election, $32 million worth of workers money, meant to be kept safe and secure for the purposes of future severance payments, back to the Electrical Trades Union. There is no rational explanation as to why that occurred. So bad is it that theres a loan facility in case Protect run out of money to pay for severance payments. They might be able to borrow some back if they ask nicely. It is outrageous.But today there is another example of the complete misappropriation of workers funds, from the same severance fund, Protect. There are a range of enterprise agreements that have a clause that insists and requires that two per cent of workers wages go not to the worker but to the fund Protect for the purposes of income protection insurance. Theres nothing wrong with that on its face. That is money that could be kept in the fund Protect for the income protection insurance of the workers. But its money that doesnt go into the pockets of the workers and its money they earned. For instance, theres a two per cent of payroll clause for income protection for Dubai Ports operations in Australia. Keep in mind these are very large operations. Dubai Ports payroll in Australia is, we think, in excess of $260 million per year.Today in the media it emerged that there is a document that no-one has ever seen before which outlines an agreement between the Electrical Trades Union and Protect, under the heading beneficial term, and it is really beneficial: the ETU will receive a benefit from the income protection insurance payments in the amount of approximately 16 per cent of the total fund income insurance contributions. So, of those millions of dollars worth of wages, year on year, that go into the Protect insurance fund, 16 per cent goes straight back to the Electrical Trades Union.This government says that, in the banking sector, a secret commission is deplorable; in this sector, it is equally deplorable. This is workers money that they get no benefit from that is siphoned off to the ETU. And right now the MUA, part of the militant CFMMEU, is pushing very hard for another two per cent of wages clause so that the money, millions of dollars, will flow into this organisation, Protect. What everyone here and, I think, the workers would like to know is: is there going to be a similar kickback in that arrangement? The only way we will ever know is if this legislation passes, to make the relationship transparent.

Their farms are critical and crucial to our nation and they should be protected. Most Australian farms are family owned and operated. Theyre good people. I come from a generational farming family and I know how hard our farmers work. They deserve our respect. If you illegally storm a farm, we will throw the book at you.Under the new legislation, if youre found guilty of using personal information of farmers to incite trespass, you will face up to a year in jail, as you should. If you go a step further and incite damage or theft on agricultural land, you could be—and should be—living in a jail cell for the next five years. You shouldnt be allowed out in those five years. We are taking this very, very seriously. I commend the Attorney-General and the minister for water resources and drought for their work in helping to form this legislation. I hear the Opposition Leader say, It is bipartisan. That is good, and that is as it should be. Its a shame that we had to drag you kicking and screaming to the Future Drought Fund. I also commend the state minister for agriculture in New South Wales, Adam Marshall, who is in the House today. This week the New South Wales government announced $1,000 on-the-spot fines for individuals—and further fines of up to $220,000 per person and $440,000 for corporations—who illegally enter farmers properties creating biosecurity risks. Our farmers need protecting. Were doing just that. Before I call the member for Port Adelaide, I remind the members for Hunter and Moreton to cease interjecting.

She and the Liberal Party have made history. She brings to this place experience in small business, the types of skills that our members bring to this place in the construction of policy. She knows that, of her electors—people in Box Hill, Box Hill North and Glen Waverley—71,469 taxpayers in the electorate of Chisholm will be better off as a result of the tax cuts that passed this parliament. More than 26,000 of them will receive the full $1,080 as a result of the legislation that passed this parliament.I can inform the House that, as of today, 3½ million Australians have lodged a tax return for the 2018-19 year. Thats nearly 25 per cent more than at the same period last year. I can also inform the House that the Australian Taxation Office has paid out refunds of $4.1 billion. Thats money flowing into the pockets of Australians, because this side of the House believes that Australians should earn more and keep more of what they earn. The legislation that we passed will ensure that Australians will pay a marginal rate of no more than 30c in the dollar if they earn between $45,000 and $200,000. That is tackling bracket creep. So, if you get a promotion, you work a few extra hours or you take a second job, youre not likely to pay a higher marginal rate of tax. Were abolishing a whole rate of tax—the 37c bracket has gone, against the wishes of those opposite—and were lifting the threshold for the 19c bracket from $37,000 today to $45,000.While we stand for lower taxes, those opposite stand for $387 billion of higher taxes. The member for Rankin said he was proud and pleased of the retiree and housing taxes. The member for Barton said that the tax policies they took to the last election were good policies. No wonder the Leader of the Opposition has not changed his tax policies; he still believes tax reform means higher taxes for all Australians.

The result of that is we have interests in family farms, and mine are fully declared through my family company, as has been widely reported in the media.The reason this issue came up is that several years ago, before I was in this current role, I sought to ensure that my farmers in the electorate of Hume were being fairly treated under a revised EPBC listing. That revised EPBC listing was having an impact on and creating concerns with my farmers, which were raised by the New South Wales Farmers and the National Farmers Federation on several occasions.I read from a letter to the Treasurer at that time: At the time the listing was made, the NFF raised the following points in a submission to the department of the environment—this is a letter to the now Treasurer, the then Minister for the Environment and Energy. The letter goes on to say: The information available for public consultation did not provide any quantified assessment of the extent, distribution and the quality of the listing. The information provided as part of the review did not adequately analyse the ongoing risks. And, thirdly, Based on the information provided, in the NFFs view it is highly unlikely that an individual farmer would be able to assess their responsibilities under the EPBC.

Her supporters are up in the gallery today.As the member for Reid knows, two weeks ago we reached another incredible milestone of the $16 billion WestConnex project—and that was the opening of the M4 tunnel from Homebush to Haberfield. This 5.5-kilometre tunnel is an absolute game changer for constituents in the member for Reids electorate and right across Sydney because it now means that a person driving from Parramatta to the CBD can avoid 22 sets of traffic lights and will save 20 minutes when going from Parramatta to the CBD. If you were doing that daily over the course of a week you would save 3½ hours. Every single week thats 3½ hours you could spend with your family, with other loved ones, on the sporting field or doing things you want to do rather than being stuck in traffic. This is an absolute congestion-busting project at its best, making a real difference to thousands of peoples lives on a daily basis.Whats more it has a great economic impact, because when you clear some of the traffic—like is happening on Parramatta Road—and make that journey 20 minutes faster, its better for tradies and for trucks distributing goods. So its better for the economy overall. There were also 4,000 jobs in construction on this project and 16,000 jobs overall during the construction of the WestConnex project. So it is a great congestion-busting project and its great for the economy. Given these fantastic attributes, Im both disappointed and astounded that the Labor Party, the opposition, are still so against the WestConnex project.Just a few years ago the Leader of the Opposition, when he was the transport spokesperson, said that he didnt support this project, because its a road to nowhere. Parramatta is a road to nowhere? Furthermore, he said, If Im the transport minister, there will not be a single dollar going into this project. We dont believe that Western Sydney is nowhere. Were on the side of those residents in Western Sydney who want to be able to get through traffic more quickly. Were building infrastructure in Western Sydney to make it easier for them to get home sooner and safer. Were on the side of all Australians who want to bust congestion, improve the economy and get home sooner and safer.

I know how important regional connectivity is to him and his electorate. This government is committed to supporting Australians through adversity. The member would well know the challenges being faced by many communities across Australia. We are focused on delivering better connectivity for the people in our communities to grow their businesses, employ more people, stay connected with their family and friends, and respond to emergency situations.I can confirm that the base station in Maroondan, in the southern end of the member for Flynns electorate, was recently switched on to provide improved coverage for the communities in the area, such as Gin Gin. This tower is further evidence of the member for Flynns record of delivering for his constituents, with 22 base stations now reducing blackspots in his electorate. Its also evidence of this governments continued and wide-ranging support of drought-affected communities, like Gin Gin, through infrastructure investment throughout those communities.As well as direct financial support, these communities need a way to communicate, share stories and be connected to the services that they need. It is thanks to the governments $380 million Mobile Black Spot Program that more regions like Maroondan are being provided with better mobile coverage. The member for Page and his constituents would also know the benefits that the Mobile Black Spot Program is providing, with a tower at Yorklea, just near Casino, switched on only this week. The record investment has funded 1,047 towers across all corners of the country, with more than 740 already on air and delivering their coverage. With a base station in his electorate turned on just yesterday, the member for Wide Bay, as a former police officer, would be pleased to know that having these towers on air has enabled more than 25,000 triple 0 calls to be made. More towers make more of these life-saving calls possible.And were not done yet. Round 5 of the program is currently open so we can continue to forge ahead with our commitment to improve rural connectivity. Were committed to providing those who choose to live and run businesses in the regions with the same coverage as their city counterparts. Thats why the Liberal-National government is building new phone towers across the country, while those on the other side have built none. There has been some talk on the other side about dates and time frames. Id like to give the members opposite a date and a time frame. How about we try February 2008?

Weve been able to negotiate third-country resettlement options, including with the US, and 585 people have departed, as at 18 July, to go to the United States. Others have received provisional approval and are in the process of their predeparture arrangements.We want to make sure that the people smugglers hear a consistent message, because this government is on the side of Australians who want strong border protection policies to make sure that we can decide who comes to our country and the way in which they can be screened before they arrive. Its a very important point. There are biosecurity issues. There are identity issues in the modern age. The thought that somebody could turn up to our country without a passport or without identity documents in the 21st century is simply inconceivable. The reality is that we have been consistent from day one in relation to border protection matters. Weve been able to stand up to the people smugglers, but there is a very significant departure now between the two positions.The position of the government is in contrast to the position of the Labor Party. We know that during the course of this last election, only in May of this year, vessels had already departed in anticipation of a Labor government being elected. There were 41 people on a boat on their way to Australia anticipating a Labor government. The Labor Party had just before the election decided to introduce a very dangerous bill called the medevac law which again sent the wrong message to Sri Lanka, Indonesia and elsewhere. They have been all over the place for years now when it comes to border protection policy. This Leader of the Opposition is trying to be as sneaky as the last leader of the Opposition. Hes trying to pretend to the Australian people that hes on their side when it comes to border protection policies, but of course he is not. The Australian public has worked out Labor. They know that Labor remains weak on border protection policies and they know that if Labor was ever re-elected the boats would restart and kids would be back in detention.

210,0,1,0,0,1,"MemberContinuation","E3L","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr MORRISON: This week in the parliament, once again, our government demonstrated whose side were on, and it was very clear whose side the Labor Party was on. When it came to the issue of the drought fund on Monday, we came in here and stood up for the farmers, but the Labor Party had to be dragged kicking and screaming to actually support Australian farmers through the establishment of the drought fund. Last October at the Drought Summit—which brought together state and territory leaders and people from all around the country—this was one of the key actions. Im so pleased that this week weve been able to get the result and have been able to legislate this drought fund, which is part of a $7 billion response by this government to the drought, backing Australian farmers and rural communities and graziers all around the country.On top of that, we took action just like we did a couple of weeks ago when we took legislation through this parliament to provide tax relief to all Australians through a comprehensive plan. Again, the Labor Party showed they are not on the side of aspirational Australians who want to keep more of what they earn. They had to be dragged kicking and screaming. On this side of the House, we know what we want to do: we want to provide tax relief to hardworking Australians and we want to keep Australians safe. Thats why we brought legislation into this parliament that deals with the risk presented by foreign fighters. This is something we have been consistent on as a government, to keep Australians safe. We have taken action on this to ensure we can keep Australians safe in the face of the threat of foreign fighters. Weve taken action this week as we bring legislation into this House to ensure that dodgy, militant unions cannot thieve the earnings of workers in this country—that they cannot go and set up these dodgy funds and siphon off the earnings to their mates in all sorts of union funds which end up— (Time expired)","Morrison Government","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1[22]/answer/talk.text/body/p[11]","N/A","N/A"

230,0,0,0,1,1,"Marles, Richard, MP","HWQ","Corio","ALP","N/A",1062," As we gather here this afternoon, on the 66th day of its third term, there is one question above all others that screams from this place: what is the point of the Morrison government? I know what the point of the member for Dunkley is: she came here and, in her wonderful first speech, talked about a commitment to the reform and funding that our health system needs and to do whatever is required to ensure that Australia trains, retains and invests in the healthcare professionals and researchers who make our system great. But, if you are expecting any action from that side of the House with respect to health, you are sadly mistaken. For the last six years, theyve cut money from health, and thats all we can expect over the next three.I know what the point of the member for McNamara is, because he stands here ready to help ensure that our First Nations people are duly recognised in Australias Constitution. But, if youre hoping for action on recognition by the government, we saw everything we needed to see when the Minister for Indigenous Australians made his statement and was cut down by the Prime Minister within 24 hours.I know what the member for Jagajaga stands for. She believes there is a climate story powerful enough to drive the action that will allow humanity to survive and to flourish. But all weve heard from that side of the parliament in the last six years in relation to climate change is the steering of this country to a place of being a pariah in the international community when it comes to our action on climate change.I know what the member for Canberra stands for, because she said:We should invest in our nations children and give them the best start in life. Social security is one of the most powerful tools governments have to address and prevent poverty.That was said by a person who understands what social security can do to address poverty. But, if you look over to that side of the parliament, notwithstanding that the Prime Minister is a former Minister for Social Services, all you see is a policy-barren wasteland when it comes to social security.And I know what the member for Lilley is about. Shes here because nothing has more power to make or dismantle this nations future than this House. The work this House does shapes lives now and long into the future. But, if you were hoping for action from that side of the House to make this place more purposeful, you are sadly mistaken. They cannot even fill the speakers list with respect to their own legislation, and we are watching, as we stand here right now, the Senate, in its third week, running out of business.When you look at the wonderful first speeches that were made by the Labor members of this place—bursting with a sense of optimism, a sense of purpose, a sense of intent; why they have come to this place and want to make a difference on behalf of Australians all around this country—you cannot feel anything but proud of being a member of the party that we belong to. But, on that side of the House, there is absolutely nothing.The date of 18 May was significant. To be honest, it was a moment that harboured a lot of pain for those of us on this side of the House. But there is no group of Australians who are more surprised to be sitting where they are right now than those opposite. They spent most of last year and all of summer thinking about what they were going to be doing after politics. They were wondering where they were going to be going on their holidays. Now they are sitting there wondering what on earth it is theyre actually going to do.To give them a little bit of credit, they have managed to kind of effect a smugness distillery. You only need to look at the faces of all the members of their frontbench to see smugness in its purest form. If you look at the Prime Minister, it is literally dripping from him. The younger at heart amongst them no doubt have been bouncing back into the ministerial wing late at night when no-ones watching. Theyre doing the snow fairy on their blue carpet. You can imagine the cabinet meetings where theyre all getting round, wondering what to say and comparing which department has the best chesterfields and which departmental secretary is offering the best Scotch. But dont for a moment think that they have anything that resembles a policy and agenda for this country.The only people who have been busy at all are those responsible for spin. This week they came up with a line which was: whose side are you on? Theres a certain irony about that, because the one thing we know about these people is that they are certainly not on the side of the Australian people. If it is measured by who they are focused on, the only side they seem to care about is this side. Because, since 2 July, when they came back here, the only thing they have done in this parliament is seek to wedge Labor.In the very first week, the week of 2 July, we were seeking to put $1,000 into the pockets of nurses, shop assistants and people who work in restaurants. But the government urgently wanted to hold all of that hostage to a tax plan which wasnt going to come into effect for six years, and they did that because they wanted to wedge Labor. Last week, the Leader of the Opposition attended the Bush Summit in Dubbo. He made clear to all assembled that Labor was willing to support a drought package of whatever size the government wanted to put forward out of recurrent funding and wanted to ensure that that package actually got into the hands of farmers right now. But what we had from the government was a proposition which sought to attach all of that to the Building Australia Fund, a fund which they have been trying to destroy since the day they were elected to office back in 2013. Whats worse, not a cent would flow from their proposition for an entire year.Of course, weve had old faithful: national security. The Minister for Home Affairs came up here and talked about temporary exclusion orders, a regime which he knows we support. But he has tried to attach it to the junking of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, a committee which has done critically important work in this country to make sure that national security legislation is fairer, better and stronger for our nation.Whatever else is going on here, there is no agenda for the Australian people. Anyone in this parliament would know it, and people in this town know that the government havent been governing for years. Its why our economy is stagnant right now. Its why weve got net debt which, under this mob, has doubled. Gross debt is at a record level. Indeed, debt is growing faster now than at the time of the global financial crisis. When they came to office, we were the eighth-fastest-growing economy in the OECD. Today we are the 20th. There is not a worker in this country who doesnt know that the stand-out stat in the economy today is stagnant wages, and this government has been responsible for the single biggest deindustrialisation in our economy since Federation.Since 2013, we have had one of the most severe droughts that this country has ever faced. Yet do you imagine that we would get anything like a long-term strategic drought policy from the government? Weve had none of it. What we have had is a drought envoy, a drought coordinator, a drought summit and a drought task force. Now were going to get a drought parliamentary committee. But, if you think our farmers are going to get a meaningful drought policy from the government, youve got another think coming.When it comes to national security and the very difficult issue of our borders, at a time when we have the largest number of displaced people on the planet since the Second World War, what you have is Labor coming to the table every day with sincerity, trying to solve a wicked problem in a way that stops people dying and has Australia taking its part in the world. But what youve got over here is deep cynicism. Youve got a Prime Minister who went to Christmas Island this year to do nothing other than put out a welcome sign by opening the Christmas Island detention centre in the most cynical way in the lead-up to the election. And whenever you hear that number from the Minister for Home Affairs, as we did today, of the 1,200 people who lost their lives between 2010 and 2013, just remember that 650 of them died after this mob cynically stopped the Malaysian solution back in 2011.So what I do know is that they are not for the Australian people, but I also know this: when you look at the wonderful first speeches from this side of the House, when you look at the intent and purpose which they embody, that is the spirit which is going to carry us from this side of the House to that side of the House in three years time when we face the people.","Morrison Government","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr MARLES (Corio—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) ","(15:25):"
231,0,0,0,1,1,"Hawke, Alex, MP","HWO","Mitchell","LP","N/A",1064," I dont know what to make of that contribution from the member for Corio except to say that, when youve won one of the last nine elections, youd think you might learn a thing or two from the signal that the Australian people have been trying to send you. In case the Labor Party hasnt picked it up, winning one out of nine means youre doing something wrong.There is no greater tribute to a governments agenda or a political partys agenda than when your opponents copy your agenda completely. Since the re-election of the Morrison government, what have we heard from the Labor Party? What are the issues that the Labor Party have been talking about in this parliament? Theyve asked us to pass more tax cuts and to pass faster and deeper tax cuts. Theyve told us that theyre in favour of drought relief. Theyve said to us that they are tough on intelligence and national security. And weve just heard from the member for Corio the absolute clincher that they are for stronger borders. What do we make of a Labor Party that tells us that theyre for lower, simpler, fairer taxes, that they want more drought relief, that theyre tough on national security and intelligence, and that theyre for stronger borders? Whose agenda does that sound like? Ive got a news flash for the member of Corio. If we did a quiz and asked the Australian people to pick the government—if we asked, Is this a Liberal-National government or a Labor government?—99 per cent of Australians would tell you, Thats a Liberal-National government for sure.And who is it thats passing the tax cuts? Who is it thats keeping economic confidence moving in this country? Its the Morrison government. The first thing that this government did was to pass tax cuts for hardworking Australians in defiance of a years assault on the working class of this country from the Labor Party—a socialist assault from a left-wing Labor Party. And the Australian people are supposed to forget or to blank out the rhetoric that you brought to this parliament over the last 12 months against hardworking people, against the middle class, against anyone who owned and operated their own business in this country, and against people that have worked hard their entire lives and put aside money for their own retirement? You brought the economic pain to this parliament over the last 12 months, and the Australian people rejected it in favour of a Liberal-National government.And now you want to replicate us. Youve become replicators. We should pass more tax cuts and pass them faster. Have you blanked out the first week of the parliament? You tried to lecture us on tax cuts. We werent passing our tax agenda fast enough, you told us. Do you suppose weve forgotten who you are and what you represent? Of course we havent. On national security, to hear members of the Labor Party today tell us that we should pass our foreign fighter laws faster and that Minister Dutton isnt strong enough on national security—what an absolute farce you have become! Ive served in the Home Affairs portfolio with Minister Dutton. We have tried to pass these foreign fighter laws for years. Weve been slowed down by the Labor Partys obfuscation on bill after bill, year after year, amendment after amendment. As we heard in question time the other day, there were 41 amendments put up, only for you to vote for the bill. Not one of them got up. What are you trying to achieve? Then you say we arent moving these bills through the parliament fast enough. Ive got a news flash for you again: this is your fault. The reason they havent moved through this parliament fast enough is that you have delayed their passage. When you had the numbers in the Senate, you used those numbers to delay passage of these bills.Dont come in here in a new parliament, where youve won one out of the last nine elections, where youve had a signal from the Australian people yet again—why? Because we now have the ability to work with the crossbench and were passing bills. Weve already passed tax cuts for hardworking Australians, for the middle class of this country, to make sure that the marginal tax rates are lowered, that bracket creeps addressed, that our economy is moving again but also that our national security is the top priority of the government. Thats called a real agenda.Our temporary exclusion orders bill that we are dealing with now in this place is the top priority of the Morrison government. Why? Because foreign fighters—we tried to deal with this in the last parliament, made unworkable by the obfuscation of the Labor Party. So it is unbelievable for you to come in here and say: Minister Dutton is not tough enough on national security. Youd be laughed out of every pub in Queensland—indeed, you were laughed out of every pub in Queensland at the last election. Take it to the pubs in your electorate and say, Minister Duttons not tough enough on national security. I dare you to go down there and tell them, because you arent seeing this picture—and its not my job to tell you, Ive got to confess, what youre doing wrong. Ill probably stop in a minute because I dont want to give you too many pointers. Keep doing what youre doing.For you to tell this government that when we take our responsibilities for national security, the security of the country, as our prime responsibility to Australians—moving legislation through this House that weve tried in previous parliaments that we are now delivering to make sure that those foreign fighters cannot return to our borders to commit acts of harm and violence against Australian citizens and against our own territory—you are wrong to suggest that we do not have a very strong agenda. Youre wrong to suggest that dealing with drought relief as an immediate priority of a re-elected government is not a national priority—that somehow thats not an agenda.

In fact, especially when youre in government, thats really job description 101. It seems that those opposite havent clocked that the election is over, they won and now its time to get on with the job. Theyve had six years, and I still dont think theyve worked out how to govern and what it means to have a vision for this country.Theyre still obsessed with Labor. Their words suggest theyre driven by one goal and one goal only, and that is to do things that are meant to be a test for Labor. We are up for any test that you care to put our way. Theres no discussion on the other side about whats best for this country, whats best for Australia. There is no vision. Or perhaps there is, and theyre too afraid to outline it to us. There are no plans to deal with the myriad of issues that we are facing. Whats the plan for the NBN in my electorate of Macquarie where we need to see how we can improve FTTN and we need to see how uneven technologies that are creating different playing fields for different people are going to be fixed? There is no plan for the forgotten houses of NBN who might never get that connection. Whats the plan for the water supply for the growing Western Sydney population? Whats the plan for flight paths from the second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek? Whats the plan to protect the Blue Mountains, and the rest of Western Sydney, from aeroplane noise 24 hours a day? They have no idea what theyre in for. Whats the plan for improving funding for schools, hospitals and preventative health care? Wait a minute. The plan is to keep cutting health and education.Whats the plan to make sure that people get proper access to the NDIS and that providers can stay viable in the face of long plan delays? Whats the plan for providing improved mental health services, especially for the Hawkesbury and for young people when theres no access to headspace? Whats the plan for ending homelessness? Whats the plan for housing affordability? Whats the plan for lower power prices? What is the plan for PFAS contamination at Richmond RAAF base? There is no plan to decontaminate mass areas of soil and water.Whats the plan for dealing with drought now? Whats the plan for Newstart, for making sure that people who are unemployed are adequately supported while they search for work? Whats the plan for raising the rate? Whats the so urgently needed plan for making ParentsNext a less punitive program? Whats the plan for tackling climate change? We know the answer to that one. There just flat out isnt one. This is in the too-hard basket not because science and industry dont have answers but because implementing anything meets opposition not from us but from within the coalition. Whats the plan for recognising First Peoples? Again, nothing; not because they expect opposition from us but because they cant get agreement between themselves and appear to not even be trying.No wonder the Senate has again run out of business. There is no vision, no plan and no destination that this government is taking us to. The problem is: if you leave a vacuum, something will fill it. What were seeing is that the backbenchers can see that theres no plan and theyre filling it. Every backbencher is coming up with an idea they dreamt up over Sunday lunch. What plans have we had so far? Weve had the plan for nuclear power plants. Earlier in the week we had the plan to ditch the legislated superannuation guarantee increase to 12 per cent. Today its a plan to scrap superannuation altogether and make it something you do if you feel like it. Goodness knows what the plan will be tomorrow.With no agenda it is no wonder that this government is failing to steer the economy, which really needs some direction. We all know that interest rates are at their lowest since the GFC. It might be okay for people trying to buy a house, but it isnt good for anyone trying to live off their earnings. Net debt has more than doubled and gross debt is at record highs. Both of these have gone up faster under the Liberals watch than when we were in government. Remember that we dealt with the global financial crisis. We need direction and were not getting it from this government. Its about time they realised that they need to do the job.","Morrison Government","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms TEMPLEMAN (Macquarie) ","(15:43):"
234,0,0,0,1,1,"Dick, Milton, MP",53517,"Oxley","ALP","N/A",1067," Mr Deputy Speaker, doesnt it say it all that you had to give me the call? The government are so proud of their record and so proud of their agenda that they cant get more than one speaker to defend their record. Whats the member for Lindsay doing over there? She has a lot to say in here and has a lot of slogans about having a go and getting a go. Now is the time to put your money where your mouth is and start defending the government. Ill give some leeway to the member for Curtin; she hasnt given her first speech yet. But the chamber is empty.The MPI came through today. How good is this government? How good is the Prime Minister? Not one member of his government can defend or has any idea what this government is. Welcome to the club; neither do we. Neither do the people of Australia. Im going to do something I never thought Id do. In the debate today Im going to quote The Australian today. The editorial states, Ill-disciplined coalition MPs are indulging their egos. They are not my words and are not the deputy leaders words; they are the words of The Australian. The article states:The Canberra Balloon Spectacular may have been in March but the Festival of the Lazy Thought Bubble is playing out in the capital this week. Weve been treated by freestyling Coalition members and senators to a range of random ideas, from the superannuation guarantee to nuclear power, the pension assets test on the family home to the indigenous voice to parliament. The breakdown in discipline has got up the nose of Scott Morrison, who urged his team on Tuesday to stop airing the issue of a rise in the Newstart allowance and other thoughtlets via the media. Where there are issues that need to be explored, I would urge colleagues to use the internal processes available to each of us…Cue the new senator for New South Wales: Super row as new Lib senator defies PM. That lasted 24 hours from when the great man spoke to his party room meeting. Why is there so much breakout happening? Ill tell you why. Because this government, as the deputy leader said, had no clue for a third term, because they simply had no idea that they would be in a third term of government. The people of Australia have spoken. What are they delivering? A big fat zero.We know that the Australian economy has slowed to its weakest level since the tail end of the global financial crisis. Interest rates are three times lower. Growth is just 0.4 per cent for the March quarter and 1.8 per cent for the year. Australia is still in a GDP per capita recession. The national economy has gone from the eighth fastest growing economy in the OECD in 2013 to the 20th. Wages are growing eight times slower. Productivity has fallen for four consecutive quarters. Household spending is weak. Living standards are growing slower under the Liberals than under the previous Labor government. If I am wrong and this is incorrect, I will sit down and one of you people can take the call. Absolute silence as always—time and time again. The facts speak for themselves.It seems the members of the backbench arent the only ones coming forward with their own ideas on how to fix things. When you are in trouble in this place you always go to one person, the member for Hughes. Time and time again we know that. His idea this week was to rip-off and attack pensioners with that great idea of allowing the family home to be included in the assets test for the pension. I cant wait to tell pensioners in my electorate about that one. He went on to say, You dont want to force people out of their homes, but it is something you could look at. What planet are these people on? Give me a break.Then, during the break, I had the revelation of actually finding out who Senator Anne Ruston is. Two weeks ago I had to Google whoever she was when she went out and said, Pensioners have it too good as it is. Theyre getting a generous payment. Does anyone over there actually talk to anyone on a low income? Do you actually talk to pensioners? I challenge any member of the government to find a pensioner who says theyve got it good, because the pensioners I and every Labor member speak to are doing it tough. They need advocates and voices in this parliament. Sadly, because of the wacky thought ideas, the ill discipline and the crazy ideas that are coming forward from those opposite, we do not have an agenda for this third-term Morrison government. I simply say to the government today: get your act together. Start governing for Australia.","Morrison Government","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DICK (Oxley) ","(15:48):"
235,0,0,0,1,1,"Ryan, Joanne, MP",249224,"Lalor","ALP","N/A",1069," There it is again. Weve got a government bereft of an agenda and devoid of a vision. Lets face it: theyve just now proved that they are an organisational blackspot. They are the blackspots that they want to talk about all the time. They tell us theyll fund blackspots if theyre in regions. Well, this chamber is a blackspot region today. They cant manage to get speakers up on the MPI. There are flights leaving Canberra. Theyre in a hurry to get home. Again, theyre avoiding work in this place.The Australian people returned this government with some expectations. When they see this MPI today they will be sorely disappointed to find out that they cant get speakers on their own legislation, and to find out today that three times theyve failed to provide a pair in this place for someone on maternity leave. They cant get anything organised. They certainly have no agenda but they have got slogans. Theyve got slogans and theyve got a new one every day. We started, before the election, with, If you have a go, youll get a go. They persisted with that.Im going to share a constituents story here, because I think it pretty much tells the story of the last six years of the ATM government. I was contacted by a single mother in my electorate. She has three children all under 10 years of age. Her husband left her and her children. She sought support from our safety net. She applied in May 2018 for a single parent pension. This payment was not granted until February 2019. If theres an agenda item that those opposite need to put on their meeting schedule, thats it: Centrelink. They have no plan to improve the wait times, not for that mother, not for pensioners and not for students waiting for Austudy for over a semester. They have no plan to address those things.They have no plans to support growth areas, like the area that I represent. They have no plan to deal with the tens of thousands of bridging visas that they are granting. They are completely unaware that there are people who are tied up in that bridging visa program coming to my office to say, Joanne, my son is turning five. He needs to go to school. They come into my office, as I am an educator and a former school principal who knows the rules. There is no place for that child in the education system in this country without their family paying international fees, but you give them a bridging visa and tell them that their child can just sit at home and do nothing. Shame on this government.This is a government that not only is without an agenda and without a vision but also doesnt even know whats going on in this country. They dont even know how people are living. I tell you what they do have. They have some ideology. Every time we raise an issue, they come back with ideology. There is no vision and no plan; just ideology. They just have a determination to punish the most vulnerable in our communities. They just have a determination to ensure that those who live in certain postcodes know their place and stay in their place. They have no plan for education other than to entrench privilege and to keep those who have come from a lesser background down in their place. That is their agenda—if the government have one.I dont think they even know that theyre doing that. I dont think they know much at all about whats going on. I think the absolute best example of their ideology, over having a plan or vision, is that we are in this place waiting for legislation to deal with the recommendations of the Hayne royal commission into the banks. The whole country knows that that behaviour was not acceptable. The whole country knows that the government have done nothing to address those issues in this place over these last two sitting weeks. The government have done absolutely nothing. With the royal commission into aged care or the royal commission into abuse of the disabled, what hope do the Australian people have that they will get anything from those royal commissions? What this government is doing in this country is absolutely shameful. Instead of saying, How good is Australia? they are saying, How good is ideology?","Morrison Government","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms RYAN (Lalor—Opposition Whip) ","(15:53):"
236,0,0,0,1,1,"Stanley, Anne, MP",265990,"Werriwa","ALP","N/A",1070," The signs were there in the lead-up to the election that the Liberals had no agenda and no purpose for this country. In my electorate of Werriwa, the government announced no plans, no additional spending and no additional infrastructure—nothing. The Labor Party had a plan for Werriwa. We had a long list of commitments: $2 million for the Middleton Drive extension, half a million dollars for the Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre, a fuel line to Western Sydney Airport and over $25 million in additional funding for schools. On a litany of issues, this government has no plan, no agenda and no purpose.It is a really strange place in history in which we currently find ourselves. We are confronted with major issues and existential challenges. Yet, despite these challenges, we are in a bizarre situation where we have the answers and we have solutions, but what we dont have is a government willing to act. The answers are there. The experts are telling us. The business sector is telling us. The community is telling us. On energy policy, the answers are there, and also on climate change and on reconciliation.In the previous term I had the privilege of sitting on the Energy and Environment Committee. In both public and private hearings the message was loud and clear: a well-functioning energy grid needs policy certainty. A stable energy grid must be underpinned by stable energy policy. Policy certainty addresses both pricing and supply. Policy certainty allows genuine long-term investment in power generation and provision. Certainty provides a stimulus for supply through new investments in plan and for innovation through funding, research and development. Instead, all weve got from this government is big sticks, then little sticks, then no sticks. And now apparently theyre replacing all those sticks with rods—nuclear fuel rods. Weve got backbenchers freelancing on nuclear power plants and the energy minister backing them in. Apparently he has an open mind when it comes to nuclear power.The minister needs to tell us where these nuclear power plants are going. Are we expanding Lucas Heights? What does the member for Hughes think about that? Or Perth? Perhaps the Gold Coast? Maybe Port Phillip Bay? While were discussing the energy minister, if youre hoping for climate change action on the part of the Morrison government youre going to be waiting for a long time. With government ministers saying A and backbenchers saying B and C, its clear that the Morrison government cant reconcile its own energy policy with its backbenchers.And while were on reconciliation, the way forward is clear: the Uluru Statement from the Heart is a national Indigenous consensus position. Our First Nation Australians are dying too soon, are educated far less, are incarcerated too often and suffer more preventable disease. The numbers show the tragedy in real terms. Over a quarter of incarcerated adults in this country are First Nation Australians. Nearly half of all juveniles incarcerated are First Australians. In 2017, suicide was the leading cause of death among our First Australian children. And we cant come to any policy certainty. It is terrible. One in 10 households in public housing are Indigenous. That says how much we are helping them and looking towards their future. The Constitution can no longer be a mark of a white man settlement here. It must recognise those who were here first and their deep connection to their land and their culture. The Minister for Indigenous Affairs appears to share the Labor Partys views on constitutional recognition. But in no less than a week after apparent bipartisan commitment we saw a captains recall from Prime Minister Morrison in respect of what Minister Wyatt had said.We on this side are committing to ensuring that our First Nation people are recognised, respected and supported. Where is the governments plan? What is the plan on climate change and on energy policy? This government is short on plans and has no purpose. Im feeling generous. The Labor Party and I and all my colleagues on this side of the House took lots and lots of great ideas to the election. And do you know what? Lots of people voted for those policies. I really encourage those on the opposite benches to take some of ours. Wed be happy for our people to start getting what they deserve out of this country.","Morrison Government","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STANLEY (Werriwa—Opposition Whip) ","(15:58):"

The devastating effects of this drought and dealing with this drought is the No. 1 priority for the communities of my electorate. I was really heartened by the visit to the region recently by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, Senator McKenzie and the member for Parkes, as well as a number of state MPs. It highlights the importance of this issue and the driving purpose of this government to deal with the devastating effects of drought in this region.This week, in terms of priorities, I think we saw it writ large in the passing of the Future Drought Fund Bill and how important that will be to country communities. How disappointing it was that, in the face of what is a national emergency, the opposition chose to play politics with it right until the end—the very end! There can be no more important priority than dealing with the fallout from the drought. It is affecting farmers. Its having a devastating impact at the farm gate. But the impact of drought is also being felt in our country communities. Ive spoken to constituents in the electorate of Calare who are running small businesses, and some of them havent had a decent income for two or three years now. They are burning through retirement savings just to keep open the doors of their businesses. I think thats one of the reasons why our communities were so pleased to see key decision-makers putting this issue front and centre, making sure that dealing with the devastating impacts of this drought was one of the key purposes, one of the key drivers, of this government.I know the Drought Communities Program has been very well received right across the central west. Ive called in this House many times for drought relief to be ramped up as conditions worsen. Ive been very pleased that the call has been answered, particularly with respect to the Drought Communities Program. I know, for example, Bathurst Regional Council has submitted about 14 projects, which are currently being assessed.","Morrison Government","MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[14]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GEE (Calare—Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister) ","(16:03):"

The Deputy Prime Minister has made it very clear through the dozens of questions—if you could call them that—that were put to him in question time this week about the many great things that are happening in infrastructure right across Australia. In my own part of the world, Dixons Long Point, the crossing over of the Macquarie River between Orange and Mudgee, is a priority. I note that Deputy Speaker Hogan was out there recently, about three weeks ago, inspecting the site. Weve been progressing that project. I had discussions with the department and Mid-Western Regional Council just this morning about how that project can be progressed and how we can get the money out the door, because this government is all about delivery, unlike those opposite, who continue to play petty politics on matters of public importance when legislation is passing through this House. Theyve been calling quorums all day. I think it shows a very petty approach and shows that they are sinking to the lowest common denominator. We saw that in question time today.

Lets reflect on what has happened in the drought space over the last six years. For six years they have had an opportunity to do something for our drought-affected farmers, and what have they done? It is pretty much zip. Weve had a drought envoy, a drought coordinator, a drought summit and a drought task force. We had the Select Committee on Regional Development and Decentralisation. It took a year to report, and its recommendations were, of course, ignored. And now weve got the Select Committee on Regional Australia. All they have done is change the title of the committee. And when is it going to report? July 2020. Theyre going to take another year now, after six years, to work out what we should be doing about the worst drought in our history. And what is familiar about that date? I know!

Ill endeavour to limit my remarks to that time so that it can certainly pass in due course. This is, in many respects, obviously, a very good day for East Timor. Timor-Leste has had such a long struggle for self-determination, and Australias role in that has not always been covered in glory, from the beginning—there was the Indonesian invasion, and Australia did not come to the aid of those in Timor-Leste but, instead, stood by and in fact endorsed the invasion—through to some of the more recent acts. The history of Australias relationship with Timor-Leste, which has led us to the point of this treaty, has not always been glorious. It has caused an immense amount of pain and suffering in some respects to the people of Timor-Leste. But the long struggle for self-determination for the people of Timor-Leste and control over their own resources, including over their oil resources, is something that has now reached a point—again, perhaps not in the fairest of ways—and the Timor-Leste parliament has said this is a treaty that should be approved. And it is now something that the Australian parliament and the Australian government is going to do, which is also very significant, because of course the amount of resources that are the subject of this treaty is significant.Of course, the Greens will have our view about the future role of fossil fuels, and we will continue to push for a phasing-out of fossil fuels and replacement with renewable energies, including the oil that is subject to this debate. But what we do not quibble with is that the country—in this case, Timor-Leste—that has responsibility for those resources in its area should be the one to decide what happens to them and the one who gets the benefit. So, yes, we will be making a transition away from fossil fuels, but that should not come at the expense of countries like Timor-Leste.In regard to the negotiations that have led up to this treaty or agreement that were being asked to ratify in this legislation, there is in law a concept of unconscionability. The concept of unconscionability basically says that, where theres a massive imbalance of power between two parties and one has access to knowledge and resources that the other doesnt, that should be taken into account in determining what is fair and that youve got to, if not show restraint, at least conduct yourself as a model nation. That is not what Australia has done in the lead-up to this treaty that forms part of this bill. That is not what Australia has done.You would think that, at a minimum, basic principles of fairness and decency to our neighbours would mean you would sit down and have negotiations on a level playing field. You wouldnt think that the more powerful side would go in and bug the negotiations of the other side. That is the kind of stuff that we accuse other companies or other countries of doing and condemn it when it happens. Its the kind of stuff that we say is about manipulating the outcomes of elections or should be the subject of legislation to restrict it. Instead, what happened? We had a neighbour whom we have not always treated well, although at some stages we have come to their assistance. I should note that previous governments—indeed, previous Howard governments—deploying Australian military forces to assist the people of East Timor was something that even the Greens supported, notwithstanding our founding principles of peace and nonviolence. That was actually a good use of international deployment to ensure that people who were otherwise being oppressed might have the opportunity to take their place as an independent nation and then be able to conduct negotiations like this. What did we do instead? Instead, we went in and bugged their negotiations. That is unconscionable. That is not how a country should behave towards someone else in its region, especially when its got a past that it has to atone for, especially when theres such a massive power imbalance and especially when there is so much at stake.The whistle was blown on that, and rightly so. And what did we do? In this country, we should be applauding whistleblowers, especially whistleblowers who say, Hang on, were treating a neighbour in a not very neighbourly way. Were treating a neighbour in a way that is going to cost one of the poorest countries in the world a lot of money and make it harder for them to continue to develop. But thats not what we did. When someone blew the whistle, they were prosecuted. They and their lawyer have been hounded. Im talking about this treaty that were being asked to ratify. Since then the prosecution of lawyer Bernard Collaery has been conducted by the government in a way that is incredibly oppressive. That is coming at a massive toll to him and is probably, I would say, designed on the governments part to do that. Im not criticising the conduct of the courts here; Im criticising the conduct of the government during this prosecution.Then there are other things that are within the governments control, like the ratification of this treaty that we are being asked to legislate today. The government has even dragged its heels on that. We know that Timor-Leste, until now, has been largely an aid-dependent country. Its revenues have been rapidly dwindling. The countrys sovereign wealth fund could have been empty within a few short years, in part because this government has dragged out the timing of ratification. That has come at enormous cost. It has come at a benefit for some companies and perhaps the government thinks that it has come at a benefit to this country, Australia, but it has come at enormous cost to Timor-Leste.Some estimates suggest that the revenue taken by Australia since the signing of the treaty now totals more than what Australia has given to Timor-Leste in foreign aid and more than Timor-Leste spends on health in a year. In other words, there is the history of the relationship and the history of the negotiations and then there is the prosecution of the whistleblower and the delay in ratifying the treaty to the point where it is costing a poor neighbour money that it simply cannot afford.This is a good day for Timor-Leste. We should not stand in the way of that, but we should also not attempt to whitewash the history and our failure to act in a way that we should to one of our neighbours.Question agreed to.Bill read a third time.","Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019, Passenger Movement Charge Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019, Treasury Laws Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[3]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BANDT (Melbourne) ","(16:18):"

This event was attended by over 130,000 people in two days. We collectively welcomed over 3,500 athletes who competed in over 14 sports during this years Easter weekend. Attendance numbers reached an all-time high at this years event, with Victoria Police and traffic wardens doing a great job dealing with that sort of crowd and the ancillary parking that resulted from it and confirming an attendance of 65,000 people on day 1 and over 70,000 people on day 2.Participants and their supporters arrived from major cities and regional areas of Australia. Overseas participants had travelled from New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, India, Canada and the United States. A total of 232 teams participated in various sporting competitions, which is a record in itself. Sports like swimming and touch football were added to the games this year. The president of the Melbourne organising committee, Davinder Singh Garcha, stated that we had an AFL cup that was part of the Australian Sikh Games for the first time ever, and we even had mens and womens ICC T20 world cups that were on site for the games. Kabaddi was a major drawcard, but so was soccer. Soccer was the most popular sport, with 91 teams competing. Apart from that, 40 teams competed in volleyball, with hockey competitions being moved to another venue to accommodate all of the games.The 32nd Australian Sikh Games was a wonderful community event. A total of $700,000 was raised by individual contributions from the Indian and Sikh community across Australia. Id like to commend the Australian government for their grant of $120,000 for the Sikh Games. I also congratulate Daniel Andrews and his Victorian government for their grant of $220,000 for these games and the City of Casey, led by the mayor, Amanda Stapledon, for their grant of $50,000 and for providing brilliant venues such as Casey Fields for these games.One of the highlights was the festival area that was created to cater for the large crowds, and there were massive crowds, as Ive said. It included large-scale cultural and entertainment performances, as well as food stalls, which were provided absolutely free for everyone that attended the games. I especially wish to thank and congratulate a very unique individual, Amanjot Bedi, and his family from Melbourne, who served meals to all those who visited the games over the three days. Thats 180,000 to 200,000 plates of food that were provided by the Bedi family, which is an amazing achievement. We cant thank the Bedi family enough for their outstanding contribution in providing that food to these games.I also especially want to thank the hundreds of volunteers who were on hand when needed to serve food and to provide assistance during the sporting events. Sporting events like these just cant run without the support of volunteers, and I congratulate them on their community spirit. I also wish to thank and congratulate the SBS Punjabi team, who were at the venue, for their extensive coverage of these games during the Easter weekend. When I attended it was amazing to see the large crowds not only visiting the stalls but also watching the sporting events throughout the day.We had good weather during the Easter long weekend, and it is claimed that, as a consequence of the crowds and the offerings from the sports and cultural stalls that were there, this 32nd annual Sikh Games at Casey Fields were the best ever. They were made possible by the tireless efforts of the organising committee, led by Davinder Singh Garcha, the president of the games organising committee, and the many volunteer organisations that helped. I also want to pass on a special word of thanks to the Sikh Volunteers Australia team, who did an amazing job to not only serve but also help with the clean-up and removal of rubbish from the venue.In my constituency we have a large Sikh community, and its great to see that they were able to attend these games at Casey Fields and also to participate at the Casey Stadium, Casey RACE, Bunjil Place, the Hunt Club and Clyde Recreation Reserve. The City of Casey, when its mentioned, is not obviously associated with multiculturalism, but there is a growing group of communities from all over the world that are making Australia their home, making the city of Casey their home and doing it tremendously successfully. The City of Casey is starting to tell the story of the great movement of people from all over the world who are making Casey their home and making their life there. This is an outstanding example of a group of people who have done that and have contributed not just to their community but to the broader community through these games.","Australian Sikh Games","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BYRNE (Holt) ","(16:30):"
263,0,0,0,1,1,"Leeser, Julian, MP",109556,"Berowra","LP","N/A",1079," In one of his first speeches as Prime Minister, Scott Morrison reflected on what he wanted to achieve. He said:My ambition is for an even stronger Australia—to keep our economy strong, to keep Australians safe and to keep Australians together.I want to reflect on his third aim of keeping Australians together. Nations are at their strongest when theyre united, when they believe they have more in common than in difference, when they see special significance in their shared identity and when they feel bonds of kinship that extend to the past, present and the future. The nation is important because, as Aristotle wrote, men are not self-sufficient. Our political community is necessary for us to flourish as people. Furthermore, a united nation is more confident and a confident nation is more creative, resilient and prosperous. As Kenneth Clark said in 1969:It is lack of confidence, more than anything else, that kills a civilisation. We can destroy ourselves by cynicism and disillusion, just as effectively as by bombs.One of the most powerful forces of division in recent years has been the rise of identity politics. Identity politics is the idea that people should be defined not by the national identity but by other personal attributes, such as gender, race, religion, class, sexual orientation, disability, cultural background or the experience of being a migrant.In a bewildering world where people are struggling to find meaning in their lives, a sense of identity can foster a sense of meaning, community and connection with other people. We are social creatures. As Frances Fukuyama observed, we crave dignity and respect from those around us. The rise in identity politics has accelerated with the decline of mass media and the rise of highly personalised news feeds and on-demand services, but the problem is not when people identify with others. It is when, in the context of public debate, the appeal to identity claims special standing for certain people based on their personal characteristics and experiences. These individual claims of identity threaten to eclipse our shared identity as Australians.In the context of political debate, identity claims to elevate the speaker beyond criticism, because no other speaker can access the speakers lived experience so they cant be in a position to judge if the speaker is right or wrong. Identity politics encourages us to talk past one another rather than engaging with one another to find common ground. Identity politics encourages groups to look inwards to their struggles and backwards to past injustices instead of outwards and forwards to cooperation. It is pessimistic and not constructive; it focuses on circumstances over capacities. It is the pursuit of emotional validation over a program for change. It is a dead end, especially for the most vulnerable. Ultimately, it is a recipe for more tribalism, loss of faith in our institutions and for abandoning those bonds that unite us as Australians.Many people have rightly criticised identity politics, but few have sought to acknowledge that the rise of identity politics reveals a need to bolster a greater sense of the national identity. How then should we bolster our national identity? We can start by reminding people of the things that we share in common and by making more opportunities to bring Australians together. I think we can do this in three ways, through education, national commemoration and the broader culture.First, we should amplify what young people are learning from Australias civic and political history so that they can take their full place as active citizens in this nation. They should understand the context of today, anchored in the traditions of our past. They should have an understanding that our democratic system of government is designed to serve them. They should believe they have a stake—indeed, the largest stake—in Australias future.Second, we must make more of occasions of national commemoration. In recent years, the commemorations of the Centenary of Anzac were a great example. Australians remembered and reflected on the stories of heroism and sacrifice of Australias citizen soldiers in World War I, which did much to shape our character. These events were bolstered by public commemorations in every town and suburb—indeed, in every ethnic community—across Australia. The next major opportunity for national commemoration is 2020, when we will commemorate the 250th anniversary of the arrival of Captain Cook in Australia. This is not only another chance for us to reflect on Cooks achievements and on where Australia sits within the history of the West, but its also a chance for all Australians to reflect on their own beginnings in this land.Third, we can make more of the national identity through its reflection in the broader culture. We can start this by making more of Australia Day. Other than citizenship ceremonies, most Australians use Australia Day to enjoy the sunshine; but we need to use Australia Day as a day to gather as a family, to tell stories, to learn more about our Indigenous heritage—which is the heritage of all Australians—and to see the day for what it really is: a day to reflect on our beginnings. Those are not only our national beginnings but also the story of how each of our families came to Australia and how this narrow story fits into the broader shared national story. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but they are a few steps we can take to help achieve the Prime Ministers aims of bringing Australians together.","Australia","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LEESER (Berowra) ","(16:35):"

So perhaps we can do that in private.Today I want to talk about type 1 diabetes, which is an issue that Ive taken up that is very close to my heart. This year my husband, David, and I were once again honoured to be invited to attend the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation gala dinner in Perth and to hear from a range of speakers, including the CEO Mike Wilson, who does a wonderful job in raising awareness of type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disorder that is not associated with lifestyle. We still dont know where it comes from.At the gala we also heard from a young lady, named Ayesha Razvi, who talked to us about her trials of living with type 1 diabetes. Also at that event, we heard from the CEO Mike Wilson and some other contributors about some of the trials of young people in accessing continuous glucose monitors. I must commend the government for making continuous glucose monitors more available to people suffering from type 1 diabetes. However, the conditions for accessing continuous glucose monitors are such that, after the age of 21, young people no longer have access to the CGMs. We heard at the JDRF gala dinner that for some young people the only way they can get access to the continuous glucose monitors after the age of 21 is to allow themselves to go into a hypoglycaemic state, which requires either ambulance attendance or hospitalisation. Once theyve done that they again become eligible to access the funding for the continuous glucose monitors. This situation means that young people are putting their lives at risk to access these life-saving monitors that help them to manage their diabetes and that theyve spent some years getting used to. Consequentially, I wrote to the health minister, asking him to consider increasing access to continuous glucose monitors for people over the age of 21 who may be in financial hardship and unable to afford them so that they dont risk their lives by deliberately going into hypoglycaemic incidents where they have to be hospitalised or where an ambulance has to attend.Typically, type 1 diabetes appears and is diagnosed in adolescence. So it is a disease and a disorder that predominantly affects young people, though Ive also met with some adults who have type 1 diabetes and who got type 1 diabetes in adulthood. Recently, one of my constituents, who is in his 70s, came to talk to me about his type 1 diabetes. He actually got type 1 diabetes after a motorcycle accident. As I said earlier, we dont know what causes type 1 diabetes or what brings it on. Its not hereditary. We desperately need more research into what causes type 1 diabetes—not just in the management of type 1 diabetes but also in the attempt to find a cure for type 1 diabetes.There are currently around 120,000 Australians living with type 1 diabetes and seven Australians a week get diagnosed with T1D. As I said, recently we heard the announcement to increase funding for the continuous glucose monitors, covering people under the age of 21, pregnant women and some other people—for example, people with a valid concessional status and people who have a high risk or a clinical need that requires evidence.I would like to finish by commending the JDRF for the amazing work they do, and the CEO, Mike Wilson, for his dedication to finding a cure for type 1 diabetes; and all people who generously donate to the JDRF. Hopefully, one day we can end T1D.","Diabetes","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALY (Cowan) ","(16:40):"
265,0,0,0,1,1,"Thompson, Phillip, MP",281826,"Herbert","LNP","N/A",1081," In the words of our fantastic Prime Minister, If you have a go, you get a go, and thats exactly what I had the pleasure of seeing in my electorate of Herbert just last week at the Townsville Jobs Fair. On a regular Wednesday afternoon, the Murray stadium was abuzz with hundreds and hundreds of jobseekers meeting face-to-face with the people who could well become the ones that give them that go.The jobs fairs have been operating around the country as part of the Department of Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business initiative. I want to thank the minister for bringing the jobs fair to our city for the first time, because it was an absolute success. Here are some of the numbers. There were 1,352 jobseekers through the doors; 53 exhibitors set up stalls in the stadium; and 931 jobs were on offer, a description of each one pinned on the jobs board. This was probably the most popular aspect of the event, giving attendees a one-stop shop to see if there was anything out there that might suit their skills and abilities. It was so great to see people eagerly taking note of career opportunities which could potentially spell the beginning of a promising new chapter in their lives.But, of course, not everyone has experience in writing resumes and applying for jobs, and time-pressured bosses are looking for one piece of paper in a pile of hundreds which really stands out. Thats why experts were on hand to give practical assistance on how to lay out CVs and even how to approach the most nerve-racking of job interviews. Its still being determined how many jobs were filled, but my assessment from the feeling on the ground was that the day had been an overwhelming success.To me, the Townsville Jobs Fair highlights the increasing confidence in the local economy of my electorate and shows that the Australian governments policies are working. Our nation has seen 11 consecutive months of employment growth, and 20,000 full-time jobs were created in the economy last month. Since the 2013 election, businesses have created almost 1.4 million jobs, and around 58 per cent of those have been full-time jobs. The Prime Minister has committed to the Australian people that, over the next five years, the government will set the stage for another 1.25 million jobs.We know that small and medium businesses are the engine room of our economy, and that is absolutely true for my electorate of Herbert. There are over 13,000 businesses in my electorate, and we need to make sure this number continues to grow. Thats why the coalition government is providing a hand-up for those wanting to start a small business. Many have been benefiting from the research and development tax incentive, which helps businesses offset some of the costs that come with having a great idea and making it profitable. Over the last three years, nearly $1 million has been granted to 23 businesses in my electorate as part of the Department of Industry, Innovation and Sciences Entrepreneurs Program. Lets not forget the student sponsorships, Australia-China Science and Research Fund, Women in STEM and Entrepreneurship, and National Science Week grants, all of which provide a cash injection to help small businesses in my electorate to get ahead and create new jobs.We also know that infrastructure projects create jobs too, and Townsville has a huge number of those, at just the right time. Last week, as part of the Townsville City Deal, the Deputy Prime Minister signed off on $195 million for stage 2 of the Haughton pipeline, which will see a staggering 691 construction jobs created, along with a further 30 new full-time ongoing roles. In addition, it will provide a boost to agricultural output of $3 million a year by making extra capacity from the Haughton channel available to irrigators. And of course the North Queensland Stadium will soon be home to the North Queensland Cowboys.Touching back on the jobs fair, it was wonderful to see people walking around in suits and ties as if it were an interview, taking it very seriously because in Townsville we have had high unemployment for a long time. This is the first time the jobs fair has been held there, and it was very humbling to see young people walking around, wanting to ask all the hard questions and wanting to speak to real employers because people want a job. I look forward to getting back to the electorate to speak to these jobseekers to find out exactly how they went.","Herbert Electorate: Employment","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr THOMPSON (Herbert) ","(16:45):"
266,0,0,0,1,1,"Dick, Milton, MP",53517,"Oxley","ALP","N/A",1082," Not so long ago I had the opportunity to address a Queensland Day rally. In fact this year was the 160th birthday of Queensland, as its official separation from New South Wales as an independent colony was on 6 June 1859. At this Queensland Day rally I had the opportunity to meet with, speak with and show my support to the thousands of Queenslanders and Australians employed by the mining and resources sector as part of recognising and celebrating the contribution of mining and resources to our great state and country.For decades, mining and resources have been the backbone of the Queensland economy. Over 300,000 Queensland jobs are supported by resources. In 2017-18 alone, mining and resources contributed $5.2 billion in wages for Queensland workers; $4.3 billion in royalties to pay for our schools, hospitals and roads; and a total of $69.9 billion to the Queensland economy. Thats $1 in every $5 of the Queensland economy and one in every eight jobs provided, thanks to mining and resources. Its not hard to see why mining is so important to Queensland. On top of this, the mining and resources sector has a supply chain of over 14,000 Queensland businesses and assists with more than 1,200 community organisations.It seems like every day that the latest national economic data is showing Australias economy weakening, with the slowest growth in a decade and, sadly, living standards continuing to fall. This government, however, seems not to be bothered by this. Even calls from the Reserve Bank governor to give the economy the boost it so desperately needs have gone unheard and ignored. Despite this, the mining and resources sector continues to provide stability not only in my home state of Queensland but right across the country.In May 2019, Australias world-class resource sector generated a record high of $24.9 billion in export earnings for the nation, or 60 per cent of total export income. This was also a record-breaking month for Australian iron ore exports, which accounted for $8.8 billion in export earnings. In fact, the ABS monthly figures show that in the first five months of the calendar year 2019 compared with 2018 iron ore exports increased by 35.4 per cent to $34.6 billion; coal exports by seven per cent to $27.5 billion; and LNG exports by 45.1 per cent to $20.7 billion. In the same period, total resources and energy exports increased by 19.8 per cent compared with the same period in 2018, to $115.8 billion.But we must not take these figures for granted. We must ensure that Canberra and governments of all persuasions back in our resources sector and regional communities to support the economy, support jobs and support our councils that are doing it tough. We must strengthen our ties and commitments to our communities and our councils to make sure that they keep delivering for our mining communities.There are many bodies who already provide leadership in this area, like the Minerals Council of Australia, and I offer my welcome and congratulations to the newly appointed chair of the Minerals Council, the Hon. Helen Coonan. The council has a long history of not only supporting traditional mining but also leading the sector in the 21st century with initiatives like hosting the Women in Mining and Resources Leadership Summit in Perth next month to help drive the business case for diversity and inclusion in Australias world-class resource sector.Its not just the Minerals Council who are taking these innovative steps. In an Australian first for the mining industry, Peabody Australia has recently announced eShepherd, an innovative technology to assist in cattle grazing trials on rehabilitated land. The industrys innovation doesnt just stop there. Even as the country moves forward towards more renewable energy, the demand and need for mining will remain strong. Electric vehicles, solar panels, wind turbines and battery storage technologies all require a complex mix of metals, many of which have previously been mined only in small amounts. These include cobalt; nickel; lithium for batteries used for electric vehicles and storage; and rare earth metals for permanent magnets, electric vehicles and some wind turbines and solar panels. There is no renewable future that does not include a strong mining and resources sector.Following the 2019 election, Ive been working alongside my friends the member for Hunter, the member for Brand and the member for Burt to work closer with our mining and resource industry to ensure their voices are heard and listened to. Today I recommit to listening to the voices of miners and those who work in our mighty resource industry. Im proud to say Im a friend of the mining and resources sector and will continue to support the industry in my role as a federal member so that Queenslanders and all Australians continue to enjoy the standard of living we have today and we provide the jobs of tomorrow in mining.I would like to add in conclusion that today is the last day of one of the attendants here, Mr Peyton Butler. Id like to thank him for his service. I know all members wish Peyton and his family the best for the years ahead.Honourable members: Hear, hear!

268,0,0,0,1,1,"Simmonds, Julian, MP",282983,"Ryan","LNP","N/A",1084," I rise this afternoon in the House to talk about my most favourite topic: infrastructure in the Ryan electorate, particularly its delivery. Our newest piece of federally funded infrastructure in the Ryan electorate is the stop, drop and go facility at Indooroopilly State School, which opened just last week at the start of the new school term. For the benefit of the House, this was a $3 million commitment made by the LNP government at the 2016 election. Following the election win, the funding was handed to the Brisbane City Council. I was pleased as the local councillor to shepherd this project through its design, consultation and then construction and to see it completed for our community.Now that it has been completed, it is an absolutely tremendous result for the local community. Its helping to reduce congestion around the school and its helping to make our kids safe. As part of the facility, we have extra drop-off room, which ensures that there isnt congestion queuing around onto Moggill Road. There are wider footpaths for the kids. Theres more shade and theres more seating to make sure that they wait away from the road. Importantly, theres a separation now between the through traffic, the drop and go traffic and the school traffic, so there are no more illegal U-turns. It is a great example of what I talked about in my maiden speech, where federal funding can be used for great local projects. A small amount of federal funding got this project out of the too-hard basket and got it built.Id like to pay tribute to Brisbane City Council. There were two people in particular who helped me see this project through to fruition, and they are Councillor Amanda Cooper, who is the infrastructure chairman, and Jacqui Neill in her office. They both did a tremendous job. Building infrastructure is hard, Mr Speaker, as Im sure that you know from your local area. Not everybody was happy, but it was an important project to get right. We did a lot of consultation with the school. We consulted with the local community as well. In the end, we got the best result that ensures the safety of our schoolchildren and also a reduction of congestion around this bottleneck which then flows onto Moggill Road.The project had one more very important benefit. When Scott Morrison made his visit to the Ryan electorate during the recent campaign, I took the Prime Minister to see this project, which was then under construction. Having seen the benefits of this project and seen what the relatively small amount of federal funding—$3 million—had yielded in congestion benefits in the Moggill Road corridor, I think it was no coincidence that, in the 2019-20 budget, further funding was made available to reduce congestion on the Moggill Road corridor. That includes a $25 million commitment for the Indooroopilly roundabout to see its transition into a T-intersection, which will help with reduced congestion on the Coonan Street corridor as well as on the through traffic on the Moggill Road corridor. I look forward to working with Brisbane City Council and Councillor Cooper on that project to get it delivered, having spent some time as the local councillor making sure that we purchased the land that was required as part of this and that we did a lot of design work as well. In the next few months, we will be going out to the local community to consult on those design options. I look forward to having that conversation with my community about how we can implement that structure project.And then of course there was funding available in the budget—$12.5 million—for the Kenmore roundabout to see an upgrade to bust congestion. I have to work with the state minister, Minister Bailey, to see that project to fruition. I havent had a lot of success with that in the past, but Im willing to give him and the state government the benefit of the doubt and assume that they wont look the gift horse of infrastructure funding in the mouth and that theyll work with the federal government and work with the federal minister, Minister Tudge, and myself in order to see this project come to fruition.At the recent election, I went to the people of Ryan and was elected on the back of protecting our lifestyle. A most important part of protecting our lifestyle is seeing us reduce congestion and undertake these congestion-busting projects. Id like to again thank the Indooroopilly State School community and congratulate them on a fantastic new facility. It was a great pleasure to be down there just last week, before I came to Canberra, to spend a morning opening the doors for parents and kids alike down at the drop and go and to see the smiles on their faces as they realised that they were able to have a safer and less-congested trip to school. Its the federal governments funding that has allowed that to occur. So thank you very much to the federal government for that and also of course to the Brisbane City Council for their support in building the project.House adjourned at 17:00N/AN/AThursday, 25 July 2019The DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Zimmerman) took the chair at 10:00.","Ryan Electorate: Roads","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SIMMONDS (Ryan) ","(16:55):"

271,0,0,0,1,2,"Rowland, Michelle, MP",159771,"Greenway","ALP","N/A",1086," One of the fundamental tenets of the co-regulatory telecommunications framework that we have in Australia is that it operates in the long-term interests of end users. Unfortunately, there are many things that happen outside that framework that can influence and dampen that, and one of those is scams. Scams are not a recent phenomenon that affects consumers; in fact, scams have existed for centuries. As long as humans have the propensity to occasionally misplace trust, scammers will thrive. This reality underscores why we must be stronger and more determined to safeguard consumers in the way of such harm. We cannot stand idle while scammers adapt old tricks to new technology, and we cannot be ignorant of how global communications platforms are being leveraged to carry out such scams. Australians deserve better.In April this year, the ACCC revealed the total combined losses reported to Scamwatch and other agencies exceeded $489 million. Thats nearly half a billion dollars, and that doesnt even account for losses which have not been recorded. This scale highlights the devastating financial and emotional toll this is having on Australians, and its growing. The ACCC has also highlighted the disproportionate impact scams are having on vulnerable Australians. We commend the consumer watchdog for its sustained focus on highlighting these and other risks and for educating the community on how to avoid them.Its no secret that one of the most prominent channels for scammers is the plain old telephone line. There are callers pretending to call from the NBN, claiming that your service is about to be disconnected. Given the prominence of the NBN rollout, it is alarming that monthly losses from reported NBN scams have tripled in 2019. There are callers impersonating the ATO, threatening unsuspecting customers with arrest for supposedly not paying their taxes. These lowball tactics are designed to shock and scare Australians into engaging with the caller.A key problem is the ability of overseas scammers to generate illegal calls which appear as Australian numbers, which is known as call spoofing. When your phone rings and the caller ID appears to be from a legitimate and more trusted Australian number, that call is more likely to be answered. That allows scammers to get a foot in the door, and from there the risks increase. Call spoofing also makes it more difficult for operators to block such numbers, because that number could in fact legitimately belong to someone in Australia.Its not good enough, and its surely not beyond the collective will of industry, standards bodies and regulators to restore integrity to our numbering system. Network based caller ID authentication, as is being implemented in the US, is just one option that could restore trust, strengthen privacy and reduce scams by making unauthorised numbers detectable. Another potential tool is having a scam blacklist. Even with the latest technical solutions, the reality is it wont be possible to stop every scam call, but Australians expect us to tackle scams better, and their expectations are justified.","Telecommunications","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) ","(10:00):"
272,0,0,0,1,2,"Laming, Andrew, MP","E0H","Bowman","LNP","N/A",1087," Homeownership remains at the heart of the aspirations of many young Australians, both urban and regional, and weve increasingly seen the deposit being a key barrier to homeownership. This has changed; even as recently as 20 years ago, servicing the loan was the key focus of homebuyers. Its really important to note that, after over 106 consecutive quarters of economic growth, homeownership in Australia has actually slowly, very subtly, declined. Its extraordinary to think that there may not be a greater proportion of Australians moving to own their first home. Increasingly, young Australians are saying to me and to my colleagues that the size of the deposit—the 20 per cent requirement—is the barrier, far more so, for those in stable jobs, than simply servicing the loan. People are effectively rent-trapped unless they have wealthy mums and dads who, through a single electronic funds transfer, could provide the deposit.Its incumbent upon the federal government, which already has a strong record in this area, to help Australians own their homes. Weve had the First Home Super Saver scheme and tax incentives for affordable housing; weve worked very hard to ensure there are limits on overseas ownership of new developments; and weve had clearer reporting and a much better understanding, ultimately, of where investment is coming from around the world in the potentially overheating elements of our property market. But it was the federal government that took this move in May of this year, and I want to commend the federal opposition for backing the scheme as well, which virtually guarantees its rollout for suburbs all around Brisbane, as a major city which will benefit from it. While its number-limited, it also has some caps, of $125,000 for an individual and $200,000 for a couple.If we are going to be incentivising homeownership, we need to make sure its not regressive. Many countries around the world make homeownership interest tax-deductible. Thats a highly regressive way of doing it. As the OECD has pointed out, the best possible way is to reduce the deposit barrier, because thats what gets people into homes. When I designed the deposit assistance scheme and presented it to Treasury staff in August of last year, my prime concerns were affordability, effectiveness and targeting. We cant afford to have this being taken up by people who were going to purchase a house in any case.With the property market potentially levelling out and prices about to increase again in some areas, there is a smaller risk of negative equity. Now is the time to implement this policy as a trial. Cameron Handley, in my electorate, has had horrible treatment by the state government and was asked to pay back his first home owner payment for no other reason than that they found a technical glitch in who had constructed the property back in 2012. I support him, as he has said the federal government scheme would have had him in homeownership up to a year earlier than he otherwise would have been. He has lost a lot of capital gain opportunity. I think Prime Minister Morrisons policy announcement in May was a real turning point for young homebuyers.","Housing Affordability","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LAMING (Bowman) ","(10:03):"
273,0,0,0,1,2,"Bowen, Chris, MP","DZS","McMahon","ALP","N/A",1087," Today I want to address an important matter in my electorate but also a very important matter right across the country, and that is the increasing prevalence of diabetes in our country, which is approaching—I hesitate to use the word but I use it advisedly—crisis levels. We have an urgent national task of tackling diabetes, and it is a task that needs to be tackled by governments—federal, state and local—but also by communities. In my community of McMahon—particularly in Fairfield, where over 15,000 people have been diagnosed with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes—certainly we are doing that.Last week was National Diabetes Week. I took the opportunity to issue a video about the issue of diabetes in my electorate and across Australia. The theme of National Diabetes Week was Its about time—its about time to get checked, its about time to take preventative measures, its about time to tackle the issue. Of course we would all agree with that.Diabetes has several different forms and it affects our communities in different ways. In Western Sydney it is a very big issue to be tackled. As I said, 15,000 people, just in the Fairfield local government area, have been diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. It does impact on socioeconomically disadvantaged areas much more strongly than others. It also impacts Indigenous Australians, our Indigenous brothers and sisters, more than non-Indigenous Australians, as well as those people living in remote and rural areas. Western Sydney is the metropolitan capital of diabetes in Australia, but its certainly not the capital of diabetes when compared to rural and regional areas.This is also an issue which affects many young people. Many honourable members and colleagues would have been impacted by their discussions with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. In my own case, Ive had a long relationship with young Jennifer Biggin, who doesnt actually live in my electorate—she lives just outside my electorate in the electorate of my friend and colleague the member for Fowler—but has been a very regular interlocutor with me about the need to lift the profile of juvenile diabetes in Australia. She approached my office when she was 10, seeking a meeting, and Ive met with her on several occasions since then. She is a fine individual.Ive also had pamphlets distributed from my office outlining important information for people tackling diabetes. We have held diabetes forums arranged by my electorate office. We will hold more of those in coming weeks and months. I want to take this opportunity in the House to urge all involved, including the federal government and other levels of government, to tackle the issue of diabetes. Fairfield City Council, in my electorate, has a proactive plan which involves the installation of exercise equipment in local parks. Its good to see, when Im out walking in our local parks, people using that exercise equipment. I congratulate the Fairfield City Council for that initiative. But we all need to be doing more to tackle the issue of diabetes in Western Sydney and more broadly in the community. Certainly that will be a focus of my time as shadow minister for health.","Diabetes","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BOWEN (McMahon) ","(10:06):"

Anne passed away on Sunday, 21 July 2019 after a 32-year battle with cancer. Anne was a wonderful teacher and was well-known and loved by our local schools. She taught at St Pius Banyo and, most recently, St Kevins in Geebung. She and her family lived in Nudgee, where she was also a proud St Pats mum. She was the adored wife of Neil and the dearly loved mother and mother-in-law of Mitchell and Bridget, Lachlan and Liz, Dominic and Sarah, and Rebecca. She was also a loving nanny to Elijah, Charlotte, Evelyn and Annabelle and the loved sister and sister-in-law of Peter, Mary, Dan and Gillian, Mick and Robyn, Kathleen and Mike, Sean and Deanna and Brendan and Christine, and aunt to all their families. On behalf of the Lilley community I send the family our thoughts and respects on this difficult day.Anne was first diagnosed with choroidal malignant melanoma in 1987, when she was only 27 years old. She underwent surgery, which took her eye and marked the beginning of a very long battle. In July 1997, Anne was diagnosed with secondary melanoma, which took 60 per cent of her liver, and she fought this disease as it returned again and again and again.In 2003, Anne commenced her first fundraising gala dinner, which she fondly called Walking on Sunshine. It was named after her favourite song by Katrina and the Waves. She decided to call her fundraiser Walking on Sunshine to remind everyone that, while it is important to take time in life to appreciate a sunny climate, we must be very cautious of the sun. Queenslanders face the highest incidence of skin cancer in the world. While a cure is yet to be found, the money that has been raised for medical research has helped Anne with her battle. She gave so much of herself, her time and her efforts to fundraiser so that others may receive help too. To date, Annes foundation, Walking on Sunshine, has raised nearly $300,000. Inroads are being made into melanoma treatments which are prolonging life and hopefully working towards a cure. It is a cure that we all want and that we will continue to work towards in Anns memory.Anns funeral mass will be held at Corpus Christi Catholic Church in Nundah today, commencing at 1.30 pm. As I cannot make it from this place, I honour Anns memory from here in the federal parliament and thank her for her many years of service to our local community, to our local schools on the north side and to all Australians and their families who live with the plight of melanoma. Ann was a great Australian, and we will remember her.","Stanton, Mrs Anne Majella","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WELLS (Lilley) ","(10:12):"

I acknowledge that there are so many people out there really doing it hard, and I just want you to know this House is with you.The residents of historic goldmining town of Walhalla are now able to access mobile phone reception for the first time through the 600th mobile phone tower under the Commonwealth governments Mobile Black Spot Program. The mobile coverage will improve communication and emergency services situations, enhance visibility of Walhalla online—Ill go into that in a minute—help grow tourism and local businesses, and make life easier for the towns residents. Team Telstra were great—Loretta Willaton, Nikos Katinakis and Garry Austin—but the great leaders of this were Councillor Michael Leaney and Russell Wright, who have been absolute stalwarts in their determination to get this.To understand this, tourists these days expect to pay for their coffee online. They expect to pay for their accommodation online. They expect to book their next place online. Tourists go to Walhalla and get nothing. They are in shock. They say: What do you mean, we cant pay for our things? We cant access our phones? We dont even think about accessing communications. You go to a place like Darwin, for instance, and the world responds only on communications that we need. The tourists are forever on their phones, doing what they have to do. Walhalla was completely in another world.It wont surprise you, Deputy Speaker, but Telstra had some promotional items there to promote themselves. Some of them were those squeeze balls. So I threw all the squeeze balls into the air, and they all landed in front of all the 200 people gathered for this momentous celebration, and we kicked the balls around. It was exactly the same as communication: bouncing off one another, making things better for people and giving opportunities for tourists to come into the place for the first time and still have access back to their families, back to their children and back to what was happening, which people expect these days.Congratulations, Michael Leaney. You have been a pain in the neck for me for so long. Councillor Michael Leaney has been desperate for this tower for so long. It was a very expensive tower.

On 17 September last year I moved a motion in this place, which was debated, and also presented a petition, signed by 11,144 people, on this issue. Ive also met with several Uygur families in Adelaide and heard firsthand accounts of detention, disappearance and surveillance and the restrictions placed on their family members living in Xinjiang. The situation in Xinjiang has also been the subject of ongoing media reports, including, most recently, the ABC Four Corners program last week. I understand that 22 countries have signed a joint statement condemning Chinas mass detention of Uygur and other minorities in the Xinjiang region.Yesterday, I and several parliamentary colleagues met with Almas Nizamidin and Sadam Abudusalamu, two Australian Uygurs who appeared on the Four Corners program and who are pleading to have their respective wives and Sadams two-year-old son brought to Australia. Their cases are being supported by Amnesty International. Last year, I wrote to Australias Minister for Foreign Affairs about Almass case. Almas has lost all contact with his wife and mother and has no knowledge of their whereabouts or wellbeing. The emotional strain on both Almas and Sadam of not being able to be with their wives was clearly visible at the meeting yesterday, and its understandable—particularly as there is no clear reason why their wives and Sadams two-year-old son are being detained or prevented from coming to Australia, or, indeed, from leaving Xinjiang.The families are pleading to be reunited so that they can get on with their lives, and Ive no reason to believe that they pose any security threat to Australia or to China. I urge both the Chinese embassy here in Australia and the Australian government to do all they can to allow these two young families to be reunited and to do so expeditiously. They have been separated for much too long. Indeed, when Sadams son was born in Xinjiang, Sadam was not even able to be at his sons birth. In fact, he has never even met his own son. I can only imagine the torment and stress that places on him and his wife and his little son.

Over the last couple of years, Ive been working closely with people like Marg Jones, President of the Pakenham netball club; Mel Broadley, President of the Berwick Netball Club; Valerie Edge, President of Beaconsfield Netball Club; Penny Asling, the netball coordinator, and Mickey Uren, the coach, of the Gembrook Cockatoo netball club; and, from the Emerald Football Netball Club, Mark Pedder.What really drew this issue to my attention was my visit to the Pakenham netball club last year.

I actually asked why the girls were all standing there in the rain and they said, Theyre waiting for the blokes to finish in the change rooms. Thats just totally unacceptable, and its pretty much the standard for those clubs Ive mentioned.The great news for the Pakenham netball club is that we have $500,000 on the way to assist them. In fact, the senior netball and football clubs get, in total, $1.5 million for major upgrades. Its the same with the Berwick football netball club—$1.5 million. Again, when I went and visited the girls, Mel Broadley and the team, out there, they were all waiting for the guys to finish in the change rooms. They had no toilets and no facilities. It was pretty disgraceful. The Beaconsfield Netball Club overall has fantastic facilities, and we also provided them with a $16,000 grant for a new LED scoreboard.I went up to Gembrook Cockatoo Football Netball Club. It seems every time I visit the netball clubs its always raining; they put the rain on for me! It was a freezing cold night again. They showed me the little shed they use as a change room—totally inadequate. Weve provided $450,000 for them. At the Emerald Netball Club, we provided $500,000, and the great news is that at the ROC Netball Club in Officer they already have $380,000 worth of new courts and facilities.","La Trobe Electorate: Womens Sport","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[10]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WOOD (La Trobe—Assistant Minister for Customs, Community Safety and Multicultural Affairs) ","(10:27):"

On this day, 14 individuals lost their lives in an underground explosion that took place at the Appin coalmine. Fourteen lives were taken in this disaster, 38 children were left fatherless, families were left to mourn and a community was severely shaken.Yesterdays anniversary was commemorated locally with a service at the Appin Mine Memorial Garden. Unfortunately, with the parliament sitting, I was unable to attend. However, by all accounts the service was a very moving one, and it was attended by hundreds of local residents. I wish to take the opportunity to thank the event organisers for inviting me and to thank the Macarthur community for their resolve to commemorate the disaster and for their determination to pay homage to those whose lives were affected by this tragedy and, indeed, those who lost their lives.I recall the day and the impact it had upon my community vividly, as do my wife and her family. While the blast of the explosion was reportedly felt over a kilometre away, this disaster has reverberated through my community for the past four decades. Over 100 volunteers assisted in recovery efforts at the time, demonstrating some of the best attributes of people from the Macarthur and Illawarra communities.A division having been called in the House of Representatives—Sitting suspended from 10:32 to 10:44","Appin Colliery Disaster","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[11]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr FREELANDER (Macarthur) ","(10:31):"

285,0,0,0,1,2,"McVeigh, John, MP",125865,"Groom","LNP","N/A",1094," Just last week we had a great visit from the federal Treasurer, the honourable Josh Frydenberg, to the electorate of Groom. We had a very significant Toowoomba Chamber of Commerce event: a business breakfast with well over 200 people in attendance. I took the Treasurer to inspect works on the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing. We visited InterLinkSQ, an intermodal freight facility under development adjacent to the inland rail alignment, just to the north-west of the city of Toowoomba. We visited the Pulse Data Centre, the first Tier 3 data centre in regional Australia, and, adjacent to the data centre, ATLAS, the emerging innovation centre particularly focused on ag-tech that will get behind research and development led by the private sector. Prior to his departure, I was able to show the Treasurer the Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport, the iconic airport that now connects our region to the world.The Treasurer in his former capacity as Minister for the Environment visited the Groom electorate in September 2016—so almost three years ago—to consider final required approvals from a Commonwealth perspective under the EPBC Act for the New Acland coalmine stage 3 proposal, which is still being considered by the state Labor government some three years later. This recent visit reminded me very clearly, and I guess it also displayed for the city of Toowoomba and the Darling Downs very clearly, that we are experiencing significant hold-ups on some major projects in relation to the state Labor government.The Toowoomba Second Range Crossing—at a cost of $1.6 billion, with 80 per cent of that funded by the federal government but being managed by the state government—is almost complete, but our community still doesnt know when its going to be open or how much the toll is going to be. On inland rail, whilst Victoria and New South Wales have signed intergovernmental agreements with the federal government to get the project going, the Queensland state government has not. For New Hope stage 3, as Ive said, were still waiting on state government approval some three years after federal approvals were provided—and the Oakey Together Street Parade this weekend will focus on that very fact. I say to the state Labor government in Queensland: at the last federal election, just a few months ago, we had a resounding result. Our community spoke so very clearly about these projects, the need to get on with infrastructure and the need to support our community. The Oakey Together Street Parade this coming weekend will be a parade through the township of Oakey, celebrating its heritage but also recognising pending job losses from New Hope if those approvals dont come through in time, and recognising that the state government needs to get on with it.","Groom Electorate: Infrastructure","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[12]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr McVEIGH (Groom) ","(10:46):"

We know there is a proposal for works along South Road that will be stretching from Thebarton through to Darlington, roughly 10 kilometres of expansion. But there is limited commitment given by both the state Liberal government and the federal government to preserve some iconic heritage buildings that are in that pathway. Im talking of many buildings, including pubs, but two main ones are the Queen of Angels Church, a Catholic church built in 1915 which is 104 years old, and Thebarton Theatre, which recently celebrated 90 years of providing arts, music and cinema to the community. These buildings cannot be lost to South Australia. Once we lose these buildings, they are gone forever.Were talking about buildings that have played a very big part in the formation of our local communities. For example, I remember as a child attending Saturday matinees at the Thebarton Theatre, watching everything from the Three Stooges to the Walt Disney movies. The Queen of Angels must be spared, and so must the Thebarton Theatre. These two most iconic buildings must be preserved. Ive written to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Infrastructure asking them to assure the people of Adelaide that works associated with the South Road upgrade will not damage historic buildings, including Thebarton Theatre and Queen of Angels. There are ways of preserving these buildings. Now is the time for the state Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Local Government, Stephan Knoll, to ensure he has discussions with Prime Minister Morrison and asks for additional funding from the Prime Minister to ensure that these iconic buildings are saved. There are ways of saving them—for example, a tunnel has been proposed. If a tunnel is needed, so be it, because these buildings are iconic and both properties should be completely hands off.The Thebarton Theatre has provided a stage for artists such as The Angels, Cold Chisel, Kylie Minogue, John Farnham, Iron Maiden—and I attended that concert last year!—Midnight Oil, Ed Sheeran, childrens performers like the Wiggles, the Hoodoo Gurus et cetera.","Adelaide Electorate: Heritage Listing","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[13]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GEORGANAS (Hindmarsh) ","(10:49):"

It is Australias largest community tree-planting day. I know how important it is to Ryan residents that we protect our national environment. The local residents love their green and leafy suburbs, as I do. We spoke during the recent election in particular about protecting our lifestyle locally. It is not just a slogan but a call to arms to roll up our sleeves as a community, and planting trees for our local community is a big part of that.National Tree Day, founded in 1996, has grown to Australias largest community tree-planting event, and we are aiming to plant, together, as a nation, over one million native trees and shrubs across the country. I will be part of it. Those community residents who take part will be part of the 300,000 volunteers who are getting out this weekend to engage in activities, along with school students tomorrow, on Friday.Id like to promote two local events within the community and encourage people to get along: first of all, Nature Freedom, a not-for-profit social enterprise organisation for young people with disabilities, is getting involved in National Tree Day. They are working with Habitat Brisbane and Cubberla-Witton Catchments Network for an inclusive tree-planting event. This will occur at Handle Street Park near UQ Long Pocket Campus on Sunday from 8 am.The other event happening in our local community is at Hilder Road State School on Sunday, 28 July, from 10 am to 3 pm. This is more of a community event, organised by Hilder Road State School, working with Save Our Waterways Now and Paten Park Native Nursery, along with the support of Brisbane City Council. They have organised an amazing day of performances and planting, a wildlife show, and stalls and food for everyone. So that will be exciting to be part of. I will be at both those events over the course of the day on Sunday, as I participated in these events in previous years in my role as a local councillor, when we were part of a Brisbane City Council administration that helped plant some two million trees across Brisbane.We have so much natural beauty in our electorate of Ryan, particularly Mount Coot-Tha and Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, and some tremendous local groups that I want to pay tribute to who help us look after that local environment, including but not limited to: the Cubberla-Witton Catchments Network, Pullen Pullen Catchments Group, Moggill Creek Catchment Group and Save Our Waterways Now. I conclude by encouraging very much local residents to be part of these two events or any event theyd like to be part of on Sunday to help us protect our local environment.

I particularly congratulate the seven members of the Toukley Torchbearers who were awarded life membership at their 34th Annual Friendship Luncheon. Life membership recognises over 10 years of service by Torchbearers and the awards were presented by the President of the New South Wales Torchbearers, Trish Berghaus. Congratulations to Alma Russell, Jean Aitken, Faye Robinson, Hazel Duckett, Lyn Whitby, Judy Ford and Roma Lawler on your service.Legacy cares for 60,000 people across Australia and almost 1,300 on the Central Coast, many of whom are elderly widows. There are some school aged children and, currently, nine university students supported by Legacy scholarships. Toukley Torchbearers currently has around 30 active members contributing to an annual fundraising effort of $25,000 to $30,000 each and every year. This year alone the Toukley Torchbearers has already organised at least two events each month, including at the Morisset and Gosford shows, the Scottish Spectacular and many market and street stalls. Activities planned for the remainder of the year include afternoon teas, cake stalls, golf days and the much anticipated annual fete. Their efforts help Legacy care for individuals and families living with significant loss and trauma. I offer the Toukley Torchbearers for Legacy my personal thanks on behalf of our grateful community. Thank you, President Judy Willmette, Secretary Ruth Condon, Treasurer Maz Cleary and all the members of Toukley Torchbearers for Legacy.I was also delighted to join members and friends of the Ourimbah Combined Hospital Auxiliary at their 73rd annual general meeting recently. The United Hospital Auxiliaries motto is, Let us hold high the lamp of service for the welfare of our hospitals. Their objectives are threefold, and include assisting the welfare of patients and staff at all hospitals and healthcare centres within the state of New South Wales by providing all kinds of services and to assist in fundraising. The Ourimbah Combined Hospital Auxiliary more than lives up to this objective. Having worked at our local hospitals for almost 10 years Im personally grateful for their efforts. The wisdom and warmth in the room was overwhelming, and it was a privilege to join so many local people who care and take care of our hospitals. The auxiliary has a longstanding tradition of presenting guests to its AGM a box of locally-grown fruit and then sharing a homemade afternoon tea. Congratulations to 2019-20 President Toni Brewster and her executive team. The Ourimbah Combined Hospital Auxiliary has been running election-day stalls since 1946 and will continue to raise funds through raffles and coach trips. In the last financial year the auxiliary raised $9,600 for Gosford Hospital, contributing funds for much-needed monitors for both the cardiac and medical wards. It was a privilege to be in the company of so many people with such deep roots in our community and who care for our hospital.","Dobell Electorate: Toukley Torchbearers for Legacy, Dobell Electorate: Ourimbah Combined Hospital Auxiliary","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[15]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms McBRIDE (Dobell) ","(10:55):"
292,0,0,0,1,2,"Howarth, Luke, MP",247742,"Petrie","LNP","N/A",1098," I rise today to speak about a very topical issue in my electorate of Petrie. That issue is the development of the North Lakes golf course. You only have to look at the map of the suburbs of North Lakes and Mango Hill in the western part of my electorate to notice the large green space in which these suburbs not only are situated but also based around. Many families have told me that their choice to purchase a home in North Lakes or Mango Hill was largely influenced by the 68 hectares of beautiful green golf course space which is available for families to enjoy in their own backyards. Its not just the golf course and the trees that grow there but the kangaroos, the koalas, the reptiles and amphibians that live on the golf course—the swans on Lake Eden.Sadly, part of this is at risk because this golf course, whilst at the moment the lungs of North Lakes, is at risk of being developed. This was brought to my attention in 2018 and has very quickly become a huge issue for locals. More than 200 residents turned out to peacefully protest the development of this land in July last year and, since then, residents have continued to express their disgust at the thought of overdevelopment and congestion within their community if this project goes ahead.The village retirement group is proposing to build a three-storey retirement home on roughly 11 hectares of the land in the middle of this green space, and this isnt just a few houses on a golf course. The footprint of this development is equal to the size of Westfield North Lakes. If locals looked at the recently distributed North Lakes Common propaganda brochure and thought it looked too good to be true, thats because it probably is. The promise of parks, sporting fields and a fitness precinct on the remainder of the land comes at a price. Whether youre renting as a resident in North Lakes or buying your own home, this will have an effect on your familys lifestyle due to the cost of wildlife displacement, the cost of overdevelopment and much more traffic on the roads, which are already experiencing high congestion from people in North Lakes.I want to be clear that Im for development and progress, but it needs to be done in line with the needs of the community—and this project is not. This propaganda brochure recently put out made no mention of who is going to pay for the new fitness and community precinct. The people of North Lakes already pay a levy, and we want to make sure that council dont increase it. So I say to the Moreton Bay regional councillors: listen to the people of Petrie, listen to the people of North Lakes and do not allow this golf course to be developed.","Petrie Electorate: North Lakes Resort Golf Club","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[16]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HOWARTH (Petrie—Assistant Minister for Community Housing, Homelessness and Community Services) ","(10:58):"
293,0,0,0,1,2,"Perrett, Graham, MP","HVP","Moreton","ALP","N/A",1098," Theres been growing concern among residents of Sunnybank Hills and Macgregor in my electorate of Moreton that some crimes are on the rise. In fact, the LNP candidate during the recent election, on one of her rare visits to the electorate, personally towed around Moreton a sign saying that crime was on the rise. Everyone deserves to feel safe in their homes and workplaces, and I would like to commend the Queensland Police Service for their implementation of the southside community safety action plan rolled out to address these concerns.Operation Romeo Airtight commenced on 1 June and it consists of high-visibility police patrols and community engagement strategies by South Brisbane District and Operations Support Command. The operation has conducted high-visibility active patrolling and detection and disruption of offences in those suburbs, including at licensed premises, restaurant precincts, local businesses, thoroughfares and residential areas. Mounted police patrols are now commonly seen around the Sunnybank area. I know this because my office is in Sunnybank. I work and eat there, and Ive seen these patrols. So far, these tactical operations have made 224 arrests and have conducted 715 street checks.Part of the action plan is to conduct information blitzes around local shopping centres. Tonight will be their third week around the Sunnybank Plaza shopping centre. Police will be in attendance, with members of Crime Stoppers, to provide information about crime prevention. Theyll also be in attendance at the Pinelands shopping centre. Last week, police conducted a meeting at the Kuraby mosque to address issues around safety in the park and the train line beside the mosque, the Beenleigh line. Prior to that there was also a Chinese community safety day at Macgregor.As I said at the start, this is a very appropriate response from the Queensland Police Service, who look after Moreton. I know theyre passionate about making people in the Sunnybank area feel much safer. However, there is more that can be done by the Liberal National Party Brisbane City Council. Ive called on the unelected new mayor to match a commitment I made during the election for an upgrade of the Mains Road pedestrian overpass at Sunnybank. Most importantly, the upgrade would include the installation of security cameras so that we can make sure we catch any criminals in the area. Local police officers have told me that security cameras are an enormous help to law enforcement. They help catch those few bad eggs who do harm in our community. So far, no commitment has been made by the mayor or the local Liberal National Party councillors Steven Huang, Krista Adams, who is the deputy mayor, or Kim Marx. They were happy to play politics during the federal election, but now theyve vanished like thieves in the night.Labor mayoral and council candidates, including my good friend John Prescott, who is running for Runcorn, have committed to this important safety investment. The CCTV and upgrade are essential. I again call on the LNP lord mayor and Liberal National Party local councillors to step up and fund this essential upgrade of the pedestrian overpass in Sunnybank.","Moreton Electorate: Law Enforcement","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[17]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PERRETT (Moreton) ","(11:01):"

It makes one reflect on ones own maiden speech—and many of the ones were hearing talk about their individual electorates. I recall only three years ago speaking about my electorate of Fairfax on the Sunshine Coast and making the point that my vision—and it remains my vision—is for the Sunshine Coast to be the healthiest place on earth with the healthiest environment, the healthiest community, the healthiest economy, the healthiest relationships, the healthiest way of life and the healthiest civil society.Within that vision lies different, discrete communities that make up the region of the Sunshine Coast, which I share, as a federal MP, with the member for Fisher. In Fairfax, my electorate, which is on the northern end, theres a town called Nambour, which is key to the region. Nambour has had its challenges after the closing of a sugar mill, the Moreton mill, in 2003. Nambour is one of those unique places in Australia that maintains those values of the past but also possesses all of the opportunities of the future.It has been an absolute pleasure over the last 12 months working with community leaders as well as other tiers of government. I want to acknowledge local councillor Greg Rodgerson and state MP Marty Hunt. They have worked with me and other community leaders on a project called Reimagine Nambour, which has been partly funded by the federal government but also by the mayor and Councillor Rodgerson.

I heard her give a terrific speech at a Project O event last month, with a message in it for everyone in this parliament. So its my pleasure to now deliver that speech on her behalf.My name is Caitlan and I am in year 6. In the future I would like to be a politician, something I have wanted to do since I was in grade 4. Just ask my teacher, Shannon. Politicians have the power to change things, to have influence and use that power and influence to help people. And I want to help people. One of the things I am passionate about is climate change. Climate change is not a problem that is going to go away if we ignore it. I am passionate about it because, if we dont pay attention to it , it is going to affect us all, especially my generation. Here are some facts about climate change. The rate at which Antarctica is melting has tripled in the last decade, Wildlife populations have declined by 60 per cent since 1970. Koalas are at risk of being critically endangered in some states of Australia. Trees are scientifically proven to help reduce the effects of climate change by absorbing CO2 and producing oxygen, but still, in 2017 alone, 39 million acres of tropical forest was cleared. I have heard so many times adults saying, Oh, theyre just kids, or that because were young we dont understand the world or have experience of whats come before us. But I say to those adults: we are the present and we are the future. We see the emergency and we know that, if the adults today dont start making the right decisions, we will be the ones having to deal with it in the future. And when I am an adult I will have to tell the children that, even though we tried to speak up, past generations didnt act on it and it created irreversible change. We also have easy ideas on how we can start to fix the problem. We can stop using our cars so much. We can use our bikes and walk more. We can really commit to stopping our use of plastic bags. We can plant trees. We can take the time to educate ourselves and check twice before we buy something, to know the ethical and environmental impact of the things we buy. So, yes, we might be young, but it doesnt mean we arent just as capable as adults of reading about the science and coming up with solutions. The only thing we cant do is change the laws and policies. That, for now, is in the hands of the adults. But we can keep speaking up, and we will keep reminding the adults that our future is in your hands. My name is Caitlan, and I want to be a future leader.Well, Caitlan, youre a leader now.

We toured Tonys Tuna and observed the processing, and then we met with the tuna industry—all of the owners of the licences—and talked through a number of issues that they need to face. We went and met with the people from the abalone industry and the rock lobster industry. The next day we went out to the tuna pens and witnessed the harvesting procedures. I must say this is very important for a minister, because this is an international industry. It relies on international quotas. It relies on trust between the nations who are signatories to those quotas. So for the minister to actually understand what we do on the ground is very important.We took extra time while we were in Port Lincoln to meet with the Great Australian Bight trawler industry, which supplies 90 per cent of the fresh seafood into Adelaide markets. Im sure youd be quite well known to some of these people, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas. They come from your culture. In this case, they were Greek families that came from Thevenard and had built wonderful industries. They have a lot of different concerns, but to once again have the minister there to talk through their challenges and opportunities for the future was a really good thing.We went on and met with the sardine industry. There was a fair bit of discussion around pelagic fish in this place a few years ago, let me say, but these people are the ones that are harvesting the sardines for our tuna industry. Thats the raw feed. Its interesting that we hark back to those debates about supertrawlers. People in the industry think that maybe the public misunderstood what they were about. We are harvesting sardines that are only suitable for animal consumption at the moment, when they could be suitable for human consumption if we could process them and freeze them on the vessel. That is probably a grave mistake. But its something that can perhaps be addressed in the future. But right across the board there was a real determination and enthusiasm to tap into the international markets so we can add value to the tonnage that we are already capturing, and a real commitment to ensure that these fisheries are sustainable and will be yielding outcomes for Australians for generations to come.","Grey Electorate: Seafood Industry","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[20]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RAMSEY (Grey—Government Whip) ","(11:22):"

300,0,0,0,1,2,"Chesters, Lisa, MP",249710,"Bendigo","ALP","N/A",1102," I rise today to speak about the growing GP crisis that we are experiencing in Bendigo and the towns and communities of greater Bendigo. Its a crisis that we have not seen since 2004, when it was widely reported that GPs in Bendigo had closed their books. New people moving to our town could not access a GP and would quite often spend many mornings ringing around trying to get any appointment that they could. Here we are in 2019, and the crisis has reoccurred. We now find ourselves in another GP crisis in Bendigo, and it is of this governments making.But dont take my word for it. Take the word of local GPs. Many have spoken out in our local media recently about the growing crisis and the problems that we are experiencing. Take the word of Bendigo Community Health Services director of primary health care services, Graem Kelly, who said that people in our community were being put dramatically at risk because of the GP shortage. He said that there was a real medical crisis on a number of fronts, putting pressure on bulk-billing clinics. He said that two groups were affected who need urgent attention: people who might have colds or flus, and those with chronic disease who cant get regular appointments to see GPs.Bendigo Primary Care Centre chief executive Glen Careedy has also spoken out and said that there is an increased demand for health care in our region but we are struggling to find new doctors. He said that the clinic is fully booked early each morning. And I would know, because this is my own clinic, and I also struggle to get appointments on the days that I require them. Im not alone in that. He said that theyve been advertising for GPs for about two years, with virtually no response. He went on to say that Bendigos doctor shortage is becoming similar to what it was in 2004, when anyone who moved to the area could not get a doctor because most had closed their books. Its not just these bigger clinics that are struggling to attract GPs to the area. Many of our smaller clinics have also spoken out, whether they are in Woodend, Castlemaine, Heathcote or Bendigo. Creek Street clinic has also spoken out about the struggle to attract new doctors, young doctors, to Bendigo to work in general practice.At the end of the day, it is our GPs, in their day-to-day practice, who help keep our communities healthy and keep the pressure off emergency rooms. The government did make an announcement, after much pressure from local GPs. It did look like we were going to be excluded from the District of Workforce Shortage list, meaning that we could not attract overseas doctors or new doctors to the area. But the government has seen that that was a mistake and has said that, from 1 July 2019, the new health workforce classification system, called Distribution Priority Areas, will commence, and Bendigo is on the list. This means that we will have recruits who are restricted to work in these areas. Overseas trained doctors and Australian bonded doctors will be encouraged to move to these areas if they wish to practise medicine. That is welcome. However, it is not the solution to our problem.The GPs highlighted to me that the bigger problem is that Bendigos geographical classification has been changed. From 1 January 2020, bulk-billing rebates will be reduced. They will be cut per patient. Theyll be cut from $9.50 to $6.30. That starts to put real pressure on GPs and clinics. It means that the income that a full-time GP who bulk-bills every patient will lose will be about $400 a week. It will force more GPs to charge gap fees for all their patients. We already have high gap fees. We know that once you charge a gap fee you lose the bulk-billing incentive. This will mean that fewer doctors will come to the area to set up and establish practices or take on roles in practices. We are not a wealthy area. While some areas are doing well, others arent. The average income is less than $50,000 a year, meaning people will put off going to the GP. The crisis in Bendigo will worsen if the government is going to cut GP bulk-billing incentives. I urge the government not to.","Bendigo Electorate: Medical Workforce","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CHESTERS (Bendigo) ","(11:26):"
301,0,0,0,1,2,"Wallace, Andrew, MP",265967,"Fisher","LNP","N/A",1103," During the recent election campaign the people of Fisher showed once again that they are engaged, that they are discerning and that they have high expectations for those who would seek to represent them in this place. The people of Fisher expect and require that their member of parliament will work hard for them every day, and they expect to see results. That is what Ive delivered during the past three years, and it is what I am passionate about delivering in the three years to come.My first priority has been the first priority of the people of my electorate—expressed to me in hundreds of conversations over the past three months—and that is to make the Sunshine Coast economy stronger. Weve helped to do that by passing the Morrison governments tax cuts package. The governments tax cuts are going to make sure that hardworking Australians get to keep more of their own hard-earned money. They are going to reward effort and aspiration and help make sure that, in Fisher and all over Australia, if you have a go, youll get a go. They are going to stimulate our economy to help ensure that the Sunshine Coast continues to grow and to thrive. That is what the people of Fisher voted for so decisively on 18 May, and that is what we are delivering. It was disappointing to see members opposite and their Labor colleagues in the Senate do all they could to prevent the passage of the tax cut legislation through the parliament. I know that the people of Fisher will remember how members on each side of the House responded to their clearly expressed wishes.For me, I will not stop there. With the governments tax cuts in place, over the next three years Ill be working hard every day to continue to grow our economy and to bring new businesses, new industries and new jobs to Fisher. Ill work hard to deliver the infrastructure that we need on the Sunshine Coast to keep our tens of thousands of businesses moving. This includes delivering on the $3.2 billion the coalition government has invested in upgrades to the Bruce Highway, and it includes delivering on the North Coast rail duplication, to which this government has allocated $390 million. The first two phases of the Bruce Highway upgrades are underway, and we have 70 per cent of the funds we need for the rail. But our community cannot go forward with endless construction works. Ill work hard to deliver the extra lanes, the extra track and the improved interchanges that weve committed to fund, but Ill do it so that we deliver these as early as humanly possible.Ill also continue to push harder for action on the crippling congestion affecting local state government roads. In the last federal budget, the Morrison government delivered $5 million to advance planning for congestion-busting solutions on routes like Caloundra Way, Nicklin Way, Kawana Way Link Road and Brisbane Road. As well, the government provided $12 million to fund the building of a new four-lane bridge on Brisbane Road in Mooloolaba. In the next three years Ill work hard to deliver on these projects and get more action on congested local roads. Its all well and good to have a fantastic Bruce Highway, which is what were building, but theres no point if you cant get to it.Beyond our roads and rail Ill work with local businesses to grow and develop new industries in our community, which will bring the jobs of the future to Fisher. Ill progress my Fisher defence industry initiative to make sure that more of the coalitions $200 billion investment in defence flows to my community in the form of new jobs in defence and high-tech manufacturing. Ill work to deliver new projects in health care in Fisher, and contribute further towards making our community a national hub—even an international hub—for cutting-edge health. This will include delivering on the governments $12 million for Wishlists low-cost accommodation hub, on our $6.2 million for endED and its Australia-first residential treatment facility for eating disorders, and on further research and treatment at the Thompson Institute.In the next three years Ill work hard to progress some of the big projects that my community needs to take its rightful place among Australias leading artistic, cultural, economic and sporting centres. This will include upgrades to Sunshine Coast Stadium, new tourism and arts infrastructure in the hinterland and a world-class convention and exhibition centre for our community.","Fisher Electorate","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WALLACE (Fisher) ","(11:31):"
302,0,0,0,1,2,"Wilkie, Andrew, MP","C2T","Clark","IND","N/A",1104," The introduction of federal religious freedom legislation puts at risk the rights and freedoms already enjoyed in Tasmania. This is because the existing Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Act provides protection to a number of minority groups, including members of the LGBTI+ community and people with disability. The implementation of federal legislation runs the very real risk of overriding these protections and allowing discrimination and hate speech in the name of religious freedom.To be clear, I support religious freedom if that means not discriminating against people of faith. But, regrettably, reform is being driven in part by people who feel that they are persecuted if theyre prevented from persecuting others. In other words, Im deeply concerned that federal reform will allow for discrimination and hate speech in the name of faith, allow discrimination in employment by faith based organisations or allow faith based schools to teach that marriage is only to be between a man and a woman despite same-sex marriage being lawful.Tasmania is the only state that prohibits discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity and relationship status by faith-linked organisations including schools, hospitals and charities. It is one of the few states that prohibits all hate speech without a religious exception, and it has the strongest protections against discrimination for minority groups. Frankly, Tasmania has the most to lose if this religious freedom bill goes ahead.The Attorney-General has said reform is not intended to replace state laws. However, theres simply no denying that Tasmanias Anti-Discrimination Act will be undermined if a religious freedom bill is passed. That would trample over the Tasmanian parliament, which has twice upheld the states hate speech laws, and Tasmanias Supreme Court, which has found those laws to be constitutionally sound.Moreover, federal reform is likely to impact any person or group that falls outside the sphere of traditional religious precepts, including LGBTI+ people, people with disability, single parents, divorcees and people living in de facto relationships. It will create a direct conflict between state and federal laws, which could allow people complaining of religious discrimination to sidestep state laws and practices. This would be inappropriate and would show a blatant disregard of the laws of the states and territories.Thats not the end of it. Reform has the potential to go beyond just the impact on state and territory autonomy. For example, it could sanction religious practices such as genital mutilation and forced marriage. Yes, it seems ridiculous to believe that this could happen in Australia. But federal reform without appropriate limitations does have the potential to lead to substantial persecution of minority groups. Consequently, the federal government must exert the utmost vigilance if it is to ensure that all people, not just those exerting their religious views and beliefs, are protected from discrimination.To that end, the government could legislate for a positive right while still maintaining state and territory laws by, for example, importing article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights into Australian law. Article 18(1) says:Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching.However, if the government does decide to pursue this road and import article 18 (1) , I must stress the importance of legislating the equivalent of article 18(3) , which states :Freedom to manifest one  s religion or beliefs may be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.This limitation would ensure the protection of all rights whilst maintaining the autonomy of state and territory laws.In wrapping up, Tasmania has effective antidiscrimination legislation that protects minority groups from persecution and discrimination. It also protects Tasmanians from discrimination and hate speech on the grounds of religious belief and practice. To implement federal legislation that cuts across this would be reckless, counterproductive and potentially dangerous. Remember, any reform at this time should not be about advocating for one group of Australians against another but rather about moving towards a more inclusive and accepting society that promotes equal rights for all, not special rights for some.","Tasmania: Discrimination","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WILKIE (Clark) ","(11:36):"
303,0,0,0,1,2,"Wilson, Tim, MP","IMW","Goldstein","LP","N/A",1105,"Mr TIM WILSON ( Goldstein ) ( 11:41 ): Since 1921, Australian Rotary clubs have united men and women with a shared belief in securing a more inclusive society which promotes fellowship, integrity and goodwill. Building our social fabric is critical to securing this great nation  s future. It is part of its past, its present and our future success. Our government has invested a record amount of money in local projects that help associations build that sense of community. But the reality is that money from Canberra is not the solution. Critically, as Liberals we realise that this great nation should be governed from the citizen and community up, n ot from Canberra down. It  s for that reason that we celebrate the Australian Rotary clubs and their incredi ble community-building success. All of Australia  s 30,000 Rotarians — including my mother — deserve recognition for their contribution.Today I would particularly like to acknowledge the outstanding leaders of Goldstein  s Rotary community. At the Rotary Club of Sandringham, which I visited only recently , they were engaging with the community in consultations for the establishment of a new community garden. I would like to congratulate Ian Wells and Gar r y Thompson , who were elected president and vice- president of the club. I was lucky enough to attend a recent meeting , as I said, and the friendly atmosphere and community spirit on display were fantastic — something I  m sure is common to all of Goldstein  s Rotary community. At the Beaumaris Rotary club we also had incredible contributions from community members who have done wonderful work in years past and present. I  d also like to recognise all the other community members who have assisted at the Rotary Club of Glen Ei ra, the Bentleigh Moorabbin Central Rotary Club , the Rotary Club of Hampton and the Rotary Club of Brighton , as well as the Brighton North Rotary club — all have made a contribution over the previous year.What these community groups and these Rotary clubs do is hit the ground running. As many of you will know, they have made an incredible contribution towards the eradication of polio across the world t hrough their efforts and innovation , and by raising money at local community activities. One of my favourite things to do on a Saturday morning is to go to the local Rotary market down at Trey Bit Reserve , as well as the one at Brighton North primary . Our local Rotary clubs organise community markets , which are an opportunity for st all holders and others to come together to sell their wares but also raise money for important community activities and events. Each one of those makes an enormous contribution to the work we can do to strengthen our local community and make sure that we get the best out of our community  s success.What I see every time the community invests in developing the talent and the capacity of Rotary clubs is that it builds the social bonds across lots of community organisations. Very regularly , I get community groups coming up to me and say ing they want to do important work and bring together sometimes local shop s and trading groups as well as other community organisations and schools. The Rotary clubs are always the first point of contact that you connect with. They have resources available. More critically than that, they have willing volunteers and participants and are in a position to make a contribution, whether its from something as simple as community establishment, as I said, of a local market or in organising volunteers for things for things like barbecues.When you get elected to this place, people say that one of the biggest challenges you have is controlling your weight because you might be enjoying too much food and drink, depending on the circumstances, and that even includes some of the members opposite. But, of course, we also know theres a big risk every time you turn up to one of those community markets and theres somebody selling a sausage for only about two bucks. There is the temptation you have and the guilt if you dont buy one. I had that only last weekend at the community market in Sandy.We want to thank them for their incredible contribution and everything theyre doing. It makes a huge difference to our community locally but also to the state and to the nation. I know that regularly they hold nationwide conferences which bring together huge numbers of people who do great work and share in that success. We want to extol them and encourage them to keep doing so. You are the backbone of this great country, you are what makes it great and you are what makes it successful. In between what government does and what the private sector and the market economy do sit volunteer organisations and volunteers, who are so critical as part of sewing the stitch of our social fabric, binding people together and being able to make and strengthen the bonds of this great nation.","Goldstein Electorate: Rotary Clubs","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","N/A","N/A"

Kevin was an ice addict. His addiction to that drug cost him his kids and his job. His kids were taken away from him and looked after by his parents. For a long time he was living in a car. He was sleeping in a car with his wife, until one day a bloke who ran a community organisation in Campbelltown helping homeless people got in contact with him, provided him with shelter and got him in touch with services that could help turn his life around. Hes now got a job. Hes the manager of a business in Campbelltown. Hes got his kids back. Hes a volunteer at the same organisation that helped get him out of that car, and hes now on the board of that organisation. Its a fantastic story of how one small organisation can help one Australian turn their life around.Last week, I went on the night walk that Father Chris Rileys Youth Off The Streets does in the streets of Sydney, looking out for young people who are sleeping rough or need a helping hand or just need a hot meal in the depths of winter. I met a young woman who had been homeless since she was 14. Shes not homeless anymore, thanks to Danny, the bloke who runs that night walk, and the work he did to help get her off the street, get her into a home and get her an apprenticeship as a chef at one of the biggest restaurants in Sydney. Shes now been doing that for six months, and I got to meet her and see the life that shes living now and the changes made by great organisations like Father Chriss.He also told me a story—this is a hard one to tell, and Im sure my colleagues opposite who have experience in law enforcement will have heard these stories before—about a 13-year-old girl who was injected with heroin for the first time by her mum, what that did to her life and how it spiralled out of control. That young woman was found by Danny and the team and Father Chris. They gave her an education. She finished high school through Father Chriss organisation. Shes 30 now, and she is now a schoolteacher, teaching in our public education system.If were talking about heroes, you cant go past two friends of mine, Hilton Harmer OAM and Joyce Harmer OAM.An honourable member: Hear, hear!","Homelessness","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CLARE (Blaxland) ","(11:46):"

Id like to let the parliament know that its Hiltons 80th birthday today. If youre watching, mate, happy birthday. Hilton and Joyce have been helping homeless people and disadvantaged people for almost 60 years. Then, when they retired from the Salvos, they went out and collected food from OzHarvest and distributed it to different refuges and boarding houses in my local area in Sydney. Hilton got really crook a couple of years ago and couldnt do that anymore, so instead they opened their own home and encouraged people who were struggling to come every Wednesday to their house, where they would distribute food and everything from toasters to fridges to mattresses. Anything people need they would find and get to people.Despite all of that good work from all of those organisations, the challenge that we face in this area is just getting harder and harder, because there are more people who are going to be homeless tonight than ever before. Almost half of them are mums and kids. I heard the story last week about a mum whos got six kids sleeping in a car just on the outskirts of Werribee and has been doing this for six months. One in 10 homeless people are veterans—people who wore our uniform and protected our country. The area where this is rising fastest is not young kids or old blokes; its women aged 65 to 74. In my own area, in Western Sydney, homelessness has increased by almost 200 per cent in the last few years. This is a massive problem, and I dont think its melodramatic to say its a crisis.Its not just people that are sleeping rough; thats the tip of the iceberg. Only seven per cent of homeless people are sleeping rough. Its people that are sleeping in cars, sleeping on couches and staying on the train just to keep warm or people that are in boarding houses, fed and helped by people like Hilton.Its Homelessness Week in just over a weeks time. Can I use this opportunity to encourage my colleagues to get out, visit refuges and listen to people—some of the quietest Australians in this country. If youre watching this, please be inspired by these stories and to go out and volunteer for these organisations. Can I encourage the government to not talk about the spin on the positiveness of homelessness but do something real like these great Australians and help the most disadvantaged people in our community.","Homelessness","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[6]","N/A","N/A"

308,0,0,0,1,2,"Wilson, Rick, MP",198084,"OConnor","LP","N/A",1108," I rise today to update the House on the ongoing uncertainty that overhangs a critical industry in my electorate of OConnor—that being the livestock industry and, more particularly, the sheep industry. This uncertainty stems from the incident that occurred nearly two years ago, in August 2017, where the Awassi Express was caught off the port of Doha in Qatar and there was an unacceptably high loss of sheep on that voyage. Subsequently some footage was released and was played on 60 Minutes, and the industry was brought into disrepute. There were a series of events that followed that which have put extreme pressure on those sheep producers across my electorate who had nothing to do with that initial incident. Just to emphasise the importance of the industry, around 40 per cent of the 3.5 million sheep turned off in Western Australia are exported. Thats about 1.5 million head of sheep, or about $180 million worth of product.This uncertainty commenced around May last year, when we saw an incident where the Emanuel company had 56,000 sheep in a feedlot. They were seeking final permission to load the boat and for that boat to sail to the Middle East. At the very last minute, literally five minutes to midnight, the permission to load was withdrawn and we saw 56,000 sheep stranded in a feedlot in Baldivis, just south of Perth. More devastating for the industry itself was there were a lot of sheep in the system ready to be exported that all of a sudden didnt have a home. It was a pretty tight season in Western Australia last year, so that caused an enormous amount of difficulty for the producers across my electorate.Come November we saw the trade resume. We had the EMS companys licence suspended in August, but come November voyages to the Middle East resumed. I want to report to the House on the results of some of those voyages. Since 12 November, we have exported 712,000 sheep out of Western Australia. Thats about half the annual turn-off. The sheep mortalities across those 11 voyages have totalled 1,800 sheep, and the mortality rate on average is 0.0261 per cent per voyage, which is an extraordinary result. As a sheep farmer all my life, I know you cant run those numbers of sheep in a normal paddock situation and expect any fewer mortalities than that. So well done to the industry for producing some terrific results that we can be very proud of, I believe, as an industry.The uncertainty going forward revolves around the heat stress review that is being conducted at the moment by the regulator, which has recommended a maximum 28-degree wet-bulb temperature on the voyages. That temperature can be reached in 10 of the 12 months the boats sail to the Middle East. That would effectively close the industry down for all but two months of the year, and that would make it completely unviable.The other area of uncertainty that we are looking at is the discussion paper that was put out by the regulator essentially recommending that the industrys self-imposed moratorium from June to September be extended to include October. That is four months of the year, which is a big chunk of the business that is done during the year, and it is the peak turn-off period for Western Australian sheep producers.Those are a couple of areas I have great concern about going forward. However, I am optimistic. Minister McKenzie visited Western Australia several weeks ago. She met with live sheep and cattle exporters. She emphasised that she wanted to see decisions made around the industry being based on science and hard data. The results we have seen from the industry since the resumption of shipping in November last year prove that the industry can be conducted safely and sustainably. I absolutely welcome the ministers approach to the industry going forward.Question agreed to.Federation Chamber adjourned at 11:56N/A","OConnor Electorate: Live Animal Exports","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RICK WILSON (OConnor) ","(11:51):"
