I would consider it a personal favour if they would do so. It is nearly always the case when our men reach a home port that some of the people are inclined to offer them liquor. Many consider it a part of the entertainment, and perhaps it is; but it works a bad end. The men are thus induced to drink, and drink too much.  On board the ships liquor is prohibited, and the men are unaccustomed to its use. When they get ashore there is no such restraint. On the way around South* America the fleet has made an enviable record for good conduct ashore. It would be exceedingly regrettable if, upon reaching the United States again, this good reputation should be dimmed.  I appreciate that most people have the best motives only in offering liquor to the enlisted men, but it would be better for the men and the navy in general if it were not done. I sincerely trust that it will not be.In view of this request on the part of Admiral Thomas, who is in charge of the fleet which will shortly visit Australia, will the Prime Minister issue instructions to the Committees making arrangements for the entertainment of the men that, as a matter of courtesy, the wish of the Admiral in this respect should be conceded?","VISIT OF AMERICAN FLEET","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/question/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It is also recorded in evidence that the application on behalf of the syndicate in which the officers were partners was pressed into a condition of precedence because of the knowledge that a second application was about to be made. In New Guinea, owing to the absence of competition, it has become the invariable rule to grant land to the first applicant. Thus, by securing priority in application, one practically secures the land.

46,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"DEAKIN, Alfred","009MD","N/A","N/A","N/A",11422,"- In the first place, Mr. Staniforth Smiths participation hardly deserves to be characterized even by so strong a word as  allowing. The Land Board in Papua had never been called on to exercise the function of selection which is continually exercised by Boards of similar denomination in Australia. On the mainland, the Land Boards are appointed chiefly because there are rival applicants-; whereas in Papua the quantity of land available has been so much greater than the number of applicants, that there has been practically no judicial duty cast on the Boards. Their task was that of registration before sending on the application to the Council, which had finally to determine its fate. In justice to Mr. Staniforth Smith, let me point out that in no case up to this had there been any real competition for land in New Guinea. That is why the practice arose of giving the land to the first applicant. Practically, there had never been other applicants for the same block-, or, if there had, it had always been possible to satisfy them in the immediate neighbourhood of the land which they desired. Therefore, there had never, as I say, been any obligation cast on the Land Board to exercise judicial functions.  Consequently, when Mr. Staniforth Smith sat on a Board, of which Mr. Drummond was a member, the latter called attention to the fact, in the first case, that he was an applicant, and in the second, when again it was known that he was interested directly or indirectly, Mr. Drummond, was not asked to withdraw, because there was no other officer available at Port Moresby to make the Board complete. The Board had only to discharge what may. be called a clerical function by forwarding the application to the Executive Council, by whom it had really to be decided.","PAPUA","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[9]/question[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Before the order of the day is read for the consideration in Committee of the Senates Message No. 28, I desire, by permission of the House, to move a motion similar to that which was placed on record in1902, when we were dealing in the same way with the first Tariff passed in the Commonwealth when it had reached the stage which the Tariff now under consideration has reached. I move -That having regard to the fact that the public welfare demands the early enactment of the Tariff, and pending the adoption of joint Standing Orders, this House refrains from the determination of its constitutional rights or obligations in respect to the Message No. 28 received from the Senate in reference to the Customs Tariff Bill of 1907, and resolves to consider it forthwith.We have standing orders of our own, though these are intended to be subjected to some revision before they are finally adopted. There are no joint standing orders in existence governing the procedure to be followed in dealing with questions which affect both Chambers. Consequently, we are, just as we were in 1902, at large in the absence of any defined method of procedure. A constitutional question might have been raised in 1902, and, speaking from memory, the point was raised then as to whether a second series of requests, or the pressing of requests by the Senate, ought to be entertained by this Chamber. In the absence of standing orders dealing with the matter, it was thought wise to waive any constitutional question that might arise, and to deal with the practical question that had arisen, protecting ourselves by a motion of this sort, in order that we might be able to take into consideration without delay the pressing of particular requests by another place. That was considered to be a wise course to adopt then, and as, in the absence of joint standing orders, we are still in precisely the same position as we were at that time, and there is the same obligation to the public to dispose of the Tariff as soon as possible, in order to permit business to flow in well ascertained channels, instead of being subject to the doubts and hesitations in which it would be plunged if the Tariff were set aside whilst constitutional questions were argued between the two Houses, it would, I think be well to adopt the same course on this occasion. In the circumstances, we protect our rights in future by this motion which I trust the House will agree to.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I hold that the Senate had a perfect right to make certain suggestions for the amendment of the Tariff as passed by this House, but this House having considered those suggestions, and having accepted some, and refused to accept others, the powers of the Senate in the matter are exhausted, and it cannot suggest further amendments, but should take the responsibility of accepting or rejecting the Customs Tariff Bill as sent from this House, after its suggestions had been considered. Now it appears that we are to have the Bill bandied about between the two Houses, and we are invited to believe that the motion moved by the Prime Minister will protect our rights in the matter. As a matter of fact, it will not protect our rights at all, because the very fact that we are taking this course time after time can be cited, when a similar occasion arises, as a. reason why we should take the same course again. We have practically established a precedent. It is of no use trying to make ourselves believe that everything will be made right by passing the joint Standing Orders. These have now been for some years before this House, after having been considered by the Standing Orders Committee, but have not yet been dealt with. An understanding can be arrived at, so far as those joint standing orders are concerned, only by making certain compromises with the Senate . But this House has. no right to make compromises with the Senate in the matter of our powers with regard to money Bills. We must be guided entirely by the directions of the Constitution, and we are bound to settle definitely what the proper interpretation of the Constitution is with regard to this question. The matter is a serious one, and I very much regret that the House at the end of a long session happens to be in. such an unfortunate and tired state that it does not care to go into the matter thoroughly, every one desiring that the Tariff question shall be settled at the earliest possible moment. The very fact that the Senate is constituted on an entirely different basis from this House should be sufficient in itself to lead those who represent at all events the larger States to make a strong stand against the action of that Chamber.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[4]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

His speech throws light on the casting votes which he gave as Chairman of Committees in regard to several items on which the Senate had requested amendments. I believe he. felt that the Senate in making requests for increased taxation were taking to themselves taxing powers that they had no right to take. Apparently the position is whether the convenience of the public in having the Tariff passed is of greater importance than the settlement of the relative powers of the two Chambers. It is of no use for us to mark up on the door of the Senate No taxing powers, while at the same time giving them power to tax. They have sent down one set of requests, and now they are repeating and insisting upon those to which we did not accede. It will be found that those requests are mostly for increased taxation, and, therefore, they are, in effect, insisting on the power of taxation.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Are we to understand that if we reject those requests a second time the Senate will accept our decision, or further press them ? If they do press them again, there will be, comparatively speaking, a deadlock. I approve of the stand taken by the Chairman of Committees. It shows, as I said, that his casting vote must have been given in Committee with a view to prevent the Senate from exercising the power of taxation. His contention that the Senate is not composed in the same way as this House shows that the course proposed by the Government will make the Senate stronger than the Constitution intended that it should be. In 1902, as the Prime Minister said, we wrote oyer the door of the Senate,  No taxing powers, and then passed the matter by. Every time we run away from the issue in that fashion, the Senate will become stronger. If, on this occasion, they resist our action with regard to twenty items, they will do so next time with regard to forty items. If they can do that, why should they not take the full power of taxation into their own hands ? If, on this occasion, we adopt the course proposed by the Prime Minister, I hope that we shall send back to the Senate, rejected, every one of their requests.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[5]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
82,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"BATCHELOR, Egerton","JOC","Boothby","N/A","N/A",11427,".- I desire also to support the view taken by the honorable member for Kennedy. A distinction was undoubtedly made in the Constitution between the powers of the two Houses with regard to money Bills, and rightly so, because this House represents the people in the mass, while the Senate represents them in States, and financial questions are not questions which affect the States as States. The Constitution, therefore, laid down a deliberate distinction between the powers of the Houses with regard to measures of taxation. Such measures can be initiated only in this Chamber, and the Senate has no power to amend them. What the Senate are trying to do now amounts to a distinct assertion of equality of power with regard to money Bills, and in some cases of their right to initiate taxation. The Constitution provides that the Senate shall have no power to amend money Bills, but that they may make requests for alterations or omissions, the intention being to make a distinction between an amendment and a request. If the power of making requests can be insisted upon for any length of time, there is not the slightest difference between a power of amendment and a power of request. The introduction of the method of making requests was intended to convey some power less than the power of making amendments. Obviously, therefore, the Constitution intended that the power of making requests should not be insisted upon. A request can be made which we may or may not grant, and there the matter should end. If it means anything further than that - if a continued insistence on requests is allowed - there is no sense in saying that the Senate cannot make amendments. In these circumstances, it seems to me that the House will be abrogating its powers and privileges as the Chamber representing the masses of the people if it gives way in the fashion proposed. I agree with the honorable member for Kennedy that if we admit on this occasion, as we did in 1902, the power of the Senate to press requests, notwithstanding that we carry a sort of pious resolution that we are not really giving way, we shall, as a matter of actual fact, be giving way. The fact is that we are giving way, although we say that we are not. We are saying in effect,  While we are giving way, we are only doing so on this occasion. We said the same in 1902, and the excuse now, as it was then, is that the pressure of public business renders this course necessary. But will not the pressure of public business always render it necessary ? Can we expect ever to have an occasion when we can take as much time as we like to settle the question of the relative rights of the two Houses? The question ought to be considered on this Bill, which represents absolutely the most important expression of the money powers of this Chamber. Proposals for taxation are the very proposals which render it essential that this House should make a firm and determined stand to protect its rights. No occasion could be stronger than this one.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If this House were to take up a determined stand on the question, the Senate would, I think, recognise the true constitutional position, and would give way. Otherwise, it would have to take the responsibility of throwing out the Tariff. On the other hand, if this House gives way on every occasion, our power goes by default, and the Senate is placed on an absolute equality with us in regard to money Bills.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[6]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We may leave out of consideration the possibility of either House laying this Bill aside. Neither House has any intention of doing anything of the kind. The laying aside of an important measure of this character is not likely to occur amongst reasonable persons. But the fact remains that the power of submitting requests has been so used, that duties have been increased at the instigation of the Senate. In fact, for all practical purposes, the Senate has originated taxation - power to do which is actually denied by the Constitution - by requesting increased burdens on the people, and which requests this House has adopted. I blame the Government for that. Had it not been for the anxiety of Ministers, improperly, I contend, to obtain increased duties, and thereby to impose greater burdens on the people than this House was originally Willing to impose, the Government should have refused to allow the Senate to usurp a power which it has no right to exercise by opposing its requests. In their desire to get their own way and to increase Customs duties, the Government have yielded,  improperly, in my opinion, to the Senate, and that House has consequently practically increased taxation on its own initiative. This House occupies a very unsatisfactory position in consequence of the course which has been adopted. Leaving out of consideration for the moment the, question whether the Senate has or has not the right to request increases of duties - and I say that it has no such right - it certainly is a fact that this House, under the Constitution, possesses the exclusive power of originating taxation. It should, therefore, have refused to agree to any proposed increase of taxation emanating from the other Chamber. I do not take exception to the course now proposed to be taken under the circumstances. We know that time is short. I suppose that . time always will be short, and that we shall be in the same difficulty on every occasion when the same power is asserted by the Senate. At the same time, I certainly do not think that We are exercising and protecting our rights to the same extent as the Senate is trying to increase its powers. That House has increased its powers, first of all by suggesting increased burdens upon the people, a right not conferred by the Constitution; and, secondly, by insisting a second time on requests having that object in view. How many times messages of this description can go backwards and forwards between the two Houses, I am not aware. It appears that we have given up any rights in regard to the matter which we had.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But after more mature consideration, I am inclined to think that it was rather an advantage that the practice which obtained in 1902, and which is about to be repeated, should be made perpetual. I believe that where there are opportunities for the interchange of views by message between the two Houses, there is less likelihood of there being a deadlock on a matter such as the Tariff, as might be the case if the Senate were limited to sending one set of requests only.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[7]/interjection[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But it was emphatically the intention of its framers that, while the Senate might exercise the power of suggestion for the purpose of a proposition being reconsidered by this House, if should not have the right to press its suggestions time after time, and try to force down our throat an amendment - for that is what it amounts to - because of its numbers. I ask honorable members to consider this list of suggested amendments. From my stand-point on the fiscal question it contains many suggestions which I should like to see adopted, but we have come to that stage, I take it, when we ought to put aside all fiscal controversy, and to recognise one fundamental necessity, and that is the preservation of the control of this House over money Bills.

Let us take as an illustration what took place, Mr. Speaker, when you were asked recently to give your ruling on the point of order raised by the right honorable mem- . ber for Swan, that the Senate in making -requests for increases of duty had . exceeded its powers under the Constitution. Suppose that you had determined that it was wrong for the Senate to request any increase of duty, and that at the same time we received a message containing requests for reductions of duty in the case of 150 items, and one small request for an increase of duty. Let us assume that that one request for an increase passed unnoticed, that the message was dealt with, and the Bill became law. Could it be suggested that in such circumstances the Courts would have a right to examine into the records of the two Houses, to turn to the evidence of the papers or messages passing between them, and to say finally,  Yes, we find that at one stage a message was sent by the Senate to the House of Representatives actually containing a request for an increase of duty, and that that request was unnoticed by honorable members, and effect was given to the message? Such a position would be altogether impracticable. The Courts could never arrogate to themselves the right to inquire into those matters, and in my opinion, the High Court would never venture to do so. If that view is right, then the position is that we are either dealing with a message under section 53 of the Constitution, or there is nothing before us. I understand that, following the usual practice, a messenger from another place placed this message in the hands of the Clerk, and that, as soon it is was handed to you, sir, the Prime Minister moved the motion now before the House. The message being in your hands at the present time, and the Prime Minister having moved this motion, I desire to request your ruling on the point of order whether there is any message, under section 53, before the House. It must be decided, and you, Mr.Speaker, are the only authority within the four corners of the Constitution who, so far as this House is concerned, can decide it. I do not want to press very strongly the arguments one way or the other. If I may say so, with all respect, I was entirely in favour of the view which you took on the point of order raised on the first message on the Customs Tariff Bill received from the Senate. You then held that the Senate had a right to send a message requesting increases as well as decreases of duty.

Section 53 of the Constitution provides that -The Senate may at any stage return to. the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not. amend; requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. . . .It seems to me that, whilst that provision may be wide enough to include one or more requested amendments, yet, reading the section as a whole, the intention was that at any particular stage the Senate might return the whole Bill, and that the. Senate has no power to send a message without returning with it the Bill to which it relates. The message must be accompanied by the Bill to which it relates. I suppose that at the present moment, Mr. Speaker, the Customs Tariff Bill is in your hands, and the only question is whether this message is one that can be sent down from another place. It seems to me that it is not a matter that can be solved by any motion such as the Prime Minister has brought forward ; that upon you, Mr. Speaker, rests the responsibility of deciding the question so far as this House is concerned. If by any chance the House disagreed with the view that you took on such an extremely important point as this - and I admit that the responsibility cast upon you is a very grave one - it has a constitutional way of disagreeing with your ruling. I should not think it likely that it would do so, but it is in this way alone that the House is master of the question. You, sir, as Speaker, are the only authority that can determine it, and this House can only affect your determination by disagreeing with your ruling if it should desire to do so. I therefore ask you to determine whether this is a message that can be sent down from the Senate under section 53 of the Constitution?","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[11]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

By pressing their requests, the Senate are insisting that the amendments should be made. In the circumstances, it is a waste of our time to argue the matter further.  Honorable senators will only make their position stronger than it has been made by the motion carried at the instance of the Prime Minister, and this Committee will only further humiliate itself.

But immediately we get into Committee, the Treasurer moves to reject the first suggestion made by the Senate. We refused to make this amendment before, and the Senate, adhering to its original decision, has decided to press it. Now the Treasurer is again asking us to refuse to make the requested amendment, and the Senate must either give Way or stand firm on its original request.

The Senate took up an extraordinary attitude, and altered the 500 to 10. Probably both Houses were wrong. I believe that the 500 horse-power limit is altogether too great, taking into consideration the usual requirements of Australian firms; but at the same time I believe that the 10 horse-power limit is. altogether too small. I think that we ought to give to the manufacturers of electrical machinery in Australia protection in regard to the production of dynamos up to at least 50 horse-power. By so doing we should secure to them the great bulk of the Australian trade. They would thus be able to manufacture those dynamos for which their plants are best suited.

He has appealed to us to adhere to our former decision in respect of this matter upon the ground that a compromise was arrived at. I am not quite sure, speaking from memory, whether a compromise was arranged, and, if it was, what was the nature of it. But the Minister must not forget that honorable members upon this side of the chamber offered to adhere to any compromises that had been arrived at in regard to Tariff items, so long as the Government would also respect them. The Treasurer would not agree to that proposal, and consequently honorable members have exercised their own judgment regarding these compromises. The Honorary Minister has also asked us to stand by our twice made decision in respect of this item. I should be willing to adopt that attitude if the Treasurer would intimate his intention to take a similar course in respect of other items. To be fair, any such arrangement must be adhered to by both sides of the House. Regarding the proposal immediately before us, I do think that we ought to consider the mining industry as far as we possibly can. It is an industry of importance to many States, and of particular importance to Western Australia. We know the difficulty experienced in that State in working the poorer propositions.

May I suggest that its passing would be greatly expedited if the Government would accept the modifications of the Senate, and not insist upon pressing for the imposition of excessive duties ? Both the Minister and the Treasurer appear to think that there is only one interest which has to be considered - the interest of the manufacturers. Apparently, the users of machinery which is the subject of high duties are to receive no consideration whatever. They merely have to pay and look pleasant. If we can only get Ministers to realize that other persons besides manufacturers and their employes should be considered, there may be a chance of disposing of the Tariff schedule this evening, but not otherwise.

In 1678, it was stated by the Commons at a conference,  That it is contrary to the constant method and proceedings in Parliament to strike out anything in a Bill which hath been fully agreed and passed by both Houses  ; and in allowing consequential amendments, either in the body of the Bill or in the amendments, the spirit of this rule is still maintained. So binding, indeed, has it been held, that in 1850 a serious oversight as to the commencement of the Act having been discovered in the Pirates Head Money Bill, before the Lords amendments had been agreed to, no attempt was made to correct it by way of amendment, but a separate Act was passed for the purpose.That seems very definite, and as it will affect our procedure, not only now, but in the future, I submit the question for your ruling.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[49]/interjection[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable gentleman should tell the Committee what the term  electrical apparatus   will cover, and he should put it in the Tariff. We should then know what we were voting for. I do not believe the honorable gentleman knows what the term covers, but his officers have told him that the proposal he has made will get, over the difficulty.

Foodstuffs and wearing apparel used by engineers in common with other persons in the community have been made dutiable in the interests of various industries at from 30 up to 120 per cent. ; but apparently it is a crime to suggest that the engineering industry should be protected to the extent of 17 J per cent. Really the way in which this Tariff has been framed is enough to make any man a protectionist.

Right through the piece, in considering this Tariff there has been a struggle for what 1 call  loot  on behalf of .various industries, and I can only regret that so far the engineering industry has been able to get so little of it. Probably the reason why fittings, switches, fusings, and lightning arresters are to be made free is that they are not made here, and that it would be rather an assistance to the engineering industry than otherwise to admit them free of duty. No body of men has done better work for trade unionism than have the engineers of Australia. The industry pays good wages, and is carried on under- fair conditions, and I should like to see thousands of people at work in Australia under such conditions.

I pointed out that, while the duty on manufactured doors had not been increased, the duty on door stocks, out of which Australian workmen make doors, had been increased. If the Ministers proposal be carried, door stocks will remain subject to the duty of 2s. 6d., with the result of decreasing the protection afforded to men employed in making doors throughout Australia. The protection granted to the manufacturer of doors in Australia at the present time is so narrow that the greatest possible difficulty is experienced in competing against the doors imported from America. I am told that the amount of timber available for this purpose in Australia is very limited indeed. Even if we made the duty 2s. 6d. per 100 feet super. instead of 2s., the material used in the manufacture of doors would still be imported, or, at any rate, the great bulk of it would be.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[57]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Why should not a directory be treated in the same way as any other book? But the point in dispute is whether the duty should be 4d. or 6d. per lb. As the duty of 4d. would amount to about 2s. 8d. per copy on the larger directories, surely that would penalise the proprietors sufficiently to satisfy honorable members. It has been stated that the printing can easily be done in Australia. It was said in the Senate that a firm of Sydney printers who formerly had the contract for printing Wises directories had given up the work on account of the conditions imposed. I have it authoritatively stated that no new conditions were imposed, and that the proprietors of these directories did not vary their contract in any way ; but the firm in question indicated that they could not continue the printing owing to the difficulties involved. Honorable members are well aware that there are difficulties attached to the printing of such books as directories. A great quantity of type has to be kept standing, and a large number of corrections have to be made, which involve a considerable amount of work and conduce to the disturbance of other work with which the printing firm may be concerned. In any case, if the work can be done in Australia a duty of 4d. against the United Kingdom will afford an ample opportunity for Australian printing firms to tender. I protest against an unfair distinction being made between this particular book and other books which may be prepared in Australia, and printed in England.

If he knows anything about this matter he has not enlightened the Committee. He takes too much for granted, so long as the representations come from one side only, and are in the direction of an increase ina duty. I have received a letter from another firm who are interested in this matter. I do not happen to know the writer personally, and I ask the indulgence of the Committee while I read the letter in rebuttal of the one just read. It reads as follows -In the Senate last week, Senator Findley, in supporting an increase of duty to 6d. per lb. preference on directories, said that Messrs. Sands and McDougall had received a telegram from Brooks and Co., of Sydney, stating that the reason they had ceased printing Wises Directories was that the conditions imposed by Wises were  intolerable.In contradiction to this statement I have to say that the firm of Wises never in any way wished or did vary the contract entered into with Brooks and Co. in 1902 ; and, further, that in 1904 Brooks and . Co. undertook the printing of Wises South Australian Directory on exactly the same terms and conditions. Again, in 1905, Brooks and Co. advised the firm of Wises that they were putting in additional plant, and would be in a better position to cope with the work, and asking for additional directories.If the conditions were, as the telegram says, so intolerable, why were Brooks and Co. anxious in 1904 and 1905 for additional work? I can only presume, from my own knowledge and what has come to light during this debate, that the rivals of Wises had induced them to join forces in crushing my firm.As regards the printing of the works in Australia, I can only reiterate my statement that my firm has not had a single offer to print the works at any price whatsoever.Trusting the House of. Representatives will retain the 4d. per lb. preference which they have twice carried,I have the honour to be,Yours faithfully,C. Gray.I do not happen to know Mr. Gray, but I received his letter to-day, and have quoted it in order that honorable members may be in a position to form their own conclusions. As regards the contents of the letter, I take no responsibility. Where conflicting statements are made by interested firms, honorable members must realize that there is always very great difficulty in knowing exactly where the truth lies. The firm who produce Wises Directory are known as reputable people, and I think that their statements may be given that credence which is due to the. statements made by any firm of established repute.","N/A","CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[60]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The smaller section of the community have to be considered by them, and the largest section have to pay and to look pleasant, whether they can afford it or not. In the opinion of the Treasurer, only one person in this community has any right to receive any consideration from the Committee, and that is the manufacturer or producer of something in Australia. The taxpayer is not to receive the slightest consideration. Take a New South Wales Directory, which weighs about 8 lbs. At 4d. per lb. the protection on one copy amounts to 2s . 8d.

As a matter of fact, Wises Directory for South Australia was printed from 1902 to 1907 by the Sydney firm, who say that the conditions of tendering were intolerable. Why is this extra duty wanted? Simply because Sands and McDougall are issuing a directory which does not contain within thousands of the number of names in Wises Directory. Sands and McDougall do not spend, within thousands of pounds, as much as Wises spend on the collection of names. In their Bendigo list, there are not one-fifth of the names to be found in Wises list, and the same remark applies to the lists of residents in Geelong, and other Victorian towns. An attempt is being made to force on the public a Victorian directory, which is useless in comparison with the full and complete directory issued by Wises.

The Melbourne Advocate office have stated that they could print, within five months, a directory similar to Wises, and that the work in subsequent years would take only three months. If the Melbourne Advocate office could do the work in that time, there must be dozens of other printing offices in Victoria which could do it in less time. The Salvation Army, which has as fine a printing plant , as there is here, could, I am sure, do it in less time. It may be objected that the information in the directory would be five months old ; but that in Wises Directory must be still more out of date, because the names after collection here have to be sent to England to be printed, and no local correction of proofs is possible. Then the printed matter has to be sent out again. With regard to the statement made by the honorable member for Lang, regarding the firm of Messrs.

Sands and McDougall Ltd.,Melbourne.Dear Sirs,-In response to your request - per telephone this morning - I waited upon Mr. William Brooks - of William Brooks and Co. Ltd. - whom I found had printed Wises Directory for several years, and he very courteously gave me information on the subject which enabled me to wire to you in terms as per copy of original message enclosed. I may supplement my telegram by stating that when William Brooks and Co. were printing the Directory they appear to have studied Wises interests in every possible way, despite the fact that Wise or his representative failed to observe nearly all the conditions intended to operate in favour of William Brooks and Co., while the conditions governing the financial part of the contract were of the most stringent character and quite unfavorable to William Brooks and Co. Further, it was constantly impressed upon W. B. and Co. that the work could be done at a lower rate in New Zealand and England, and this aspect of the matter was invariably introduced whenever W. B. and Co. endeavoured to secure a more reasonable rate of remuneration for their work. Eventually, becoming tired of the exacting and harassing conditions of the contract, Mr. Brooks informed Wise of his intention to relinquish the work, whereupon Wise implored Mr. Brooks to continue the printing of the Directory.Mr. Brooks was obdurate, and now says that while his firm could easily undertake the work without in the least straining their resources, nothing will tempt him to work for Wise again. Given the same work under reasonable conditions, Mr. Brooks is ready and willing to undertake it. I trust I have comprehended your message aright, and that the information furnished will be of service to you.Yours faithfully,D.

One of them said, when he read what the Committee had done,  I do not know whether the members of the Federal Parliament are mad, but the fact of the matter is that what they have done will let in the rich persons material, and exclude that used by poor people. When I reached Melbourne I called upon two softgoods merchants, and asked them whether what I had been informed was correct. They said that they had read the debates in Parliament, and that the effect of the amendment, carried at the instance of the honorable member for Melbourne, would be to let in the very goods which he intended to keep out. Of course, the intention of the honorable member for Melbourne was to give the poorer people the benefit. But, as a matter of fact, the 5-oz. stuff is the richest material made, and it is principally made by foreign manufacturers. I am surprised at the Treasurer supporting such a provision.
