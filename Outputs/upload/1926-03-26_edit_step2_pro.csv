In that report the board stated that it could not recommend an increase over the amount granted under the classification. It would appear, however, that in making that report the board was under the misapprehension that the Public Service Arbitrator, in fixing the maximum salary at Â£480 per annum, had taken into consideration the extra overtime that would be involved under the compulsory voting system. The determination of the Public Service Arbitrator was made on the 5th February, 1924, whereas it was not until the 4th July, 1924, that leave to bring in the Compulsory Voting Bill was given. In view of this apparent error, and also of the fact that the 1925 elections were the occasion of the initial application of the compulsory voting law, and that the difficulties incidental to the innovation were accentuated by the fact that the elections were held some three and a half months earlier than the anticipated date, the matter has been referred back to the board, with a request that it shall review the whole position.","ELECTORAL RETURNING OFFICERS","QUESTIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[5]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

50,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PRATTEN, Herbert","K1J","Martin","NAT","Minister for Trade and Customs",2072,"Honorable members will remember that when this item was under consideration there seemed to be an almost unanimous desire that the duties on asparagus should be increased. It was felt that big developments were in sight in asparagus-growing and canning, and it was generally thought that, our climate being ideal, and other conditions being good as compared with conditions in other parts- of the world, Australia ought to be able to supply the whole of its requirements of this vegetable. Since then, I have very carefully considered the suggested amendment of the honorable member for Corio (Mr. Lister), and the whole subject has been re-investigated. To meet the wishes of the committee, I move this amendment, which goes farther than the original proposal : -That the item be amended by adding the following : -The effect of the amendment will be that sub-items 2a, 2d, and 2e will remain practically unchanged, but that, in the case of sub-item 2b, which applies to half-pints and over quarter-pints, and 2c, which applies to pints and over half-pints, specific duties have been substituted for ad valorem duties-. I submit the amendment to the committee with some confidence. My reason for suggesting the deferred duty is that I am still without conclusive proof that Australia is producing, or can produce, the bulk of the asparagus required in. this country.","Customs and Excise Duties","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Considerable quantities of. Australian-grown asparagus are stored in. the various States, and a market for it cannot) be found, because of the Californian competition. The committee should be made aware of the fact that asparagus produced in California is almost exclusively grown by black labour. Filipinos are employed at the rate of 36 or 38 cents, which equals ls. 6d.. or ls. 7d. a day. The bulk of the work in the canning factories is done by Chinese labour, under the contract system.. My complaint is not against the wages paid, so much as against the class of labour employed. Australia cannot hope to compete in primary or secondary industries against goods produced by Asiatic or other coloured labour. I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter, because there is no possibility of disposing of the present stocks of asparagus in Australia if the duty is not made operative forthwith.","Customs and Excise Duties","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He states that the committee is practically unanimous in its desire to increase the duty. I can assure him, however, that I am not of that opinion. It would be infinitely preferable to reduce the production costs in. the industry.. The Minister asserts that the most favourable climatic conditions for the growth of asparagus exist in Australia. If that be so, the industry enjoys a natural advantage, and, therefore, his argument does not support his case. The proposal must increase the cost of living, and encourage a demand for a further increase in wages, thus helping to place Australia in a more insular position than it now occupies.","Customs and Excise Duties","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member for Corio (Mr. Lister), who has taken keen personal interest in this matter, has shown that ample stocks of asparagus, grown in Australia, are ready to be placed on the market. If the duty is deferred, the effect will be to flood our market with foreign supplies sufficient to last for years, with the result that the duty, when it becomes operative, will be of no value to local producers. If the duty is justified at all, it should be made operative immediately. I positively refuse to support a deferred tariff. The Minister should pay no heed to the honorable member for Forrest (Mr. Prowse), and the honorable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory), but should be guided by those who support Australian industries. I hope that he will not throw this particular industry to the wolves, since it is seriously threatened by competitors that employ cheap and nasty labour.","Customs and Excise Duties","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

With the honorable member for Richmond (Mr. R. Green), I think that every consideration should be- shown to an industry whose competitors have an advantage over them by reason of their employment of cheap coloured labour. The honorable member for Forrest suggested that the Minister, who, in his first proposal, had  out-Heroded Herod, had now gone even further ; but the honorable members argument seems to have  out-Prowsed Prowse. Asparagus is purely a luxury, and, in order to retain a market for it, an article of the first quality must be produced. I have ho doubt that the honorable member, because of his previous arguments against protection, felt bound to say that an increased duty on asparagus would both increase the cost of living and cause a rise in wages.","Customs and Excise Duties","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The unfair competition, of which protectionists usually complain, consists in the employment of low-paid workers. The honorable member, however, confessed that he did not take exception to the wages paid by Californian producers j his chief objection was that they employed foreigners. Therefore, he contended that the competition was necessarily unfair. Could a protectionist argument be more ridiculous? If the wages said to obtain in California are -paid, they are an indictment of protection, because it is claimed that protection prevents  sweating, and keeps wages high. It is almost incredible that such low wages are paid in a wonderful protectionist country like the United States of America. The same argument was repeated by the honorable members for Dalley (Mr. Mahony) and Macquarie (Mr. Manning). Nothing has so displayed the insatiable greed of the protectionists as the speech of the honorable member for Corio (Mr. Lister) who complained of what he termed the small concession which the Minister was willing to grant. I should not have spoken had it not been for his illogical, absurd and inconsistent statements.","Customs and Excise Duties","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The professor asked for a number of frogs for dissection, to demonstrate in the interests of scientific research. A friend told the professor that in a pond in his back yard were thousands of frogs, and that he could supply cartloads of them. Two days later he called on the professor, and handed him a small box containing three frogs. When reminded that he had stated that he could supply cartloads of frogs, seeing that there were thousands in the pond, he replied that he had been led to think so because of the noise which emanated from the pond, but that he found only three frogs when the pool was emptied. Those three frogs had made all the noise. The honorable members for Swan (Mr. Gregory), Forrest (Mr. Prowse), and Perth (Mr. Mann) are like those frogs in that they make a big noise.

As it is the desire of the committee that  shoddy  material shall practically be excluded from Australia, the raw material used in the manufacture of caps will cost considerably more, as . manufacturers will now have to use genuine cotton tweed or woollen material made in Australia. Further, the proposed duty will give an increased measure of protection against the importation of some caps and hats manufactured of  shoddy  material, which cannot be excluded from the country except by a heavy duty. The operations of this Australian industry are perhaps greater than many imagine, as the output is valued at approximately Â£200,000 a. year. The Australian factories axe so efficient and so well conducted that the importations with which they have to compete are valued at only Â£25,000 a year. The local, industry controls the bulk of the Australian trade. Strong; representations on this subject have been made by certain honorable members, and investigations have been in. progress for some time.

I therefore propose to place a few facts before the committee, although it is perhaps too late to ask for an amendment to be made at this juncture. I hope the subject will be further considered before the tariff is in another place. It is true, as the Minister(Mr. Pratten) stated, that the Australian cap manufactures have control of the bulk of the Australian, trade, but their manufacture consists principally of schoolboys caps, which represents a fairly extensive trade, as nearly all Australian, schoolboys wear caps. If we eliminate the value of schoolboys caps from the total value, it will be found that the trade in mens tweed caps is held by importers, as shown by the following figures : - In 1917-18, the importations were 4,000 dozen; in 1918-19, 3,000 dozen; 1919-20, 2,344 dozen; 1920-21, 6,600 dozen. It will be seen that between 1918-19 and 1920-21 the imports of this article have more than doubled. I do not wish to see an exceptionally heavy duty imposed on schoolboys caps, as, although the local manufacturers are working on a small margin - I have seen their figures - they have been able under the- present tariff to hold the Australian, trade. I am. assured that the manufacture of mens- caps is not at present extensively undertaken, in Australia.. Imported caps, a sample of which. I submit, are invoiced in Great Britain alt 12s. per. dozen, or.1s. each, notwithstanding that the material in them costs 7Â½d. in Great Britain..","Customs and Excise Duties","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The cost of the material is 7Â½d., lining lÂ¼d., peak and canvas1d., button and threadÂ½d., making the total cost in Great Britain l0Â¼d. These caps which cost1s. in Great Britain are made in the homes of poor people under sweated conditions of the worst character, recalling the  Song of the Shirt. The cost to Australian manufacturers importing tweed as they were doing before this duty was imposed would be 15s. 3d. per dozen caps with landing charges 20s. 3d. or a total cost of 35s. 6d. per dozen., without profit.

I have never argued! that an increase in the duty always results in a reduction in the price- of an article to the consumer. An article made under sweated labour conditions abroad cannot be made at a lower price in Australia. I have shown, time after time, in machinery lines, that the importers work on a very high margin of profit, when there is no local competition, and that when a duty is imposed to enable Australian manufacturers to compete against them, they substantially reduce their prices. But the public are not being exploited by the importers of these caps, which are made at a ridiculously low price. Honorable members must find it hard to believe that this cap that I exhibit was made for one shilling, but I have seen the invoices and know that it is so. The importers formerly manufactured them here, but the competition from abroad became so keen, that they were compelled to cease manufacturing and import them. To enable them to regain the business, it will be necessary to impose a high duty of 15s. a dozen, plus 35 per cent, on the imported caps.","Customs and Excise Duties","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[16]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

These machinery duties have been grouped along certain fixed lines. Machinery in which there is the lowest proportion of labour to material has been placed in the lowest group. There are four groups, and the duties range up to 45 per cent. British for machinery requiring seven or eight times the amount of labour compared with other types of machinery. I was, as I have said, under a misapprehension as to the proportion of labour required in the manufacture of road-making machinery. Therefore, I desire to withdraw my amendment to reduce the British duty by 5 per cent. I have made careful inquiries into this subject, and I find that concrete-mixers are made by about two dozen firms in Victoria and New South Wales, tar-boilers are made by five firms, tar-sprays by four firms, and stone-crushers by three firms. Practically all engineering establishments in Australia make these machines.

(British) ; 35 per cent. (intermediate) ; 40 per cent. (general).I am not seeking to reduce the duties in the intermediate and general tariffs. I stated yesterday that there is a natural protection of from 50 per cent. to 60 per cent. on this heavy class of machinery, which is essential for road making purposes in Australia. Owing to the action of the Government in imposing dumping duties on cement, many manufacturers in Australia are making enormous profits. A couple of years ago these manufacturers protested that the industry was suffering severely through the dumping of foreign cement, with the result that special dumping duties were imposed, but as the honorable member for Wannon (Mr. Rodgers) showed last night these people now find it difficult to hide the enormous profits they are making. The Commonwealth Government is committed to an expenditure of . Â£20, 000,000 for the building of roads throughout Australia. Because of the great development in motor traction, good roads are essential, and I am sure that no honorable member is in favour of allowing cement manufacturers, or indeed any other manufacturers, to make illegitimate profits. We want a fair deal. Prom what I can learn, it is apparent we are not getting a fair deal in the manufacture of cement, which is so badly needed for road making purposes. A lady friend of mine who has lately returned from America informed me that there is a magnificent cement road all the way from Vancouver to San Francisco. I understand road making in the United States of America costs only about one-third the price in Australia.","Customs and Excise Duties","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[19]/continue[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The duties proposed in this sub-item are atrociously heavy, and I hope the committee will not agree to them.

I was Minister for Mines at the time and took part in the opening ceremony of starting that magnificent plant. It was as fine a piece of machinery as could be produced in any part of the world. The honorable member for Wakefield (Mt. Foster) knows that many years ago machinery manufacturing firms in South Australia were in a position to meet outside competition under what was practically a freetrade policy; so there is no justification whatever for the imposition of these duties on the heavier types of machinery. In metropolitan districts such as that represented by the honorable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) the position may not be so difficult as in country areas in Queensland or Western Australia. A gentleman told me this morning!, that freight on maize fromSouth Africa was 22s. 6d. a ton to Melbourne and Sydney, and 25s. a ton to Brisbane, whilst the freight from North Queensland to Sydney for the same class of cargo was 42s. 6d. I quote this to illustrate the heavy burden that is imposed on distant States in respect of requirements obtained from, say, Melbourne or Sydney. The competition should be fair. People who live in the capital cities where the manufacturing industries are, as a rule located, should be just to the people who live in the country. This heavy burden on machinery so essential for country work is a grievous injustice to country people. The Commonwealth is pledged to heavy expenditure for road-making. Let us then be helpful, and not put obstacles in the way of establishing new cement industries which may put an end to the exploitation of the people. If these companies are making enormous profits the Minister should withdraw the dumping duty; he should not allow cement to be retailed in Australia at a price two and a-half times as great as that which is asked in America, where the rate of wage is probably 70 per cent, higher than it is here.

In view of the fact that within the next ten years the Commonwealth will be spending Â£20,000,000 and the States Â£15.000,000 on roadmaking, the manufacturers of roadmaking machines -will have an unprecedented flow of business which should enable them to build up their industry without the additional 5 per cent. duty. It is a fundamental principle recognized by all manufacturers that if a manufacturer can secure a great quantity of local business, be can produce his articles much more cheaply than he can otherwise do.

There is no doubt that the majority of honorable members on the Ministerial side regarded the Ministers proposal as a compromise which he was willing to accept. It is but a small concession to reduce the preferential duty on road-making machines by 5 per cent. Apart from the duty the natural protection afforded to the manufacture of these machines is about 30 per cent., and before the ordinary duty fixed by the tariff is imposed 10 per cent, is added to the invoice price of the imported article. In these circumstances, the honorable member for Wannon (Mr. Rodgers) is asking for a reduction of 5 per cent, on a total protection which really amounts to about 75 per cent. On Wednesday night the Minister practically agreed toto make this reduction.","Customs and Excise Duties","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[23]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Road construction is of paramount importance. There is no municipality in the Commonwealth that is not hampered by the excessive cost of construction. Out of every 20 miles of roads in Australia 19 miles are in a bad condition. Consequently the excessive wear and tear on every form of transport means a big loss to business men of every kind. This loss is of more importance than the loss of an additional 5 per cent, duty to the industry engaged in the manufacture of road-making and stone-crushing machines.

The Country party members have said that a reduction of 5 per cent, in the British preferential tariff is only a small item. It would be a very small item so far as country roads are concerned because the increased cost of road-making machinery would be spread over a considerable area. But from a manufacturing view-point, this is indeed a big item. The honorable member for Ballarat (Mr. McGrath) has shown that a reduction in the duty would adversely affect the manufacturer of road-making equipment in his electorate. I am surprised at the attitude of the honorable member for Henty (Mr. Gullett). He is evidently opposed to the development of all Australian industries.

A railway was constructed from Adelaide to Willunga under the guarantee principle, the district councils concerned promising to make good any loss on the line. According to the latest returns, there has been an annual loss of Â£35,000 on this railway of only 30 miles, and yet these district councils have never been called upon to make good their guarantee. In the same, electorate a railway runs from Adelaide to Victor Harbour. At the last New Years Day celebrations at Victor Harbour, the town, by the way, at which Sir Henry Barwell made his famous statement about black labour, the present State Premier promised the residents there a bitumen road from Adelaide, despite the fact that two railways already serve that district, and that there are fewer primary producers there to-day than there were 35 years ago. The honorable member for Barker (Mr. M. Cameron) cannot deny what I am saying. Compared with those things and the tremendous taxation that they have imposed upon the people of South Australia, the effect of the proposed duty will be infinitesimal. The honorable member advocates a reduction of 5 per cent, on this item to enable the British manufacturers to compete successfully with our own manufacturers. Rather than accept his advice, and that of the Country party, the Minister should stand to his principles, and be all Australian by insisting that, where possible, we shall manufacture our own machinery.

138,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PRATTEN, Herbert","K1J","Martin","NAT","Minister for Trade and Customs",2084,".- The procedure is that Parliament authorizes the imposition of a deferred duty. I think that the principle first came into existence in connexion with the 1920-21 tariff. The Tariff Board Act provides that before any classification can. be made or before any deferred duty can be imposed, it must be referred to the Tariff Board for investigation and report, the evidence to be taken on oath and in public. The principle of the deferred duty is that it shall not operate until the bulk of theAustralian requirements of the article concerned is made locally. I may say that one or two deferred duties have come into operation during the last two years. A great many have had to be deferred from time to time pending the development of certain industries. It is quite possible that under the principle adopted one or two deferred duties, which were placed on the statute-book in 1921, may not, I am sorry to say, operate for some years to come.Mr.SEABROOK (Franklin) [2.44].- In 1921 the duty on sheet glass per 100 square feet was 2s., 3s., and 4s. This glass is not manufactured in Australia, Notwithstanding what other people may say, I maintain that the Tariff Board has had no evidence whatever to justify the imposition of the proposed duties of1Â½d.,1Â¾d., and 2d. per lb. A case of glass contains 100 square feet. I wish to give the committee some idea of what the increased tariff means. We have always understood that the highest protective duties are imposed in the United States of America,, but the duty proposed in this schedule on glass is 100 per cent. higher than the American duty on glass. The sooner an industry that requires so much protection goes out of existence the better. I wish to see industries established in Australia as much as any one else, bub we are dealing here with, an item which will affect almost every individual in Australia. If this duty is agreed to, every man who builds a house in this country must pay over 100 per cent, more for all the glass he requires. This duty will increase the east of building. I. have here a few figures which will give honorable members some idea of what this item means. The lightest quality of glass imported weighs 16 oz. to the square foot, and the next lightest weighs 21 oz. to the square foot. These two kinds of glass represent nearly 90 per cent, of all the glass imported. The 16-oz. glass is imported in boxes each containing 100 square feet, and the price of a box of this glass in London is 15s. Under this item the duty will be 12s.- 6d. In addition to this, there will be a charge ofl 3s. 8d. for freight, insurance, and wharfage-. The ad valorem duty on a box. of this glass would be 7s-. 5d., and need not be taken, into consideration. The duty under this item, plus freight, will amount to 16a. 2d. on a box of glass which costs .15s. in London. These are actual figures which, cannot be disputed, and they show that the total protection afforded, on. glass of this quality is 107 per cent. The protection on 21-oz. glass amounts to 115 per1 cent. The company that is- asking for this enormous duty has newer made a square foot of sheet glass, and does not intend to do so until this item is passed. Manufacturers who have been making glass for hundreds of years have discarded in its manufacture what is known as the Fourcault system, but that is the very system which the Australian company proposes to install.","Customs and Excise Duties","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[28]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

This means that all the bad glass, containing flaws and blows, which would amount to 80 per cent., must be sent to other markets or disposed of here at a loss. That is the reason why the company has asked for suck a high duty.

Is the Government prepared to impose this tax on the people of Australia for all that time? I am not much concerned about imports from foreign countries, but I do want bo see- the proposed duty on British imports of glass considerably reduced. For the information of honorable members I may say that the quantity of glass imported to Australia, from the United Kingdom in twelve months was 1,858,057 square. feet, and from Belgium and other countries, 9,983, 648 square feet.

He and members of the Country party have no sympathy with Australian secondary industries. In connexion with the growing of wheat or cotton or wool, considerations of inefficiency never enter their minds; but when we are talking of the milling of wheat or the weaving of woollen and cotton goods, those honorable members do nothing but charge Australian secondary producers with inefficiency. Being a good Australian, I have faith in my country, and in its captains of industry. The honorable member has said that the process employed in the manufacture of glass articles pressed is different from that used in the manufacture of sheet glass. It was unnecessary for him to tell us that School boys and girls in the third class know that there is a difference between the two processes. The honorable member has endeavoured to prejudice the committee on this item. He said that the company which is about to undertake the manufacture of sheet glass has not taken all the difficulties into consideration. I anticipate that there will be certain difficulties, but I have faith in the men who are prepared to invest from Â£250,000 to Â£300,000 in the business. Many skilled men in the glass-making industry are walking the streets of Sydney unemployed. Their condition is due to the heavy importations of glass from England and Belgium. Specially trained experts in the manufacture of sheet glass have been brought out to this country by this company at great expense. They are quite satisfied with the prospect, and are showing greater faith in Australia than is shown by the honorable member for Perth, who claims to be an Australian. I am satisfied that if the duty is imposed Australia will, within twelve months, be producing sheet glass comparable with the best Belgian sheet glass. I hope that the committee will pass the item, and, by so doing, will demonstrate its faith in Australian industries and Australias captains of industry.

190,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORDE, Francis Michael","F4U","Capricornia","N/A","N/A",2089,".- 1 am pleased to observe that the Minister has given some assistance to the marble industry by increasing the rate of duty. He ha3 granted, a 10 per cent, increase on slabs, scantlings, or blocks, sawn on one or two faces; a 10 per cent, increase on slabs, scantlings, or blocks, sawn on one or more faces, and one or more edges or ends ; and 5 per cent, on wrought marble n.e.i. The proposed, increase is, however, inadequate. In Central Queensland there are marble quarries in. which, local people have invested large sums of money,, and there are also marble quarries in the Angaston district of South Australia. There has been a considerable increase in importations of marble during recent years. In. 1913 we imported Â£51,775 worth of marble, and in 1925, Â£77.400 worth. Importations of marble from Italy in 1921-2 were: In rough, Â£453; sawn, Â£22,846; and wrought, Â£9,950, making- a total of Â£33,249. For 1923-4 the figures were-: In rough, Â£247; sawn, Â£28,375; and wrought, Â£15,683, making a total of Â£44,260. In 1923-4 the importations from Italy were Â£11,000 in excess of those for 1921-2. The request for an increase in the duty on imported marble was made on the- ground of depreciation, of currency in Italy, inability to impose a dumping duty, low wages in Italy, and high rates of freights in Australia. A number of Australian marble companies have suffered considerably as- a result of inadequate protection. A. sum of Â£30,000 has been invested in the quarries in Central Queensland, and probably a similar amount in South Australia. Owing to the depreciated currency in Italy, the old protection is quite inadequate, and has closed down the Australian quarries. The normal rate of Italian currency is 25.23 lire to the Â£1, but it is now, approximately, 140 to the Â£1. The Tariff Board made its last inquiry into the need for protection for the marble industry on 14th and 30th January, 1925. On 14th January there was only one witness, who was from the Angaston Marble Company, of South Australia. No witnesses were examined in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, or Rockhampton. The board ought to have visited Rockhampton. It visited the South Australian marble quarries, but did not go to Central Queensland. My chief request to the Minister is that he should arrange for the Tariff Board, the next time it is in Brisbane, and, if possible, before the schedule is considered in another place, to visit Central Queensland, and make personal inquiries into the operations at the marble quarries there. When the board; as far back as 1923, wanted to find out certain things about the Queensland quarries, it sent a telegram to the sub-collector of Customs in Rockhampton, who collected the information, and telegraphed it to the Customs Department in Melbourne. Members of the board would certainly be greatly impressed if they could see the Central Queensland quarries. I have some photographs taken last January of the quarries, and the marble from them. I hand them to the Minister for his edification. Machinery that cost about Â£30,000 is now lying idle. When the ex-Minister for Trade and Customs (the late Sir Austin Chapman) visited Rockhampton on the 27th October, 1923, he received a deputation representing the marble interests of Central Queensland, and in the course of his reply lie stated -Regarding the work of the Tarin Board. I desire to explain that it inquires into and reports upon matters referred to it, and then makes a recommendation to the Minister.But I point out that no personal inspection of the marble deposits in Central Queensland was made by either the Minister or the board. The following is an extract from a letter from the board, dated December, 1923 : -I beg to inform you that it has not been found possible to impose dumping duty on marble imported from Italy: but the question of providing greater protection for the local industry by an increased duty is receiving consideration, and will be dealt with in connexion with the next revision of the tariff.No inspection, however, was made of the Queensland quarries by the board. Last year Australia sent Â£80,000 to other countries for marble, and I submit that we should endeavour to keep that trade within the Commonwealth. In Central Queensland no less than 18,000,000 tons of the finest marble in the world is procurable; yet every decade Australia purchases marble abroad to the value of at least Â£1,000,000. It is impossible for the Australian quarries to cope with the competition from Italy, where the wages paid in this industry are from 7 to 12 lire a day. On the 17th March the Italian currency equalled 121 lire to the pound sterling, and last July it was as high as 145 lire to the Â£1 . When the exchange is normal the lira equals 9d. ; but at the present time it amounts to only 2d., which means that the wages now paid in Italy are equal to only ls. 6d. a day. The Italian Government has imposed an export duty on all rough marble sent out of that country, lt has done this in order to encourage employment in Italy in connexion with the working of the marble. Some of the best geologists in Australia have reported very favorably on the quality of the marble found in Central Queensland. Mr. E. C. Saint-Smith, F.S.T.O., Government Geologist of Queensland, reporting on the 15th May, 1921, on the deposit of marble in Central Queensland, stated -Quite apart from the marble obtainable from other leases, there can be no doubt whatever that these two quarries alone would not be worked out in 50 years.I have been informed by those associated with the industry in Central Queensland that a sample of the Ulam Carrara marble was sent to Mr. Harold Parker, the Australian sculptor. Having exhaustively tested it, he furnished the Central Queensland syndicate with the following opinion : -I have now given the block of white marble that you were good enough to send me a trial, as promised. I have pleasure in reporting to you that, in my opinion, it is very good quality, and quite suitable for sculpture. . . . . It is very like the statuary marble of Greece, and should have a great future before it for buildings, monuments, &c.For a few years after the war the Australian marble quarries obtained a fairly good market in this country, and some of the importing firms reported favorably on the Queensland products; but, owing to the depreciation of Italian currency, and the refusal of the Commonwealth Government, to impose dumping duties, thousands of tons of cheap Italian marble were imported until it became impossible for the Australian quarries to compete against the Italian product. Dumping duties would probably have been imposed had it not been for the existence of a treaty between Great Britain and Italy, dating back to 1883. Touching on this matter, the Tariff Board reported -In considering the request for a higher duty, it would seem necessary to bear in mind the fact that the currency of Italy has greatly depreciated, and that the price of Australian marble has been reduced below a payable level in order to meet the competition from Italy. Two Australian companies at least have been unable to carry on in opposition to Italy. If it were not for the treaty between Italy and England, which prevents Australia charging dumping duty on goods from Italy, it seems very probable that the provisions of the Industries Preservation Act would be applied to marble from Italy.It seems to me that that treaty should not have been allowed to influence the action of the Government, since it was made before the establishment of federation. The duty on imported marble provided in the schedule before the committee should be increased by at least 5 per cent. All I ask at this stage is that the Minister arrange for the Tariff Board or one of its officers to report on the Central Queensland, quarries by the time the consideration of the schedule is begun in the Senate. I should like the board, if possible, to visit Rockhampton and submit a report, which could be considered by the Government and the Senate. Let me quote from other letters, which show that marble from Central Queensland was highly spoken of by firms using it a few years ago. Messrs. D. W. Custer and Company, of Sydney, on the 18th February, 1921, wrote as follows : -The samples show a quality equal in texture to most of the Italian marble imported into Australia, and should find a ready sale amongst the monumental and building trades.Messrs. Gunnerson Proprietary Limited, of Melbourne, stated on the 1st September. 1921-We are pleased to say that the quality of the marble shipped per s.s. Mackarra was quite satisfactory, the colour being good, and the marble hard and firm.Messrs. William Train and Company, of South Melbourne, reported on the 4th February, 1922 -The last blocks of marble received from you have turned out well, and we are carving a soldier out of it. Our sculptor says he is well pleased with it, and considers it as good as the imported marble.It may be objected that these laymen are not competent to give an expert opinion. I shall, therefore, quote the view of Professor H. C. Richards, D.Sc., of the University of Queensland. He states -From the dressed specimens, it is seen that the marble can be worked very well indeed, and there is no evidence of cracks or brecciation. Analysis shows Queensland marble equal to any in the world.The marble quarried in New South Wales and South Australia has also been the subject of favorable comment; and now I hope the Minister will take steps to have a request for an additional increase of duty made by the Senate.","Customs and Excise Duties","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[36]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

That means that 210,000 tires entered Australia during that year, their value being about Â£1,842,360. Yet motor tires are manufactured in Australia. I admit that the -whole of Australias requirements could not be met at once, but they could be met within sis months. This regulation should be deferred for that time. Should my amendment be agreed to, Â£500,000 more capital would be invested in this industry, and employment given to a greater number of workmen.

197,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"PRATTEN, Herbert","K1J","Martin","NAT","Minister for Trade and Customs",2092,". - I am afraid the Government cannot accept the amendment, because it would interfere with our policy of giving substantial preference to the Mother Country in respect of motor cars, if we can do so and still preserve the interests of Australia. For the reason that during -the war period the British motor industry -was engaged in the manufacture of munitions, it suffered from the competition of the United States of America. In spite of what has been said here, it is the earnest desire of the Government to encourage British trade with Australia; these duties have been designed to give the British motor car industry the maximum encouragement. The assembling of British motor cars in Australia has commenced, and I believe that under the Governments proposals the assembling of American motor cars in Australia will proceed . at a greater rate than heretofore. During . recent years Ford, Dodge Brothers, and other makes of motor cars have been assembled here. The margin between unassembled and assembled chassis before the introduction of this schedule was only 2Â½ per cent., whereas under this tariff that margin is increased to 5 per cent. Seeing that great developments have taken place in the assembling of chassis in Australia with a margin of 2Â½ per cent. only, we should expect even greater developments with a margin of 5 per cent. The question of the manufacture of tires in Australia is receiving the earnest attention of the department. Although I am unable to say so definitely, I am of the opinion that the Australian tire factories are already working to their utmost capacity. I understand that further developments are projected. If the honorable member for Yarra (Mr. Scullin) will withdraw his amendment, I promise him that the Tariff Board will keep closely in touch with developments, and that I shall have no hesitation whatever in submitting to the Government any proposal considered necessary in the interests of Australia. Notwithstanding what has been said during this debate, motor cars can be bought in Australia today at prices which are very much lower than was the case when these duties were first imposed. The Government is very reluctant to alter its policy regarding preference to British motor cars. A reduction of the preference to Great Britain would not help the assembling of motor cars in Australia. I realize that the manufacture of motor tires in Australia is an important industry. If the Australian factories can add to their production, I shall see that their interests are conserved.Mr.Fenton. - One firm has already increased its capital by Â£500,000 in anticipation of increased business.

A duty hay to be paid on tires, whether attached to the chassis or imported separately, the rate being, British ls. 6d., intermediate 2s., and general 2s. 6d. per lb. Batteries are admitted free if attached to the chassis, being deemed part of the chassis; but replacement batteries, imported separately as such, are subject to a specific duty of British 27Â£ per cent., intermediate 35 per cent., and general 40 per cent. As batteries are satisfactorily manufactured in Australia, it is an anomaly. Batteries, like tires, should be dutiable whether imported separately or not. Half a dozen firms are manufacturing motor car batteries, and among them the Clyde Engineering Company; but their sales are confined to replacements when the original batteries are worn out. As batteries are manufactured in Australia, the same conditions should apply to them as to tires. According to the evidence given before the Tariff Board, for the year ended the 31st December, 1924, 72,551 chassis were imported into Australia,, each fitted with a battery, which, at the American cost of Â£6 15s., gives the total value of Â£489,719 in respect of batteries alone, or nearly half a million of money. The manufacturers in Australia can produce all the batteries required to meet the demand in the Commonwealth. It was stated in evidence before the Tariff Board that one firm could increase its output from 7,000 to 60,000 a year within 60 days. As no less than 80,000 batteries are used in Australia every year, this industry is of the greatest possible importance. Batteries are used for various purposes, including wireless, and I earnestly trust that if for political considerations the Minister cannot accept this amendment he will allow the question to be determined by a free vote. As the committee has shown great patriotism in its desire to help Australian industries in directions where the economic conditions and the value of the production are far less than in this particular instance, I trust that it will be decided to allow the deferred duty to operate. If it is found impracticable the Minister can bring down a recommendation later, but he should accept this amendment, which has been thoroughly examined by honorable members on both sides of the chamber, and has also received the consideration of technical officers. I trust that the amendment will be carried in spite of the difficulties which the Minister has raised concerning it.","Customs and Excise Duties","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[40]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

If the honorable member had left the duty on assembled chassis as it is, Britain would still have had the preference of 12J per cent. If the honorable member had made the duty payable on unassembled chassis under the general tariff 1\ per cent., the proposal would probably have met with the Ministers approval. Preference should be given to unassembled chassis so that the work of assembling would be done in Australia. Most of the factories assembling chassis would, I am sure, give an undertaking to use Australian tires and bodies, and thus a tremendous amount of work would be provided. I trust the Minister will do something in this respect.","Customs and Excise Duties","TARIFF","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[41]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The proposed site is State-owned property in Power and Moore streets, South Melbourne, which the Commonwealth intends to lease from the State for an extended period. The present accommodation for mechanics is inadequate and unsuitable. The two main workshops are situated in different parts of the city, the telephone workshops being at the General Post Office, Spencer-street, and the telegraph workshops at Jolimont. This separation of activities causes considerable inconvenience and added expense. The proposed building will provide better accommodation, and allow for future expansion. Previously a scheme for the erection, as an extension of the General Post Office, Spencer-street, Melbourne, of a building for workshop accommodation was investigated, and reported upon by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, but the proposal was abandoned by the Postmaster-Generals Department in favour of the one now under review. The proposed building is a simply designed concrete structure of one storey, providing a working space of 50,000 square feet. An approximate estimate of the cost is Â£40,000, including accessory engineering services.Question resolved in the affirmative.","N/A","POSTAL WORKSHOPS AT SOUTH MELBOURNE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The existing manual exchange which serves the subscribers in the Hobart telephone exchange area will reach the limit of its capacity by about 1928, and it is impracticable, owing to building limitations, to extend the existing plant in the present building. The new installation will provide an up to date and more efficient service for subscribers. The initial equipment of the exchange will be 4,100 subscribers lines. This will be capable of extension to an ultimate capacity of 7,000 lines, thereby allowing for anticipated development in the area over a period of 20 years.

I recognize that it is the duty of honorable members of the Opposition to obstruct, but, to a certain extent, they forgot their natural instincts, and allowed a very valuable measure to be placed on the statute-book for the benefit of Australian industries.

We were working, U0t for the Government, but for Australia and its industries. There would have been no fight on the tariff had it not been that our place as an Opposition was taken by honorable members of the Country party who sit in the corner opposite. Those honorable members not only opposed, but obstructed business, although they went to the country recently under the leadership of the Prime Minister, and, as a part of the Government, pledged to the programme that was put before the country by the right honorable gentleman. The mandate which they received was forgotten by them immediately they took their seats in this House. I can assure the Prime Minister that whenever the Government comes down with a measure that is in the interests of Australia and its development it will find us, not opposing, but cooperating with, it.","Customs Tariff: Opposition Assistance - Wackett-Widgeon Flying Boat - Ventilation of Chamber","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The tariff was quite a dead letter. We are unable to congratulate the Government upon the tariff that it has passed. I look forward with some dismay to a period of depression, because I feel that the heavy imposts that are to be put upon certain key industries will make manufacturing inAustralia very difficult. We shall, however, be able to show the people of Australia that this policy of very high protection is ruining the country. I hope that the knowledge which is being gained by the people will lead them to return to this Parliament in the near future a Government that will exhibit a far greater sense of proportion than has been shown during the lost week, and realize that a moderate tariff is of greater advantage to Australia than the heavy duties which have been imposed.","Customs Tariff: Opposition Assistance - Wackett-Widgeon Flying Boat - Ventilation of Chamber","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
