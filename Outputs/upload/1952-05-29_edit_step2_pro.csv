The Government was extremely reluctant to close Glen Davis, but circumstances made it inevitable. It is probable that, from an economic point of view, the plant should never have been at Glen Davis, but on the other side of the Capertee Valley where there are bigger deposits of shale. In 1935, it was estimated that for an expenditure of £600,000 Australia would be able to get 6,000,000 gallons of petrol and 16,000,000 gallons of fuel oil a year at market prices. Instead, this country has invested over £5,000,000 in the venture and petrol has been produced at the rate of less than 3,000,000 gallons a year at a cost of more than 5s. a gallon. So from an economic point of view the venture has been fantastic.","N/A","N/A","/hansard/chamber.xscript/business.start/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

If sufficient shale had been fed into the retorts the venture might have had an opportunity to pay its way. In 1949, Senator Ashley went to Glen Davis and warned the miners that they must increase the output of shale. At that time they were producing about 3 tons for each man-shift. Shortly after his visit the production rate fell to 2.8 tons a man-shift and it has been falling ever since. To a very substantial degree, the responsibility for the position at Glen Davis has to be laid at the door of those who have declined to produce sufficient shale to keep the retorts going at full blast. A proposal was made in relation to what is known as  long wall  mining, which might have assisted production. The suggestion was put to Senator Ashley, but he did not see fit to act on it because he knew that it would make no ultimate difference.","N/A","N/A","/hansard/chamber.xscript/business.start/para[2]","N/A","N/A"
3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","About £10,000 a week is being lost in the production of petrol at Glen Davis. In 1947, when the Labour Government was in office, the output of petrol from Glen Davis was 4,000,000 gallons; in 1948, it was 3,100,000 gallons; in 1949, 2,600,000 gallons; and in 1950, 2,400,000 gallons. By 1951 the annual production had fallen to 1,400,000 gallons. The petrol was costing over 5s. a gallon. The petrol produced in 1951 represented . 023 per cent, of Australias consumption, or less than a days supply. The Government realized that it would have to take certain action unless it was to accept the proposition that this disastrous and ruinous enterprise should be continued so that the townspeople would not be disturbed. The Government did not reach a decision on this matter wantonly or without thought for the welfare of the people concerned. I appreciate that the people in the district did not want their settlement to be broken up. For fifteen months the Government tried to interest other industries in the venture. It tried to interest the State Government of New South Wales. It tried to adapt the venture to suit the purpose of various government departments, but that was found to be impossible. Many private industries were invited to put forward propositions. All our efforts to keep the township going failed because people were not sufficiently interested. Certainly no one in the oil industry was interested because they knew what a disastrous economic proposition it had been. So, tenders were called. But not one tender was received for this venture as a going concern. The offer to establish it on a co-operative basis was also rejected. Now, fifteen months later, a further proposition is made to the House, but that proposition has only to be stated to be shown to be unacceptable. In those circumstances, no government, however reluctant it might be to injure the people at Glen Davis in their livelihood, dare, having regard to the public interest, to keep the works going. Consequently, at long last and reluctantly, the Government has decided to close the project down. Generous offers are being made to help those who live in the district, but, as the Minister for Labour and National Service has said, we expect to receive some co-operation from those persons, who, we hope, will not make of this matter a cause for industrial disturbance. Naturally, the Governments readiness to be generous and helpful to them must be dependent upon the willingness with which they are prepared to co-operate with it.","N/A","N/A","/hansard/chamber.xscript/business.start/para[3]","N/A","N/A"

Therefore, during that period the dollar pool has not been drawn on in respect of (a) and (6). Generally speaking, Australian newspaper companies and publishers who acquire and publish this type of material clear their commitments against payment in Australian currency to blocked accounts in Australia in the name of American owners. Statistical records are not maintained for the various categories of expenditure covered by (c), (<i) and (e).Single copies of newspapers and magazines addressed to individuals are admitted but import licences are not being issued for the importation of comic strips and similar material of United States origin.The information the honorable member seeks is not available.The Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations provide a basis for declaring certain publications of this type prohibited imports. Many comics including numerous true detective types, have already been prohibited under the regulations. However, a number of comics enter the country as first-class mail matter in the form of tear sheets, pulls, proofs and newspaper cuttings. As the detection of those goods entering in such a manner would involve censorship of mail, I am unable to agree to this course of action. In addition, single copies of overseas newspapers which arrive by post are also used for reproducing in Australia this kind of material. The physical difficulties of examining every newspaper received by post are insurmountable.In this regard it is pointed out that the Com monwealth Government has no jurisdiction over the reproduction of this material in Australia and the only means of preventing its publication and sale is by concerted legislation by the various States.The information the honorable member seeks is not available.One hundred and eighty , persons have received full-time reconstruction training in commercial art in which the trainee is trained to 40 per cent, proficiency and then placed in employment. His salary is subsidized by the Government up to the point when he reaches 100 per cent, efficiency.If the nature of the licence, agreement, or contract required consent under the Banking (Foreign Exchange) Regulations, then this would be a matter for the Exchange Control as the authority for administering this requirement. Numerous imported strips are re-drawn by Australian artists from material received through the post. Without postal censorship it would be impossible to exclude entirely the inflow of this reproduction material from abroad.Applications for foreign exchange to cover payments on publications referred to in (c), (a) and (e) of part 1 of the question are dealt with by the Exchange Control. As mentioned in the answer to part 1 dollar exchange is not provided in respect of the publication of comic strips.","Books, Magazines and Comic Strips","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[1]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

As the Governments precipitate action in curtailing imports has caused a national crisis and a weakening of the entire British economy, when docs the Treasurer envisage the restrictions being removed and what action is the Government taking to ensure that it will not be necessary to re-impose them?The answer to the honorable members question is that the Government has taken no decision to recognize for import licensing purposes letters of credit established before the 8th March last but against which no actual orders had been placed at that date. What the Government did decide was to permit the importation of all goods which had been ordered and for which provision had been made for payment under irrevocable letters of credit opened by an Australian importer in favour of a supplier in another country. The honorable member will understand that in such cases the supplier can automatically receive payment for the goods on fulfilling the conditions of the irrevocable letter of credit and there is, therefore, no point in refusing to permit the importation of goods covered by such credits.The honorable member for Fremantle also asked me when I envisaged the restriction being removed and what action was the Government taking to ensure that it will not he necessary to reimpose them. The Government -will review and relax the restrictions as soon as it considers that Australias international reserves permit such action but on this point I would refer the honorable member to my recent financial statement in which I covered the matter more fully.Has the Government entered into an agreement with a gold-mining company to exploit the timber resources of a certain area in New Guinea?If so, what is the name of the company?Who are the principal shareholders of this company and where do they reside?Will this company pay income tax on the profits made from the timber undertaking?Is it proposed to manufacture plywood as well as producesawn timber?If plywood is to be manufactured, will the plywood and sawn timber be sold on the Australian market; if so, what will be the effect on the production of plywood in Australian  plywood mills ? 7.Is plywood in short supply in Australia?How will the wages to be paid to the workers employed by this New Guinea enterprise compare with the wages paid to workers employed in similar work in Australia?","Textiles","ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[4]/question[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
