On 28th June, 1906, I, as Chairman of the Committee, sent the following letter to the Prime Minister: -Sir, -I have the honour to inform you that at a meeting of the Printing Committee of the House of Representatives, held on the 15th inst., I was requested to call your attention to the unnecessary printing and extra expense incurred by the Senate in printing regulations under the Post and Telegraph Act 1901, as set out in the journals- forwarded herewith. As I pointed out in my letter of 14th July, 1904, regulations of this character are published under the Rules Publication Act 1903, and presented to Parliament in the usual printed form of such rules.The resolution passed by the Printing Committee was as follows : -That the attention of the honorable the Prime Minister be again called to the fact that these regulations (sec page11 of Journals of the Senate) are published under the Rules Publication Act, and that there is no necessity for their being printed as parliamentary papers.The Printing Committee, in forwarding that letter, had no desire to question the right of the Senate to order the printing of  any document, nor to assail the discretion of the Printing Committee of that Chamber. We, in no way, criticise or challenge the exercise of its prerogatives by the Senate. But, in the performance of the duties for which we were appointed by this House, we think that we have a perfect right to draw, the attention of the Government to what we consider -extravagance in the matter of printing. The letter was merely a continuation of correspondence which has been conducted by me on behalf of the Printing Committee during a period of some years. The first letter on the subject was sent to the Right Honorable Sir Edmund Barton, then Prime Minister, and he concurred in its recommendations. We sent a second letter to the honorable member for Bland, when he was at the head of affairs, and he, too, thoroughly agreed with the Committees suggestions. This is the third letter on the subject. Our object is to draw the attention of the Government to the facts, so that the. Prime Minister may place himself in communication with his colleague, the leader of the Senate, and inform him that certain documents are printed, published, and circulated by authority of anAct of Parliament, so that he may not inadvertently move for their printing a second time, and thus cause unnecessary expense.","N/A","PRINTING COMMITTEE: SENATE PRINTING","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[2]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There is a tendency on the part of the population in Australia, as in other parts of the world, to gravitate to the large centres, and we hope that we shall be able to encourage the owners of land, either to make use of it themselves, or to afford others an opportunity of doing so. The present population of the Commonwealth is 4,052.000, the number resident in the capital cities being 1,435.000, whilst our urban population is 1,944,000.

The honorable member, and those who are associated with him, would allow everything to drift. They would allow blackfellows to come here, and would do nothing to help our people. If the honorable member will look at past legislation in other countries as well as in the Commonwealth, he will see that it is necessary for us to encourage primary production. I regret very much that we have not been able to apply the principle of bounties to the development of our iron industry. If the majority of the people had been of the same way of thinking as myself, we should now be producing our own iron, instead of importing it. All over the world the system of assisting industry by the payment of bounties is adopted. In the Argentine Republic exporters of sterilized milk are allowed a refund of duty on cases, packing paper, and tins. For cotton weaving an exemption from duty is allowed oh machinery, accessories, and materials necessary for the installation and working of the factory for a period of ten years. This is to be suspended if, within three years of installation, native-grown cotton is not wholly employed in the factory. The factory, its capital, and its products are exempted from national taxation for ten years. In Hungary the bounty system is confined to preferential railway rates on certain agricultural products. In Brazil the same procedure obtains. In Bulgaria the manufacture of yarn, and certain other articles, is encouraged by the factories being exempted for fifteen years from licensing, land, and stamp taxation, by reduced railway rates, and by a proviso that -The produce of these factories is to be preferred to foreign goods in all States and municipal contracts, even though it be 15 per cent, dearer than the latter, including the Customs duties paid by them.In Chili bounties are allowed on the exportation of wines and spirits, and the manufacture of beet sugar and sulphuric acid. In France, in order to encourage the cultivation of hemp and flax, a law, dated the 8th April, 1898, provides that for a period of six years an annual expenditure of £100,000 shall be allowed for bounties to growers of hemp and flax. No bounty is paid unless the surface cultivated is more than 956 square yards in extent, and the rate of bounty is fixed by Ministerial decree. For 1902 it was fixed at about £1 3s. per acre. The expenditure for bounties since 1808 has been -N/ABounties to encourage cod fishing are granted to the crews of French vessels engaged in the industry. These bounties range from 12s. to £2 per head, according to the location of the fishery. A bounty on dried cod from French fisheries is also allowed, ranging from 4s.10d. to 8s.1d. per cwt., according to port of shipment and country of destination. From 1899 to 1903 £1,037,000 has been expended in this manner. A system of preferential railway rates is also in force in connexion with French products. In Germany no bounties are given for agricultural products, but in the case of goods manufactured from imported or excisable material, and afterwards exported, a drawback is allowed of the duty involved. In Italy there are no bounties, but preferential railway rates are allowed in a few unimportant cases. In Japan the Government granted a subsidy of £7,000 per annum in 1893, for a period of ten years, to advertise and promote the commerce in Japanese tea. The Ministry of Finance are reported to be satisfied with the results obtained. In Portugal an effort was made by the Government in 1892 to encourage the consumption of native wines by the grant of a bounty to a company called the  Companhia Vinicola de Norte. This association, in return for a bounty of , £3,330 annually, bound itself to display exhibits and establish depots at various foreign cities, one of which was Berlin. The term fixed for the continuance of the subsidy was fifteen years, with the proviso that should the companys profits attain to a certain magnitude at the close of ten years, a corresponding reduction in the grant should be made for the ensuing five. In Russia, in addition to the drawback of excise duty paid on the exportation of spirits, corn-brandy, and preparations of the same (infusions), the exporter receives a bounty. This bounty is fixed at the rate of 31/2 per cent, for spirits of every strength, both rectified and unrectified ; for rectified spirit not lower than 951/2 per cent, proof, and satisfying the standard fixed for purity ;11/2 per cent, is additionally payable to the exporter. The latter is, moreover, allowed a bounty for leakage or loss during the carriage of the spirit from the distillery to the Custom House - 31/2 per cent, for the first month of transit, 2 per cent, for the second, and 1 per cent, for the third. On rectified corn-brandy, and preparations of the same the bounty is fixed at51/2 per cent. Payment of the drawback and bounty is effected in  instalment notes, calculated at the rate of 2d. per degree - the actual excise rate being21/2d. The allowance, however, on spirits extracted from fruit and grapes is reckoned at15/8d. ; the actual excise being13/4d., with a like addition to the rate according to the increase of the excise duty. If the excise duty has been actually paid, the drawback is payable in full at13/4d. per degree. On hemp and flax goods exported from Russia the following bounties are given : -Onyarn and thread, unbleached, 71/2d. per 36 lbs.On yarn and thread, bleached,1s. 51/2d. per 36 lbs.On tissues, unbleached,1s. 63/4d. per 36 lbs.

I wish to quote a statement made by the honorable member for Gippsland at the Hobart Conference. In reference to bounties, he said -These are matters which would naturally fall under the Commonwealth Department of Agriculture. Another is, of course, the Federal Government have sole power to encourage production and export by means of bounties or bonuses; then, naturally, the Federal Agricultural Department should do what it could to encourage the establishment of new and valuable industries. There are many industries which are being successfully carried on in other parts of the world, and which to all appearances might be very successfully established here; but the transplanting of a new industry to a new country always involves new conditions of production. For instance, we would have to find the best seasons for planting, and the best seasons for harvesting, and many other things which involve a certain amount of risk ; and therefore people are very slow to undertake that risk unless the State as a whole will give some encouragement during the first few years. I think we should be very careful about encouraging the establishment of any industry, unless we are tolerably sure that it could be successfully and profitably carried on, after it had 1 fair start, without any State advantage whatever in the future, and become a profitable industry to the whole Commonwealth.I quite agree with the statement of the honorable member, but at present we have not a Federal Department of Agriculture. My colleagues agree with me that the time is not very far distant when we shall have to establish a department of that kind. At present, however, the Slates have organised such departments, and perhaps it would-be better for us for some years to come to work in co-operation with them, instead of duplicating expense. If the Bill be passed, we shall probably enter into negotiations with the States Governments with a view to securing their co-operation in giving effect to our intentions. In the same way I am applying to the States to practically work the Commerce Act with the machinery at their disposal, reserving to the Commonwealth merely the supreme power of control. In Victoria, I may mention that many years ago a bounty was offered in connexion with the planting of vines. The payment, I think, was based upon the acreage put under vines, and I am told that in a great many instances that bounty was practically wasted because sufficient inducement was not offered to the planters to obtain the best possible stock with a view to making substantial profits at a later period.","Second Reading","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

But I have, seen some of the agreements with the growers - agreements under which the bounty is not secured to them in the way that it should be. Whenever we discover a weak spot in that respect, we should endeavour to provide against it. The Bill is so framed that no bounty will be payable in respect of the articles enumerated in the schedule unless they have been produced by white labour. That provision is in accord with the declared policy of thisParliament and of the country. It is further proposed that the bounty shall become operative only when the plants are sufficiently matured to produce the particular commodity required. Just now I heard an interjection in reference to chicory. That leads me ito say that I have received information from one or two persons in Sydney who have been dealing in that article. From them I gather that the granting of a bounty upon the production of chicory is not a very important matter. I learn that a great deal of chicory - almost sufficient to supply the requirements of Australia - is grown in the neighbourhood of Western Port. Consequently, when we come to deal with that item, I shall move that it be omitted. I was not aware until a few weeks ago that so much chicory was produced in the locality indicated. I hold in my hand a list of articles which is interesting from the standpoint of showing how much employment might be afforded to our own people if we produced them in sufficient quantities to provide for our own requirements. Take the article cocoa as an instance in point. I find that the value of the raw cocoa imported into the Commonwealth in 1904 was .£17)037 ; in 1905 it was £19,441, whereas the value of the manufactured cocoa imported in those years was £157,527 and ,£185,686 respectively.","Second Reading","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I need hardly remind honorable members that whilst we have refrained from proposing to grant the bounty for an extended period, it is always open to the Parliament to readjust the bounty, and, if necessary, to extend the period during which it shall be payable.

Our proposition is that for ten years a bounty of 10 per cent. on the fair value shall be payable on the production of fibres, but that the total sum so paid away shall not exceed £6,000 in any one year. Under the heading of fibres we have flax, ramie, sisal hemp, hemp, New Zealand flax, pandanus, and other approved fibres. Flax, hemp fibre, and coir, and other fibre are allowed to come in free of duty ; on manufactured articles there is a duty of 20 per cent-, whilst reaper and binder twine is subject to a duty of 5s. per cwt. In 1904 our imports of flax and hemp were of the value of ,£145,925, and comprised 85,049 cwts. Of this amount, £73,993 represents the value of importations of New Zealand flax. During the same year, 7,459 cwts. of coir, valued at ;£3>535> a110* 4,462 cwts. of jute, valued at £4,354, were imported; whilst in 1905 the imports were as follows: - Coir, 9,885 cwts., valued at £3,303; flax and hemp, 74,186 cwts., valued at .£128,383; and jute, 3,622 cwts., valued at ,£2,671. The import value of cordage and twines in 1904 was ,£91,436, and of twine and yarn ;£54>578. I have no record of the imports of other fibres in 1904; but in 1905 they comprised 3,500 cwts., of the value of £5,146. It was at first proposed that a bounty of £3 per ton should be granted, but since the values of the different species vary so materially, it was considered that it would be better to give a bounty of 10 per cent, on fair value for a period of ten years. On such fibres as New Zealand flax, ramie, and sisal hemp, the first crop of which is not available until three or four years after planting, the bounty would be payable for only six or seven years. These were very large importations. It is remarkable that a country possessing every description of soil and climate should not grow all these kinds of fibre, and thus give employment to a large number of its own people, instead of obtaining its requirements from abroad to such an extent as at present.","Second Reading","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[31]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I think that that is a great pity, in view of the proportions which the olive oil. industry might reach in this country if it were properly fostered. The duty on olive oil is is. 4d. per gallon. In 1904 28,420 gallons were imported, valued at £6,518. In addition, .£38,857 worth of castor oil, and £17, 597 worth of China oil which comes in duty free, were imported.

It has been objected that these bounties may not go to the producers; but I hope that they will go partly to the producers and partly to the manufacturers. No doubt, if the industry flourishes, and production is increased, growers will be able to supply the manufacturers at more reasonable rates than are now charged. That, however, is a detail to be dealt with afterwards. In 1905 1 6, 330 gallons, or £3,512 worth of olive oil, £21,784 worth of China oil, £80,235 worth of linseed oil, £9,453 worth of cotton seed oil, and .£25,969 worth of essential oils were imported.

Lanier, shows what is being done in this matter in America. The article is headed  The Revolution in Rice Farming, and is as follows : -Now, the settlers have seen labour saving implements make wheat fortunes in the Dakotas and California. Why could not they themselves make these Gulf prairies blossom- with rice at a profit? Accordingly, they brought on the wheat machinery they were used to, they adapted it to the new crop, they worked out irrigation methods, and with Government help found the best seed varieties. Here is one result of their labours : before the Civil War, South Carolina produced about three-fourths of our home rice ; North Carolina and Georgia most of the rest. To-day, it is Louisiana and Texas that produce three-fourths of the whole.However, the greatest result is that, for the first time in history, a labour-saving method of rice-production has been demonstrated. The American farmer, although he pays a higher price for labour than any rice grower in the world, may eventually find himself in control of the worlds markets. The patient Chinaman with his mud-rake and his twenty-five dollars a year profit, the Punjab ryots women wielding their slow hand-sickles, the toiling fellah of the Nile delta, the Japanese mattocking his plot, too tiny for a flow to turn - all will be undersold by the progressive American driving his four mule twine binder to his power cultivated fields, past the steam plant where a battery of clanking pumps, impelled by eight hundred horse-power, has sucked up to his growing crop its seventy-day bath of vital, fresh river water.Down on the Gulf coast, one farmer, one helper, and good teams can prepare and plant to rice two hundred or three hundred acres.In general, rice can be profitably grown by the new methods wherever there is land so level that large single fields can be uniformly flooded by fresh water, and possessing enough clay, either in soil or subsoil, to hold water and quickly to drain the fields dry enough for the support of heavy terms.This shows what can be done by the employment of machinery, and indicates to us how we might carry on the cultivation of rice in Australia. At present we levy a duty of 3s. 46. per cental upon uncleaned rice. Starch rice is free, But rice n.e.i. is subject to a duty of 6s. per cental. In 1904 we imported 232,611 centals of uncleaned rice, valued at £107,070, and 267,574 centals df rice n.e.i., valued at ,£129,465. In j 905 we imported 259,004 centals of uncleaned rice, valued1 at £113,554, whilst of rice n.e.i. we imported 253,319 centals, valued at £112,939. Rice is worth 2 1/2 d per lb.

Now we come to the last item in the schedule, namely, rubber. Last night, I had an interview with the manager of the Dunlop Tyre Company, who told me that if we could produce rubber in the northern parts of Australia - and there is, no doubt that it could be produced, because we have a native rubber tree which is capable of being cultivated with advantage - his company would purchase £10,000 worth of rubber per month. In view of this large local demand, every encouragement should be offered to planters to engage in the enterprise. It is proposed to give a bounty which will not exceed £7,000 per annum for a period of ten years, under conditions to be prescribed by regulation. We have not been able to fix the rate at which the bounty shall be payable, because the matter is a difficult one to deal with. At present, crude rubber is admitted free of duty, but we levy 15 per cent, upon rubber manufactured n.e.i. In 1904 our importations of rubber manufactures, including crude rubber, which were admitted free, were valued at £100,389, whilst the imports of rubber manufactures n.e.i. were valued at £100,275. In 1905 the imports free of dutv were valued at £102.983, whilst the rubber manufactures n.e.i. introduced were valued at £129,482. At present the rubber used bv the Dunlop Company comes from Ja.va, or South America, and their consumption is very large. They offer to take rubber to the value of ;£ 10,000 per month, or in all, £120,000 worth per annum. I have referred seriatim to the matters dealt with in the Bill, and I hope I have sufficiently explained them to honorable members. I trust that they will have no hesitation in passing the Bill, because if we can merely meet our own requirements, to say nothing of exporting the commodities mentioned, we shall confer a great benefit on the community generally. We should have preferred to bring forward this measure at an earlier stage, but it was impracticable to do so. We should! also have liked to embrace a much larger number of items, but we did not think it wise to submit any more comprehensive programme at the present time. We have endeavoured to make provision for the encouragement of those industries which can most readily be developed, and which will conduce in the greatest degree to the settlement of our territory.","Second Reading","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/continue[49]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

However, it is refreshing to find that the Government are awakening to a recognition of the fact that something requires to be done in that direction. Hitherto the only stimulus which has been imparted to agriculture has been by way of the bounty which has been so generously granted for the purpose of fostering the sugar industry. I am glad to know that the Government are now turning their attention to the development of other products. I need not surmise why they are taking this step. I can only express my gratification that attention is being devoted to this particular matter. It is unfortunate that the Bill is so badly drawn, and it was scarcely fair of the Minister to saddle the draftsman with the blame in this connexion, because we all know that the Parliamentary Draftsman merely frames a measure in accordance with the instructions which he has received from the Minister. The statement that the Bill can be altered in Committee shows that the Minister of Trade and Customs has an open mind upon it, and is prepared to accept amendments. To my mind there is no Bill which ought to be considered less of a party measure than ought this. It is a Bill upon which honorable members can express themselves freely without being open to the taunt that their criticisms are prompted by party motives. Another reason why we should express out opinions freely, is that the step which we are now asked to take is a very grave one. We should endeavour to pay the greatest attention to it, in order that we may start upon sound lines, and not be subsequently called upon to retrace our steps. Whilst fully agreeing with the system of bounties, I doubt whether the proposals which have been submitted to-day are best suited to the requirements of Australia at the present time. The Bill proposes that we should spend a very large sum of money, namely, £500,000. The expenditure of that amount, if directed into proper channels, would prove of incalculable benefit to this country. If, on the contrary, it is frittered away, we may continue the system of granting bounties for six or eight years, and at the end of that time find ourselves asking,  What benefit have we derived from this expenditure?","Second Reading","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In some respects, I like the proposals which are embodied in the Bill, though they are scarcely upon the lines that I should have chosen myself If we look at the circumstances of Australia to-day, we find that a large extent of our territory is arid. I suppose that, after we utilize to the fullest extent all our water resources, 90 per cent, of our territory will be absolutely dependent upon the rainfall. In other words, we shall have a territory as large as that of Europe, which will be dependent upon the natural rainfall. Consequently, we should ask ourselves,  Can this great tract of country be made wealth-producing, or must it always - by reason of the intermittent character of the seasons - remain a place where all the operations of the producer are a mere gamble - where there is no certainty that he will secure a return from one year to another. Our first attempt should be to solve this great problem. In making that attempt we should endeavour to co-ordinate our work with that of- the States. We should co-operate with them in what they, are doing. The Minister has expressed a similar opinion, but I would point out that the Bill contains nothing in the shape of proposals to that end. We know that some States are doing a very great deal towards developing their territory, whilst others are doing very little. At Perth, in Western Australia, there is a station which is accomplishing a little. In Queensland there is the Gatton College, which takes students, and which, within its circumscribed area, is performing good work. In New South Wales there is the Hawkesbury College, and several other institutions which are rendering excellent service ; and in Victoria, we have the Dookie College and the Longerenong institution, although as a Victorian I am bound to confess that they have not proved the success which they should have been. The Dookie College has cot sent out one man who has left the imprint of his individuality upon farming operations in this country.","Second Reading","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In the first place, the soil requires to be so treated that all the moisture precipitated shall enter it, and be stored there for plant use. In order to  accomplish this, it needs to be worked by special cultural methods. Then we require to plant crops which are adapted to our soil and1 climate. We must further develop the seed that we get. in order to obtain that which is most suitable to the conditions of our country. Then we must learn the right time and manner of planting that seed. It is well known that crops grown under arid conditions are better than those which are produced under more humid conditions. If we can accomplish something in that direction we shall be moving upon right lines. In regard to the cultivation of tropical products we must always recollect that they will have to compete with the cheap labour of the world. For a very long time the market for those products will be outside our own country, and consequently I do not think it is either necessary or desirable to introduce into this Bill restrictions as to the class of Labour that shall be employed in their cultivation. It seems to me that our present restrictive laws are sufficient to enable us to deal with that aspect of the question without imposing upon the growers of these products any more restrictions than are absolutely necessary. As far as- is possible, consistently with the declared policy of this: country, we should allow them as much freedom in carrying out their experiments. as we can. Then the Minister has given, us absolutely no information whatever regarding the organization under which effect is to be given to the provisions of the Bill. When proposals involving such an enormous expenditure are submitted to the House, it is only reasonable that details as to how they are to be carried out should also be supplied. It seems to me that we ought to have adopted the advice which was given to us some years ago, and to have had in existence to-day a Federal Department of Agriculture. Honorable members will recollect that in June, 1901, the honorable and learned member for Bendigo brought that matter under the notice of the House. It was then dropped for a period of three years, but in July, 1904, the honorable and learned member again pressed the subject upon the attention of Parliament. His proposal was supported in most eloquent speeches by the Attorney-General, the Minister of Home Affairs, the honorable member for Macquarie, and others, but up to the present time nothing whatever has been done to give .effect to it. I . contend that we need not start upon elaborate lines. If we commenced operations upon a small scale, and allowed the Department to grow gradually, we should be acting wisely. If we did that, and co-operated with the States, we should be confident that the undertaking would he efficiently supervised, and that our operations would tend to ultimate success. In moving the second reading of the Bill, the Minister of Trade and Customs referred to the experiment which was made in Victoria, in granting a bounty upon the planting of vines. I was a . member of the-State Parliament when those proposals were submitted, in 1886 or 1887. They were very much better thought out than are the proposals contained in the Bill under consideration. They were submitted by the Hon. J. L.. Dow, who has always been a strong supporter and sincere friend of the agriculturist. Their objects were as follow : -First, to induce the farmers throughout the Colony to enter upon the growth of additional products by means of acreage bonuses, in order that they may not confine their attention to the production of one or two cereal crops; second, ito promote an improvement in the quality and packing of dairy produce, fresh fruits, and wines exported to the London market; third, to induce the establishment of factories for fruit canning, fruit drying, dairying, wine-making, raisin and currant making, vegetable oil making, and preparing for the manufacture of flax, hemp, silk, and other products to be named in regulations ; fourth, for the introduction of new varieties of seeds and plants; fifth, for the establishment of a system of agricultural technical education ; sixth, for the publication of agricultural reports ; and, seventh, for the introduction of new kinds of agricultural machinery and appliances.I should very much like to have seen a comprehensive proposition submitted to this Parliament, instead of the proposals which are embodied in the measure before ais, great and useful as many of them are.","Second Reading","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The Victorian proposals, to which I have referred, were much wiser, more comprehensive, and far more suited to our circumstances than are those now submitted to us. When we examine the Bill, we find that the bounties are to be paid on goods, and not on crops. It is specified that they are to assist agricultural development, and they have been heralded with the cry of  Protection for the farmers. They will certainly give assistance to the farmers, but they will not constitute protection for the farmer in the sense that we understand the term. They will probably help some but not many farmers. I believe that the Government proposals will play into the hands of the manufacturers, and help them to a much greater extent than the farmers. I understand, however, that that is not the intention of the Minister. The honorable gentleman emphasized the point that his desire was to assist the primary producer. I would remind the House, however, that under this Bill, the bounties are to be payable only on the finished product placed on the market. We shall find that the great bulk of them will be paid to those who turn the raw material into various manufactures, and not to those who actually produce it.","Second Reading","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He will grow the raw material, but in very few cases will he treat it. The treatment will be in the hands of other parries, upon whom he shall have to depend. The farmer may put his best work into the cultivation of one of these products, whilst the reward for his industry will depend on the treatment of what he produces by some one else. What guarantee will the farmer have that the raw material that he produces will be treated in such a way as to secure a return to him in the shape of a bounty ?

To the farmers in the Ministers electorate, as well as in that which I represent, and also in. South Australia and Western Australia, these bounties will be practically valueless. Very few will be able to take advantage of them. Whilst in themselves these bounties are good to a certain extent, do not let us delude the farmer into the belief that they are going to participate in their distribution, when the great bulk of them are not likely to do so. I believe, however, that these proposals will do good. The Government proposal, although not altogether on the lines that I favour, is in the right direction.

Skeleton Bills are passed, and everything that is to be done under them is defined in regulations drawn up by officials. There is no proposal that the regulations under this Bill shall be placed! before Parliament. We do not know what shape they will take, or whether they will carry out the object we have in view. They will be framed at the will of the Minister. The honorable gentleman says that he will invite the co-operation of the experimental farms, but he is to have supreme power under this Bill. He is to prescribe who may be employed, what wages shall be paid, what acreage is to be cultivated, and what bounties shall be paid, and he is also to fix the time that must elapse between the growth of the product and its manufacture in a form to warrant payment of the bounty. He is to halve a still greater power - the power, at his own sweet will, to divert a bounty from one product to another. These powers are too great. I hold that the regulations under this Bill should be submitted to the House and that the whole scheme should be subject to proper supervision. We have no indication, however, that that course is to be followed. In the face of these drawbacks to what are otherwise good proposals, what farmer is going to risk his time and money in seeking to earn the bounty? If bounties are to be given, let them be allocated between the various parties instrumental in placing these new products on the market. If that be not done, the whole scheme will fail. The farmers will not take it up, but we shall have a combination of farmers audi manufacturers making arrangements to secure the bounties. Wealthy people who can afford to buy the necessary land, employ the requisite labour, and wait until the result of their work appears in the shape of the manufactured article, when they can claim the bounty, will take up these proposals. The ordinary working farmer, whom this Bill is intended to help, will not participate in the bounties except to the very smallest extent. The provisions in regard to the employment of coloured labour are somewhat ludicrous. It is interesting to learn that a man who has one white parent may be employed in producing any of these articles, but I do not know why ethnological problems should be submitted to us in a Bill of this character. A man with one white parent will have a chance, but who is to prescribe the degree of whiteness necessary to enable a man to participate in these bounties? Perhaps, it will be necessary to produce a certificate of marriage.","Second Reading","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[13]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

A coloured man from a country where some of these products are grown might be disposed to come here, purchase an area of land, and produce some of these articles by white labour ; but he would be unable to secure the bounty. . If we hamper these proposals in such an. arbitrary way, we shall probably deter people from embarking on these new industries. Our ordinary immigration restriction laws should deal with these matters, instead of their being dealt with in a measure for the advancement of the industrial welfare of Australia. It- has yet to be shown whether white labour earn successfully grow these products in the north, where many of them can be raised. Throughout the rest of the world many of these products are grown bv coloured men, and it is with the products of these men, living under the lowest conditions, that we shall have to compete. The Minister has obtained some information with regard to the production of rice, which is undergoing great changes in the United States of America. In the Carolinas and other parts of the United States, where rice is grown on swamps near the seashore, the sea has encroached on lands previously used for rice cultivation, and rendered it totally unfit for that purpose. As the result of this encroachment the rice-growers have been obliged to go to the uplands of Louisiana and Texas - not California, as the Minister said - and to form artificial swamps there for their crops. Rice must be grown in swamps. It has to be planted in water, and after that water has been allowed to remain for a certain time it must be drained off. lini America they have made great levees, and have placed on the rivers immense pumping plants, because the water has to be flooded over the land very quickly, and got rid of again at the proper time with equal rapidity. In this way rice is being grown which is equal to that grown in any other part of the world. The labour employed does not consist entirely of white men, much of it being Chinese and Japanese, while, in some cases, European aliens are engaged. There is nothing to prevent us from growing rice in Australia in a similar manner; but what stimulus will the offering of a bounty of £1,500 a year be to the industry ? I believe that in the electoral division of the Hume, and in other parts of Riverina, the growing of rice could well be carried on under conditions such as I have described ; but the offer of a bounty of £1,500 per annum will not stimulate the industry, .because those embarking in it will require a large amount of capital in order to obtain land, to make it ready for their operations, and to erect the machinery necessary for pumping water upon it. Formerly, the granting of bounties was the free-trade method of encouraging production, which the protectionists used to condemn. When the giving of bounties was first proposed in the Victorian Parliament, it was condemned by many sincere protectionists, being looked upon as a freetrade device, preventing the imposition of duties. I am therefore surprised tha-t the free-traders are resisting these proposals - especially since John Stuart Mill, the great apostle of free-trade, recommended the bounty system. .","Second Reading","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[14]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I think there is a more excellent way in which money could be spent to assist the agricultural development of this country. The Minister sought to recommend the Bill by referring to a number of countries which give bounties. He named. Hungary, Brazil, Chili, France, Portugal, and Russia. I do not think we should follow on the lines pursued by those countries, where labour receives the very lowest payment. They are not countries whose example we should follow in trying to develop Australia. We should rather look to those parts of the world where agriculture has greatly progressed, and whose peoples are now in the front rank of the worlds producers. We shall find that they do not give bonuses. I do not recommend that we should slavishly copy the example of any country; but we should carefully examine all successful attempts to assist agriculture, in order to see if we cannot profit thereby.

France is a country of very small holdings, where assistance has been given to the small man ; but the assistance proposed to be given by the Government -would not, I think, go to small men. One word alone will explain the progress and development of the countries I have named, and that word is  education. They have educated their people by means of experimental investigations, having thus built up a sound and scientific method of agriculture. If we consider the work of Liebig, in Germany, in regard to the chemistry of the soils, and the discovery of the fertilizers necessary to make them useful, and to restore the waste that is continually going on, we must recognise the great utility of his labours, not only to Germany, but also to the rest of the world. The first experimental station in Germany was started at Moeckern in 1851, and since that time practical experiments, coupled with chemical investigations, have enabled the country to progress by leaps and bounds.. There are now seventy experimental stations in Germany, designed to assist the farmers of that country. Germany was the first country where an attempt was made to discover the true relations between chemistry and agriculture. America has, followed suit, and is battering the instruction it has received. Washington himself saw clearly what the development of agriculture would mean to that country, and in 1796, in his address to Congress, said -It will not be doubted, with reference either to industrial or national welfare, that agriculture is of primary importance. In proportion as nations advance in population, and other circumstances of maturity, this truth becomes apparent, and renders the cultivation of the soil more and more an object of public patronage.Although America was slow to adopt these views, when it took the matter in hand it went ahead very fast. The first experimental station there was established in 1875. By 1886 twelve stations had been established, and now there are in the United States over sixty stations, with a staff of about 700 persons, nearLy all of whom are scientific teachers. At these stations every branch of agriculture receives attention, from the first operations in connexion with the treatment of the soil, to all details connected with plant and animal life and their diseases. Whereas in this country agriculture is. an industry conducted at random, the sport of season and circumstance, in America the work of the farmer is carried on in accordance with well-defined scientific principles. The investigations of the experimenting stations cover, amongst other things, the perfecting of machinery and implements, the fertilizing of the soil, the suitability of soils to crop, drainage, seepage, irrigation, methods of cultivation, rotation of crops, feeding and digestion experiments, and the value of different kinds of food for various kinds of stock, laboratory investigations of diseases of plants, the introduction of drought-resisting seeds and plants into arid areas, and the crossing of plants to secure stock which will suit special conditions. The effect of these wide investigations has been to put America in the front rank as an agricultural country, and it has been brought about by the efforts of far-seeing men, among whom is Justin S. Morrill, who, in 1862, had 11,000,000 acres set aside for experimental purposes. He was followed by W. H. Hatch, who brought in a Bill instituting experimental stations. Later on Morrill obtained a further grant, sp that now each experimental station receives 25,000 dollars a year from Congress, while they are also assisted by the- States. I visited one or two of them, and saw the work which they are doing. They have sent trained men all over America, who assist the agriculturists when in- difficulty or trouble, by putting them on the right road, and keeping them there. At the Department of Agriculture, in Washington, scores of letters are received every day from farmers from all parts of the Continent. The officials deal with the matters referred to in these letters, or remit them to experimental stations, from which experts are Sent to ascertain the cause of the trouble, and to put matters right again. The work of the experimental stations was crowned by the establishment of a Federal Department of Agriculture, which is what we require in Australia. That Department was established in 1862 ; but it did not attain its full measure of usefulness until, in 1897, it was reorganized by Secretary Wilson, who had been Senator Wilson, of Ohio. I had the pleasure of meeting him a short time ago. He brought the Department to such a pitch of perfection that now there is no institution of the kind elsewhere which equals it, or whose work will compare with that done by it. There is no matter affecting agriculture with which it does not deal. . There has recently been added a Bureau of Rural Engineering, which will be a most valuable branch of the Department. Experiments have been made as to the best implements for dealing with various classes of soils, and especially for the cultivation of arid soils. The circumstances of Australia are similar to those of the United States. Although the area of the United States is so large, they are as hard pushed there to find land for the people as we are in Victoria. The good country lying to the eastward of the 96th meridian, which divides the humid from the arid area, is all taken up, while to the westward there is a tract over 500 miles wide by 1,100 miles long, with a rainfall declining from twenty inches to nothing. The problem of America, during the last seven or eight years; has been how to get this arid country settled. Every effort has been made by the Central Department of Agriculture, and by the experimental stations, to obtain a solution of this problem, by discovering means whereby the land can be farmed with some certainty of a profitable return. The farmers there have been taught how to store the moisture in the soil by proper cultivation, how to use the winter floods, how to bore for wells, and what are the best implements for deep cultivation. Professor Campbell has been fourteen years at the Nebraska University, doing nothing else but investigate the problems raised by the dry area, with a view to ascertaining how best to keep moisture in the soil, what are the best means of cultivation, and how it can be used to most advantage. In 1899, they sent men all over the world to obtain drought-resisting seeds. These agents brought back with them from the plains of the Volga, from Siberia, Algiers, and other places, wheat, oats, maize, grass, sorghum, and various other seeds, which have been distributed throughout the droughty areas. As one consequence the wheat-producing area has, since the beginning of the century, been extended 200 miles further west, I saw beautiful crops being grown in country which enjoyed only a 12-inch rainfall.","Second Reading","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[16]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Under the system of cultivation adopted in the United States, the ground is kept open and the moisture is able to find its way well below the surface, and remain stored there for the use of the plants till they come to perfection. I am quoting these cases to show that it is desirable that we should educate our people as to the best methods of cultivation, and the proper crops to grow, rather than bring in proposals intended to encourage the cultivation of only a few products. I dc not say that the Government proposals are wrong. They will probably be productive of much good, but I contend that under present circumstances, we should consider first measures that would be calculated to help the country further ahead. It is our first duty to assist those who are occupying our dry areas, who are fighting against drought, and dust, and hot winds, and all the discomforts that attach to life in the interior. We should show them - as other countries are doing - how they can increase production, and make life bearable. In the State of Utah, which has about the same area as Victoria, namely, about 83.000 square miles, :not 1 per cent, of the land is under irrigation. It was thought that the rest of the territory was practically useless except for the rearing of rough stock, but by means of diligent cultivation and deep soiling, much of the area that was held in such low estimation is being rendered productive. In 1903, Dr. Widstoe, the chemist at the Experimental Farm, at Logan, Utah, joined with Professor Morrill, the agronomist, in recommending to Governor Heber that experimental stations should be established in various parts of the State. This suggestion was brought before the State Legislature, and was forthwith adopted. Senator Whitmore joined with the experts mentioned in selecting six sites in country that had been deemed almost valueless, and in each case forty acres were fenced in at the cost of the country, which also found the land. The experimental stations were located in places where the soil contained 40 or 50 per cent, of gravel, or 60 per cent, of sand, or clay and other unpromising elements. In the lol lowing season, crops averaging from twenty down to four bushels of wheat were obtained, and the results were quite a revelation to the people of the Stare.","Second Reading","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[18]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It has been established beyond doubt that nearly the whole of the area in Utah that was regarded as practically worthless can be cultivated with profit, and large tracts of country are being settled by persons who know that under a proper system of tillage they can feel assured of obtaining a return for their money. This matter is of greater importance than my remarks up to the present might indicate. This is not merely a matter of consequence to us, but is an Imperial question also. When I was in the old country I was a strong advocate of preferential trade, but I found very few people who agreed with me, because nearly a.11 those I met were free-traders, who thought that a duty on foodstuffs would ruin the country. I was asked if we could guarantee to supply Great Britain with all the food-stuffs she required, and I was told,  If you will guarantee to. supply all our needs in the way of foodstuffs, and thus render us independent of foreign countries, we are prepared to adopt a preferential Tariff, and place you in a position of advantage as compared < with other countries. It seems to me that the solution of the question lies in the utilization of our enormous areas of country, which, under improved methods of cultivation, could be made productive. I am not opposed to the granting of bonuses, but I think that we should- devote our attention to the larger question. We should cooperate with the States Governments in conducting experimental stations, and should place the work of such stations to a very great extent under State supervision. We should endeavour to show our agriculturists how to successfully grow different products. If we once did this, and demonstrated that certain products could .be grown with profit, we should -not need to grant bonuses. The enterprise of our settlers would be sufficient to bring about the production of all that we require, and a great deal more. I would ask honorable members which would be the best plan to adopt : to educate our people up to the point necessary to enable them to profitably utilize our large waste areas, or to grant bounties and largesse to a comparatively few?","Second Reading","BOUNTIES BILL","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/continue[20]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We already have some reports upon the Tariff which I think should be disposed of without further delay. I recognise that the Government are responsible for the conduct of business, but I venture to say that they are adopting a wrong course in this matter, and that they will inevitably be led into a difficulty at a later stage. I agree with the Prime Minister that the Budget debate will furnish honorable members with every opportunity for the ventilation of grievances. At the same time, I consider that we are making a sacrifice in surrendering  grievance day, and I am glad that it is proposed merely to suspend the Standing Orders, and not to abolish that institution. I knew nothing of  grievance day  before I came to Victoria, but in my judgment it is a very useful institution, and but for its existence numerous adjournment motions would be moved and much time would be wasted. If time were not consumed in this way grievances would be ventilated as they arise, and .more time would thus be occupied. At any rate, that is my experience, extending over a good many years. However, I hope that the surrender of private members day will afford the Government a further opportunity of disposing of the remaining business of the session. My advice to them is that they should make up their minds speedily as to the particular business which is to be transacted, take the House into their confidence by letting honorable members know the task which they have to perform before they separate, and then, no doubt, the Prime Minister will be able to command the co-operation of everybody concerned in an endeavour to deal with it in some shape or form.","N/A","STANDING ORDER 241 :  GRIEVANCE DAY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[2]/continue[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I again urge upon the Government the desirableness- of taking the House into their confidence, and of making an earnest effort to wind up the session as early as it is possible to do so. The best way to accomplish that is to let honorable members know exactly what they are expected to do, so that 1,Ve may address ourselves to the task of disposing of the business at an early date.

It was quite a refreshing change to see the members of that party taking a keen interest in the debates of the Chamber. However, the mail contract has now been disposed of, and therefore we may expect to see them once more assume their attitude of wonted calm and philosophic consideration.

They avow that they do not exaggerate when they say that, in connexion with grievance day, they have heard more drivel talked than they have ever listened to in any other deliberative assembly. I should have been much better pleased if the Prime Minister had proposed to abolish grievance day altogether. It is quite true that the adoption of that course might give rise to the discussion of an occasional motion of adjournment. But that is the way in which an important matter should be dealt with. It ought not to be sandwiched between a proposal, probably for the mending of the village pump, and another, perhaps, for sticking a postage stamp upon a sign board of the Commonwealth.

I was very much surprised at the attitude taken up by the honorable member for Echuca, especially in view oj the fact that a few weeks ago he objected to postpone a motion which he had upon the business-paper to enable honorable members to witness a very important experiment in connexion with the transmission of the first Marconi message to Tasmania. Upon that occasion he urged that his proposal was of such serious public import that it did not admit of any delay. I note that it is now set down for consideration upon 2nd August. If it were important previously it is equally important now, so that the honorable member, by making it appear that private members business is of no consequence, has practically condemned his own proposal. I agree with the remarks which have been made regarding the wisdom of abolishing grievance day, because I hold that any important matter can and should be ventilated upon a motion for adjournment.","N/A","STANDING ORDER 241 :  GRIEVANCE DAY","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I will read the condition, so that honorable members may see how closely it has been followed in article 36 of the proposed contract -The Admiralty may at any time during the continuance of the contract, if they shall consider it necessary for the public interest, purchase any of the mail ships at a valuation, or charter the same exclusively for His Majestys service, at a rate of hire to be agreed with the contractors or, failing agreement, to be settled by arbitration, and the contractors shall not sell any mail ship to any body or person other than the Admiralty without first giving the Admiralty a reasonable opportunity of purchasing the same.The alterations which we have made are these.

He would make it appear that the object is, in both cases, the same. If this is so, it would surely be within the ability of the draftsman to declare that the mail steamers are to be purchased only for belligerent purposes. That could have been provided for without using the name of any Minister. In my opinion, the alteration has been made deliberately, with a view to giving the Commonwealth power to purchase the mail steamers for general commercial purposes, as well as for defence.
