8,0,0,0,1,1,"OBrien, Llew, MP",265991,"Wide Bay","LNP","N/A",4673," I previously informed the House of recent enhancements made to the e-petitioning system. These enhancements have simplified online petitioning and made sharing petitions through social media more intuitive. We have now seen the benefits of these enhancements as we have watched a petition titled Declare a Climate Emergency reach the highest number of signatures for an e-petition, with over 400,000 signatures. I thank all principled petitioners and all Australians who signed petitions to the House. It is encouraging that so many people are having their say to the parliament. I also thank staff of the Department of Parliamentary Services, who responded quickly to some technical issues that arose during the signing period of this petition.This petition has increased public awareness of petitions more broadly and prompted questions about what happens to a petition after its presented. Misinformation played a fairly significant part during the signing period for this petition, with people incorrectly suggesting on social media that a certain number of signatures would trigger a debate in the House. Our thanks go to the House media team, who worked hard to get the correct information out there. The committee will continue these efforts to better inform the Australian public on the petitioning process.One thing that has become clear through feedback from the public is that Australians expect debate on petitions that reach a certain threshold of signatures. This currently occurs in other parliaments such as the UK and New South Wales. In the 45th Parliament, the Petitions Committee recommended that petitions over 20,000 signatures be considered for debate at a dedicated time in the Federation Chamber. The committee also sought to encourage members to give notice of debate on petitions during private members business time as this procedure is already available to members in the House. The committee will work to educate members about how to get involved in petitions as part of a wider campaign to increase awareness of the petitions in the House. I look forward to further updating the House on the work of the Petitions Committee.","N/A","PETITIONS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.2/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LLEW OBRIEN (Wide Bay) ","(10:04):"
9,0,0,0,1,1,"Wilkie, Andrew, MP","C2T","Clark","IND","N/A",4674," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.I am again introducing the Refugee Protection Bill 2019, which I tabled earlier in the year during the last parliament as well as an earlier version in June 2018, because there is still no sustainable long-term plan for refugee protection from either the coalition or the Labor Party.Confining people for an indefinite period of time, whether it be on Christmas Island, in Nauru or on Manus, was never a lawful, ethical or affordable policy. Its grossly inhuman, breaches international human rights and refugee law, shirks Australias global and regional responsibilities and is outrageously expensive.Remember, under Australias current policy we have confined people indefinitely for years, including many children from time to time. These are mostly people who have committed no crime, people who are vulnerable and traumatised, people who have been separated from their families for years and years, and people who came to our country seeking protection under international law.The physical and mental suffering of these people cannot be understated. Indeed, under the medevac legislation, where people can only be transferred for urgent medical treatment to save their lives, over 130 applications have already been approved, with many more applications pending. Thats a lot of gravely-ill people, and many of them sick because of the way they have been treated in Australias offshore detention. Twelve people have died. In this context, it simply beggars belief that the government is ignoring the advice of Australian medical professionals and wants to repeal medevac.It is deeply shocking how brazenly the government, and the opposition, ignore the international laws and standards that Australia helped create. How dare the parliament ignore the fact that successive Australian governments signed up to the refugee convention, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. No wonder were singled out and criticised by the United Nations and other organisations—proof positive that weve lost the moral authority we once enjoyed.And the cost of all this? Between 2013 and 2016, Australias network of offshore detention gulags cost the taxpayer $9.6 billion. According to figures published just year, the annual cost of offshore detention continues to be a staggering $573,000 per person—reaching approximately $340 million each year.We can, and must, do better. To that end Ive recently written to the Prime Minister asking him to take up New Zealands offer to resettle refugees from Nauru and Manus Island. Surely these people have been suffering too long. Instead of treating them as political footballs, we need to relocate them immediately as a way through this impasse. And then we need bipartisan support to implement the Refugee Protection Bill, which is before the House today, because this bill would finally provide a sustainable, humane and equitable response to the protection and processing of asylum seekers and refugees in the Asia-Pacific region.In essence, this bill is the enabling legislation for Australia to commence the process of seeking to establish the Asia-Pacific asylum seeker solution, or APASS. This would be a genuine regional solution, developed in accordance with international human rights law and UNHCR guidelines, based on a regional framework for the registration, processing and settlement of asylum seekers and refugees. Importantly, it would build on existing forums, such as the Bali Process, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Asian Dialogue of Forced Migrations. In outline, the bill would facilitate the establishment of a network of centres located in and run by Asia-Pacific countries, where asylum seekers could go to be registered, have their immediate humanitarian needs met and lodge a preference for country of resettlement. If the asylum seeker selects Australia and its within the specified quota, their claim would be assessed in Australia with appropriate oversight, limited time frames and judicial review. The bill does not allow mandatory detention.Its important that Australia is seen to take the initiative here because Australias current deterrence based policies have placed so much pressure on neighbouring countries. This is why Australia must act first to amend its own domestic laws to fit with APASS in order to gain trust within the region. This was one of the reasons I was deeply disappointed by Labors response to constituents regarding previous versions of this bill, where Labor claimed it was, Seeking to dictate to our regional neighbours how to manage asylum seeker populations and Commits regional nations to actions without their consent or engagement. What a load of rubbish! If Labor had bothered to read the bill, theyd see that a fundamental principle of APASS is cooperation and respect for the sovereignty of each member country as well as being alert to the difficulties and priorities of refugee protection for each country involved. No wonder the community is confused about Labors asylum seeker policy when Labor criticises the governments policy despite helping create it and promising to maintain it and then turns around and criticises the viable APASS alternative.In closing, Id simply add that this bill incorporates into domestic law multiple international instruments to which Australia is already a signatory. These instruments as well as the principle of family unity and the principle of the best interest of the child are paramount to the development of the APASS framework. Crucially, this bill abolishes unlawful mandatory detention of asylum seekers and refugees. It removes the abhorrent and torturous conditions that asylum seekers and refugees currently experience under Australian law in both onshore and offshore detention. It provides an alternative to detention, allowing asylum seekers to live in the community, and clearly states that any detention must be, in Australia, lawful, necessary and proportionate and for the shortest time possible. And any immigration detention is subject to ongoing judicial review and will be independently monitored on a regular basis.Finally, Id remind everyone in this space that we need to stop talking about asylum seekers and refugees as a threat to national security and start recognising that Australia has a legal and moral obligation to give protection to asylum seekers, to quickly hear their claims and to provide permanent refuge if those claims are correct. I commend this bill to the House. And, in my remaining time, I invite the member for Indi to make a short contribution.

11,0,0,0,1,1,"Haines, Helen, MP",282335,"Indi","IND","N/A",4676," I rise to second the Refugee Protection Bill proposed by the member for Clark, and I do so knowing that so many people of my electorate of Indi and so many people of Australia stand beside me. I believe this because this is the issue on which I receive the most correspondence and personal calls for action from the people in my electorate, and the people are calling for a better response than what our leaders have given us.The Rural Australians for Refugees Group, that is so active in my community, has called on me to work with this parliament to do better, and I am committed to doing just that. For too long in this country we have been sold the idea by our successive governments that to be kind we must be cruel, that if we want to avoid people drowning at sea we must detain those who dont. Weve been told that if we want to end people smuggling then we must keep people who arrive by boat in indefinite detention. But we know, as evidenced by the large number of people arriving by plane, people are still coming and will continue to come. Offshore indefinite detention is a cruel stopgap that should have been dismantled long ago and replaced with a system that actually creates a fair, orderly process that gets people safely and quickly settled into our communities.People I meet are devastated by what weve become. They want better than this. They want better than this because so many of us see ourselves in these people—convicts forced to board boats to Sydney, Jewish people leaving Europe as fascism dawned, the Vietnamese evacuating Saigon, the South Sudanese fleeing the war with their northern neighbours. Australians want a better solution, because when we see people in these camps we see ourselves. And we know that, much as they deserve better, we deserve better.Australians want a nation that has control of its sea borders but does not leave desperate people to languish indefinitely in prisons. The Asia-Pacific asylum seeker solution does both of these things at once by creating a network of centres across the region. People no longer have an incentive to risk their lives on boats. By enabling people to apply at these centres we have a single, virtual queue where we are completely in control over who is granted asylum to this country.As an Independent, I see my role as advocating for sensible compromise policies that reflect what Australians actually want their politicians to do. This is an elegant law that meets the objectives of the government without debasing the fairness and egalitarianism that mark us out as Australians. I commend the bill to the House.Debate adjourned.","Refugee Protection Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr HAINES (Indi) ","(10:13):"
12,0,0,0,1,1,"Bandt, Adam, MP","M3C","Melbourne","AG","N/A",4677," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.In the last 12 months we have had hundreds of thousands of young people in Australia and around the world take to the streets to demand action from their governments to fight the climate crisis. Mostly teenagers, they recognise that we are in a climate emergency. This rising-up by the worlds young is almost unprecedented in human history, which is not surprising because the climate crisis we all face is unprecedented in human history and the youth of today know it. They also know that its on their shoulders that the terrible burden of the climate crisis will rest.In the words of Swedish student and leader of the youth revolt Greta Thunberg:The year 2078 I will celebrate my 75th birthday. If I have children maybe they will spend that day with me. Maybe they will ask me about you. Maybe they will ask why you didnt do anything while there still was time to act. You say you love your children above all else and yet youre stealing their future in front of their very eyes.Todays young people are also some of the most educated and knowledgeable young people in human history. High-school retention rates around the world have never been higher, and our youth have access to the internet storehouse of information and the means of instant social communication in the palms of their hands. They know what is happening to the world, and they know who is responsible. They are, by definition, model active citizens. Yet most of the worlds young people, including Australian teenagers, are denied the right to vote and to determine their countrys, and therefore the worlds, future, and that is why they have taken to the streets.The Greens believe that this reality of the climate crisis is one of the most profound reasons why our longstanding policy of enfranchising young people should finally, once and for all, be implemented. Thats why today Im proud to introduce to the House this bill to give 16- and 17-year-olds the right to vote. Before I outline the details of the bill and the specific changes to the law it makes, I want to pay tribute to my colleague Senator Jordon Steele-John for developing this bill. Senator Steele-John first introduced this bill to the Senate last year. I want to commend him and take note of the strong campaign that he is running not only to give young people the right to vote but also to secure their rights more broadly. The average age of politicians in this place is around 50, so is it any wonder that young people feel disenfranchised by parliamentary politics? We need more leaders like Senator Steele-John in this parliament. He outlined very clearly the need for this bill when introducing it to the Senate last year:There are almost 600,000 of us who are, by and large, deemed to be adults by our society and yet cannot participate in the decisions being made about their future. Sixteen- and 17-year-olds can work full time, pay tax, contribute to superannuation, drive a car and own a car and therefore pay stamp duty to contribute to maintenance of our roads and public transport infrastructure. They can legally have sex and make medical decisions about their bodies. They can join our political parties, all except, of course, the absent Ms Hansons party. In many cases, they can be treated as an adult by our criminal justice system. In short, they cannot vote although they are treated in many ways by our society as adults.… … …My generation will have to live with the consequences of the decisions made in this place for the longest time. The fact that I am the youngest person in this place by close to a decade, and that I am the only person under the age of 30, speaks volumes about the lack of representation of Australias young people in our political system. It is time we recognised 16- and 17-year-olds and their contribution. It is time we recognised they should have the right to a vote and that they make an enormous contribution to our society.The mechanism to give 16- and 17-year-olds the vote is relatively straightforward. The bill includes amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984. The changes to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 are intended to lower the minimum age of a voter in Australian federal elections and referenda from 18 years of age to 16 years of age while keeping the minimum age of compulsory voting and eligibility to stand as a federal parliamentarian at 18 years of age. This change would allow 14- and 15-year-olds to be added to the electoral roll in preparation for their eligibility to vote at 16 years of age. The changes to the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 are intended to ensure that the Electoral Commissioner includes 16- and 17-year-olds in the certified list of voters and that 16- and 17-year-olds will not be given a penalty notice if they dont vote.In other words, by lowering the voting age to 16 but leaving the compulsory age for voting at 18, were creating a grace period for young people, allowing them to familiarise themselves with the electoral process, giving them the right to vote if they so choose but without the fear of being penalised if they dont. It will facilitate greater civics education and allow teachers to bring the democratic process itself—not partisan politics—into classrooms in a tangible way. It will foster a culture of civic participation amongst young people, leaving them in good stead for the rest of their lives, as we know that voting is in fact a habit, and we want them to form this habit early so that it stays with them.There are some positive international experiences of lowering the voting age. In Scotland, for example, during the independence referendum in 2014 a decision was made to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote and to participate for the first time. Almost 80 per cent of that age group turned out. That cohort now continues to turn out at a much higher rate than their predecessors who werent given an earlier opportunity. In Austria the 16- and 17-year-old demographic has a higher level of participation than the 18-to-25-year-old demographic, proving that this kind of reform works. In Austria, 16- and 17-year-olds are now able to vote in most elections. These international experiences should give us the confidence to make this reform here.Finally, this bill seeks to update our archaic electoral practices that say, You are not allowed to participate on election day if you have not updated your details on the electoral roll. It is 2019, and we should be flexible enough in our system to allow people to do so at a polling place on polling day. This bill provides that Australians who are eligible to vote but who are not yet on the electoral roll or are not enrolled at their correct address can enrol to vote or update their address at a polling centre on election day or at an early voting centre and will be deemed to be enrolled at that address and eligible to cast a provisional vote at that time.We regularly hear in the commentary the bemoaning of young peoples lack of engagement in society or the deploring of them for always being on their mobile phones, but when Australias students lead the countrys participation in the global climate strike, we heard the same politicians and adults complaining about their skipping school and getting involved in politics.Some politicians and shock jocks like to suggest that young people are somehow being manipulated or are not thinking for themselves. In the same vein, the objections raised against young people having a vote suggest that young people are not smart or independent enough to vote, that they are not ready enough to make such big decisions. These are the same objections that were made 200 years ago against working men having a vote or a century ago against women having a vote or, more recently, against Aboriginal Australians having a vote—arguments that we no longer accept. The Australian Greens reject such discrimination. We believe that young people, like all Australians, are capable of making decisions for themselves. We dont fear more democratic participation; in fact, we welcome it. We are confident that if young people have the vote they will use it wisely. Its time to lower the voting age to 16 in Australia and show our young people that we, here in this place, hear them, that we care about their opinions and that we are working for their future. I commend the bill to the House.

16,0,0,0,1,1,"Butler, Mark, MP","HWK","Hindmarsh","ALP","N/A",4679," I move:That this House:(1) notes that:(a) climate change is a significant threat to our economy, natural environment, farming communities and national security;(b) Australia’s annual emissions have been rising in recent years;(c) as a global problem, the solution to climate change requires concerted international cooperation to limit the production of greenhouse gases;(d) as the only global agreement designed to address climate change, the Paris Accords must play a central role in addressing climate change;(e)the Paris Accords require signatory countries to deliver actions consistent with keeping the global temperature rise this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius;(f) based on the latest scientific advice, the world is currently on track for warming of above 3 degrees, and efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions need to be strengthened to avoid catastrophic climate change impacts; and(g) as a result of the threat posed by climate change, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Portugal, Argentina and the Republic of Ireland have declared a climate emergency; and(2) therefore, affirms that:(a) Australia remains committed to delivering on its obligations under the Paris Accords;(b) failing to meet the goals of the Paris Accords would have unprecedented and devastating environmental, economic, societal and health impacts for Australia; and(c) the threat posed by climate change on the future prosperity and security of Australia and the globe constitutes a climate change emergency.This motion responds to the calls from more than 370,000 Australians who have participated in the largest ever e-petition to this parliament, calling for this parliament to recognise climate change as an emergency. It also follows the example of the UK, Canadian, Irish and other parliaments, not to mention literally dozens and dozens of councils here in Australia and across the world, who have made a similar declaration. Since October last year, in just the past 12 months, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, the worlds leading climate scientists, have issued three reports, each more urgent than the last. In essence, those reports tell us that the window is closing on our generations ability to discharge our responsibilities set out in the Paris climate agreement—namely, to ensure that global warming is kept well below two degrees above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees. Those reports, particularly the report issued 12 months ago by the worlds leading climate scientists, tell us that substantial cuts in emissions are going to be necessary over the course of the 2020s if we are to have any reasonable hope of keeping to those important thresholds.Earlier this month, here in Australia, the Australian Medical Association, the AMA, followed the lead of its British and American counterparts in also declaring that climate change is a health emergency, because weve received advice after advice over many years of the health impacts were already seeing through climate change but will only get worse over time if we dont meet those Paris commitments. Earlier this year, the World Economic Forum, which surveys the worlds leading global business leaders, found that, of the 10 leading global risks identified by those leaders, the top three were extreme weather events, a failure to mitigate climate change, and natural disasters, reflecting advice from the Reserve Bank earlier this month about the risks to the global financial system that are posed by climate change and the legal responsibilities that company directors are now recognised as having, as identified by APRA, ASIC and economic regulators across the world.The world is currently on track to exceed three degrees of global warming, which would be utterly catastrophic for the planet and for humanity. There is a dangerous level of complacency that has crept into the public debate, and particularly the parliamentary debate on climate change here in Australia. Were told by the Prime Minister and leading media figures that were going to meet our Paris commitments in a canter and everything is going fine. Well, Australias Paris targets are consistent with more than three degrees of global warming and we frankly are just not on track to meet those. Our Kyoto commitment is to cut, by next year, our carbon emissions by five per cent on 2000 levels, but only in the last several weeks the government has released projections showing that in 2020 carbon emissions will actually be higher than they were in 2000, not five per cent below. Carbon emissions are projected by the governments own department to continue rising all the way to 2030. So, at best, well be seven per cent below 2005 levels by that year, not the 26 to 28 per cent below that the government signed up to in the Paris agreement.All of this means that we are failing our children, our grandchildren and generations beyond that, because it is within the power of this generation to ensure that global warming is kept well below two degrees and that we pursue efforts around 1.5, recognising that two degrees is not a safe threshold. According to the worlds leading climate scientists, even two degrees of global warming will mean that more than 99 per cent of the worlds coral reefs are lost. According to the World Bank, it will mean that by the middle of the century global cereal production will have reduced by 20 per cent and by as much as 50 per cent in the continent of Africa. This complacency also means that Australia is missing out on very serious investment and job opportunities. For example, according to Bloomberg, renewable energy investment has been slashed by 50 per cent already in just the first six months of this year. This motion is a chance for the parliament to change course. Its not a substantive motion in policy terms but it is an attempt to have the parliament recognise the gravity of this challenge.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BUTLER (Hindmarsh) ","(10:26):"

It is clear that with this motion Labor is simply jumping on sensationalist, populist sentiment. They prefer to put forward this grand symbolic gesture rather than actually committing to policies that will reduce carbon emissions. In contrast, our government has a plan, one that we took to the Australian people. Part of this plan is to effectively act on climate change and meet our emissions reduction target for 2020, as agreed in Kyoto. We also have a plan to meet our emissions reduction target for 2030, as detailed in the Paris accord global agreement. We can do this in a balanced and responsible way. We can work with our global partners to deliver a healthy environment for future generations, whilst keeping our economy strong. This is why we have invested $3.5 billion into our Climate Solutions Package, which will deliver the 328 million tonnes of abatement needed to reach our Paris targets. The Climate Solutions Fund is a great program, one that brings to $4.55 billion our support for businesses, landholders, farmers and Indigenous Australians, through practical climate solutions. The Climate Solutions Fund gives Australians the incentive to adopt smarter practices and technologies to reduce greenhouse gases and, at the same time, earn additional revenue.The Tambua Regeneration Project is a great example of what is being delivered through the fund. Tambua station is a farm located near Cobar in New South Wales. The Evans family owns the property and recently celebrated 100 years and five generations on the land. Over the years, the family has overcome a number of challenges that often occur with farming, including drought and bushfires. The Evans family, supported by an Emissions Reduction Fund contract over 10 years, is establishing permanent native forests on the property. Theyve been growing these forests from seed on land that was previously cleared and on which regrowth has been suppressed for 10 years. These new forests will effectively become carbon sinks, helping to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This is a great example of responsible stewardship. This is one example of thousands thats being implemented without great fanfare and sensationalism.There are also projects being delivered in my electorate of Cowper. Through the Emissions Reductions Fund, we have invested $1 million to help Biomass Solutions in Coffs Harbour produce compost from the organic waste collected in three neighbouring local government areas. We will be investing a further $2 million in this project in the near future. The fund also has enabled the New South Wales office of environment, energy and science to plant $800,000 worth of new native trees on land that had previously been cleared for agriculture.We are making the investment necessary to bring about change. In fact, in 2018, Australia led the world in clean energy investment, with more than double the per capita investment of other leading nations like France and the United Kingdom. We are, therefore, doing more per capita than any of these countries who saw fit to declare a climate emergency, highlighting the redundant nature of this motion by Labor.Rather than being reactive, we have announced some proactive steps to mitigate the current climate change and drought in Australia. Drought is debilitating for regional communities like those in my electorate of Cowper. But, rather than offer redundant, symbolic gestures, like this motion, we have acted decisively to invest $3.5 billion in water infrastructure to fast-track the construction of new dams, weirs and pipelines. This will guarantee new and affordable water for regional Australia into the future and unlock the economic potential for new and expanded agricultural production. We have also been proactive by investing in renewable energy projects like Snowy 2.0 and the Battery of the Nation in Tasmania. We are getting on with the job of delivering our plan to make Australia stronger.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CONAGHAN (Cowper) ","(10:31):"
21,0,0,0,1,1,"Conroy, Pat, MP",249127,"Shortland","ALP","N/A",4682," I note that the last speaker, who rejected the science, couldnt even go the full five minutes on this very important topic, which yet again demonstrates the lack of seriousness the government has on climate change. I want to start with a few facts—something foreign to those opposite. The IPCC has already found that the world has warmed by one degree Celsius, compared to preindustrial times. Since 1998, weve had five mass bleachings of the Great Barrier Reef, and the years 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 were the warmest years on record. In fact, we have the highest greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere in 800,000 years.Climate change is occurring, and it poses probably the greatest security threat to the planet and certainly to Australia. That was set out in a seminal speech by the Chief of the Defence Force a couple of months ago, where he highlighted the fact that natural disasters are increasing in number, severity and range. For example, Cook Islands, once considered outside the main cyclone belt, experienced five cyclones in one month. Diseases such as malaria and dengue fever are on the rise in PNG. We are seeing an increase in sea temperatures and winds pushing tuna stocks westward, stocks which are critical to the economic livelihood of many Pacific nations. The greatest example was around the Syrian civil war, where the great drought between 2006 and 2011—which was caused by climate change, according to scientists—pushed 1.5 million Syrians into cities, ramping up pressure on an already precarious political system. In the next 10 years, scientists think that well see another half a degree of global warming, which will lead to food scarcity, displaced populations, disease spreading, a doubling of species extinctions and sea levels half a metre higher. In fact, the CDF highlighted the fact that 81 million people will be negatively affected by changes to crop yields, several hundred million people will be driven into poverty and a quarter of a billion people will not have access to adequate drinking water. All this is obviously a catastrophe for the planet and will lead to an increase in conflict. This is especially relevant in Australia, given that we live in the most disaster-prone region in the world. The waters of the central Pacific are currently rising four times faster than the global average and this is obviously causing more flooding, erosion, inundation of living areas and contamination of aquifers and arable land. Again, most of these statistics are not drawn from some environmental group; these stats are drawn from a speech by the Chief of the Defence Force—a Chief of the Defence Force held in the highest esteem by both sides of politics.I have chosen to concentrate on this because anyone who professes to care about our national security should care about fighting climate change and should care about making sure Australia makes an appropriate contribution to the global fight on climate change. I would submit that, for all their professed interest in national security, those on the other side are betraying our national security, as well as betraying future generations, by their attitude to climate change evident in an inadequate target, which they wont even meet.But its not just about national security; its also about economic opportunities. For example, the University of New South Waless technology around solar PV cells is resident within 60 per cent of PV cells around the world. Yet we didnt get a single job out of that innovation because John Howard and his government were so anti renewable energy.There is a massive opportunity here. We can be an energy exporting superpower through direct export of electricity to South Asia and South-East Asia and through the export of hydrogen to places like Japan and Korea. We have the highest solar radiation of any continent in the world and weve got great wind and wave resources. So, when the world transitions to renewable energy, which is inevitably occurring, we can again be the land of energy-intensive manufacturing. Thats a great opportunity.We also have a great opportunity around the key inputs to renewable energy. Were the second-largest producer of rare earths. We have the greatest reserves of iron and titanium. Weve got the second greatest reserves of copper and lithium and the third greatest reserves of silver. These are great opportunities for our mining sector. In fact, it takes 200 tonnes of coking coal to make one wind turbine. So there are even good opportunities for our coking coal sector around the transition to renewable energy.So, whether it is from a national security point of view or from an economic opportunity point of view, we need to declare a climate emergency and we need to take urgent action, unlike those opposite.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CONROY (Shortland) ","(10:36):"
22,0,0,0,1,1,"Pitt, Keith, MP",148150,"Hinkler","LNP","N/A",4683," In speaking on this motion, Im going to start with some tongue-in-cheek comments. This issue is so important to those opposite. Let us count how many there are here. Well, there were five but now there are four—one, two, three, four. I think there is one coming back. I am not sure whether the member is returning. We could get to five people on the other side. It is so important to those opposite that they declare a climate emergency that they havent even filled the opposite side of the chamber!I note that Matt Killoran is up in the press gallery, and I also note his story on the Courier-Mail site today, talking about the former member for Herbert, Cathy OToole—who has managed to find her spine on this issue—and former Labor Party member and Mayor of Rockhampton, Margaret Strelow, who have come out and said that the Labor Party has got it wrong. Let me count the ways! Once again, I take this motion with a grain of salt, to be honest. If those opposite were serious, they would all be here—every single one of them would be in the chamber. So this is, at worst, a stunt and, at best, a way to fill some space in this mornings program.If those opposite were serious about this, if it is a climate emergency, then everything should be on the table—everything—and we shouldnt just be ruling things in and out because we like them or we dont like them. That means that you should consider nuclear energy. That means that you should consider HELE coal. If a HELE coal power station can reduce emissions by 40 per cent, why wouldnt you use it? Why wouldnt we go to another country and take their biggest emitting industries and move them to Australia, cut them in half, improve the worlds outcome and create more jobs? But it seems thats off the table too.Ive got to say that I have missed one opposition member. There is an extra opposition member over here who I didnt count previously. There are six here in the chamber. So my apologies to the Labor Party; there are six here for this debate. So, if everything is on the table for the climate emergency, thats the end of snowmakers. There will be no more of those; they run on diesel. Well certainly have to stop using aircraft. So we will have to move parliamentary sittings and come here for a longer period of time, as there will be no more aircraft. There will also be no more cars.But, in all seriousness, if we are to look at this issue properly, we need to consider what our contribution is. That is what we on this side of the House, the government, have done. We have put forward a proportional response to our contribution. We have put up a balanced approach to what we are doing in terms of the environment. When we look at what happened in the last election, we know the outcome: the people agreed with us. The people agreed with us, because they were terrified of what the opposite side would do. Those opposite had a completely uncosted policy. This was identified by Jonathan Lee at a press conference, when the then Leader of the Opposition simply couldnt answer the question: How much will your policy cost, Mr Shorten? If you cannot put forward a costed policy to the Australian people they will not support you. It is that straightforward.You do not represent working people anymore. That is the reality of where we are at. If we look at what happened in Queensland, rusted-on Labor voters walked away from the opposition in droves. They know that it happened. I know that it happened. We know the outcome. We know what happened in terms of the election. But, to be honest, I think its a great shame—I really do—because the Labor Party used to be the party of working people. They are now the party of slogans. Where do you go from the climate emergency? Does it become a climate crisis? Do we wind it back and say, Its not quite as bad as we thought it was, so well wind it back a little bit more? Once again we find ourselves here talking about another stunt around the climate emergency. As I said during this speech previously, I havent seen a single member come in. I dont see the Labor Party tearing in to support their colleagues on the PMB. I dont see any of those things.Once again, if you are out there representing working people, stop telling them youll take away their jobs, because that is exactly what they are concerned about. They are concerned about losing the roles that they have now. Their priority is to pay their bills, be employed, ensure they can send their kids to school and work their way through what they do in life. On this side of the parliament, we are representing them. We are here in their interests, not those on the other side. We hear a lot of noise and a lot of sloganeering and we see lots of people with stunts and who are holding up traffic and, once again, Id say to those in Extinction Rebellion: there will be no glue for you if there is a climate emergency; we simply cant produce any. Every single time we bring forward stunts like this, you depreciate the value of your position. If you really want to support climate change work and what we are doing around the environment, put forward a practical approach. Tell us what it is.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PITT (Hinkler) ","(10:41):"
23,0,0,0,1,1,"Kearney, Ged, MP","LTU","Cooper","ALP","N/A",4685," I am proud to be standing here today speaking on this motion put by my colleague the member for Hindmarsh to declare a climate emergency. It is a mark of Labors commitment to future generations. As he said, we owe it to our kids and our grandkids to stand up for their future and to fight for real action on climate change. As one of my staunch Cooper activists, Jane Morton, said, Declaring the emergency is not just a matter of token words; it is the start of a whole new frame of mind. From young kids in Northcote to grandmas in Reservoir to doctors, nurses, tradies and scientists, our community knows our earth is experiencing a climate emergency, and they want something done about it now. Unfortunately, while the rest of the world has accepted that global warming is perfectly clear, it is not a priority for all of us in this place. Those who sit opposite are collectively burying their heads in the sand, with no desire or political courage to start to repair the damage that global warming is inflicting on our planet.The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report calls for drastic action to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees of warming this century. The report starkly and graphically outlines the world we face, with the prospect of exceeding a 1.5 degrees Celsius rise by 2040—and that is not too far away. At 1.5 degrees, we lose between 70 and 90 per cent of the worlds warm coral reefs on top of what weve lost to date. There will be more extreme hot weather, more extreme droughts. At 1.5 degrees, we will see the consequences of climate related risks to our health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, national security and economic growth. This change will disproportionately affect those living in developing countries and those in the Pacific, our neighbours.The IPCC is not some radical body. Their most recent report was written by 91 climate experts and cites 6,000 peer-reviewed papers. They are often considered to be too conservative in their warnings. As the member for Hindmarsh said, none of us should fall for the idea that is often spouted by commentators and, unfortunately, some on the other side of the House that what Australia does doesnt matter in this debate. Yes, we are a small nation. We dont even rate in the top 50 of the worlds nations in population, but we rate in the top 15 in the total amount of greenhouse gases emitted. We are a wealthy nation that has, along with other members of the OECD, grown wealthy on the back of long-term industrialisation. We are the highest per capita producer of greenhouse gases. If Australia wont act to take responsible, strong action on climate change, which nation on the face of the planet should be expected to act?If this government had a plan, a real plan, Australia could be leading the way to mitigate this climate emergency. With certainty instead of chaos, we could be encouraging clean energy production, sustainable industries and investment in jobs and the growing renewable economy. This has been Labors mantra for a long time. We are committed to tackling climate change and transitioning our economy, and to still support all communities by providing decent, secure work. I stand with the millions of Australians who are committed to the cause of hope which is made possible by climate action. Hope for a just world, a fair world, a sustainable planet and the reshaping of our economy to meet its challenges.I want to finish by giving a big shout-out to the many activists in Cooper who have been pushing for a climate emergency declaration for so long: all the Cooper students and protesters who marched at the climate rallies; the kids who sign and send me petitions and beautiful pictures every day; DCAN, Darebin Climate Action Now, for asking the member for Hindmarsh the hard questions at the many climate forums weve had; and CAHA, Darebin City Council, Newlands Parents for Climate Action, the Darebin ACF, Cooper GetUp!, Newlands Friends of the Forest, Doctors for the Environment, beyond zero emissions; and so many hundreds of individuals who have written, called and stopped me in the street to talk about this important issue. We are standing here today because of your hard work. This is your achievement. My commitment to all of you is to keep up the fight for climate action. We stand here to deliver the strongest possible targets for a real response to tackling the climate emergency. These are not just words; these are not token words. It is about changing the trajectory of this planet and keeping it sustainable to have a sustainable future.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms KEARNEY (Cooper) ","(10:46):"
24,0,0,0,1,1,"Wilson, Tim, MP","IMW","Goldstein","LP","N/A",4686," It is extremely important to debate this motion in this chamber, because it reflects a fundamental discussion the Australian community is having about the future of our natural environment, our care and concern for it, and how this government is taking sensible, proportionate, practical measures to reduce Australias greenhouse gas emissions with the sanction and support of the Australian people, consistent with the proposition that we took to the election.Ultimately, because were talking about a transition of the economy—a transition that will occur—to reduce our CO2 footprint and equivalent greenhouse gases, and the fact that there are trade-offs, it is fundamentally a discussion about how were going to take Australians forward and not leave people behind. More critically, it is a discussion about trust—trust that governments will honour the positions they take to the public at election. The objective of this motion is to break that trust by declaring something, and if its serious—and Labor and other members present who support this motion are serious—re-orientate the entirety of the Australian economy and society towards a singular purpose. We do this from time to time. We do it in times of war. We do it when the threat posed is so immediate and extreme that every single other concern goes out the window. If Labor are not honestly putting forward that proposition and backing it up with policy, then its a dishonest motion. So, no matter which way you deal with it, its an issue around trust.If we support this motion, we are turning on the Australian people and showing contempt for them and their concerns, for their livelihood, their jobs and their interests. We face a situation where the Australian Labor Party are showing contempt for the voters of Australia—and they do so because, at every point, the opposition has sought to do one thing on the issue of climate change and reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, which is to trade on the trust from the Australian people and make ridiculous allegations about what is and isnt being done. Of course, we know full well that trust is not an issue that the opposition cares much for. After all, we do remember where the there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead ended up, and theyre continuing to do that in the way they approach this issue, because weve seen that their rhetoric does not match their action. Only last week, the International Monetary Fund released a report saying that even if we were to go down the path that the Labor Party or the Greens want us to, you would need a carbon tax in excess of US$75, more than A$111. Let them get up here now and argue that thats what they want and that thats what they will support in this chamber right now. Of course, we know they wont, because this is a dishonest motion. We know they wont, because it doesnt enjoy the support of the Australian people. We know they wont, because its actually not sustainable policy—by the way, that was the start, not the end. We know it wont actually deliver the sustainable transition for the Australian economy that this nation needs.Instead, we, the government, took clear policy proposals to the last election. Twice we have gone to an election saying we will support and honour our targets under the Paris agreement to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions between 26 and 28 per cent, and we are doing so. We have massive investment in major new base load energy generation in this country, whether its the extension of the Snowy Hydro project or connecting more of the surplus wasted energy provided over to the Australian mainland. To take lectures from the Greens—lets not forget who the Greens are: a political party founded on opposing investment in renewable energy in Tasmania. We are doing everything we can with the trust of the Australian people. What the Labor Party and the Greens want us to do is break that trust.

25,0,0,0,1,1,"Burns, Josh, MP",278522,"Macnamara","ALP","N/A",4687," We have heard a lot from those opposite this morning, but what we havent heard is one single thing, one single idea, about how Australia is going to reduce our emissions. Not one. The member for Goldstein walks out right now, and he needs to be very, very careful in this debate because Goldstein is the seat that borders Macnamara. I know those people in Goldstein care about the future of our planet. They care about how our emissions are going up. They will hold the member for Goldstein responsible along with this government which doesnt have a plan to reduce our emissions.Lets start in this really important motion put forward by the member for Hindmarsh—and I commend the previous speakers on this side of the House, who have all made thoughtful contributions to this debate—with some facts on the table. Climate change is a man-made problem and it will continue to have devastating consequences for Australia and our Pacific neighbours. We need to reduce our carbon emissions as part of a concerted global effort to keep our temperature rises well below two degrees and towards 1.5 degrees, the pre-industrial levels. Another fact we have today is that our emissions are going up. They are going up, as they have done every year since 2014. This is part of the governments own figures, which confirm it every time they are released.The crazy thing about this debate is that climate change is a problem, but it also presents real opportunities. I was a young staffer here and I remember vividly the day that Joe Hockey goaded the car industry to leave this country. It was a devastating day, especially for the people in my electorate who, for years and years, worked in the factories in Fishermans Bend. It was a devastating day for the people of Geelong in the Ford factory. Yet they scoffed when we brought an electric vehicle policy to the last election. When they goaded the car industry to leave this country, they didnt just end the jobs of manufacturing workers; they ended the jobs of high-skilled engineers, of scientists, of researchers, of developers and of all the subsidiary businesses. Yet they scoff at a policy that could potentially bring manufacturing back to our electorates.They are more and more isolated. Across the states, we have seen the state governments move towards net zero emissions by the middle of the century, as well as bring in complementary policies. In the great state of Victoria, where we have seen a Labor government now re-elected—I had the privilege of working and playing a small part in it—policies include net zero emissions by 2050 and a renewable energy target. In that same Ford factory where those opposite goaded companies to leave our shores, they are now producing wind turbines. Manufacturing jobs are returning to our cities and to our towns on the back of renewable energy jobs. Its exciting, yet the only people who have no plan, who dont accept the science, who dont want to take action, are those opposite. I know that there are a sprinkling of people over there who like to make platitudes, but they need to be very careful because platitudes simply arent going to cut it. They need a plan to reduce our carbon emissions. The last person to have an energy policy was Malcolm Turnbull, and we all know where that went.To those opposite: I know the Prime Minister has a genuine affection for those in the Pacific region—I know he does; he talks about it often—but you cannot look our Pacific island friends in the eye when they come to us pleading with Australia to take climate change seriously, pleading with our government to do something to reduce emissions. Fiji, Samoa, Tuvalu, PNG—climate change is an existential threat to these countries, and the best our Prime Minister can do when hes in New York, when the international climate change conference is on, is skip the conference.Climate change is an opportunity for us to create jobs in this country, to create renewable energy jobs, to create a boom. Theres investment, but we can make it better. Climate change is our responsibility, as responsible global citizens and as friends to our Pacific neighbours, to take seriously. I commend the motion put forward by the member for Hindmarsh. We are in a climate emergency, and we need to take it seriously.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BURNS (Macnamara) ","(10:56):"

It reflects many of the others on that side over the past half hour or so; once again, high on rhetoric but with no solutions. The important thing is its actually this government that is taking this seriously. It is this government that has made it very clear, in the recent election on 18 May, that it is going to honour its international commitments with respect to reducing emissions and dealing with the impacts of a changing climate.It is important that we do take this seriously for any number of reasons, least of all the impact on our economy if we dont take seriously the impacts of the changing climate. This is what the government is actually doing. Were working across the community and across the various levels of government to put in place practical solutions to manage these risks. Were working towards developing and implementing through investments: an investment of some $24 million over the six years from 2014-15 to the National Environmental Science Program and Climate Change Hub; some $255 million over the 10 years from 2015-16 to enhance Australias Antarctic capabilities; another $6.1 million over the three years from 2018-19 to provide the electricity sector with improved climate and extreme weather information; and another $25 million in 2019-20 towards the establishment of the National Centre for Coasts, Environment and Climate at Point Nepean. It is these investments that are the key to ensuring that we manage the impacts of a changing climate.More locally, I have seen the benefits of work that has been done over many years through planting additional trees and revegetating our local communities—improvements in water quality and improvements in the built environment. It is these practical solutions that we believe are going to help achieve the goals that we need to achieve. We all agree in this place that we need to leave the planet and the environment in a better place than when we found it. In addition, we can look at the investments in clean energy across the country not just at a national level but from some of the state governments as well. In 2018, an estimated $13.2 billion was invested in clean energy technologies in Australia, and this builds on the estimated $10 billion invested in 2017.As I go around my electorate, there are a number of businesses—and the number increases by the day—whose focus is on recycling and improving how we use our waste—that we dont just dump it into landfills, that were able to recycle that waste and reuse it. Doing that ensures that we dont deplete our natural resources as much as we otherwise would. It is these practical outcomes that we are seeing every day in electorates right across this country. Recently we announced a $6 million investment with Logan City Council in one of our waste water treatment facilities to treat solid waste by burning it at high temperatures to create biochar. It is a range of those examples that were implementing, as well as meeting our emissions reduction targets, as weve committed to through the Paris Agreement, and they will deliver on our commitments to manage the impacts of a changing climate.Importantly, one of the things that we do need to do is ensure that we have a strong and robust economy so we have the funds to manage these impacts and pay for the new investments and new technologies that are going to be developed over the coming five, 10, 15 or 20 years that will help further mitigate and deal with these issues. But it is these practical outcomes, these practical investments right across our economy, that this government is undertaking because of its strong economic management and foresight to deal with the issues of a changing climate.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VAN MANEN (Forde—Chief Government Whip) ","(11:01):"
27,0,0,0,1,1,"Payne, Alicia, MP",144732,"Canberra","ALP","N/A",4689," In light of the Prime Minister belittling school students for striking for climate action, I thought I would bring the voice of one such student from my electorate to this place. Raechel McKinnon, a year 8 student from Merici College here in Canberra wrote this speech for me last week in Girls Takeover Parliament. If the government wont listen to the Labor Party, I call on them to listen to the next generation, whose future is at stake if we dont take action now. This is the speech Raechel wrote for me:It is with great sorrow and disappointment that I am here again to talk about the impact of climate change and the importance of doing something about it.As I said in my previous speech on climate change, electors in Canberra have vocalised their concerns—on the lack of action—on what the Australian government is doing to prevent our planet from dying.Under the power of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, no difference is being made whatsoever. Australians are living under the power of an all talk, no action government.The government is doing nothing to contribute to change the situation that we are in, despite of the publics needs and wants.On the 20th of September, my Labor colleagues and I joined with 10,000 Canberrans in Glebe Park to strike for Climate as part of the—international—movement inspired by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg.300,000 people gathered around Australia calling for action on climate change.Out of 195 countries, Australia is the 20th richest country in the world and we are within the top 15 countries in terms of carbon emissions. We have the ability to reduce our carbon emissions and fossil fuels—Moreover, we have a responsibility.However, the federal government has chosen not to act.It appears to me that the government is not comprehending how much of an issue climate change is. So let me lay out the facts for you.The Great Barrier Reef is able to be seen from outer space, is visited by 2 million tourists every year and generates—for us—roughly 5-6 billion dollars per year in economic gains.However, if we keep emitting carbon dioxide into the environment, the Great Barrier Reef is expected to die by 2050, and, according to scientists, half of the great barrier reef is already dead.If a climate emergency is not announced, and we do not make a change, the Great Barrier Reef has no hope whatsoever. The Great Barrier Reef will die.This is not just tragic because the Great Barrier Reef is home to over 1,000 different species of living organisms; but we will also lose a lot of tourism in Australia.The Great Barrier Reef is one of the biggest tourist attractions in Australia. If the Great Barrier Reef dies, Australia will lose roughly 1.3 million tourists every year. Nobody wants to visit a dead reef; it would just be a painful reminder of how terribly we have treated this earth.The reef has become vulnerable because of human activity and the pollution that has been emitted to the environment. Oceans absorb up to 25% of the carbon dioxide which citizens across the world produce every year.The Australian government needs to take action on climate change. Climate change is not impacting on an environment that is somehow separate to our every day lives. It is our world that we are destroying, our home.Our Prime Minister needs to step up and recognise the science, for current and future generations.He must not settle for anything less than to declare urgent climate action, because it is with great regret that this has become an emergency.The Australian government doesnt understand that climate change is a silent killer—it is staring them in the face, why wont they open their eyes and look at it?Thank you, Raechel, for this great speech.As her representative here in this place, I support climate action and the declaration of a climate emergency by this parliament. As you see, in spite of what the Prime Minister says, the youth of today are not relaxed and comfortable. They are engaged and informed, and they are anxious for action on climate change because they know our future depends on it. They know what is at stake. The Prime Minister will not make the facts go away by simply dismissing them. Australia must transform the way that we do things in order to stay below a two-degree increase in global temperatures and must make efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. To do this, we must get to zero emissions by 2050. It is incumbent on us in this place to take action now so that future generations might be given a fighting chance. Labor will continue to fight for real action on climate change from this government. I support this declaration today of a climate emergency. I am proud to represent the activists in my electorate, who will also keep up the fight because they understand what is at stake.","Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms PAYNE (Canberra) ","(11:06):"

30,0,0,0,1,1,"Hammond, Celia, MP",80072,"Curtin","LP","N/A",4691," I move:That this House:(1) recognises that after more than twelve years at school, year 12 students will soon complete their final examinations and transition to the next phase of their lives—this may include pursuing higher education, engaging with vocational education and training (VET) or entering the workforce;(2) acknowledges the valuable contribution hard working teachers have made in our communities in educating, nurturing, encouraging and motivating our 2019 school leavers;(3) notes the Governments record investment in education funding including:(a) a record $21.3 billion for state schools, catholic schools and independent schools for the 2020 school year, an increase in funding of $8.5 billion since 2013;(b) a record $8.6 billion for child care and $17.7 billion for the university sector in the 2019-20 budget;(c) $30.2 million in 2019-20 to establish the Local School Community Fund to support priority projects in local schools that benefit students and their communities;(d) $71.6 million to improve outcomes for very remote students by encouraging teachers to teach and stay longer in their schools through remitting the HELP debt; and(e) a commitment to support the VET sector through a $525.3 million Skills Package; and(4) congratulates the Government on its continued commitment and investment in education from early learning through to higher education and VET to ensure our young people have the opportunity to succeed, gain employment and live their best lives.For many year 12 students in our electorates, the school year is now drawing to a close, with final exams either underway or due to begin shortly. These students, the majority of them born in 2001 and 2002, are post-millennial, sometimes known as the iGen or gen Z. For the majority of young people growing up across Australia, they have never known a world without Pixar movies, Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, The Hunger Games, Twilight, the internet, Google, social media or selfies. They have engaged with the old Marvel versus DC debate and the new Minecraft phenomenon and lived the Fortnite phase—the less said about that, the better! Just like Harry, Hermione and Ron in the Harry Potter series and Frodo in The Lord of the Rings, our year 12s across the country are about to leave a stage of their life which, whether theyve enjoyed it or not, has become very familiar to them. They are about to embark on their own adventures. They may not be battling Voldemort or having to return a ring on Middle Earth, but the exam period can be extremely stressful and daunting for them and their loved ones. The endless What are you going to do with the rest of your life? questions can be overwhelming. Its understandable that our year 12s across the country will be feeling adrenaline and a mix of emotions—enthusiasm, excitement, anxiety and some trepidation.To all the school leavers across the country, but particularly the 2,500 or so in my electorate of Curtin, I say the following: these exams are important, but you owe it to yourself, your family and your school to do your best. But also remember, just as Harry Potter thought the Sorting Hat was the be-all and end-all of the world when he first went to Hogwarts, he soon realised that it didnt determine his life for all time. So too are these exams important, but they do not determine who you are, your worth or your dignity. All of you have a special purpose, special gifts and talents. You may not know what your path in life is at this particular moment, and there may be a number of times that you change that path, but always remember that you have a purpose. Learn from the past and prepare for the future, but make sure you live in the present.More broadly, as someone who is passionate about education and with a personal investment in this years final year 12 exams through my eldest son, I note the following: we have an excellent education system in Australia. We have passionate and dedicated teachers, we have excellent facilities and we have a shared understanding across all levels of government, across all political parties, that education is vitally important at an individual and at a societal level both for the here and now and for the future of our country. As excellent as it is and as shared as we may all be in understanding the importance of education, we can always do better. It is the role of government to continue to look at ways of improving the system and improving outcomes. On particular strategies we may disagree in this chamber but, to me, that is a sign that our educational system is working and that our country is healthy and vital. We have the capacity and the knowledge to review, innovate, assess and implement, and we have the freedom to debate and disagree.Our government is demonstrating its commitment to excellence in education through this years budget, a record $21.3 billion investment in funding for state schools, Catholic schools and independent schools for the 2020 school year and a record $17.7 billion investment in the university sector in 2019. A number of new strategies include a $525 million investment to strengthen the VET sector through a skills package and a revamp of the VET sector to ensure our VET sector is accessible, of high quality and responsive to what industry needs. The $30.2 million Local Schools Community Fund to assist schools to undertake small, identified and prioritised projects will be of benefit to the local school community. There are more but I will stop there.By way of finishing, I congratulate our government for backing our students by ensuring we have the best options and resources available to them. I acknowledge and thank our dedicated school leaders and teachers, who support, motivate and guide our students throughout their years at school. My particular thanks go to the teachers in my electorate of Curtin. Finally, to the school leavers in my electorate: I wish you all the best over the coming months. In the words of Dumbledore: it matters not what someone is born but what they grow to be.

34,0,0,0,1,1,"Ryan, Joanne, MP",249224,"Lalor","ALP","N/A",4692," I begin by thanking the member for Curtin for moving this motion in the House today—well, at least the first part of the motion. I completely and utterly support the opportunity to wish year 12 students across the country, across the great state of Victoria and those year 12 students in my electorate, those in the VCAL program who have already finished their final year of school and are out in the world as we speak, planning and seeking their future, and those undergoing the VCE exams over the next few weeks luck. We all know in this place the importance of education. We know on this side of the House the transformative power of education. Im fortunate to have taught for 27 years in state schools in Victoria, and have had Labor governments that understood the importance of kids finishing school, of people going the whole road for 13 years of education in Victoria and the fact that that final year of school can make the difference in someones future.In completing that final year of school, we have changed the state of Victoria. It has meant that we have now surpassed the 80 per cent target set many, many years ago and are close to reaching 90 per cent retention rates in Victoria. I want to say to all of the students going into exam period: I wish you well, I wish you luck. I would say to you the key to examination performance is to stay calm and to remember that, ultimately, were not testing you; were testing the system. I want say to the teachers who have taught year 12s this year: thank you for raising your hands to be the people who do that ultimate year in education. Having taught VCE English myself for many, many years, it is a big year. There is an enormous amount of work. I want to thank you for the corrections, I want to thank you for the feedback and I want to thank you for creating an environment where the school-assessed tasks are done in a relaxed way. I want to thank you for every time you took the time out to get a student back on track, to give that little bit of conversation that might motivate a student. I want to thank you, in particular, for the referrals you made to the welfare teams in your schools, when you thought something was awry with a student, this year and every other year.As well, students completing year 12 is a culmination of all of their teachers work across the 13 years of formal school education—and, might I say, the work of preschool and early-education educators as well. It is a test of our system, and I want to thank everyone who works in that system, from the school support people to the teachers to the administrators in schools, and particularly the principal class in schools, as well as what we in Victoria call our senior teams—people who spend their lives managing a group of students in the senior years of school to ensure that they are supported to make the most of the opportunities that are before them.I also want to speak to the second part of this motion, where it goes to the great work of this government, and I just want to say to those opposite, particularly those who have joined us in recent times: when we came here after the 2013 election, there was a $30 billion cut carried in the 2014 budget. So, whenever you say record spending, you need to remember that cut. You need to remember wholeheartedly that most of the VCE students in this country, most of the year 12 students in this country, attend state schools, and you need to be very clear on the fact that the government, for six years, have undermined the best opportunity we, as a Commonwealth, have had to ensure quality education for all students in all schools. Those opposite have actively undermined that.I was reminded this morning, when I walked past a television set to see Christopher Pyne, the former member for Sturt, on the television, who was responsible for that cut. I know who the minister was at the time who undermined the incredible work done by the previous parliament in the Gonski review. I remind members opposite that the Gonski review, in its original form, determined that state schools required the most funding from the Commonwealth, and those in this government have done nothing but undercut that. In fact, theyve capped the contribution from the Commonwealth to the Schooling Resource Standard at 20 per cent. This is an absolute outrage. It undermines years and years of work in this place, to see us wound back to the happy Howard years where state schools became marginalised as private schools flourished in our suburbs. Thats the legacy that this government should consider itself responsible for—the undermining of a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver great, quality education for every student in Australia.

35,0,0,0,1,1,"Alexander, John, MP","M3M","Bennelong","LP","N/A",4694," I rise to speak about the importance of education and the efforts this government has taken to support and encourage students in their final weeks of year 12. It goes without saying that education is the key for fulfilling and successful careers. It provides individuals with the skills and expertise to become everything from teachers and surgeons to plumbers and astronauts. The diverse variety of jobs and careers in a modern economy like Australias requires a diversity of education and training opportunities. It is important that the government supports all varieties of education, from traditional universities to vocational education and training such as TAFE, or even on-the-job training, and Im proud to say that this government has done this.If we consider the $17.7 billion allocated to the university sector in the 2019-20 budget, as well as the $525.3 million skills package committed to the VET sector, we see that this government makes substantial investments in our nations higher education capacity.But tertiary and further education can only work effectively if individuals have a strong start in primary and high school. As any economist could tell you, the strongest impact of education is made in the early years of schooling, when students are developing the core critical thinking and reasoning skills necessary for any profession. It is vital that this part of our education pipeline is as effective as possible. Over the 13 years of schooling from kindergarten to grade 12, young Australians all around the country gain a world-class education in a variety of subjects, spanning languages, maths, English, technology, sport and countless extracurricular activities. However, the quality of this system should not be taken for granted. It requires commitment, hard work and extensive funding for it to be possible.Im proud that this government has stepped up to the challenge of making Australias education system the best it possibly can be. This government has invested a record $21.3 billion for state schools, Catholic schools and independent schools for the 2020 school year, an increase in funding of $8.5 billion since 2013. In addition, we have funded $30.2 million in the 2019-20 years to establish the Local School Community Fund, which is to support priority projects in local schools that will benefit schools and their communities.I would also like to highlight some of the local work Ive been doing in my electorate to foster and encourage education for our children. As Australias economy becomes more complex we will rely more and more on sectors that use science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM skills, as they are more commonly known. It is therefore essential that we foster STEM skills in our community, not simply through traditional classroom learning but also through applied problem-solving and real-life scenarios. In 2016 I began the Bennelong STEM Challenge in order to provide students in the electorate with another opportunity to develop their STEM teamwork and interpersonal skills. Each year the STEM challenge sets up a complex STEM related problem and asks students to solve it. Last year it was designing a medical station for the surface of Mars, using 3D modelling software. It was hosted by Medtronic and led by the exceptional Dr Michael Myers from Re-Engineering Australia. Dozens of students created complex and ingenious designs, then came together for competition day, when they presented their designs using virtual reality software. It was a tremendous success. This year, the STEM challenge is back and Im very excited to see what our students will develop this time.In addition to the STEM challenge, Im currently in the process of designing a Bennelong chess challenge with our local schools. Chess is a wonderful sport. It develops critical and strategic thinking—both are assets that are used in many different aspects of school and the workforce. It is not just an enjoyable pastime but also has great educational benefits. We are hoping to provide chess resources to every school in Bennelong, along with a single competition day for students to learn from each other and to test their abilities. I greatly look forward to seeing this project get underway next year. It is interesting to note that this came about as a result of our multicultural community. Learning chess is a mandatory extracurricular activity in Armenia, and Armenians are the great champions. This is another real example of multiculturalism at its best.","Education","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALEXANDER (Bennelong) ","(11:22):"
36,0,0,0,1,1,"Haines, Helen, MP",282335,"Indi","IND","N/A",4695," I thank the member for Curtin for her speech. As a former vice-chancellor, she knows well the importance of education in this country and I concur with her in wishing our students the very, very best of luck and in congratulating the teachers, whose fine work has got them to this stage. As an Independent, I see it as my role to be an honest and fair voice on the issues that matter to my electorate, to recognise good work where its done and to call on the government where more work is needed, particularly for Australians in regional areas. People living in remote, rural and regional Australia have much lower education outcomes than our city cousins. This is nothing to do with our capacity to learn and everything to do with our opportunity to do so. It is completely unacceptable that this is so in a modern Australia with a projected federal budget surplus.Rural Australians are less likely to complete year 12, less likely to gain a certificate IV, or above, qualification, more likely to have to leave home for an education, and less likely to apply for and accept a university offer. As someone who grew up on a farm in rural Victoria, let me say that I know what impact drought has on a young persons expectations as to how high they can aim. Whether there is money around to leave home and go to university or whether we should leave school and try to get a job—never underestimate the message young kids in the country subliminally receive when their parents are struggling to manage the ravages of prolonged drought on the family income. The governments recent strategy in rural and regional education, the Napthine report, identifies clear barriers that hold country people back. We should move swiftly, for instance, on the first three recommendations of that report: uncap places at regional universities; develop new, innovative VET offerings focused on practical learning and technical skills; and expand the Regional Study Hubs program to give all students, VET and university, access to high-quality learning spaces with world-class internet. In short, we need to do more to introduce our young people to opportunities for education, provide them with pathways to succeed and connect them to jobs that our regions are thirsty for.Mansfield Secondary College in my electorate of Indi is doing precisely this kind of innovation. Commencing in 2009, Mansfield Secondary developed an agriculture and horticulture training program for year 9 students, integrated into the schools curriculum. The program addressed the need for a sustainable agricultural workforce by recruiting year 9 students into agricultural careers by organising field trips to farms and offering enrolment in VET cert II courses offered by a local TAFE provider. What is now known as the Mansfield model was a huge success: 98 per cent of participants completed that certificate II; of those, 27 per cent successfully transitioned into completing a cert III or IV, some of which led to university courses in agriculture via school based apprenticeships and traineeships. In fact it was such a success that it has spawned the workforce development project which is expanding the Mansfield model to 24 locations across the Ovens Murray region in the coming years. It has also been expanded to address another critical skills shortage in health care and social assistance.This project is supported by wonderful local organisations like the NE Tracks Local Learning and Employment Network, which supports young people and works with schools to achieve higher rates of education attainment in Benalla, Wangaratta and Mansfield. This program came to pass not because the government or the private sector made it happen but because of local creativity and hard work. Julie Aldous, a local secondary teacher, instigated the Mansfield model in 2009. She is now leading an industry and government backed push to expand the original agriculture focus of the model into health and horticulture. Lucy Wallace, a committee member with the Albury Wodonga Health Community Advisory Committee, has joined this push into the health sector to address our immediate and urgent needs for healthcare workers in the north-east. Sue Brunskill, from the National Industry Reference Committee for horticulture and conservation, has been actively engaging local and national horticultural businesses as they consider the models employment and study success.Increasing the life chances for kids in the country means we need to elevate and expand on these brilliant initiatives that are already taking place. A place to start would be to implement the recommendations of the governments own regional education strategy. The government committed in this election campaign to develop a study hub in Wangaratta, and I will be pushing for this to be delivered, along with the rest of the regional education strategy, to ensure that all regional Australians get an equal shot at opportunities that education offers.","Education","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr HAINES (Indi) ","(11:27):"
37,0,0,0,1,1,"Gillespie, David, MP",72184,"Lyne","Nats","N/A",4696," I rise in support of this motion. As you know, the coalition government was at the forefront of the increased funding to all schools across the Australian states and territories. In the time of Menzies in the 1960s the Archbishop of Canberra and Goulburn closed the school because of the requirements to upgrade their toilet blocks and the facilities for the students. As he marched the schoolchildren up the main street, people all of a sudden had a lightbulb moment and thought, Gee, if all these non-government schools close, the government schools will be flooded with children. Hence at the time there was federal coalition government support for Catholic and other non-government schools in the form of science blocks, and it has gone on from then. For decades, state governments have funded and run free public education. From the 1850s and 1860s, when government schools exploded around the then colonies, Australia has had an exemplary record in funding things.But the coalition government, in the recent so-called funding wars, have really stumped up and increased funding to all levels of school. The most formative period of ones education is that very first part. We have a situation now where there is guaranteed funding for 15 hours of preschool, including support for child care. And we are putting pressure on the states to make sure that the funding results in the children actually attending that preschool and early school preparation work, because if theyre not ready for school when they get into kindergarten or their first year at school, they dont thrive as well. Weve put enormous amounts of extra money into child care. Weve made it much more efficient; the funding goes straight to the day care or the childcare centre.In the school space, all of the schools in the Lyne electorate have received extra funding. There were no problems in my part of Australia. All the government schools got a better deal out of the federal coalition government, and so did all the non-government schools. But, as the member for Indi pointed out, regarding achievement at the tertiary level, whether in trade skills development or in higher education at universities, regional Australia hasnt done nearly as well. Many of the views she referred to, I thoroughly agree with. The inhibition to achieving a tertiary or a vocational qualification in regional Australia is different. The challenges are different. The tyranny of distance really plays into it, just as much as the low general income, because its the barrier to travelling away for either apprenticeship training or for a university degree. Its the costs involved; its not the actual education fees. People cant really aspire if it means relocating to a regional or major metropolitan centre. If your children are relocating to a major metropolitan centre, you are up for about $25,000 when you put together housing, travel and relocation, even for distances as small as 50 or 100 kilometres. It means they dont aspire to it, because its not in their area. Thats why these regional university centres that the minister is rolling out, in the next round, are so important.In my electorate, there are pockets where there is low achievement in the tertiary education space: in the Manning and down into the Upper Hunter regions. We had 42 new apprentices delivered into the marketplace courtesy of our subsidy trial program. In the second round, we had another 30. Thats roughly 70 new apprentices in the Lyne electorate alone that are there because of the support that we in the coalition government have given them. These regional university centres are a great initiative, and Im looking forward to support from the government in any application that comes out of the Manning Valley region, which Ive spoken about in this House already. It is a really critical thing because it brings tertiary education into the here and now, into the financially possible space if its delivered locally in a mixed modality fashion.

38,0,0,0,1,1,"Phillips, Fiona, MP",147140,"Gilmore","ALP","N/A",4697," I am pleased to have the opportunity today to talk about the governments record on education. Education is something I am passionate about for many reasons, but largely because of the many wonderful students I have spent time with over the years. I want to start by also acknowledging the hard work that all year 12 students on the New South Wales South Coast have put in over their years of schooling. I wish them the very best of luck in their exams and in whatever path they may choose to take next.I recently had the pleasure of attending graduation ceremonies at Kiama High School, Nowra Anglican College and TAFEs IPROWD students. I went along to the Clontarf Foundation academys opening at Vincentia High School. This week I am very excited to welcome school students from Callala and Moruya public schools to Parliament House. I look forward to seeing them later in the week.I always love talking with students about their hopes and dreams for the future. I would also agree wholeheartedly with this motion that the work of teachers is invaluable. Teachers are invested in their students. They live the highs and the lows with them. They want to see them succeed and they push themselves hard to help their students reach their full potential. That is why I am so passionate on this topic. I used to be a TAFE teacher. I was invested in the students in my outreach classes. I was invested in my students in my pre-apprenticeship courses. I was invested in them all, and I still am. That is why I can talk passionately about the governments record on education but not the record the member for Curtin wants us to believe.The Liberals have cut $14 billion from schools. They have cut $3 billion from TAFE and training. Teachers are being asked to do more with less because of this governments record on education. Students are falling behind in reading, writing and maths because of this governments record on education. Schools are turning to GoFundMe pages to help them. Minnamurra Public School made an amazing video asking people to help them raise $14,000 for their new STEM lab. They wanted a STEMshare robotics kit, an iPad and a 3D printer—equipment to help them prepare for the jobs of the future. I think it is fantastic that the kids, their teachers and their parents put such great effort into this, but why should they have to?At the last election, I committed an additional $400,000 to this school under Labors schools plan. Under Labor, schools across my electorate would have been $21 million better off. But this government is not serious about properly funding education. The government is not serious about making sure children can reach their full potential. Students need the right equipment to gain the skills for 21st century jobs, otherwise they will be left behind. We need to have targeted investment in schools, but this government has starved our education system through its cruel cuts.Instead, what do young people in my electorate have to look forward to when they finish school? The highest youth unemployment rate in New South Wales, the lowest workforce participation rate in Australia, a 30 per cent drop in apprentice numbers from when this government was elected in 2013 until March 2018. Thats not surprising. This is what happens when you cut all the pre-apprenticeship courses in our local TAFE campuses. When you remove the support for young people wanting to take up a trade and put your faith in celebrities rather than in funding, you cause a skills crisis, you end up with more apprentices dropping out of apprenticeships than finishing them.Year 12 students graduating this year have the world at their feet. They are full of potential and full of hope for the future. I want to see them succeed. I want to see them go to TAFE and university and get a good job. I want to see them follow their dreams. This government needs to start investing in their future now. They need to reverse the successive cuts that have ripped the guts out of our education system. They need to fix the mess they made of TAFE and apprenticeship courses. They need to re-establish pre-apprenticeship programs. They need to properly fund our schools so that no child has to turn to GoFundMe just to get the basic equipment they need. Our young people need the government to invest in them, and I will continue calling out the government on their record in education so that our kids can get the start in life they deserve.","Education","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs PHILLIPS (Gilmore) ","(11:38):"
39,0,0,0,1,1,"Leeser, Julian, MP",109556,"Berowra","LP","N/A",4698," Id like to thank and acknowledge my friend the member for Curtin, the distinguished former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Notre Dame, for moving this motion today. Let me also acknowledge the year 12 students in the Berowra electorate, who are preparing for life beyond the school gate—some are preparing for university and others for vocational education, while some are moving into the workforce. I want to congratulate our HSC students on completing school and wish them well for their exams, and I want to say to all of them that we look forward to the many ways in which theyll contribute to the great future of this country.The Morrison government is investing more money in schools than any federal government in our history. Were doing this because we recognise that one of the most important differences any government can make to the future of our young people, no matter what their background, is to ensure they have a chance to learn and are equipped with the skills, knowledge and capacity to keep learning in the years ahead. But we also know that money alone does not create a great education system. No matter how much money we put into education, we cant change the fact that one of the most important factors in the quality of the education a child receives is the teacher a child learns from. Great teachers bring deep subject matter expertise combined with a passion for educating students and for the subjects they teach as well as the skills to manage the classroom and pass on their knowledge.Today I want to talk about an amazing organisation which has been funded by the Morrison government and its predecessors on both sides of the House and which is doing so much to bring outstanding people into the teaching profession, where theyre improving student performance and changing lives. For the past 10 years this organisation has been quietly working to ensure more children can have the best possible teachers and to raise the status and quality of the teaching profession in Australia. Teach for Australia takes top graduates from a range of disciplines and puts them through a tailored masters of education while working in the classroom, where they are coached, mentored and supported by highly experienced teachers. It was an honour to serve on their board prior to my election to this place.Over the past decade, 800 highly talented Australians who are at the top of their field have chosen to teach because of Teach for Australia. Teach for Australia has shown some of the things we assume about the teaching profession are not necessarily true. Firstly, we assume top graduates dont become teachers because the pay is low, the work is hard and the status isnt high. Thats not the case. Eleven thousand people have applied for the roughly 800 places Teach for Australia has filled. Teach for Australia has been ranked among the top 100 graduate employers in Australia. One Teach for Australia participant, Surajeev Santhirasegaram, left his burgeoning career in finance to move to Western Australia and teach high school maths and physics. He says he was motivated by work with a purpose. He loves being on the ground with students and wants to be creative and self-driven in his work. It seems that, for many people, teaching is an attractive pathway but investing the time and money in further education for a career you cant try before making that investment is a difficult obstacle to overcome. Teach for Australia provides a different pathway.Secondly, we too easily assume that the best way to prepare a great teacher is to teach educational theory in lecture halls. The Teach for Australia model shows that learning in the classroom with high-quality professional development happening alongside can produce great results. In 2015, a survey of principals who had a Teach for Australia teacher in their school found that 80 per cent of principals said that Teach for Australia teachers were more or much more effective than typical graduates with the same level of experience.Thirdly, we assume that if someone can become a management consultant or investment banker, they will choose that over teaching. But the Teach for Australia retention stats show a different picture. Fifty per cent of Teach for Australia graduates remain in teaching three years on. This compares to about only one in four students who start an educational degree through traditional pathways who are still in teaching five years of graduation. The Morrison government is investing in Teach for Australia because it is game changing for the teaching profession and for the whole education system in Australia.Teach for Australia provides an avenue for some of our top students to pass their knowledge on to the next generation and its building the status of the teaching profession. It allows us to think creatively and freshly about how we build educational quality in Australia. Each dollar we spend on Teach for Australia is a wise investment in the future of our nation. Teach for Australia graduates bring a growth mindset to our education system. They realise that, as the PISA results indicate, our education system isnt performing as it should be and we need to attract people into the teaching profession to achieve real change on the ground. Thats what Teach for Australia graduates are doing every single day. I want to commend the outstanding Melodie Potts Rosevear, founding CEO of Teach for Australia, who has led it since its inception, and her team for their dedication to young people and I want to thank the government for their continued support of TFA.","Education","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LEESER (Berowra) ","(11:43):"
40,0,0,0,1,1,"Perrett, Graham, MP","HVP","Moreton","ALP","N/A",4700," Im pleased to speak on the motion moved by the member for Curtin recognising that, across the country, year 12 students will be completing their final exams and their last days as school students. I especially mention my godson, Alexander Crocker, who I know is listening, and wish him well in his exams and in his football career in the United Kingdom. The end of 13 long years of school is an exciting time for students and their parents. It can also be an anxious time. To the year 12 students in Moreton and everywhere, but especially in Moreton, students graduating from Yeronga State High School, Macgregor State High, Runcorn State High School, St Thomas More College, St Aidans Anglican Girls School, Corinda State High School, Brisbane Christian College, Sunnybank, Our Ladys College at Annerley, Milperra, the Murri School, Carinity Education and maybe some of those schools right on the border, such as Holland Park State High and the Islamic College: I encourage all of you to enjoy your last few days of school and, whatever your results, remember they alone wont define your journey through life. Whatever your next chapter holds, be it higher education, vocational education and training or entering the workforce, I wish you well. I would also ask you to take a moment, before you leave the school grounds for the last time, to thank staff and teachers. This can be a stressful time for them, and teachers, remember, have to go through this every single year; you only have to do it once. If there are one or two special teachers who have inspired you or supported you or held you up, please especially take a moment to let those teachers know. We have some exceptional teachers in our schools, and they dont always get the accolades or reward that they deserve. A kind word of gratitude from you will mean the world to that teacher. And also: buy them a gift.Its funny how, even when its many years since you walked from the school grounds for the last time, you remember those teachers who managed to make that connection—the teachers who made the puzzle fit. I had many. One I will particularly mention was Lorna Locke, my grade 6 teacher. Lorna had also taught my very wild and unruly older brother Mark. Lorna actually took the time to teach me that learning is always a good use of my time, and that lesson has stuck with me my whole life. I bet most of us cant recall too many single lessons from our schooldays but we can remember those teachers who left a lasting impression. Likewise, from my 11 years of teaching high school English, there arent many actual classes that I recall, but I do remember the faces of the students, especially the ones who left me feeling that our future would be in good hands.Teachers today have far more pressures than when I was in front of a blackboard. Households are under far greater financial stress, which can flow on to students. The internet makes teaching, and parenting, much more complicated—and, sometimes, even dangerous. The students are under pressure to find a pathway in a world where the job market is changing rapidly, with the gig economy and so many other pressures. Most students who decide to go into higher education will be signing up for debt, and, thanks to the Morrison government, that debt now has to be repaid much sooner, making their chances of affording a home an unattainable dream for many.Education is transformation, but education costs money—money so schools can hire more teachers and teacher aides; money so struggling students can have the one-on-one attention they need to succeed. We need every child to be learning every day. We need children who are struggling to be identified early so they can obtain the help they need to catch up. We need children who are gifted and talented to have the opportunity to stretch themselves, because they will create the jobs of the future.Two-thirds of students in Australia—2½ million children—are educated at public schools. Under the Morrison governments funding regime, all private schools will reach or exceed their fair funding level. Good luck to them. But 90 per cent of public schools never, never will.This government is in its seventh year of presiding over Australias education system. How are they doing? Well, lets prepare their report card—because, sadly, I need to report that theyre failing. Theyre failing to reverse the alarming declines in reading, writing and maths—the core business of education. In every state and territory, kids are going backwards in some of these critical areas of education. This is not just a tragedy for each of those students; its a tragedy for the Australian economy. A good education is the ticket to a lifetime of opportunity, opening doors to rewarding and well-paid jobs, and an educated workforce is critical to a strong economy. Malcolm Turnbull abandoned proper, fair school funding. Tony Abbott dumped reforms designed to lift standards in the basics—reading, writing and maths. Now, sadly, our kids and our economy, under Prime Minister Morrisons stewardship, are paying the price.","Education","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PERRETT (Moreton) ","(11:48):"
41,0,0,0,1,1,"Wallace, Andrew, MP",265967,"Fisher","LNP","N/A",4701," For a week or two earlier this month, my Sunshine Coast office was the site of a production line that even BlueScope Steel would be proud of. Volunteers from all over my community came together to create my Fisher school leavers guide. With only a hand-cranked binding machine and lots of community spirit, Fishers volunteers put together 2,000 booklets to go out to all of our year 12s. My guide gives local students a great starting point to find out how to get information on further education, find somewhere to live, get a job and set up a life in the real world. I would encourage all of the students who received a copy this month to read it carefully, and to come back to it often in the critical months to come. Thank you to my dedicated volunteers, Julie Craig, John Pozzey, Helen Burke, Charmaine Roberts and Lyn Carden, who came in to help them get ready. My mission as a parliamentarian is to help make Fisher the place to be for education, employment and retirement.Education is the foundation of that vision, and that is why I am so pleased that this coalition government has delivered unprecedented support to my electorate for learning at every stage. For schools in Fisher, the government has delivered an additional $266 million to ensure every student has the resources necessary to flourish. Critically, we have combined that additional funding with a program of reform in teaching standards and approaches because we understand that money alone will never deliver the results that we need. However, the government acknowledges that a better built environment can support students learning, and with millions of dollars through the governments Capital Grants Program Ive had the privilege of opening fantastic new facilities at schools all over Fisher.In June, I opened new classrooms, a recording studio, a drama and dance studio, new sports courts and a gym at Glasshouse Christian College. Supported by a grant of $1 million from the Capital Grants Program, these new facilities feature the cutting-edge technology and learning design so important for success in todays world. Recently, I visited Caloundra Christian College to view the results of the governments $880,000 investment in the schools new primary precinct. We helped deliver six new classrooms, places for art and play, and the functional facilities the precinct requires. Last year at Caloundra City Private School I opened a new multipurpose hall, a music classroom, a drama classroom, practice rooms, a stage and more, following a grant of $900,000 from the coalition government. In the weeks to come, Im looking forward to joining Mr Peter Hovey and Bishop Paul Smith in opening Pacific Lutheran Colleges new administration buildings and classrooms, following their receipt of $600,000 from this education-focused government.Many of Fishers year 12s will be going on to study at the University of the Sunshine Coast. Alongside funding for research into epilepsy, airport runway materials and mental health, this government has provided millions to USC in additional funding for our university students. Our funding for teaching and learning at USC increased from $165 million in 2017 to $172 million last year. This government is also providing USC with an additional $69.4 million over four years for their Moreton Bay campus and an additional $30.2 million to increase the number of bachelor students at their Caboolture and Fraser Coast campuses.Sadly, too few of our year 12s will be on their way to an apprenticeship or other vocational education. I have spoken often about this in this place—that is, the importance of our tradies, and for young people to take on trades and to have a fulfilling and lucrative career. First-year rates of full-time employment for VET and university graduates, and their median salaries, are almost identical. Apprentices generate an income from day one, do not finish with a big burden of debt and, in the longer term, have the chance to start a business and work for themselves. The government understand that we need more skilled tradies, and we are investing to make it happen with an expanded Australian apprentice wage subsidy trial, with $156.3 million for a new additional identified skills shortage payment and $525 million in a new skills package. To all the students out there: do yourselves a favour and get a trade.","Education","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[7]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WALLACE (Fisher) ","(11:53):"

45,0,0,0,1,1,"King, Madeleine, MP",102376,"Brand","ALP","N/A",4703," Labor supports this legislation. I move:That all words after That be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:(1) notes with concern potential temporary foreign labour arrangements concerning Contractual Service Suppliers;(2) notes the importance of ensuring robust public interest safeguards, including on health and environmental law, relating to the new, modernised investor-state dispute settlement provisions;(3) commends the outstanding work by civil society, the wider labour movement and the trade union movement in campaigning against antiquated investor-state dispute settlement provisions, for better, fairer free trade agreements;(4) calls on the government to implement the recommendation made by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, to ensure that future proposed free trade agreements are accompanied by independent modelling and analysis;(5) notes with concern the growth in worker exploitation under current temporary work visa arrangements; and(6) calls on the Government to rigorously enforce anti-dumping measures to ensure Australian industry is not subject to anti-competitive and predatory trade practices.This morning I received confirmation in writing from the minister for trade confirming this governments commitment to the issues I have raised. I welcome the commitment, but it must be followed by action. Labor will hold the government to account on the commitments it has made and will work constructively to make sure that this happens.We support this legislation because we understand the enormous benefits that trade has brought to Australia. We do so because we recognise the importance for a trading nation like ours in building closer economic and people-to-people relationships with our neighbours. Trade creates jobs. According to the independent Centre for International Economics, one in five Australian jobs depends on trade. Thats 2.5 million workers whose livelihoods are directly linked to our engagement with the world, especially the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region on our doorstep. If we continue to reduce trade barriers, if we as a nation continue to advocate for an open, rules based global trading system, we will create more jobs for Australian workers. The result will be more competitive industries with a higher skilled, better-paid workforce.Many of our key industries rely on trade. Those with the highest percentage of export related jobs are in mining. Seventy-five per cent of mining jobs are export related, 43 per cent of agricultural jobs are export related, 38 per cent of metal product manufacturing jobs are export related, 28 per cent of jobs in food manufacturing are export related, and 31 per cent of transport and storage jobs are related to export trade. These are the people whom Labor represents: mineworkers, farm labourers, meatworkers, manufacturing workers, truck drivers, wharfies, airline industry workers, shop assistants, and storemen and packers. In addition, there are thousands of jobs in hospitality and transport that rely on tourism. As well, those in higher education and vocational education rely on the rapid growth in Australias export of education services. Trade creates jobs for Australians. It also creates better jobs. A study by economists at the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science has found that Australian businesses that export will hire, on average, 23 per cent more staff, pay 11 per cent higher wages and have labour productivity 13 per cent higher than non-exporters. However, Labor also recognises that we live in an era of increased scepticism about the impacts of globalism and free trade. We live in an era in which some world leaders have demonised free trade for their own domestic political purposes. In the US, the America First slogan from the 1940s has been revived and the US President has lambasted his countrys global engagement in the postwar era and pulled the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Here in Australia, the Greens and One Nation have also used international trade as a weapon for their own electoral gains. If these parties choose to weaponise these agreements for short-term political gain, I hope they have the courage to explain their decision to the steelworkers of Port Kembla, to the wheat producers of Western Australia, to dairy farmers in Victoria and to the beef and sugar industries of Queensland. And, if Centre Alliance also chooses to politicise these agreements, what will they tell the Australian grain and wine industries? What will they say to South Australian workers in the copper mining and refining industry who will benefit from the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement?While we know that trade has raised overall living standards in Australia, we also recognise that it has harmed workers in some industries and some regions. The benefits of trade are not always evenly spread, and it is understandable that those who feel left behind often question whether trade deals are more advantageous for big companies than for ordinary workers. So we must listen to what the community is telling us, and that is what we have been doing. We have consulted with stakeholders in the union movement, in industry, in academia and in government. After careful consideration, Labor has come to the conclusion that these three agreements, with Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru, are in the national interest. But that doesnt mean they are perfect—far from it.When Labor is next in government, we will undoubtedly do things differently. I appreciate the concerns that have been raised by the ACTU and some of its affiliate unions with these agreements. I share these concerns. The federal parliamentary Labor Party shares these concerns. Labor wants to protect jobs and to improve working conditions for everyone. These are important aims, critical for the wellbeing and prosperity of Australian workers, especially at this time of slowing economic growth, record low wages growth and high youth unemployment. The Liberal-National governments appalling record of economic mismanagement has only exacerbated these problems for workers and their families.The union movement has stood up for the rights of Australian workers and has also played a leading role in highlighting the exploitation of foreigners who come to Australia to work on a temporary visa. We should have better safeguards in place to protect these vulnerable workers. Unfortunately, this government does not share Labors belief in the need for a stronger industrial relations systems that protects all Australian workers regardless of their country of origin.Unions have long advocated for labour market testing when employers bring temporary skilled workers to Australia. I note, however, that there are no new labour market testing waivers in these trade agreements that go beyond the commitments Australia has already made to these three nations. All adhere to Australias obligations under the World Trade Organization rules. But this was not the case when the coalition ratified the China-Australia free trade agreement in 2015. At that time, the trade union movement campaigned to protect labour market testing to ensure the safety and prosperity of Australian workers. This lobbying effort has resulted in a significant change. Australian government trade negotiators have maintained labour markets testing as a rule in all current and future arrangements.Without the advocacy of the labour movement in ensuring free trade agreements are fair for workers and maintain high standards, we would not have the robust safeguards that we see in the deals before the parliament. That does not mean, however, that concerns about protecting Australian jobs have been fully or adequately addressed. Labor is concerned that the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership could, in future, allow workers from Indonesia to enter Australia without due consideration as to whether local workers are able to full those positions. Under the terms of the IA-CEPA, Australia and Indonesia can begin talks within three years of a new agreement to allow increased numbers of Indonesian temporary workers to enter this country.I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the Labor members on the JSCOT committee that examined the IA-CEPA and other agreements—and I also acknowledge the chair of the JSCOT committee, who is in the chamber. These Labor MPs sought to include a recommendation in the final report that a future agreement with Indonesia on this issue should include a commitment to labour market testing. Such a commitment would ensure that Indonesian workers meet the same standards as local workers. However, the JSCOT committee in the end did not support this recommendation and it was not included in its report. Again, I note the governments letter today and its commitment that people who come to work in Australia are not exploited and that they are properly qualified for any work that they undertake.Under the IA-CEPA, the number of working-holiday visas issued to young Indonesians will increase from the present level of 1,000 a year to 4,100—scaling up to 5,000 young Indonesians by the sixth year. Some stakeholders have expressed concerns that this could help to drive up unemployment in Australia. However, it is important to note that in 2017-18 a total of 210,456 working-holiday visas were issued in Australia and that Indonesia accounted for just 0.5 per cent of these. In contrast, there were almost 38,000 visa holders in this category from the United Kingdom. An additional 4,000 workers from Indonesia will equate to just 0.03 per cent of the national labour force. Nonetheless, there is a very real risk that these workers could be exploited, and the growth of the temporary workforce is fundamentally changing Australia as a nation.Two million people live and work here with no path to permanency and fewer rights than Australians. This country is at risk of creating a migrant underclass, and that is not what Australians want. Many people blame free trade, but the problem is wider than that. It includes our domestic industrial laws and the inadequate enforcement of those laws. It includes a failure to address the worker exploitation that the trade union movement brings to our attention regularly. I recognise the commitment of trade unions that are at the coalface when fellow humans are discovered living in appalling conditions—held hostage, their passports taken and often not paid by unscrupulous employers. All nations, including Australia, should be striving to meet their commitment to implement agreed international standards on labour rights, including the International Labour Organizations conventions.It was pleasing to see the treaties committee unanimously recommend that the government should conduct independent modelling of all proposed trade agreements to assess whether expected outcomes are being realised. This has long been Labor Party policy. This recommendation was supported during the JSCOT process by both the union movement and leading business groups, such as the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. As the ACTUs Damian Kyloh told the committee:We feel that for good policymaking its very important that we conduct independent cost-benefit analysis, and not just of the economic effects—wed also say environmental and, for us particularly, looking at the labour market. We want to understand what the effects on the labour market are in these agreements. We know that in the past some industries have benefited but some others have not and there have been job losses as a result. Without an independent economic assessment no-one knows what the effects are.I call on the government to accept this recommendation and to implement a process through which independent economic modelling of proposed trade agreements can be undertaken, but I am far from confident this will occur, because the government has ignored all previous JSCOT recommendations on this issue. I note too that todays letter from the government does not have a commitment to economic modelling.Labor calls on the government to ensure that any new free trade agreement is subject to an independent national interest assessment along with economic modelling before it is assigned. This assessment could examine the economic, strategic and social impacts of the agreement. It should be reviewed 10 years after ratification so the full impacts of a trade agreement are able to be assessed. In addition, we call on the government to ensure greater transparency in other areas, including updating the parliament and public after each round of negotiations, where that is possible. Wed also like to see a focused system of trade advisers, including from industry and unions, who will provide feedback and draft trade agreements during negotiations.In its most recent review of the world trading system, the Productivity Commission noted that higher-quality consultation processes with the community would help to achieve better outcomes for our trade and investment agreements. It found that confidentiality agreements could be used to enable formal consultation on draft treaty text with stakeholder parties during the negotiation process. It recommended that, when a draft agreement is completed, it should be exposed to public scrutiny before it is signed. This level of consultation would build a better appreciation of the choices and their respective pros and cons, combat perceptions that secrecy during negotiations leads to suboptimal outcomes for some members of the community and foster public confidence in open markets. More generally, the commission called for governments to better explain how and why the community benefits from trade liberalisation while recognising there sometimes will be members of the community who do lose out.Labor believes in greater transparency because we believe the whole community should be cognisant of facts in the discussion on international trade. Facts are importance to all decision-making and policy development processes. Just as Labor and the Australian people have called on the government to acknowledge the science of climate change, we want the facts on trade to be out in the open. It was for this reason that the previous Labor government conducted a scoping study into the full economic partnership with Indonesia, in conjunction with the Indonesian government. This was followed by independent economic modelling by the Centre for International Economics that indicated a potential IA-CEPA would result in gains of $3.2 billion of GDP to Australia. This modelling can give Australians confidence that the agreement will be of significant benefit to Australia and Australian jobs.It goes without saying that a more contemporary analysis would provide even greater confidence. But, in the absence of this, we turn to other reputable sources. The recent report of the Productivity Commission, the Australian governments independent advisory body, found that the benefits of free trade for this country are wide-ranging. For example, every Australian business that uses a car—from tradies to taxi operators and driving schools—has benefited from the large reduction in tariffs and quotas over the past decades. Its not just the price of cars that has fallen. Australian consumers see the benefits every day in terms of wider choices and lower prices. The prices of clothing, footwear and most electronic goods have also fallen in real terms over the past 30 years, boosting household purchasing power.In many parts of the world, the effects of trade liberalisation have been even more profound. The World Bank estimates that, over the past quarter-century, more than one billion people have lifted themselves out of poverty, in many cases by seizing the opportunities that trade has created. The largest gains have been in Asia, including our key trading partners, such as Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.Other experts have attempted to investigate the likely economic impacts in the event an Australian government chose to wind back decades of tariff cuts and even to renegotiate existing free trade agreements. The aforementioned report by the Centre for International Economics, commissioned by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, did some valuable work on this topic. It found the short-term impact of tariff increases would cause job losses in Australia, and over the long term real wages for Australian workers would be lower, in turn cutting household consumption and Australian living standards. The modelling in the report showed that, if tariffs on manufacturing imports were raised, causing a 10 per cent price increase across the world, real GDP in Australia would be 1.8 per cent lower, and global real GDP would be 3.5 per cent lower. If tariffs on all merchandise imports were increased to raise all import prices by 10 per cent, real GDP in Australia would be 2.2 per cent lower and global real GDP would be 4.1 per cent lower.A key point of difference between Labor and the government on these three agreements relates to the inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms. These agreements with Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru all contain ISDS clauses which Labor does not support. Again, I recognise the excellent work of civil society and the trade union movement in campaigning against antiquated ISDS provisions. Importantly, however, the ISDS provisions in these agreements include newer safeguards that protect Australia from legal action against public interest laws, such as public health measures or environment law. For example, under these new ISDS clauses, tobacco giant Philip Morris would be unable to take legal action against the Australian government for its plain cigarette packaging legislation, as it unsuccessfully did several years ago.If these agreements do not come into force, the bilateral investment treaties that currently govern Australias relationships with these trading partners would remain in place. In other words, Australia would be worse off. In the cases of the Hong Kong and Peru agreements, separate agreements have been made to terminate these bilateral investment treaties upon entry into force of the new trade agreements. In the case of Indonesia, no agreement was reached to terminate the old treaty. It is of course baffling why the government signed IA-CEPA without ensuring that, contrary to usual practice, the previous investment treaty with Indonesia was not terminated. It means that, for now at least, the IA-CEPA will initially coexist alongside the antiquated investment treaty and two sets of ISDS provisions will be in force. This presents a risk for Australia and it must be addressed. Im heartened by the governments commitment today, in response to Labors demands, that the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment will pursue an agreement with Indonesia to terminate the old bilateral investment treaty. I also note that the JSCOT committee made this recommendation in the strongest possible terms.Ill now address a number of concerns that have been raised by stakeholders in respect of these agreements. In relation to the privatisation of public services, none of the agreements include provisions that require the privatisation of any public services, and that is a good thing. However, some stakeholders remain concerned about this issue. I therefore call on the government to ensure there is no inference from the agreements that would require the privatisation of government owned services, nor restrict any future decision to acquire public assets.In relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, none of the agreements include provisions that undermine our important PBS. On intellectual property, the Peru and Hong Kong agreements do not include pharmaceutical provisions, including in relation to biologics. IA-CEPA does not include a chapter on intellectual property. The investment chapters in the Peru, Hong Kong and Indonesia agreements explicitly prevent anyone from bringing an ISDS claim against the Australian government in relation to measures comprising or relating to the PBS. The PBS is a critically important part of Australias health system. It is the envy of the world and must be protected.With regard to antidumping, all three agreements preserve Australias WTO antidumping rights. However, Labor calls on the government to rigorously enforce antidumping measures in order to ensure Australian industry is not subjected to anticompetitive and predatory trade practices. The government should consider sensible reforms, such as transferring the emergency safeguard mechanism from the Productivity Commission to the Anti-Dumping Commission.Labor supports trade between Australia and the rest of the world, because trade creates jobs, generates economic growth and improves living standards. Trade has lifted millions out of poverty around the world. It provides consumers in Australia and around the world with cheaper products. Despite absurd claims to the contrary by some Liberal MPs, Labor has a long record as an advocate for an open global trading system. Labor was the party that opened up Australia to competition and helped make our exports globally competitive. In fact, it was Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley who took Australia into the worlds new multilateral trading system that began after World War II. Chifley also led the foundations for close engagement with the emerging powers of Asia, boldly supporting independence for both Indonesia and India. He envisioned lucrative new export markets in our region. In the early 1970s Gough Whitlam cut tariffs by 25 per cent across the board. He also launched a new era of regional engagement when he visited China and established formal diplomatic relations with Beijing. These were brave moves, unprecedented for a political leader of that time. Whitlam viewed China as a huge potential economic opportunity for Australia. Of course, almost 50 years later, China is our biggest trading partner. The reforms of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, who tore down Australias tariff walls in the 1980s, laid the foundation for almost three decades of continuous economic growth. Hawke was the founding father of APEC, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group, a vehicle for free and open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. Labor trade minister John Dawkins established the Cairns Group in order to make trade in agricultural products tariff free.Labors dedication to trade reform has not dimmed in the years since. When Labor was last in government we signed trade agreements with Chile and Malaysia, along with a landmark deal with the 10 countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and New Zealand. Labor trade minister Simon Crean was also heavily involved in the Doha round in the WTO and in commencing the FTAs with China, South Korea and Japan. The Gillard governments landmark Australia in the Asian century white paper identified the vast opportunities for Australia in the region. Another Labor trade minister, Craig Emerson, launched negotiations for what would become the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, which we are discussing today. Unfortunately, this stalled for several years after Labor left office, and Australias trading relationship with Indonesia has since gone backwards. The government eventually re-entered negotiations but these broke down in 2018 when, during the Wentworth by-election, the Prime Minister announced plans to relocate Australias embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.This economic partnership agreement between Australia and Indonesia will help to address a relationship that is very much underdone. Indonesia has a population of 260 million people and is one of Australias closest neighbours, yet it accounts for only around two per cent of Australias exports. In 2018, two-way trade in goods and services was worth $17.6 billion, making Indonesia only our 14th biggest trading partner. Labor believes the IA-CEPA agreement will help to address this. Indonesia is an emerging economic giant in our region. The Indonesian economy has expanded strongly over recent decades. It remains the third-fastest growing economy in the G20, behind India and China. Based on trends, by 2030 Indonesia will move from the 16th largest economy in the world to the ninth largest, and to the fourth largest by 2050. It will have a consumer class of 135 million people by 2030. Indonesias urban population could reach 63 per cent in 2030, up from 51 per cent in 2012. As Indonesias economic clout grows and more of its people enter the consumer class, business opportunities in Indonesia will continue to grow. We should not overlook its challenges, of course. To realise its potential, Indonesia will need to continue the structural reform of the economy undertaken by President Joko Widodo. It will have to improve its business and investment climate, cut red tape and tackle corruption.Under IA-CEPA, Australia will eliminate all of its remaining tariffs on Indonesian goods imported. In return, Indonesia will provide duty-free or preferential access to 99.9 per cent of goods from Australia. This agreement locks in fresh trade opportunities for Australian steel manufacturers, as well as for our meat, grain, sugar, dairy and horticultural producers. The Australian steel industry and steelmakers will benefit as Indonesia reduces its existing tariff of 15 per cent on Australian steel to zero. It will also guarantee import permits for 250,000 tonnes of Australian steel per year. This is great news for Australian manufacturing, especially for companies like BlueScope Steel and its workers in Port Kembla. It will also ensure that BlueScopes Indonesian operations of 40-plus years, which employ more than 500 Indonesians, have access to a bigger range of high-quality, competitively-priced feedstock. It means that Australia will be well placed to contribute to the extraordinary development and infrastructure agenda of the Indonesian government.With the Presidents recent announcement that he intends to build an entirely new capital city in East Kalimantan, the possibilities are endless. Australian farmers will be able to import 500,000 tonnes of grain, wheat, barley and sorghum a year into Indonesia tariff-free, with the quota increasing five per cent a year. Indonesia is Australias largest wheat export market, but higher grain prices in Australia caused by the drought have hit our exports. The industry has said it wants to be in a position to rapidly recover market share in Indonesia when conditions in Australia improve, and it has said that the IA-CEPA will be critical in this regard.More generally, the outlook for Australian agricultural exports to Indonesia is very promising. Over the next three decades Indonesias economic growth is projected to result in a quadrupling in the value of food consumption. The five per cent tariff on Australian live cattle will be eliminated, and a quota will be established for 575,000 head of cattle grown to four per cent annually over five years to 700,000 head of cattle. Northern Australia will be a great beneficiary of this—that is, Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia.Indonesia will progressively eliminate tariffs on a wide range of other products, including frozen beef, sheep meat, dairy, honey, citrus fruit, vegetables, copper, plastic, automotive parts and machinery products. Australian vocational education and training providers will be able to establish ventures in Indonesia with up to 67 per cent Australian ownership. Our world-leading mining service firms will for the first time be able to partner with Indonesian businesses in developing the countrys extensive mineral and energy resources. Under the agreement Australian businesses will also be able to invest up to 67 per cent in Indonesian companies.While much of the focus has been on Indonesia, this bill will strengthen our ties with Hong Kong and Peru. The Hong Kong agreement codifies existing trade arrangements between the two nations, providing greater certainty for Australian business. Hong Kong is Australias leading business base in Asia and serves as a gateway for mainland China and the North Asia region. Peru is a growing market for Australian goods and services exporters, with a GDP comparable to that of Vietnam. It has been one of the fastest-growing economies in the world over the past decade. The Peru agreement will help Australian businesses to deepen engagement with the dynamic markets of Latin America.There is one final, very topical reason for these three agreements to be supported. The trade war between the US and China presents risks to Australia, which, as an export-driven economy, depends on a strong rules based trading order. We must therefore diversify our export markets lest we become a victim of the dispute between the two largest economies in the world. We must do whatever we can to encourage the survival of the multilateral trading system under the auspices of the World Trade Organization. In the meantime, Labor is moving second reading amendments. We will support the legislation before us. Most importantly, Labor will support openness. I thank the House.","Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MADELEINE KING (Brand) ","(12:00):"

51,0,0,0,1,1,"Sharma, Dave, MP",274506,"Wentworth","LP","N/A",4711," Let me thank the member for Brand for her comments in support of the Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill. At a time of growing global economic uncertainty and mounting trade tensions, countries like Australia need to stand up for the principle of free trade and shore up the foundations of the global trading system.Trade and economic growth go hand in hand. Since the end of World War II, it has been the growth in global trade that has driven increased living standards around the world. In 1945, exports were a mere five per cent of total GDP. Today, they are 25 per cent. As the IMF updated in its World Economic Outlook last week, its the slowdown in global trade growth that is very much driving the slowdown in the global economy. Global trade growth is now down to one per cent, its lowest level in seven years, and this is leading, in the IMFs words, to a synchronised slowdown in the growth of the global economy.Countries that have embraced the opportunities of global trade and opened their economies have seen the most dramatic improvement in their fortunes. Chinas embrace of trade and openness from the late 1970s onwards propelled Chinas development and lifted literally hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. But the proposition that links growing trade with rising prosperity is, unfortunately, under threat from protectionist sentiments, from increasing trade tensions and from growing deadlock within the World Trade Organization.Australia has been a huge beneficiary from the liberalisation of the global economy. The ability to trade freely around the world on the basis of transparent and predictable rules has delivered us improved living standards, better jobs, higher wages and greater choice. That is why it is important for Australia to stand up for the global trading system, to stand up for free trade and to play our part to maintain and improve the liberal and open character of the global trading system. On average, Australian businesses that export hire 23 per cent more staff, pay 11 per cent higher wages and have labour productivity 13 per cent higher than non-exporters. That is why trade contributes to our economy, creates more jobs and higher-paying jobs and adds to our capacity to pay for the essential services, health and education that Australians rely on. This governments ambitious trade agenda has already resulted in more Australian businesses exporting—more than 53,000 exporting in 2017-18, which is up 18 per cent since 2013-14—and more jobs, with one in five Australians employed in trade related employment. Its estimated that more than 240,000 trade related jobs have been created in the last five years.Australia has concluded three important free trade agreements since 2018—with Indonesia, with Peru and with Hong Kong. The bills before the House today will amend our legislation to allow ratifications of these agreements, to allow these agreements to enter into force and for Australians to reap the benefits of these agreements. Each of these agreements will open new markets, provide greater opportunities and protections for Australian exporters and Australian investors. They will help protect the Australian economy from growing global economic headwinds by diversifying and growing our export markets.Coverage of exports by free trade agreements in Australia has gone from 26 per cent to 70 per cent over the past six years, and these three agreements will take this further. This governments goal is to ensure that around 90 per cent of Australias trade is covered by FTAs by 2022, including by implementing these agreements signed with Indonesia, Peru and Hong Kong and pursuing strong export agreements with the European Union; the Pacific Alliance, consisting of Mexico, Chile, Peru and Colombia; the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, or the RCEP; and, when theyre ready, the United Kingdom.The agreements with Indonesia, Peru and Hong Kong will also strengthen relations with important partners, and each of these agreements will help buttress the global trading system and underwrite free trade at a time when it is under threat. Our agreement with Indonesia, the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, has the potential to transform our economic relationship and lift it to a level that better reflects the strategic importance of our two countries to one another. Beneficiaries include Australian grain and citrus growers, cattle producers, mining-equipment providers, mining-services providers, vocational education suppliers—all these groups stand to benefit from improved market access.Under IA-CEPA, once implemented, over 99 per cent of Australias goods exports will enter Indonesia duty-free or under preferential arrangements. Key market access gains include: frozen beef and sheepmeat exports, which will have their tariff halved from five per cent to 2.5 per cent upon entering into force and eliminated entirely after five years; removing all remaining tariffs on dairy exports to support Australian dairy producers; and improving market access outcomes on services and investment, which will give Australian businesses increased certainty and confidence in the Indonesian market, including in areas such as vocational education, mining and related services, and tourism.The Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement also lays the foundations for a comprehensive economic partnership with our largest and most significant northern neighbour. It will tackle emerging issues in trade, such as non-tariff barriers, the digital economy, connectivity, competition policy and regulatory transparency. It will improve the business and investment environment, including through modernised investor-state dispute settlement provisions. It will support Indonesias own growth by supporting Indonesian capacity in key areas and by positioning Australia as the supplier of first choice. Indonesia is one of Australias highest priority relationships, and this agreement with Indonesia will help grow our ties in a part of the relationship that has been historically underdone.The agreement with Peru has concluded with one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America over the past decade, an economy comparable in size to Vietnam. It builds on the liberalisation we have already achieved in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP. Our trade with Peru has been growing in the order of 20 per cent annually, and Peru is an increasingly attractive investment destination for Australia. From 10 Australian companies investing in Peru in 2003, there are now over 90 companies in Peru, especially in the mining and mining equipment sectors. The Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement will ultimately eliminate over 99 per cent of tariffs on Australian goods to Peru, expanding on the TPP-11 agreement. It will also include the elimination of tariffs on beef cuts after five years, instant elimination of tariffs on sheepmeat and wheat, instant duty-free access on 7,000 tonnes of dairy products and immediate elimination of duties on all pharmaceutical tariffs. It will also include the recognition of Australian degrees in Peru. I would like here to thank the work of the embassy in Peru and our ambassador at the time, Mr Nicholas McCaffrey, for all he did to help conclude this agreement.Our agreement with Hong Kong, the Australia-Hong Kong Free Trade Agreement, provides a comprehensive and ambitious agreement to govern the trade and investment relationship. Our economic and trading relationship with Hong Kong, one of Asias most advanced economies, is already well established and advanced. This agreement largely codifies existing trade and market access arrangements, providing certainty for investors and exporters into the future. It modernises the treatment regime for foreign investors, making investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms more transparent and more constrained, improving safeguards for governments wishing to adopt legitimate public policy measures in areas such as tobacco control. The modern e-commerce rules governing free data flows across borders are included in the agreement as well as guaranteed access for service supplies into key sectors, including financial services, education, transport, tourism and professional services, and guaranteeing that tariffs will remain bound at zero per cent.This is a good agreement on its merits with Hong Kong, but we must also be mindful of the political situation in Hong Kong, something that we in this House and the government continue to watch closely. It is certainly my view that the maintenance of the one country, two systems formulation which has governed Hong Kong since the handover in 1994, under the basic law, is important, and this agreement helps shore up the status. Weve concluded this agreement with the authorities of Hong Kong, and this agreement helps re-affirm the unique status under the one country, two systems formulation.The Joint Committee on Treaties found that IA-CEPA, the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, and the Australia-Hong Kong FTA represent substantial gains for Australian industry, agriculture and business and, therefore, for the Australian economy. JSCOT recommended that we proceed to rapid ratification of both agreements. I thank fellow members of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, as well as the deputy chair, for their work in enabling our productive deliberations on these issues.I want to touch upon some issues that the member for Brand raised in her comments regarding these agreements. The first is investor-state dispute settlement. These three agreements, with Indonesia, with Hong Kong and with Peru, strengthen our existing ISDS provisions with all three countries. The ISDS provisions in all three agreements allow the government to regulate on issues of national importance, including public health and the environment. Australia has pre-existing ISDS mechanisms in force with all three countries. Those with Peru and Hong Kong will be terminated upon entry into force of these agreements. I note that the trade minister has advised that Australia will now be pursuing termination of the Australia-Indonesia bilateral investment treaty, something the Joint Standing on Treaties recommended, and I welcome that announcement.There are no new waivers of labour market testing under these three agreements. Its important to emphasise that point: there are no new waivers of labour market testing. Nothing in these agreements changes Australias workplace laws, nor do the agreements allow for the exploitation of working holidaymakers. All workers in Australia, whether they are Australian nationals or foreign workers, are treated equally under Australian workplace laws. This is exactly as it should be. Nothing in these agreements allows for foreign workers to work without the necessary licensing or registration or qualifications, and the government will continue to take steps to ensure that working holidaymakers are not exploited and, if required, are qualified for any work they undertake. The government has confirmed that it will not use the provisions of article 12.9 in the Indonesia agreement, or any other provisions in that agreement, to propose, create or extend any additional labour market testing waivers for Indonesian contractual service suppliers.Finally, I go to privatisation. As the member for Brand said, these agreements do not create an obligation to privatise any Australian public services, nor do they restrict any future decision to acquire public assets, and nor do they imperil schemes such as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, or Medicare for that matter.In conclusion, these agreements serve Australian interests. Securing better access to export markets for Australian producers is one of our best forms of protection against global economic headwinds. These free trade agreements do just that, so I commend this enabling legislation to the House.","Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SHARMA (Wentworth) ","(12:29):"
52,0,0,0,1,1,"Chesters, Lisa, MP",249710,"Bendigo","ALP","N/A",4715," I rise to speak in favour of the amendment and strongly urge the government, in relation to these bills before us, to consider whats being asked. Its been at least 30 years since theres been a focus in this country on some free trade agreements. Increasingly in the community, in industry and amongst workers, people are asking: but are they really worth it? We hear a lot of rhetoric about how they create jobs, but wheres the economic analysis to prove that the claims made when striking an agreement, when legislation is passed through this House, have actually been achieved? That is why one of the amendments, which focuses on independent economic modelling, is so critical—before, during and after. Whilst we are still waiting to learn whether the commitments made for the South Korea, Japan and China agreement have been achieved, we dont know the full impact or the cost of free trade agreements. That is where the government has a lot of work to do: to reassure people in our community that the agreements in the legislation before us will actually be good for Australian workers and Australian industry.The single most important objective of trade policy should be to deliver benefits to the Australian economy and the community—to ensure that working people have access to good jobs, secure jobs and the creation of local jobs—yet with all of the rhetoric that we hear that these agreements will do so, have they previously delivered and will they deliver in the future?These are questions that people are asking. In the thirty years since weve liberalised when it comes to free trade, whilst growth has been up, living standards and wages have been flatlining and, in some cases, are going backwards. Free trade agreements have been signed, yet we are losing industry and losing good, secure jobs. We are losing industry, and creating industry in areas which may not economically benefit everybody.As to the agreements we have before us, I would just highlight some of the claims that have been made and ask some questions. There has been a lot of focus on how the agreements will create jobs and secure investment for our farmers. The problem is: were in drought—a severe drought, a drought thats not ending. Do we have the supply to satisfy the new quotas? When it comes to grain, for example, with the grain quotas that have been achieved in all the free trade agreements, will we produce the crop this year, next year or the year after? The supply issue is not just in grain. If we look at sheepmeat, beef or any meat in our red meat sector, again the question has to be asked: what will be the impact of drought on producing the supply to satisfy these great new trade agreements? Theres all this talk about how great the current and previous agreements are, but do we actually have the supply and the capacity to achieve them?Then we ask the question: what are we losing on the other side? Lets talk about dairy. Dairy is a really vexed question, given that we dont know if were even going to have a viable dairy industry going forward, particularly in areas like northern Victoria. Dairy farmers are leaving in droves. This government is confused. The Australian rhetoric is confused. The economy is confused. On the one hand, were saying that these agreements are great and are going to create industry, and then, on the other hand, were saying that the industry is collapsing because of factors not enabling us to secure it locally.Then we could talk about the jobs in these industries and what they will create. They say that in the dairy industry the agreements could create up to 20 jobs—20 jobs—in an industry which is struggling to deal with drought, with a shortage of water, and which has its own recruitment problems. Agricultural jobs tend to be a big focus, yet we hear time and time again from farmers that they cant employ Australians to do the jobs. I guess thats why we need to increase the number of backpackers coming in from Indonesia—to do the jobs. Meat processing, which you would think would be staffed by Australians, is increasingly being staffed by working holidaymakers, backpackers and international students—overseas temporary workers.Were being told that the agreements being put before us are good for jobs. But theyre not Australian jobs. We have to then import the workers to work in these industries. This government has no plan for how to increase employment in these industries for Australians or how theyre going to ensure that Australians get access to these jobs first. Theyve not implemented one of the recommendations that has come from the Migrant Workers Taskforce that was set up to investigate exploitation. All the agricultural industries that, they say, these agreements will benefit are the most exposed and the most at risk of worker exploitation, and people are competing against each other for temporary workers to come in from overseas and work. So when the government rants about how great these agreements are for jobs, I ask again: whose jobs? Which workers and which Australians will benefit?Theres talk as to these agreements about how they are great for vocational education and training. Again, we already have significant numbers of international students coming from these countries, before these agreements have been struck. There are about 10,000 coming from Hong Kong and 9,000 from Indonesia already—international students coming to Australia to study and to work. Also, there is a question mark—you just have to ask any academic—about the quality of our higher education in this country and whether the education that international students are paying for is actually of good quality. Thats a separate review and a separate process thats ongoing.My concern is how theyre treated as workers in this country. There are over 900,000 international students in this country that have work rights and they are an exploited underclass of worker. Report after report has exposed how they are treated in this country. Theyre classed by this government, by many economists and by that broad rhetoric as being a top export industry, but what they really are is an underclass of workers. A UNSW report recently found that a significant number of these workers were paid less than $12 an hour, and 43 per cent of these workers were paid less than $15 an hour, well below the minimum wage. When you start to talk about those kinds of figures—of 900,000 workers in this country being treated that way—you have to ask yourself: is this a good trade industry, when really what youre doing is creating an underclass of workers in this country? Thats why the amendment that Labors put forward that talks about the exploitation of temporary workers is really trying to push the government to sort that issue out. The government is asking Australians to believe in these free trade agreements when its done very little to ensure that workers who come here to work in these industries that will benefit from these agreements, or who come here as an industry themselves in relation to international students, are not being treated properly here in this country and are victims of exploitation.The Peru agreement talks about increased market access to sugar. Its really hard to take the government seriously when it talks about sugar market access when you talk to sugar farmers in Queensland who are still baffled about the sugar code and baffled about the future of their industry and who cite the same problems that other industries have in agriculture: We dont have the workforce, we dont have the water, we dont have the support thats required. Again it talks about how great it is for wine, sheep meat, horticulture and wheat products. Will we have the supply? Will we have the supply to satisfy these agreements? We talk about how great this is for jobs and industry, yet not really having the independent economic analysis to say if we have the industry to sell under these agreements.Then we come to the impact of the growing problem that trade agreements are starting to focus on, like the social aspects and the movement of people when it comes to these trade agreements—the movement of natural persons. We need to start to question: is it really the role of free trade agreements to be looking at the trading and movement of people? There are some concerns that have been raised in relation to who comes in under what visas. Im not going to take the government at its word when it says that there will be no weakening of labour market testing when it comes to these agreements. The report that was put forward by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties said that Australia will waive labour market testing for business visitors, intracorporate transfers and independent executives. My question is: does this include the 400 visa? What safeguards are in place to ensure there is not manipulation of these visas to ensure it doesnt become a back door for big numbers of people to come in? The 400 visa, as some may or may not know, is the visa on which lots of trade assistants have come in to build the solar industry, because apparently we dont have the skills to build solar farms in this country. It has become a bit of a manipulation of this visa, and we are seeing very little effort by the government to close those loopholes down.When it comes to these agreements, our community is concerned. They express their concerns daily. Its the secrecy in which these agreements have been struck that people are raising their concerns about. There have been concerns raised by nurses about the potential for foreign labour workers to come in under contractual services. We need to take this seriously and rule out that these agreements will be used to see more temporary workers come in and work as PSAs, work as nurses, or work in industries where the real issue and barrier is our lack of dealing with skills and lack of dealing with pay. We need to look at what contractual service could mean when it comes to other industries like housekeeping and hospitality. Weve seen report after report exposing how temporary workers who come into this country in these industries are quite often exploited and underpaid. The government needs to rule out that this will occur. This creates, again, further tension.The government also needs to take on board the request for independent economic modelling. We hear a lot of ranting and rhetoric about whats good about free trade agreements, but what are we losing? If you take what happened recently in the manufacturing sector, are we going to ensure that our industries are protected going forward and that we do have growth in industries? Whats this government doing about the non-tariff barriers? If you talk to manufacturers, if you talk to businesses, if you talk to industry, if you talk to workers, they go, The agreements there, but its the non-tariff barriers that are really preventing us from being able to grow our industry. Its the biggest complaint that you get about the China free trade agreement. When you talk to winemakers, they go, It doesnt mean anything for me because I cant actually get my wine off the port. Theres more and more red tape, yet, despite the calls from industry, despite the calls from businesses, theres been very little effort by this government to tackle the non-tariff barriers—the red tape, as its been called.Theres a failure by this government to really implement any decent legislation when it comes to stopping dumping. Dumping is costing us jobs in this country. Theres also a real failure by this government to address, as Ive said, the concerns about worker exploitation under temporary work visa arrangements. All of this feeds into the challenges about why the government is putting all its eggs into this free trade agreement basket and calling them the great nirvana, when really its failing to address the broader concerns and anxieties that Australian workers have. These anxieties are real and something that I hope the government takes on board when considering this. It is not enough just to pass free trade agreements and enter into them. Its what happens every day after.The governments track record on free trade agreements is a lot of talk and a lot of rhetoric but not a lot of delivery. That is why independent economic analysis is so critical. Are they creating the jobs that have been promised? Are they growing the industries that have been promised? Are they actually ensuring that workers who come here in good faith are not being exploited and mistreated? These concerns that are being raised by workers unions and civil society need to be addressed, they need to be considered if we are to have confidence in free trade going forward.Ive always stood in this place and said that we support fair trade, yet fair is increasingly becoming a dirty word in the debate about trade. You can support trade and still believe in fair trade; it isnt one or the other. But, unfortunately, with this government, free trade agreements are the only positive economic narrative they have. Yet Australians are sceptical, and they have a right to be sceptical not just because of the points Ive outlined but because of the points many others have outlined.

53,0,0,0,1,1,"Albanese, Anthony, MP","R36","Grayndler","ALP","N/A",4718," On balance, Labor has decided to support the Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill not because the agreements are perfect but because the agreements are positive on the basis of jobs for Australians and the Australian economy. The fact is that one in five Australians depend upon trade for their work. The fact is that Indonesia isnt even in our top 10 trading nations. We can and we should do better. These agreements, particularly after the safeguards that Labor demanded from the government as a condition of our support have been agreed to in writing by the minister for trade, Simon Birmingham, mean that the overall assessment of the jobs that will be created has to be positive. Therefore, as Ive said before, Labor will not oppose these bills just for oppositions sake. Where the government is prepared to engage and be constructive, we will participate in those processes. That is what the people who sent us to this parliament expect of us. The fact is that we consulted very widely to identify practical, commonsense measures that will ensure that their implementation achieves the goals of creating Australian jobs and opening up opportunities for our exporters, measures that will safeguard Australian jobs and working conditions, measures that will expand opportunities for Australian exporters, including those in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors.Labor will always fight for whats good for the Australian economy, for whats good for jobs and for whats good for Australian workers. Last week, we demanded and have now received these undertakings that we sought from the government. I confirm that we have been successful and the government has guaranteed in writing that, first, Australian jobs will be protected. There will be no new labour market testing waivers, and these agreements will not change Australias workplace laws.Second, the government has agreed that it will not use provisions of article 12.9, or any other provision of the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, to propose, create or extend any additional labour market testing waivers for Indonesian contractual service suppliers.Third, it will, for the first time, bring forward legislation to introduce criminal penalties for the worst forms of worker exploitation.Fourth, new measures will be introduced to ensure that working holidaymakers are not exploited and are appropriately qualified for the work that they undertake.Fifth—and I think this is a critical point—it will seek the termination of the existing 1993 bilateral investment treaty with Indonesia, which includes out-of-date investor protection provisions and does not contain appropriate public interest safeguards. When we were having discussions with interested parties about the nature of these agreements, there was no-one who said that what is in the agreements that are being proposed here is a backward step from the agreements that currently are in place over trade between Australia and Indonesia. This is a step forward. Therefore, the removal of the existing bilateral agreement, which doesnt have the safeguards that we will have going forward, is an important step. To me, that alone signals that when people are saying an agreement is an improvement then its one that, pragmatically, we should support.Sixth, the existing investor-state dispute settlement and other agreements will be updated, where possible, to include modern, stronger safeguards.Seventh, well review the ISDS mechanism in the new agreement as part of the five-year review of that agreement.Eighth—and this is important, as well, because this was of concern in the submission from the Nurses and Midwives Association to the JSCOT inquiry—the agreements do not force the privatisation of any government services and, whats more, they dont provide any restriction whatsoever on any future decision to acquire public assets. So youd have more public ownership, not less. But its not impacted at all by these agreements.Ninth, on the Hong Kong agreement we sought confirmation that we would continue to monitor the situation there, given the internal issues that are taking place, to make sure that Australias strong support for the one country, two systems principle is maintained.Lastly, the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Treaties will conduct an inquiry into all aspects of Australias treaty-making process, with the aim of improving transparency and consultation. That is an important thing going forward, because we are certainly of the view that whilst this legislation is connected up with the treaties that are proposed, its not actually legislation about the treaties. That goes through a cabinet process. Its one on which there is no parliamentary vote. Given that it is in the province of the executive rather than the parliament, its important that there be far greater transparency in these processes up-front so that people can be satisfied that, on balance, any of these agreements are in the interests of Australian jobs. We dont give a blank cheque on these. They should be analysed on the basis of: are they in our national interest to do so?In particular, Labor has a very strong view that the agreements need to demonstrate that nothing in any agreement will undermine Australian working conditions. Nothing in any agreement should ever lead to exploitation of foreign workers, if they participate. Our strong view about labour market testing is that, as our first preference, we want Australians to do jobs which Australians are qualified to do. We make no apology for putting the interests of Australian workers first.Subject to proper protections we will support arrangements that lead to the creation of new jobs, because Labor is the party of jobs. With these agreements reducing barriers to trade, Im convinced that they will be positive overall. Labor, indeed, initiated negotiations for the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement; we did that in 2013, after we commissioned a joint feasibility study with Indonesia earlier on.When we look at Indonesia, it is the worlds third-largest democracy. It is our closest neighbour. It has the largest Islamic population in the world. Youve always got to examine the counterfactual as well, and the counterfactual is this: particularly since Paul Keatings leadership, Labor has recognised the importance of the relationship with our near-neighbour to the north and the importance of friendship between our two peoples. If they were to say, We have this agreement that wont undermine workers rights, that wont lead to foreign workers replacing Australian workers, that wont put any pressure on any other issues that have been raised on privatisation or anything else—if this parliament were to reject that agreement, then I think if you were in Indonesia, in Jakarta, youd be entitled to think, Why is it that Australians want to fly over us to China, to Japan, to Korea, to other countries where we have agreements in place, and ignore Indonesia?Indonesia will grow to be the fourth-largest economy in the world by 2050. It is a democracy. It is one that is growing at more than five per cent. Based on current trends, by 2030 it will have around 135 million people who are consumers. But the economic relationship between Australia and Indonesia currently has the lowest bilateral trade volumes of any pairing in the G20. I find that quite remarkable. The fact is: in 2018 Indonesia accounted for just two per cent of Australias exports, and there has been no increase in recent times.This agreement will facilitate Australian suppliers of technical and vocational education and training to provide services, for example, through majority Australian owned businesses in Indonesia. Theyll be able to establish ventures with up to 67 per cent Australian ownership. Australian universities currently have more than 118 formal agreements with Indonesian universities. Theyll be allowed to open up campuses in Indonesia. If Australia was to receive the same proportion of students from Indonesia as it receives from Malaysia, this would add around 150,000 additional students—which would equate to approximately $11 billion in additional exports for the nation.The agreement also eliminates and reduces tariffs. This figure, I think, is pretty significant: in return for two per cent of Indonesian exports getting tariff-free access to Australia, 25 per cent of Australian exports to Indonesia will not face any tariffs. That includes steel—something that is of particular importance to the Illawarra and other regions around Australia. The agreement provides for guaranteed import permits of 250,000 tonnes of Australian steel per year. If you want to visualise that, that is the equivalent of five Sydney Harbour Bridges. BlueScope, in particular, is set to benefit from this arrangement, opening up the potential for more competitive exports to Indonesia—which translates simply as jobs.In Western Australia, grain will benefit from this agreement. The whole of northern Australia has particular potential to benefit from this agreement as well. It will open up new opportunities for Australian manufacturers of medical devices, cosmetics and skin products and other high-value manufacturing that takes place here. That means jobs for Australians.In Indonesia, on the day that I and our shadow foreign minister met with the foreign minister of Indonesia, President Widodo announced a new capital city—a bit like Canberra—where there is currently nothing at all. Do you know what that means? It means a demand for engineers, demand for steel, demand for architects and demand for legal and service providers—demand which can be met by Australian infrastructure companies. This is an enormous benefit for the Australian economy.Of course, Hong Kong is an important destination as well. Its our fifth-largest source of inwards investment. Given the nature of Hong Kong and given that we have an agreement with China, its important that we also have an agreement with Hong Kong, which is an entry point into China and into North Asia as well.Whilst these are not agreements that we would have negotiated—we would have had up-front a very different attitude towards labour market testing and a range of measures, as we have very publicly said—we have assurances from the government and we do think that, on balance, this is in the interests of Australian jobs and Australian businesses, which is why we will be supporting these agreements. The government entered into discussions in good faith and put responses in writing, and I confirm that it is on the basis of these commitments that Labor will be supporting this legislation. I seek leave to table the letter giving commitments from the minister for trade.Leave granted.","Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALBANESE (Grayndler—Leader of the Opposition) ","(12:58):"
54,0,0,0,1,1,"Marles, Richard, MP","HWQ","Corio","ALP","N/A",4721," I rise to speak in support of the Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019 and the second reading amendment moved by the member for Brand. This legislation is the enabling legislation for the Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru free trade agreements.Australia is a trading nation. Forty-two per cent of Australias nominal GDP is based upon trade. Since the Whitlam government it has been the bipartisan policy of governments, since the early seventies, to pursue trade—and for good reason. We are unlikely to be able to maintain the level of prosperity that we have in our country today, as well as the level of employment, if we are solely based on engaging in that with our domestic economy of 25 million people. To maintain high-quality jobs and the prosperity and the standard of living that we enjoy today, Australia needs to be a part of the global trading system; we need access to markets around the world.When we look at Australias trading landscape, one of the countries which stands out in a glaring way—that our trading relationship is underdone with—is Indonesia. Currently, our two-way trade with Indonesia is $16.8 billion. That compares with Singapore, where our two-way trading relationship is $27.8 billion, and Malaysia at $21.5 billion. But the difference is this: in Singapore, the population is six million people and in Malaysia its 32 million. In Indonesia, the population is 270 million people. It is anticipated that by the middle of this century, as a result of that enormous population and that enormous potential market, Indonesia will become the fourth-largest economy in the world. So if we seek to have trade continue to play the role in our domestic economy that it does today and to use it to build high-quality jobs in this country going forward, then we must be in a trading relationship with Indonesia on a bigger scale than is currently the case.But the Indonesian agreement, and indeed the Hong Kong agreement, also forms part of Australias engagement with Asia. This is a story which has been written by Labor governments going right back to the Chifley government. In the aftermath of the Second World War and Australias focus on the Pacific theatre of that war, it was the Chifley government which understood that out of the ashes of the Second World War in the East Asian time zone would grow an economic powerhouse. But, just as significantly, it was understood that it was absolutely essential that Australia find its security in Asia. This was a sentiment that was reflected in a very famous quote that was made half a century later by another Labor Prime Minister, Paul Keating, who said:… Australia needs to seek its security in Asia rather than from Asia.It was of course the Whitlam government which established diplomatic relations with the Peoples Republic of China and all that that has implied since in terms of our economic relationship with that country. It was the Rudd-Gillard government which gave us the Asian century white paper, published in October 2012, which spoke about the enormous opportunity that the rising middle class in Asia represented for our economy, as well as the strategic significance of East Asia to Australia.But if we look at Indonesia specifically, again, it was the Chifley government which placed Australia at the forefront of supporting Indonesias independence movement. It was Paul Keating who, in December 1995, establish the signature Australia-Indonesia Security Agreement, and it was the Rudd government which invited President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to this place to address the Australian parliament in March 2010. In doing so, he was the first Indonesian president to address the parliament.On that occasion President Yudhoyono referred to the history of our relationship with Indonesia. He said:We are not just neighbours, we are not just friends; we are strategic partners. We are equal stakeholders in a common future with much to gain if we get this relationship right and much to lose if we get it wrong.… … …We in Indonesia will always remember that Australia resolutely stood by us when Indonesia was struggling for our God-given right to independence and statehood. We remember how Prime Minister Chifley, foreign minister Evatt and diplomat Sir Richard Kirby actively supported Indonesia during critical moments of diplomacy in the United Nations—a standard collegiate with that of the Netherlands. That was one of the finest hours of our relationship, and we have had many more high points since.Those comments spoke about how important our relationship is with Indonesia going forward. In that context, it is worth noting that the Indonesian free trade agreement, which will be enabled by the legislation that we are debating today, will be the first free trade agreement that Indonesia enters into with any other nation in the world.Free trade agreements shape economies, and, whilst it is important that we are doing this agreement, its important that the agreement is a good deal. But I would submit that this is a good deal. This will provide a reduction in tariffs for two per cent of Indonesian exports to Australia and an increase of 4,000 places in Australias working holiday visa scheme. Its worth noting that that is in a context of 210,000 people being in Australia today under working holiday arrangements and in a context where the existing cap of 1,000 working holiday places provided to those from Indonesia is not fully subscribed at this moment, so the increase in the number of working holiday visas in Australia as a result of this agreement will be, by any measure, marginal.But, on the Australian side, what the agreement will provide is a reduction in tariffs in respect of 25 per cent of Australian exports to Indonesia—in some cases, a reduction in tariffs from 30 per cent down to zero. In the case of Australian exports of steel we will see the reduction down to zero of a 15 per cent tariff on steel exports to Indonesia. In areas such as mining services and agriculture, commodities such as grains, sugar and cattle, and in the provision of services around education and health care, the Indonesian free trade agreement will provide much better access for Australian exports to Indonesia and, in the process, build our economic relationship with Indonesia and, in the process of that, create jobs and build prosperity in our nation.This agreement is not exactly the agreement that Labor would have made had we been in office. We have sought a number of improvements to it, which are contained in the second reading amendment that has been moved by the member for Brand and that Labor supports—improvements which would see the labour market testing that currently applies in Australias temporary work arrangements apply to any future providers of contractual services to Australia from Indonesia, making sure that working holidaymakers, when they come to this country, are not exploited; making sure that there is the termination of the 1993 bilateral investment treaty which has contained in it an old investor-state dispute settlement clause, which is very wide, and replacing it with the clause which is currently in this agreement, which is more modern.In making that observation Id also make the observation that Labor has a longstanding opposition to investor-state dispute settlement clauses in trade agreements but, given there is this clause in the agreement which is before us today, we have been seeking a commitment from the government that there be a review of that clause after five years. Weve also been seeking an agreement that the Joint Standing Committee on Trade engage in an inquiry on the entire treaty-making process in our nation so that it is more transparent not only to the public but also to this parliament. We want to make sure that there is absolutely no inference whatsoever within the Indonesian free trade agreement that there would be any privatisation of Australian government services, we want to make sure that there is an enforcing of the existing anti-dumping measures within Australia and we also want to make sure that there is an adoption of independent economic modelling and analysis of future free trade agreements.That is whats contained in the second reading amendment, but it was also contained in a letter from the member for Brand, Labors shadow minister for trade, to the minister for trade on 17 October, along with a request that, in respect of the Hong Kong free trade agreement, nothing removed Australias support for the principle of one country, two systems in terms of Hong Kongs relationship and being part of the Peoples Republic of China. There is a response to this letter by the minister for trade on 21 October, which agreed to just about every one of the improvements that were sought in the letter from the member for Brand.In that, it has to be said that this represents a very significant win on behalf of all those, including those within the trade union movement, who have been campaigning for the very best trade agreements that we can have and that Australia can enter into. As the Leader of the Opposition said, it is on the basis of the commitments that have been provided by the minister for trade that Labor is now able to support this legislation today.There are a number of concerns that have been legitimately raised by many people within our community, including the trade union movement, particularly around the exploitation of those in Australia under temporary work visa arrangements. This is a real issue. There is exploitation of people on temporary work arrangements in this country today, and it is a stain on our country that that exploitation occurs. But, in saying that, this has not principally evolved as a result of Australia entering free trade agreements—although it is natural, given clauses that have existed in free trade agreements, that people are anxious about the interaction of free trade agreements with the question of temporary workers in this country. It is an issue which needs dealing with, but it is not principally a function of trade agreements. Indeed, the investment facilitation agreement of the China free trade agreement, which was the subject of much debate in this place, has seen no investor facilitation agreements registered in accordance with ChAFTA since it has come into this place and, accordingly, no temporary workers come into this country as a result of that agreement. As I mentioned earlier, the impact that the Indonesian free trade agreement will have on the number of persons coming to this country on working holiday visas will be marginal. That said, the issue, more generally, is one which needs to be dealt with.There is, by virtue of repealing the 1993 investment agreement with Indonesia, a situation now where the investor-state dispute settlement provision within the Indonesian free trade agreement will be much better. There is no provision in this agreement which will see any inference at all in relation to the privatisation of any government services. It is worth noting that Indonesia is a signatory to the eight core ILO conventions. There is nothing in this agreement that will waive labour market testing, nothing that will undermine the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, nothing that will undermine our antidumping provisions, nothing that will undermine the government regulation of public welfare or the safety of products and nothing that will undermine existing government procurement policies. There is no exemption of any person from Australian law, and there is nothing which undermines Australias skills certification regime.Our place in Asia is absolutely central to our future. Our place as a trading nation is absolutely essential to continued jobs growth and prosperity in this country. For those two reasons—supporting this legislation, which enables the Indonesian free trade agreement, the Hong Kong free trade agreement and the Peru free trade agreement, along with the second reading amendment, which has been moved by the member for Brand—it is absolutely essential to make sure that we continue to trade, that we continue to see jobs growth and that we continue to engage with our region.","Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr MARLES (Corio—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) ","(13:13):"
55,0,0,0,1,1,"Keogh, Matt, MP",249147,"Burt","ALP","N/A",4725," Labor supports trade between Australia and the rest of the world, because its only through trade that jobs are generated, our economic growth is boosted and living standards in our great nation are improved. This legislation before us today seeks to reduce barriers to trade through creating more competitive industries and further benefit customers through lower prices and greater choices. Overall, deeper regional integrations through the agreements implemented through this legislation will generate added trade and output gains in Australias sectors of comparative advantage, in particular agriculture, mining and education. This will mean more jobs and training opportunities for Aussies in or wanting to get into these same industries.We are an export nation. Businesses in Australia that export on average hire 23 per cent more staff and pay 11 per cent higher wages. Trade is good for jobs and growth in our nation at a time where economic growth is the slowest since the global financial crisis, wages are stagnant, almost two million Aussies are looking for more work and living standards are going backwards. These trade agreements are a positive step to getting our economy back on track, and, frankly, under this government, they are about the only thing that is heading that way now. Labor support trade and we will support these agreements. As we encounter an increasingly unstable international trading system and possible limits to the power of the World Trade Organization in resolving trade disputes, Australia must engage in bilateral agreements to support our interests. Its in our nations best interests to diversify the access we have to markets around the world lest our current trading partners make decisions that may affect our ability to trade freely.","Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KEOGH (Burt) ","(13:28):"

Since the GFC, regulatory settings that we are familiar with have left us with the four major banks holding 80 per cent of the market and another 90 authorised deposit institutions fighting over the remainder. While this may be as good as it gets, it doesnt represent true competition. As we saw in TheAustralian last week, despite having higher funding costs and having to hold more capital against each loan than the big four, non-major banks continue to offer lower rates in many cases. This is simply not sustainable in the long run.The desire of these nonmajors to compete does need to be fully unleashed so that we actually have a better banking sector and, ultimately, better outcomes for Australian families. For the sake of mum-and-dad mortgage holders, for instance, small business even, I call upon APRA to take action around capital and funding settings. That will work to level the competitive playing field in the banking sector. On International Credit Union Day last week, the theme was Local Service. Global Reach. Remember these credit unions and mutuals have been around for over 100 years and they, ultimately, are customer owned. We wish the big four well but the smaller ones should be there side by side as well, making sure Australia continues to have one of the highest quality banking sectors.","Banking and Financial Services","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[10]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LAMING (Bowman) ","(13:43):"

I spent a couple of hours there. It is wonderful to see so many people who are concerned about our environment making sure that our used goods dont end up in landfill. I want to talk today also about The Bower Repair and Reuse Centres latest campaign, which is a right-to-repair campaign. We have all found times when we have thrown something out because it was too costly to repair it or could not get it repaired and it has gone into landfill when it probably had years of life left. The right-to-repair campaign asks that manufacturers produce goods that are fixable, ensuring manuals and spare parts are easily available and allowing everyday Australians to make reasonable attempts to repair items without risk of voiding the warranty.A right to repair would also encourage manufacturers to make high-quality, long-lasting goods in the first place rather than products that conveniently die as soon as the warranty expires. The Bower has launched a petition calling on government to act as we move towards a circular economy. I have to say I dont agree with all of the suggestions they put forward as to how we might do that but this is a debate we have to have and it is really important voices like this one be heard, so let me help amplify it today. They are looking at making sure that Australians have access to products that last longer than the warranty, that we produce goods that are fixable.

Building this train station is a priority for the people of northern Mandurah. Many locals have waited over 10 years for this train station to be built. I am proud of the Morrison governments record. We are the only government to have ever committed funding towards the construction of Lakelands, with $37 million on the table. By contrast, the WA Labor government is hopelessly conflicted on this issue. There are some, such as WA Minister Paul Papalia, who have argued that no-one needs Lakelands train station. Minister Papalias argument was knocked on the head on election night. The people of north Mandurah abandoned Labor and voted for the only party with a plan to build the station.On the other side of Labor, there is the member for Mandurah, Minister David Templeman, who says the WA government does support Lakelands but he has failed to deliver any funding thus far. This failure comes despite David Templeman sitting at the WA cabinet table. WA Labor has a problem. Will they finally build the train station north of Mandurah that the people of Lakelands need? The people have made their views very clearly known this weekend with the election of Ahmed Zilani to the north ward of Mandurah. Ahmed has been an outspoken and at times colourful campaigner for the station—I note his hunger strike in support of the train station. Will WA finally listen? I call on David Templeman to take action to help make the Lakelands train station happen.

This is certainly the case for a proposal by Cleanaway to build an energy-from-waste incinerator at Eastern Creek. A similar facility was proposed by Dial A Dump at Eastern Creek just last year, which saw more than 1,000 objections lodged with the New South Wales Independent Planning Commission and, similarly, a New South Wales upper house inquiry into that proposed energy-from-waste facility received nearly 1,000 public submissions against the project and only two in favour. Nothing has changed. It is just a different company now and they are proposing the same old thing: using Western Sydney as a dumping ground. The potential health impacts of such a proposal have not been adequately identified or addressed. It is a huge facility thats proposed to be located within a kilometre of homes, schools and sporting facilities. According to figures obtained by Seven News, 150 trucks will be used every single day to deliver waste to this facility. It will place increasing pressure on the already resource-starved infrastructure of Western Sydney. It is a facility that is not the solution to the waste challenges we face as a country.

Today in The Australian we read that the New South Wales Liberal government is looking to broaden the GST. Its always under the guise of reform, but they let the truth slip. The Liberal Party plan to broaden the GST is to help cut stamp duty for property investment.Broadening the GST is a tax on education. Broadening the GST is a tax on milk, bread, fresh fruit and vegetables. Broadening the GST means you put a tax on baby food and baby formula. Broadening the GST is a tax on Australian farmers—a farmer tax at the worst possible time for this country. It will send the cost of fresh food and vegetables up by two, three, four or five per cent at once. We cannot afford the Liberal Partys plan to increase the GST.Its not just the New South Wales branch of the Liberal Partys plan; its the Prime Ministers own plan. Back in February 2016—remember?—he opened the discussion for the GST increase, saying it was how he wanted to fund income tax cuts. Thats right—he was going to impose a tax to give a tax cut! If you have a tax you get a tax, under the Prime Minister. And Treasurer Frydenberg said that there could be benefits that will come from the GST increase.

Tom was particularly concerned about the quality of Australias aged-care facilities, as this is an issue he has personally witnessed in his community.Today, more than 1.3 million Australians access or use some form of aged care, with that number expected to grow to an estimated 3.5 million Australians by 2050. In light of the disturbing findings from the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, we will continue to improve the aged-care system to protect older Australians. We have invested over $90 billion, to go into the sector over the next four years, to enable senior Australians to remain in their homes for longer, and to support their choices, have their needs better understood and improve their quality of life.In July, the Morrison government introduced new standards for residential aged care to improve transparency for senior Australians and their families, as well as making regulation clearer for providers. This will allow aspects of service provision to be measured in order to contribute to the quality of care for senior Australians. The standards are also used by providers as part of continuous improvement.Tom feels strongly that it is our civil duty to care for older Australians, especially as Australias population continues to age.

Instead, what I got back was a letter outlining past projects—projects that were bipartisan and which have already been built. So it was not a plan for Bendigo at all but what had been done previously, including $45 million for the Calder Highway upgrade and the Ravenswood interchange—a project committed to by Labor when we were last in government. And, if it werent for the state Labor government, we wouldnt have it.There was $5 million towards the Bendigo Airport upgrade stage 1. We asked for stage 2, but theyre still talking about the past. The government has an opportunity in the MYEFO to commit to projects for Bendigo. It could commit to stage 2 of the airport: $5 million to upgrade the terminal. It could commit to funding the necessary Road Trauma Research Hub at La Trobe. It could commit to new projects for our region.

He was actually central to the organisation of that Drought Summit. There were many members from this House present at that summit as well. That summit framed the drought response the government has continued to roll out since that time. Since that time, we have continued to listen very carefully, particularly through the minister for drought, to rural communities across the country to ensure that the response that we are continuing to provide is up to the mark in terms of the needs in rural and regional communities across Australia.I remind the House that that response has three components. The first of those components is to ensure the direct financial support and assistance, as is the responsibility of the Commonwealth under the National Drought Agreement, which was revised and updated after that Drought Summit, which made it very clear that it is the Commonwealths responsibility to look after the income support and other financial assistance to farm households and those communities. Issues such as fodder subsidies and freight subsidies and the direct care of animals and others involved in the welfare of the farms themselves is the responsibility of the states and territories. The reforms weve made to farm household allowance alone mean that, in a period over just over four years, with the announcement we made last week, individual farm households will have received, as couples, $125,000 in direct financial support—not a loan but direct financial support over and above what they are able to earn in terms of off-farm income—and we lifted the threshold to up to $100,000 for off-farm income. That enables them, even with the off-farm income, to access the farm household allowance. There was support for drought affected communities through the Drought Communities Program. So its not just about the farmers and graziers specifically; its also about the communities that are affected. Weve invested in over 120 councils and their shire areas to ensure that were supporting the continuation of growth of their economies during difficult times, and of course weve invested in water resilience. Thats our plan. Were getting on with it.

At the last election, Australians wanted to be able to plan for their future with confidence in what they knew would be uncertain times globally and, at times, domestically, when there would be many pressures on Australia, no less than the drought but also the many other pressures faced by families around the country. So they elected a government that they knew would be able to address those very difficult circumstances with stability, certainty and with measure and would do so in a way that was not afflicted by the policies of crisis but took a stable and calm approach that would enable them to get on and plan for their future with confidence. Thats why we as a government are continuing to do that, maintaining the discipline in our budget management, which is the big reason weve been able to take the absolute fiscal wreckage that was left by the Labor Party and, over the last six years, painstakingly do the work to get expenditure under control and to make the choices necessary to get the budget back into a position to give this country resilience at a time when it needs it. We did that not just to deal with today, as we are doing when it comes to our record funding for hospitals and schools and to funding fully the National Disability Insurance Scheme and all of these programs such as mental health additional support, but also to ensure that for the future, as we move to two per cent of GDP in Defence Force funding as a result of the reforms weve put in place, were providing for the future of the world. There is $100 billion in an infrastructure pipeline, new water infrastructure—21 projects which are around the country today. Some $1.5 billion is being invested in those projects, many of which are underway even today. It is the stable, certain and calm approach that Australians have been looking for.Whether its there or how we are responding to the drought and ensuring, as Ive just said in answer to the Leader of the Opposition, the programs were delivering on the drought and providing that resource and support where its needed, the stability and certainty in our engagement with the countries of our region, our partners and those further afield and our greatest allies, they have seen the stability and certainty in the approach that weve been taking. Theyve understood that Australia is a country that carries its own weight, that engages with its partners to form new trade agreements which not only expand opportunities for Australia but underpin the prosperity of our region.I was pleased to return from the inauguration of the President of Indonesia where these very points were able to be made not just to the President but to those also in attendance.

This bridge is still operating today, although it needs repairs. When it does get those much-needed repairs, there will be interruption to traffic, and, of course, that affects the community. The Liberals and the Nationals, as part of our $100 billion nationwide infrastructure rollout over the next decade, are getting on and replacing the bridge. The local mayor, Anne Young, is absolutely delighted with what she is doing. The member for Mallee and I were there when Councillor Young described replacing the Swan Hill Bridge as a budget winner. A budget winner, indeed! Im sure the Treasurer would have been delighted to hear those words. Councillor Young also said:The Federal Government has already invested heavily in our region, and this bridge funding is the icing on the cake …The bridge has been a long term aspiration of our community, and this funding will help us achieve a new bridge much sooner.Of course, she is right. There has been a lot of funding going into the member for Mallees electorate, because she is a fighter, she is determined and she wants her community to be the best it can be.Whether its the member for Mallees or any other electorate right across this country, they are all benefiting from having a budget going towards surplus. Theyre benefiting towards our delivery of infrastructure across this nation. We have committed funding to thousands of projects across the country, including up to 900 major projects, of which 280 are already completed and some 160 are already under construction. Thats delivery. Of course, we work with the states and territories to make sure that this funding becomes a reality.In the member for Mallees electorate, weve committed $350 million through the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative across six projects, and we will deliver this in full. Weve put funding on the table to make sure that these crucial freight-enhancing projects are possible. The member for Wright knows this, because in his portfolio area he hears every day how important these regional roads are not just for road safety but also for freight supply chains. In Tasmania, weve commenced construction on the Murchison Highway corridor upgrade, with bridge strengthening along the corridor already complete. Labor would never have designed an initiative such as the Roads of Strategic Importance.The member for Mallee asked me about the opposition to this. Im looking at the opposition. It would never have happened under Labor, because they dont care about the regions, and less do they care about infrastructure in the regions and those important roads.

Thats moneys that are hitting right across the country. In addition to that, the tax cuts that were legislated by this government, fought against by the Labor Party, who said these shouldnt happen—in fact, the Labor Party argued at the election that we should be imposing $387 billion of higher taxes on the Australian economy. I dont know what sort of a stimulus package $387 billion of higher taxes constitutes, but that was the prescription that was offered by the shadow Treasurer when he was the shadow finance minister and he was the joint architect with the former shadow Treasurer and the former Leader of the Opposition, who said they thought at this time of great uncertainty in the global economy that adding $387 billion to the tax burden of Australians would be a good idea.We dont share that view. We believe, and we have demonstrated in our budget, that the right way to go about addressing the issues in the global economy and, indeed, in the domestic economy is the stable and considered approach of rolling out our program of reducing the costs of doing business, whether its on removing unnecessary regulation, ensuring that were training people for the skills needs of the future, delivering tax relief to Australians, taking our trade barriers further out to ensure that were dealing with more and more countries in the world and taking our trade agreements coverage from 26 per cent to 70 per cent, and were seeking to go further. So that is the economic plan that we took to the election.The Labor Party would have us engage in the reckless spending policies that they last implemented when the member who asked the question sat at the knee of Wayne Swan and instituted one of the most reckless spending packages, which crashed the budget and took money away from things like pharmaceuticals, defence spending and a whole range of other important priorities because the Labor Party did not know how to manage money. He refers to the Governor of the Reserve Bank, and Im happy to quote the governor when he said, on 1 October:the Australian economy appears to have reached a gentle turning point. The economy has been through a soft patch recently, but we are expecting a return to around trend growth over the next year. There are a number of factors that are supporting this outlook. These include the low level of interest rates, the recent tax cuts, ongoing spending on infrastructure, signs of stabilisation in some established housing markets—So I would encourage members to reflect on those comments.

The meetings of the IMF, G20 and World Bank came at an important time for the global economy, as we are going through a synchronised slowdown, with the IMF downgrading the global forecast to three per cent for 2019. The mood at the meetings was serious but not panicked, as countries the world over are getting used to a world, an economy, with low interest rates, low inflation and relatively low unemployment.But the trade tensions between China and the US hang over the global economy like a dark cloud, and the IMF has estimated that, if those tensions between China and the US are unresolved, they could lead to an up to 0.8 per cent reduction in global growth by 2020. But certainly the comments from both the Americans and Chinese at this meeting were more positive than weve heard before.This meeting reinforced the need for Australia to continue to have considered, disciplined economic management—economic management that sees Australia in its 29th consecutive year of economic growth and with the first balanced budget in 11 years. Balanced budgets and surplus budgets help build the resilience of the Australian economy to external shocks, whenever they may occur.Im asked: are there any alternative approaches? We know that the Labor Party would take a sledgehammer to the Australian economy. We know they proposed $387 billion of higher taxes, which would be hitting Australians from 1 July this year.

When we arrived into government in 2013, we were faced with not just a financial deficit but a deficit in achieving emission reductions and abatement, because they left us with a 700 million tonne deficit versus our 2020 targets. We now know, from the hard work done by this government and by hardworking Australian businesses and industry, that well overachieve on that target by 367 million tonnes. Thats a 1.1 billion tonne turnaround. We havent just turned around their financial deficit; we have turned around their abatement deficit. As we look forward to 2030, weve laid out to the last tonne how were going to achieve our emissions obligations through our $3½ billion Climate Solutions Package. Thats the centrepiece. Well do this while growing the economy. So we have a clear policy that is delivering results.We are receiving endorsements for this policy from unusual quarters and unusual places. The member for Hunter has endorsed our policies. The member for Burt has joined with him. Its not just them. The WA state Labor government has said that the government won the election and has a mandate to follow its policies through. On the weekend, the Australian Workers Union—a place thats generated many of those opposite into this place—endorsed our policies.So, whilst were in lock step with the Australian people and hardworking Australian businesses right across this country, those opposite are for hollow symbolism and empty gestures. We dont yet know what their policies are, but they have followed the Greens to support a climate emergency. The question is: what do they mean by that? The Greens have belled the cat in the Senate, and they have defined a climate emergency. Do you know what it is? No oil, no gas, no coal, no Adani, no Beetaloo and no hope for Australia under those policies. It means terminating literally tens of thousands of jobs. It seems those opposite are taking a leaf out of Extinction Rebellions playbook and are gluing themselves to their old mates in the Greens. Before I call the member for Oxley, I think this is important information for members of the House, following the Leader of the Oppositions last attempted point of order. Im going to make it very clear to the House, just so members understand. Its been the practice of speakers for many decades now to be very liberal when it comes to the practice of interpreting the standing orders with questions. Just so that members are clear, the rules for questions, as the Leader of the Opposition outlined, in standing order 100 include that questions must not be debated, and they also must not contain arguments, inferences, imputations, insults, ironical expressions or hypothetical matter. If the opposition want me to enforce that, I think they will find it very difficult to ask any questions at all.

The member is aware, as I am and as the Prime Minister is, that, amongst the many contentious issues inside the industrial relations system, the system itself is actually full of a range of practical problems that are looking for practical solutions, and, as the member is aware, industrial relations plays a critically important and central role in contributing to the strength of the Australian economy. As the member is also aware, the Morrison government has undertaken to clearly identify ways in which we can increase productivity and make the IR system more efficient and fairer for both employers and employees, the idea being that we need to find ways, where there is a consensus that can be built around policy changes, that would put upward pressure on wages and make businesses stronger and help them to employ more people. In discussing just one of those potential areas for improvement, I might use some words spoken by the former Leader of the Opposition before the last election, when the member for Maribyrnong said:We want to look at the ability for companies to negotiate with unions for extended greenfields agreements, project life, you can go to the global investors who will back it.That is a very, very good idea. Enterprise agreements are a critical part of the system. They allow flexibility and theyre particularly important in the mining and resources sector, particularly in Western Australia and Queensland. In the last parliament, there was a decline in EAs because of the fact that many of them were being invalidated by minor technical issues. Literally it was the case that enterprise agreements were being invalidated if they had a mistaken document stapled to the back of them on submission.

That saves business money and helps business become more efficient.But when we have these big projects, if it is the case, as we have suggested in a recent discussion paper, we can find consensus about how to have enterprise agreements for the life of those projects. These are projects like Woodsides Burrup Hub natural gas project, which will create on average 4,000 jobs a year, every year for decades. These are the projects that are more likely to get across the line from banking feasibility stage to reality if we can provide them with the ability to negotiate an enterprise agreement for the life of the projects.

And, indeed, even if its with local government on projects that we pursue, our job is to ensure that we provide the allocation of the funds, set the priority projects and sit down with the state and territory governments. Those opposite would know—particularly the Leader of the Opposition would know from his time when he served as a minister for infrastructure—that the scheduling of projects is set out together with the states and territories, and the profile for the delivery of those projects is often revised based on the advice provided by the states and territories. That is why the changes in the schedule arrive as they have.Now I make this point, though: under our government, this year, we will spend about $10 billion on infrastructure. That is what is budgeted to be spent in this very financial year all around the country. Now, thats almost double what we inherited from the Labor Party when we came to government. The Leader of the Opposition, who sits at the table now, had committed, from memory—and I would be happy to stand corrected on this figure—around $6 billion.This year, were spending $10 billion or thereabouts, just slightly less than that, and the reason were doing that is because, two budgets ago, we decided to put in place the $75 billion pipeline of projects over 10 years. In the last budget, recognising the difficult situation that were facing in the global economy, we increased that pipeline of investments over the next 10 years to $100 billion. We upped it, because we knew thats what the Australian economy would need, not just now, but over the next 10 years. More important than that, we have the budget discipline to back those sorts of commitments up. So the reason for any change in schedules is not a lack of fiscal capacity or discipline because of this government; any changes to scheduling is in relation to our negotiations with the states and territories.We know that, when those opposite are in government, the reason they cut defence spending, the reason they dont list pharmaceuticals, the reason they have to strike flood levies and all of those sorts of things is that they never know how to manage money. That is why at the last election Australians knew they could trust this government to deliver—because they know they can trust us to manage money.","Infrastructure","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[14]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr MORRISON (Cook—Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service) ","(14:52):"

The Morrison government has a strong record of identifying, investing in and delivering what makes and keeps Australians safe at home and abroad. Its important to provide certainty to our defence industry in order to create jobs, to create those defence industry opportunities and, at the same time, to keep Australians safe. Were very proud that, because of our governments strong economic management, we are now restoring defence spending to two per cent of GDP, reversing the significant decline that the nation experienced under Labor. We will achieve the two per cent of GDP in the 2020-21 period, which is three years before predicted. Of course, this is due to the good economic management of those sitting on this side.Ive been asked about alternative policies. Under Labor, defence was an unacceptable casualty of the inability of those opposite to manage money. In six years, Labor did not commission a single Australian-built ship. There are many new members on this side of the House and on the other side of the House and they may have thought that they misheard me, so I think its worth repeating that, in six years, Labor did not commission a single Australian-built ship. By contrast, the Morrison government will build 57 vessels in Australia, built in Australia by 15,000 Australian workers using Australian steel.In 2012-13 Labor slashed the defence budget by over 10 per cent in real terms, causing defence investment to fall to its lowest level since World War II. Because of Labors panic and crisis, Labor cut $18 billion from the defence budget whilst they were in government. Labors cuts caused Australias defence industry to cut thousands of Australian jobs and, at the same time, place our defence capability at risk.","Defence Industry","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[15]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms PRICE (Durack—Minister for Defence Industry) ","(14:55):"

But, rest assured, were getting on with the job of building a better future, building a better Australia. When it comes to providing funding for projects, there are many, many members who are delighted to get the infrastructure that their electorates need. Certainly, when it comes to regional programs, there is the black spot funding, the tripling of Roads to Recovery and that sort of funding, which is provided to local councils where they can make the decisions at a local level, and that is so important. That is the difference, perhaps, between the Liberals and the Nationals and what we saw over six years under the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years when the member who asked me the question, the opposition leader, the member for Grayndler, was the infrastructure minister. I know he would have been absolutely thrilled to have the sort of infrastructure spend that we have been investing in on this side of the House since we came to government in 2013.And not only are we providing that infrastructure spend but the rubber is actually hitting the road. We are getting on with the job. If there is one thing that those opposite could do when there are projects and programs that they feel are necessary, it is pick the phone up, particularly to their Labor infrastructure ministers at a state level, and ask what they are also doing to work in conjunction with the Commonwealth to make sure that we get these programs and projects delivered. That would be a great start. We have had good support, I have to say, whether its been from Mark Bailey in Queensland or Jacinta Allan in Victoria. They are two Labor ministers prepared to come to the table. I know that the Prime Minister met with Premier Daniel Andrews just last Friday. We want to build infrastructure. We need to build infrastructure. Indeed, were getting on with the job of building infrastructure. The Australian government is spending, as I say, $100 billion over a 10-year pipeline of investment. The 2019-20 budget included $23 billion of new commitments, including $2.6 billion for Queensland, $6.1 billion for New South Wales, more than $6 billion in Victoria, $933 million for Western Australia, $1.8 billion for South Australia, $68 million for Tasmania, $60 million for the Northern Territory and $50 million for the Australian Capital Territory.

201,0,1,0,0,1,"Littleproud, David, MP",265585,"Maranoa","LNP","N/A",4751," I thank the member for Nicholls for his question. He understands that this drought has spread like a cancer—first up in my part of the world, in my electorate, some seven years ago, then into the Northern Territory, now into New South Wales and Victoria, and even into Tasmania and across into South Australia. But our response has been ongoing. This isnt new; this has been ongoing. We continue to support. Tackling drought is like going up a set of stairs: every time it escalates you take another step, and thats what this government does in response to this drought. Weve made sure that weve brought all the stakeholders with us, particularly after the National Drought Summit, to make sure that the commitment of the states and the Commonwealth is agreed, and we continue to have that unanimous and bipartisan approach to it. The states look after animal welfare, freight and fodder; we look after farmer welfare.Our response has been predicated on three core pillars. The first pillar is about the here and now. Were giving our farmers the dignity and respect that they deserve by giving them the farm household allowance—$120,000 in farm support, money in their pockets—giving them the dignity to be able to have household expenses paid for them. Were creating an environment around them with rural financial councillors to help them make decisive decisions about their future, the strategic decisions about their future. Were also giving them the ability to access low-interest loans, saving them tens of thousands of dollars, putting money back into their pockets.The second pillar is about the community. We understand this drought goes beyond the farmgate; it goes into the local economies, so weve empowered local councils to have local solutions, not Canberra solutions, to how we stimulate these local economies. Were getting projects that use local tradies using local materials from the local hardware store. But we also understand the mental health impacts, and were making sure there are targeted mental health programs put into these communities. For the first time, were thinking about the future. Were thinking about preparing for the next drought, taking the next step in terms of drought policy. Thats been done in the past through over $500 million a year in tax concessions to farmers to help them prepare in the good years by putting away their money through farm management deposits—theyre now able to offset that against their term debts—and also by building the infrastructure that stores the fodder to build the resilience. But its also around the future fund—making sure theres a dividend to equip them with the tools to prepare for the next drought through research and development extension work so that they understand what is available for them, the tools they need and the new science and cutting-edge technology being prepared for the next one.The third pillar is around the infrastructure. Were providing them with the water infrastructure to build resilience and to have a longer lag period between droughts. Were harvesting the water when it comes to give them a red-hot crack at getting through the next drought. Our job as a federal government is to put the environment and infrastructure around them. Thats what our three-pillar policy is about. Were standing with them, shoulder to shoulder, saying, It will rain, and, when it does rain, we will be there to protect them in the bad and the good years.","Drought","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[17]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LITTLEPROUD (Maranoa—Minister for Water Resources, Drought, Rural Finance, Natural Disaster and Emergency Management) ","(15:03):"

In addition to her advocacy on that front, prior to coming to this place she worked with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and understood, through her work there, and advocated for the importance of a stable, balanced approach to the economy. One of the reasons why, of course, is that she witnessed, in 2011, the then government unable to fund critical medicines for conditions such as endometriosis and IVF treatment. Fortunately, however, we are in a very different place today, a place where over 2,200 new or amended medicines have been listed under this government, including on the weekend with the announcement that new medicines for cystic fibrosis will be listed. In particular, ORKAMBI will now be extended to children between the ages of two and five—beautiful young children—and for the first time SYMDECO will be made available for children aged from 12 years up and adults.Why is this important? These new medicines are life extending, life improving, life saving and would otherwise cost $250,000 a year. They would be beyond the reach of virtually every Australian family. It is expected that these medicines, which will be available on the PBS from 1 December, will help over 1,400 patients. Instead of $250,000, they will now be available for $6.50 or $40.30.Significantly, weve managed to negotiate immediate compassionate access for free from today. Thats immensely important for these young people—immensely important for children such as Xavier, who I met yesterday. He is five years old. Last night, I received an email from Dr Sonia Marshall. To the best of my knowledge, Ive not previously met Sonia. She said: Dear Greg, what fantastic news you delivered this morning about SYMDECO and ORKAMBI. There are lots of tears of joy in our house this morning. There are no words adequate enough to thank the Australian government for the role they are playing in changing the future for those with cystic fibrosis. My almost 14-year-old daughter has been taking ORKAMBI for 13 months. It has completely changed her life. Its changed our lives beyond recognition. Before ORKAMBI, Evie would spend 13 hours a day doing CF treatments. After ORKAMBI, it takes only 45 minutes a day.That is why a strong budget matters and that is why a strong heart matters, and why a strong PBS is essential.","Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[19]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HUNT (Flinders—Minister for Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Cabinet) ","(15:08):"

This simple statement has always underpinned the economic imperative of expanding international trade for Australian prosperity. We are a relatively small economy, with industries that rely on exports in order to thrive—primary industries like agriculture and mining but also, in recent times, service industries like education and tourism. As a result, its no surprise that one in five Australian jobs rely on trade. Labor has always understood this. Our support of Australian jobs through trade is not a new thing. Indeed, it was a core part of what was called the positive approach—the approach of Labor leaders like John Curtin and Ben Chifley—to shaping the international arrangements that govern our future after the Second World War in the interests of working Australians.Chifley fought for full employment in Australia, and he championed international arrangements that would help in that fight, building international trade and Labor agreements that improved the living standards of Australians and ensured we were able to provide a stronger safety net. Its why Chifley fought some on his own side in politics to champion Australias membership of the IMF, the World Bank and GATT. Its why he fought Robert Menzies to secure Australias ratification of the GATT agreements against the opposition of the conservatives. More than any other international agreement, it was these GATT agreements, ratified by Chifley against the opposition of Menzies, that underpinned Australias economic prosperity in the second half of the 20th century. Chifley understood that Australian trade meant Australian jobs, and the great Labor prime ministers who followed him understood this too. Thats why Whitlam unilaterally reduced tariffs and why the Hawke-Keating government led the foundation of APEC and championed Australian interests through subsequent GATT negotiations via the Cairns Group.Its particularly important that we get this right and we understand this fundamental truth in our trade relationship with Indonesia. Our neighbour and the home of more than 250 million people, Indonesia is the worlds third-largest democracy, one with which we share many strategic interests in a rapidly changing Indo-Pacific region. Economically, Indonesia is forecast to become the fourth-largest economy in the world and will have a consumer class of 135 million people by 2030. As Paul Keating once said, There is no country more important to Australia than Indonesia.Having a strong economic partnership with Indonesia is crucial to Australias future prosperity. Its why we come here in this place. Labor has always understood the importance of Indonesia to Australias future. In 2007, then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd initiated the joint feasibility study with Indonesia to kickstart the process of getting a free trade agreement with Indonesia. In 2013, also when Labor was in government, negotiations for the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, or IA-CEPA, began. This agreement is long overdue. The bilateral investment treaty with Indonesia was agreed back in 1993, under another Labor government. There has been a fair bit of change since then though. In the early nineties, 30 per cent of Indonesias GDP was from agriculture. Now its half that, at 15 per cent. Almost 70 per cent of the Indonesian population are now connected to the internet, and 71 million Indonesians enthusiastically use social media next door. Since the Asian financial crisis, Indonesia has experienced two decades of uninterrupted growth of at least five per cent per annum. Its one of the fastest-growing middle-class populations in the world.This agreement is long overdue, because, despite Indonesias growth over the last 20 years, the economic potential of Australias trade and investment relationship with Indonesia has not been realised. Only two per cent of Australias trade is with Indonesia—our northern neighbour, a future giant of the world economy—and there has been almost no growth in this figure over the last 10 years. Indeed, Indonesia is not even one of our top 10 trading partners. Incredibly, trade volumes between Australia and Indonesia are the lowest of any neighbouring states in the G20. We do more trade with New Zealand, a country of a mere four million people, than we do with our northern neighbour with a population of more than 250 million.We should be frank that a large part of the blame for this situation lies on the Australian side. For too long we have shown too little interest in Indonesia. This is reflected in something as simple as the number of Australians studying Bahasa Indonesia, the language of our northern neighbour. While schools like Williamstown High School in my electorate have fought tooth and nail to retain their Bahasa Indonesia language programs over many years now, the sad reality is that there are fewer Australians studying Bahasa Indonesia today than when Gough Whitlam was our Prime Minister, at a time when Indonesias primacy in both Australias security and economic future was in greater question.Labor supports IA-CEPA because it establishes a foundation for a bilateral partnership that forges Australia and Indonesia as an economic powerhouse in the Indo-Pacific region. This means more jobs in Australia, more opportunities for Australian businesses and more money in the Australian economy, across education, mining, steel and agriculture. This agreement is a gateway for one of Australias largest export industries: education. The agreement guarantees that Australian suppliers of certain technical and vocational education and training can provide services through majority Australian owned businesses in Indonesia. Also, Australian universities, which already have more than 118 formal agreements with Indonesian universities, will be allowed to open campuses in Indonesia. At a time when we talk about the strategic imperative for Australian universities to diversify the sources of their export industries, this agreement is good news. Extraordinarily, in 2018 Australia received more students from Malaysia than from Indonesia, despite Indonesias population being nearly 10 times larger. This is a real opportunity. If Australia were to receive the same proportion of students from Indonesia as Malaysia, this would add around 150,000 additional students, growing the Australian education export market, and equating approximately to an additional $11 billion in exports for the nation.The growth of Indonesias middle class and its increasing industrialisation also provide an opportunity for Australias resources industry. The agreement the legislation before the House implements reduces tariffs and locks in progressive tariff quotas for major exports to Indonesia. Indonesia has not previously made commitments in a trade agreement on mining services of this kind. This is of significant importance to Australia. Under IA-CEPA, Australian companies can own up to 67 per cent of mining companies based in Indonesia—up from 49 per cent. Under this agreement, Indonesia will guarantee import permits for 250,000 tonnes of Australian steel per year, meaning more Australian jobs in the Australian steelworking industry.The Australian grain industry is also facing tough times. It expects wheat exports to be up to 25 per cent lower this year due to drought. IA-CEPA will be crucial in making sure that the Australian grain industry is in a position to recover market share in Indonesia quickly when the industrys prospects improve.All of that is the good news. Thats the opportunity story presented by this agreement, but, as the Leader of the Opposition, the leader of the Labor Party, made clear in his speech to this chamber earlier, all of the details of this agreement are not the details that we would have included if we were the ones sitting opposite negotiating this agreement. Despite all the benefits and the opportunities that I have talked about in relation to this agreement, we need to ensure that IA-CEPA is good news for all Australians. We need to safeguard the interests of Australian workers. This is a significant issue. Since the global financial crisis, unemployment in Australia has risen from around four per cent to around 5.3 per cent. Underemployment has also increased. It went from less than six per cent before the GFC to 8.4 per cent. More than a million Australians are underemployed, wanting to work more but not able to get the opportunity. Thats why Labor has demanded—and the government has agreed to it, in writing—to specific commitments on the implementation of this agreement in order to protect Australian jobs and Australian working conditions.The first is a recommendation made by the members of the JSCOT that the government not use article 12.9 or any other provisions in IA-CEPA to propose, create or extend any additional labour testing waivers for Indonesian contractual service providers. This morning, the government agreed to Labors request on this. It means that any future negotiations with Indonesia will not undermine Australian workplace laws and will include appropriate workplace labour market testing and actual skills assessments, both features being critical to protecting Australian jobs.Second, under the free-movement provisions an increase in working holiday visas is provided for by this agreement, something thats quite good, I should point out. One of the disadvantages of the Australia-Indonesia relationship is the lack of that diaspora community in Australia—people with experience of living in both countries. So increasing the numbers of people, both Australians and Indonesians, who have experience living in the other country is an important priority to the Australia-Indonesia relationship. But its important that this not be used to facilitate the exploitation of temporary foreign migrant workers. Australians are right to be worried given the endemic exploitation of people in Australia working under temporary work visas under this government in recent years. This is a legitimate concern and a real scandal in Australia in recent years.Labor sought and the government agreed that any Indonesian nationals utilising the additional work and holiday visas in IA-CEPA are treated equally under Australian workplace laws and should be licensed and qualified for any work they undertake in our country. Not only that, but they ought to be informed of their rights under Australian workplace laws. One of the great scandals that we have seen in recent times is the securitisation of Australian immigration policy—the relentless focus only on how to keep people out of this country and inadequate attention paid to the experiences of people coming to this country to work. If we had been paying more attention to this settlement process of new arrivals in recent years, perhaps we would have caught the endemic exploitation thats been going on that all members of this House will have heard of in their electorates.Third, IA-CEPA includes modernised and improved investor-state dispute settlement clauses and includes safeguards of public health, environment and prudential regulations, crucially replacing existing provisions providing for investor-state dispute settlement processes of this kind in the existing bilateral agreement. Under these new ISDS clauses, Philip Morris would not have been able to sue the Australian government for its plain-packaging legislation introduced by my predecessor in this House.Unlike the agreements with Hong Kong and Peru, the IA-CEPA did not terminate the existing bilateral investment treaty, the existing arrangement between Australia and Indonesia, despite the JSCOT recommending that Australia pursue termination of the survival clause in this agreement. Labor sought and the government has agreed in writing that it accepts the bipartisan JSCOT recommendation on termination and that the government also review the recent ISDS mechanisms across all recent agreements as part of the scheduled five-year review of IA-CEPA.Labor sought confirmation from the government that there is no inference from IA-CEPA or any other free trade agreements that would require the privatisation of government services nor restrict any future decision to acquire public assets. To maintain public trust, its crucial that any free trade agreements, any agreements of an international nature, impose no external obligations on privatisation of government services, subverting the democratic process in this country. Thats not whats going on here, and I welcome the governments assurance on that front. It is also why the government has agreed to Labors request to implement the JSCOT recommendation that it will consider the use of economic modelling analysis in an overall JSCOT inquiry into all aspects of Australias treaty-making process in relation to trade. Independent modelling and analysis of proposed trade agreements should be undertaken as a matter of course for future trade and economic partnerships. And any member of this House who has served on JSCOT in the past will know that this has been a frequent and ongoing complaint from members of that committee. Improving transparency and public consultation on how the government enters into treaties with foreign countries is crucial for maintaining public trust in our democratic institutions and in free trade more generally. Its important that we make the case for these agreements to the Australian public and bring them along with us.Labor has a long history of supporting and promoting trade between Australia and the rest of the world. Our industries benefit from trade through increased competition. Our consumers benefit through lower prices and greater choice. Our workers benefit through higher pay and more jobs. Australia benefits from trade. It has always been thus. Australian businesses that export, on average, hire 23 per cent more staff, pay 11 per cent higher wages and have labour productivity 13 per cent higher than non-exporters. Australian household incomes are estimated to be an average of around $8,500 higher as a result of opening up new markets through trade. But we do need to ensure that free trade agreements benefit all Australians, and the changes to this agreement, the implementation commitments Labor has sought, deliver this.","Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WATTS (Gellibrand) ","(15:14):"
211,0,0,0,1,1,"Chalmers, Jim, MP",37998,"Rankin","ALP","N/A",4758," I take this opportunity to follow members on this side of the House in support of the Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019 and related bill and the amendment moved by the member for Brand. This is a really important time for the House to consider new trade deals with Indonesia, with Hong Kong and with Peru. Nobody in here needs reminding about the very serious challenges in the global economy, particularly as they relate to trade, with trade tensions between the Chinese and the Americans and trade tensions between the Japanese and the South Koreans. Of course, theres also Brexit, and theres a fairly robust debate going on about the relevance and the rules of the World Trade Organization.Ideally, the region and the world could get together and make high-quality multilateral agreements, to the ultimate benefit of all the economies of the world. Ideally, we could seek common ground for the common good when it comes to trade arrangements, and those arrangements would have as many nations involved as possible. Unfortunately, progress on the multilateral front has been slow in recent times; so we are left with bilateral deals, like the ones we are debating in the parliament today. They are, frankly, better than nothing when it comes to finding new ways and new markets for our goods, and new jobs and opportunities for our people. When economic growth is not exactly thick on the ground in Australia at the moment, we look for and we take the growth where we can get it—because growth means jobs, which means opportunities for people. These agreements, though imperfect—they always are—do give Australia and Australians an opportunity to reach out to some important neighbours, especially Indonesia, to ensure that we are trading more and that we can become mutually more prosperous.As the House is aware, the bills implement the tariff cuts agreed to by the government as part of the Hong Kong agreement, the Indonesia agreement and the Peru agreement. All we in this House are being asked to do is vote on the tariff arrangements rather than the full deals struck between governments. As the Leader of the Opposition outlined in his contribution, we dont debate the deal in this place; we debate and vote on the accompanying tariff reductions—and that is what we are doing.From our point of view, the most strategically and economically important one of the three agreements—not to diminish the others—is obviously the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. It has five core areas: goods, electronic commerce, skills development, investment and services. If you are looking for a summary of the nature of the change to the Indonesian trading arrangements it is that over 99 per cent of Australian goods exports to Indonesia will enter duty free or under significantly improved or preferential arrangements. In particular, the components of the Indonesian agreement around steel, agriculture and technical and vocational education really stand out as the big opportunities for Australia.It is worth acknowledging that, when it comes to agreements like these, they are always on-balance calls. There is always an obligation for us on this side of the House to weigh up all of the pros and cons and come to an on-balance call. After lots of consultation and lots of discussion, we decided to support these deals for four reasons that I want to run through this afternoon.Firstly, we support these deals because bigger markets mean more jobs for our people. We back our workers to do well out of the new opportunities created by the changing nature of these markets and these agreements. We want bigger markets because we want more and better jobs. In a nutshell, thats one of the reasons that we are supporting these deals. There are also big benefits for agriculture, mining and education. As other members have pointed out, a very interesting stat is that, on average, Australian businesses that export hire 23 per cent more staff and pay 11 per cent higher wages, with their labour productivity 13 per cent higher than nonexporters. I think that says something about the businesses which can grasp these opportunities afforded by new deals.One in five Australians are employed in trade related employment. Australian household incomes are something like $8,500 higher, on average, as a result of opening up new markets through trade. Again, as other members on this side have pointed out in their contributions today, Labor is the party of trade. Labor is the party of seeking out and benefiting from new markets. I was very pleased to hear the member for Gellibrand talk about Ben Chifleys contribution in the postwar years—such an important role for an Australian at the time, in being part of the discussions that led to the general agreement, as part of his engagement, really, right across the board when it came to the new postwar institutions of international engagement. We on this side do have a lot to be proud of when it comes to trade.I also wanted to touch on what these bills dont do. I think its easy to make assumptions about debates and agreements like this. Its important to very clearly understand that none of these agreements include provisions that require the privatisation of any public services. None of them include provisions that undermine the PBS. All of them preserve our WTO antidumping rights. None of them include provisions that will limit the right of the Commonwealth to regulate in the interests of public welfare or safe products. The agreements dont require any legislative change with respect to our procurement arrangements. None of them explicitly exempt any category of people from Australian laws and regulations. They do not lower Australias standards to facilitate the entry of foreign workers. And—I think very importantly for our considerations—all three agreements improve on the level of investment protections and public interest safeguards, when you compare them to the older arrangements that they replace. I think those are very important things for the House to remember.We support the agreements because, firstly, bigger markets mean more and better jobs. Secondly, we support them because we want to deepen our relationship with Indonesia—our closest neighbour, a massive country, with massive economic potential, which is set to move from the 16th-biggest economy now to the fourth-biggest in 2050, with about US$1 trillion in GDP, growing at a rate of over five per cent, with 135 million people in the consumer class, the largest growth in customers outside of China and India—and the list goes on and on. The opportunities for us in the Indonesian market are absolutely extraordinary. The obvious conclusion is that we are not serious about engaging with Asia unless we are serious about engaging with Indonesia.It is not acceptable for Indonesia—such a big country, so close to us—to represent only two per cent of Australias trade. As the member for Grayndler, the Leader of the Opposition, pointed out in his contribution, no pair of contiguous countries in the G20 have lower trade volumes than us and Indonesia. That is clearly not acceptable. That is something that was recognised by the Rudd and Gillard governments, which started down this path of the Indonesian agreement. There have been missteps since then, but it is now on track and ready to be supported by this place.The third reason we support these agreements before us in the House is that we did recognise that there were some shortcomings and weve gone to the government and negotiated some good improvements in the deals and the way that theyve been struck. I think its important to acknowledge and recognise that without some of the, frankly, robust engagement with stakeholders, including the labour movement, we wouldnt have had as well informed a view about what to push for when it came to negotiations with the trade minister, Simon Birmingham. He has come back and agreed to the proposals that we have put forward. I think thats a very good thing. There have been changes made when it comes to replacing the older, bilateral investment treaties: issues around the ISDS clauses, issues around labour market testing, issues around privatisation—all of these things that we have raised in good faith have been addressed by the response from the trade minister, and I wanted to acknowledge that. But I also wanted to acknowledge the many conversations that we have had with the labour movement and with other important groups around Australia to make sure that we have come to the best possible decision that we could when it came to these bills before us today.The fourth reason why its important that the House support these bills—I alluded to this at the very beginning—is that these are uncertain times and we do have weak economic growth in this country. When times are uncertain, when Australian economic growth is well below what we expect of it, we need more engagement with the world and with Asia, not less. We want to see more engagement, not less, with our neighbours and with the countries beyond, because in uncertain times, when we need the economy to grow faster, trade negotiations and agreements do give us the potential to address both of those shortcomings.I think its important to acknowledge, or at least to not let pass, some of the language of negative globalism from the Prime Minister in recent weeks. We had the member for Mackellar, I think, try to pretend that the IMF was some far-Left organisation. All of these sorts of things damage our ability to engage with the world. These bills are about engagement with the world, for good economic and strategic reasons. At the same time, we have these dangerous messages from the Prime Minister and down on that side of the House, which compromises our ability to deal with the world on good terms. When the Prime Minister gets up at the Lowy Institute speech, as he did in the last fortnight, and talks about negative globalism and runs down the global institutions which Australia has done so well from, recognising that it is in our national interest to have a voice and to have a say in the conduct of the worlds affairs—to have a prime minister try and diminish that is troubling, I think. Its concerning. Its damaging. We need a prime minister who is not just chasing headlines; we need a prime minister who is chasing good outcomes for Australia. Good outcomes for Australia means engaging, seeking common ground, seeking common good, looking for ways to advance our national interest in the way that these bills do, frankly. He shouldnt be engaging with this far-Right, crazy language about global institutions. Global institutions do serve Australia well, and we should continue to engage with them, as we should continue to engage with the nations of our neighbourhood and beyond.Its true, I think, that weakening global cooperation is now one of the big economic risks that we face as a country and as a region. Its true that Asias growth and potential is making up a bigger proportion of the global economy. But its also true that when cooperation falls down and the impact of that is felt disproportionately, Asia—and Australia within Asia—has a great deal to lose across trade, investment, finance, immigration and regional cooperation. Growth in Asia is very interconnected. When cooperation fails or when countries put up walls, it is susceptible to a lot of damage when that path is followed. That clearly has implications for Australia and for our economy.Finishing up, I would summarise by saying that these deals may not be exactly as we would have struck them had we concluded these deals. We do not necessarily think every sentence in the deals is perfect. But, on balance, I think they are worth supporting. They are good for Australian workers. They are good for our relationship with Indonesia. We have been able to secure key improvements to the text of the agreements. In that light and for those reasons, I support these new agreements and I urge the House to do so as well.","Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr CHALMERS (Rankin) ","(15:29):"
212,0,0,0,1,1,"Leigh, Andrew, MP","BU8","Fenner","ALP","N/A",4762," Selamat sore to those listening to this debate on the Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019 and a related bill. When I was anak kecil I lived in Indonesia for three years. My father, Michael Leigh, was at Syiah Kuala University in Banda Aceh, funded by the Australian government to work in a special training program designed to improve social science research capability throughout Indonesian universities and Islamic institutes. My mother, Barbara, was mostly looking after my brother, Tim, and me, but also began the research into the Indonesian education system that became her PhD thesis and wrote a book on traditional Acehnese textiles, Tangan-Tangan Trampil, or The Hands of Time.Living in Aceh was a pretty extraordinary experience for an Australian boy to have. I attended the local school, where lessons were conducted in Indonesian and, where, in the face of a burgeoning Acehnese independence movement, we spent a large portion of the day singing nationalist songs to remind us all that we were Indonesian first and Acehnese second. The Suharto government was keen on that. We then played in the muddy playground—as the only white kid in the class, I was the only one whose white shirt had turned completely brown by the end of the day. My friend Niko Fahrizal and I would explore the local neighbourhood, playing by the river, watching the bigger kids at the volleyball nets, watching Scooby Doo at Nikos place. Niko is now an officer in the Indonesian military. When my mother, Barbara, visits, he calls her tante—auntie—Barbara.We were following the many Australians who engaged with Indonesia in the immediate decades after independence. They were an extraordinary group of people. Herb Feith, who created Australian Volunteers Abroad, believed that volunteering was symbolic of human equality. I still remember Herbs enthusiasm for Indonesia—the way he would energetically share his ideas with everyone, from President Sukarno down to a little child like me. Herbs subsequent PhD thesis was dedicated to his friend Djaelani, a Jakarta servant who lived in one of the citys many slums. When I speak to young Australians looking to volunteer in South-East Asia, I encourage them to read Jemma Purdeys biography of Herb Feith before they go.But those Indonesia experts didnt believe in just helping our large neighbour after independence. They also believed Australia had to get out our policies right. Jamie Mackie helped draft Control or Colour Bar? and organised street protests against the White Australia policy. My father was among those who marched from Melbourne university, between tight rows of police officers, to campaign to scrap that policy. In the 1980s, thanks in part to the repeal of that policy, Chusnul Mariyah came to live with our family for several years while she wrote her PhD thesis—on the topic of Australian local government corruption, as it happens. My brother, Tim, and I still refer to Chusnul as our Indonesian big sister.The arc that the Indonesian economy has taken over the past two generations is superbly traced out in a recent article by the Australian National Universitys Hal Hill. He noted that, while growth rates have moderated in the post-Suharto era, Indonesia has benefited from sound macroeconomic management, economic openness, inclusive social progress and institutional development. Indonesia still faces significant challenges; my own economics research with Pierre van der Eng on Indonesian inequality shows just one of those challenges. But, for all the challenges it faces, Professor Hill’s major conclusion is one of development success, broadly defined.Yet, when it comes to Australia and Indonesia, weve too often neglected our relationship with what Hal Hill calls Asias third giant. Indonesia is a G20 nation with 10 times Australias population and enormous diversity. It is the largest Muslim nation in the world. Indonesia and Australia have worked together in countless international forums to secure a more prosperous and peaceful region. But, between our two countries, weve got too little economic activity: just two per cent of Australias exports go to Indonesia. There are too few interpersonal connections. We need a relationship based on more than batik, Bali and Bintang.This free trade agreement with Indonesia has been a long time coming. Negotiations began under the Gillard government in 2010, restarted in 2016 and concluded in 2018. The signing process was then derailed for a time, when Prime Minister Morrison suggested that Australia might join Guatemala and the United States as the only two countries in the world placing their embassies in Israel in Jerusalem. We did eventually get there, and its a good thing that we did.This is a bilateral agreement, a preferential trade agreement, and therefore not the best way of achieving trade liberalisation. Multilateral agreements are preferable; next after that, large plurilateral agreements; and then bilateral agreements. Businesses recognise this. According to the latest Australias International Business Survey, just seven per cent of businesses identified such agreements as a key reason for choosing their first overseas market.The strength of the relationship is certainly there on the Indonesian side. You only have to go through some of the stars of Indonesian politics who have spent substantial periods in Australia: Chatib Basri, known as Dede, Indonesias former finance minister; Mari Pangestu, the former trade minister; former Vice-President Boediono; and Marty Natalegawa, the former foreign minister. The first cabinet of President Widodo included Pratikno, who is the Minister of State Secretariat, and Airlangga Hartarto, the Minister of Industry, both of whom had studied in Australia, at Flinders University, Monash University and Melbourne Business School.On the Australian side, too few Australians have a deep understanding of Indonesia. When I was born in 1972 there were more Australian school students studying Bahasa Indonesia than there are today, despite the fact that Australia is much bigger than it was. That costs us in multiple ways. Language isnt just a communication tool; it is also a window into the culture. While Ive forgotten much of the Bahasa I knew as a child, it is something I will use with my three little boys. When were out at a restaurant and someone says their food is too hot, well have a conversation about whether they mean panas, meaning scalding, or pedas, meaning spicy. Sometimes English lacks the right adjective, and Indonesian can step in to fill the void.As Santo Darmosumarto, director of the East Asia and Pacific division of Indonesias foreign ministry, said:For a long time we have looked north; to Japan, Korea and China, and so has Australia, but in both looking north we have missed each other.The recent Asialink report, Match fit: shaping Asia capable leaders, found that at least eight out of 10 large Australian firms are inadequately equipped to do business in Asia. What is vital for Australia is to plug into those services supply chains in Asia where there are significant benefits of this free trade agreement on the goods side. Australian farmers will be able to export half a million tonnes of grain a year into Indonesia tariff-free, which especially matters given that Indonesia is Australias largest wheat export market. The tariff on cattle will be eliminated. The tariff on steel will be reduced from 15 per cent to zero.The real long-term importance will be in assisting Australias businesses to plug into the services supply chains in Asia. Australias vocational education and training providers will be able to establish ventures in Indonesia with up to 67 per cent Australian ownership. Thats vital, given that Indonesias industrial sector will need around 600,000 new skilled workers every year. Australian VET providers will be able to step up to the provision of high-quality in-country programs, including train-the-trainer teaching models and models that combine online education and in-person education. If its to achieve the population-to-care ratios recommended by the World Health Organization, Indonesia needs to train around a million new nurses over coming years. Australian education and healthcare providers could work with Indonesia on that important services export. There are important opportunities in allied health care, social services companies and professional services firms in areas like waste, water and infrastructure.We also know that Indonesia is targeting 23 per cent renewable energy by 2025, up from just 12 per cent currently. Indonesia is working on ensuring greater reliability while moving towards cleaner power supply to reduce both carbon pollution and the direct impacts of poor air quality. In this vein, an ANU Grand Challenges project funded last year, Zero-Carbon Energy for the Asia-Pacific, is going to be an important piece of Australias energy engagement with Indonesia. Among the academics involved in that project are Ken Baldwin and Emma Aisbett, as the joint leads; Chief Operating Officer Karen Warnes; Dr Matthew Stocks; Dr Fiona Beck; Associate Professor Paul Burke; Dr John Pye; and Associate Professor Janet Hunt. They are working on proposals, such as exploring why Indonesia needs climate finance for its energy transition and new opportunities to grow Indonesias solar sector. The engagement with Indonesia on the services trade front will only grow in coming years.In supporting this trade agreement, I am following in a long and distinguished line of Labor members of parliament who have argued the case for Labor as the party of trade liberalisation. Open markets are simply an extension of comparative advantage. Just as most of us dont fix our own cars, cut our own hair or make our own clothes, so too it makes sense for Australia to specialise in what we do best. As a country that constitutes just 0.3 per cent of the worlds population, it naturally makes sense for us to focus on our comparative advantages. And in so doing we dont get beaten by the rest of the world. Trade isnt a zero-sum game, like the Olympics or the Eurovision Song Contest. Trade is an opportunity for us to get the gains from comparative advantage and from specialisation.Within the Labor legacy this was first and most strongly recognised by the Whitlam government, with its 25 per cent tariff cut in 1973. It was then recognised by the Hawke and Keating governments, which significantly reduced Australias tariff levels. Those tariff cuts, brought about through the 1980s and 1990s, delivered almost $4,000 a year into the pockets of the typical Australian household. This meant, in practical terms, that high tariffs, which had been over 100 per cent in the 1970s and which were still around 40 per cent in the early 1990s, were brought down on products such as cars, clothing and shoes.When I wrote a book called Choosing Openness, I calculated the cost of a pair of childrens shoes in 1987 and again in 2017. I found that childrens running shoes had gone from $10 in 1987 to $9 in 2017 and that mens workboots went from $28 to $34. Given that wages had tripled over that period, that meant the amount of time that a typical worker needed to work to buy a pair of childrens shoes had gone from 44 minutes to 13 minutes. And when I looked at cars, I found that the price of a base model Corolla had gone from $12,000 to $20,000 over that 30-year period. That meant that the amount of work required to buy a Corolla had fallen from six months work to three months work.Those changes were progressive; the cuts in tariffs delivered more in proportional terms to low-income households than to high-income households. Thats why, when Australians were asked by the Lowy Institute poll this year whether they believed that free trade is good or bad for their own standard of living, 75 per cent said it was good. It is why there is such a risk to Australia if we follow down the road that too many countries are on towards narrow, tribal nationalism. Labors commitment to free trade has not been an ideological one; it has been a practical commitment, recognising that the benefits of trade flow most strongly to the most vulnerable.I want to commend the shadow minister for trade for the vital work that she has done in ensuring that this agreement backs Australian jobs and that significant concessions were achieved from the government to ensure that this agreement, like past free trade agreements that Australia has supported, is in the interests of the Australian economy, Australian households and Australian jobs.","Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr LEIGH (Fenner) ","(15:44):"
213,0,0,0,1,1,"Khalil, Peter, MP",101351,"Wills","ALP","N/A",4765," Labor supports the Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019 and the related bill to enable the government to enter into the free trade agreements with Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru. Weve heard from many previous speakers that if Labor were in government of course we would have negotiated agreements with these countries that were somewhat different. But, nonetheless, we have tried, valiantly, to work through the processes available to us to try and ensure that a number of Labor principles on free trade are reflected in the agreements going forward and in future negotiations for free trade agreements. Part of that has been obviously the work done by the shadow minister and the minister for trade as well as by the Leader of the Opposition in negotiations with the government to try and reflect some of these important principles.The other part of it of course has been the work of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, of which Im deputy chair. As Deputy Speaker Karen Andrews would know, the important although understated work that committees do in this place is very, very important in making sure that some of our legislation is better than it is in the initial stages of drafting. It is a part of the important process to improve legislation in the national interest. The committee work is actually vitally important. I had that unique perspective of working on the JSCOT, as its called, in the last couple of months on these free trade agreements. Obviously, the public hearings and the submissions that were put to the committee by a whole range of stakeholders and organisations were very important.In summary, I want to acknowledge the chair of the JSCOT, the member for Wentworth, Dave Sharma, for his work and also the secretariat, who did a lot of great work in the last couple of months, in what was a very tight time frame around these free trade agreements given the governments timetable and schedule in wanting to ratify at a certain point in time. The Labor members on the JSCOT, from our perspective, worked very hard to try and ensure that some of those principles were reflected in the committees Report 186.Starting really with one of the main issues that has exercised not just the Labor Party but the labour movement more generally is the issue around labour market testing. The wording in this report reflects the importance of ensuring that any agreement that Australia enters into with Indonesia in the future is made at a treaty level—not a subtreaty level—and that it does not waive labour market testing with respect to contractual service suppliers. I note the Leader of the Oppositions announcement earlier today—that he had negotiated this with the government—was welcome news. Thats very, very important because what it does is give preference to Australian jobs. It makes sure the skills testing and the labour market testing are there to make sure that any temporary foreign workers meet the same standards as Australian workers. That is of critical importance for Australians and for Australian jobs.The other important recommendation I highlight out of the report is recommendation 4, in which the Australian government would pursue the termination of the survival clause in the old bilateral investment treaty between Australia and Indonesia, which effectively means terminating the old ISDS provisions that existed under that agreement signed back in 1992 obviously in favour of far more improved and better ISDS provisions in the current agreement thats been signed. This really goes to reducing Australias potential exposure to claims under the superseded agreement and is very much in line with ensuring that there are safeguards, carve-outs around public policy that will make a huge difference to investors going into Indonesia and also into Australia.It should be noted, too, the achievement of this agreement with one of our largest and closest neighbours is of utmost importance, in my view, given this time of global trade uncertainty. It is important to note, too, that the Labor Party has always been a party of trade on fair terms. Were hopeful that the agreement will lead to a greater number of exports and a closer trading relationship with what is such an important neighbour in Indonesia and an economy that is growing at such a rapid pace.The other important recommendation to note in the report is the recommendation that the Australian government give due consideration to implementing independent economic modelling around these agreements, particularly with respect to having that occur through the Productivity Commission, or an equivalent organisation, and providing that to the JSCOT in future, alongside what is given to the committee with respect to these agreements, and that is the national interest analysis. That is something that has been called for over many parliaments, with respect to ensuring that the trade deals we enter into actually work for Australians, with some evidence based independent economic modelling that can give us some certainty around the benefits and the opportunities that flow out of these agreements.Regarding the point that was raised this morning about the importance of consultation with civil society, particularly the union movement, a number of submissions that came to our committee made the argument that much of civil society, and the union movement in particular, felt that they were shut out of the negotiations with DFAT officials during the course of the preparation of the agreement and the negotiations around elements of the agreement. They made the argument that many other stakeholders, such as business, were given much more time in that process. We had some language in the report that went to resolving that there be further consideration around consultation mechanisms in the context of trade treaties during this 46th Parliament. This actually means much more than that. It means having the committee look at the whole treaty-making process in the 46th Parliament—how we can improve it in order to ensure that we get better results. Part of that is the inclusion of civil society stakeholders, such as the union movement, within the consultation process, just like any other stakeholder. Thats been an important element in the committees work over the last couple of months. Its important that we are able to conduct hearings on this in the 46th Parliament in order to see how we can improve those processes.I want to make a point about the Hong Kong free-trade agreement. We had much discussion and debate about the language on the unique status of Hong Kong that goes into this report. We have signed an agreement with an autonomous entity within what everyone knows is the one country, two systems framework. I note the arguments made by the chair of the JSCOT, the member for Wentworth, and the governments broader argument that the characteristics that make Hong Kong unique under this system are being recognised by the very active signing of a separate agreement with the territory. These, obviously, are the rule of law, freedom of expression and some of the democratic rights that are afforded or have been afforded to residents of Hong Kong under the basic law. There is certainly a strong argument that if we are signing this type of agreement with Hong Kong we are further emphasising and supporting the unique autonomous status that exists. I have made the point though—and Ive made this public—that if the ongoing civil disturbance and political instability in Hong Kong leads to a diminution of those rights, those very unique elements that make Hong Kong the special autonomous territory that it is, then real consideration should be given by government to the ratification timeline, because the very act of ratifying the agreement may, in those circumstances, actually lead to the diminution of those rights. Thats why its so important that the government and the opposition, through the committee as well, have noted the importance of continuing to monitor the situation on the ground in Hong Kong with respect to those unique elements of the autonomous territory, in order to ensure that that can be resolved as peacefully as possible. That is a slight difference in positioning, I guess, between myself and the member for Wentworth, but I think its important to note that for the record.With respect to Indonesia, weve heard many speakers raise what I think are extremely important points. One is the fact that the Indonesian economy is on track to being the fourth-largest economy in the world by 2050, with a consumer class of around 135 million people by 2030—providing a great opportunity for Australias exports into that country. Weve heard time and time again that this trading relationship with one of our closest neighbours, our northern neighbour, right on our doorstep, has been woefully underdone. Currently, Indonesia accounts for only around two per cent of our exports. That is a remarkable statistic given the size of the country thats just to our north. Its currently our 14th-largest trading partner—again, a remarkable statistic given the fact that there are over 240 million Indonesians just to our north.In many respects, this agreement fits into the broader objective that I think we should all share, and that is to improve our relationship with Indonesia. Its certainly a bipartisan objective in the general sense. It has been a relationship which I think has been woefully underdone. Many Australian businesses have kind of leapfrogged Indonesia to go to other parts of Asia. There are different reasons for that. At the public hearings and in submissions there were points raised about how difficult it is to do business in Indonesia—and there were valid reasons given for that. We realised that we had to do much better in enhancing our relationship with Indonesia in order to give Australian businesses and Indonesian businesses a better opportunity for the economic relationship to flourish. This is one step towards that and one that we should all support.Another point to make is that Australia needs to look at diversifying its trade—not have a trading relationship that is limited or narrowly focused on one or two countries but really trying to diversify our economic and commercial trading relationships right across the Asia-Pacific. This free trade agreement with Indonesia is also a step in that diversification objective. This agreement will allow our relationship with Indonesia, an important regional partner, to grow. I support the agreement on that basis, as much as for any of the other reasons that have been enunciated today.As Ive mentioned, the Australian Labor Party believes that our trade agreement processes should be more open and consultative. This is a really important point. I welcome some of the improvements that have been agreed to with respect to the process and, as deputy chair of the JSCOT, I look forward to working on these. The JSCOT is one of the few avenues that allow business, civil society, the union movement, other stakeholders and ordinary people—citizens—to provide input and feedback on Australias treaty-making process. Reviewing and improving this process is of utmost importance, and I welcome the step that were taking.","Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KHALIL (Wills) ","(15:59):"
214,0,0,0,1,1,"Jones, Stephen, MP","A9B","Whitlam","ALP","N/A",4768," The bills before us, the Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, give effect to the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the free trade agreement between Australia, Hong Kong and China, and the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. There are three agreements but, in the contribution that I will make to this debate, I want to focus my comments on the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. I want to express my strong support for the agreement and to set out the reasons why.When I first came to this parliament I was concerned that I personally and Australians in general lacked a deep knowledge and understanding of Indonesia—our nearest neighbour and a significant partner in the region. I set out on my own personal journey to try to close that gap not only by learning the Indonesian language and by working on person-to-person ties but also by looking for opportunities, in my role as a parliamentarian, to establish links and relationships with parliamentarians from Indonesia. My job has been imperfect, but I think standing here and strongly advocating for this agreement is another step in the right direction. Indonesia, as has been said by others in this debate, is Australias largest near-neighbour. Its the seventh-largest economy in the world and has a population of more than 260 million people. Almost by dint of that population—but also because of some proactive decisions being made by the Indonesian government—it will move from the 11th largest economy in the world to the fourth largest economy in the world by 2050.As Paul Keating set out when he was Prime Minister, the relationship between Australia and Indonesia is absolutely critical to both of our nations futures. Defence ties are very, very good. There is regular contact, regular exchange, regular cooperation between the Australian and the Indonesian defence forces, as there is with the other security agencies of both of our countries. From time to time there are bumps in the political relationship, but overall I would rate it as very, very good indeed.One of the areas where we are significantly underdone is in our people-to-people relationship and in our economic relationship. In terms of our bilateral trade relations, our relationship with Indonesia sits at No. 13 in the ranking of trading partners, at around $16.8 billion. If you drill down into that, you can see where the gaps really are. The level of mutual direct foreign investment between the two countries sits just under $22 billion, which sounds like a lot of money but, when you look at the direct foreign investment that we have with other near-neighbours, whether that be New Zealand, Thailand, Malaysia or Singapore, were way off the pace when you look at the importance and the size of our respective economies. We have more bilateral trade with New Zealand, a country of 4.8 million people, and Singapore, a country of 5.6 million people, than we do with the seventh-largest economy in the world. Im not being critical of the fact that we have excellent trading relationships with these countries. They are important. But I am critical—and I think we have a collective responsibility of doing something about this—of the fact that for far too long Australians and Australian businesses have flown over Jakarta to do business in Singapore and in Hong Kong and to do business more latterly in Shanghai and southern China. We have been flying over the opportunities to do business and to strengthen those person-to-person and business-to-business relationships with Indonesia. The direct effect of trade agreements can be overdone, but I think it is true to say that they are a part of a number of steps that governments can take to improve those relationships.Talking about comparisons of our trade relationships, we export more goods and services at the moment to the United Kingdom. If you stand on the tip of Cape York—avoid the crocodiles!—and Ive done this, you can almost, on a good day, see the territories of Indonesia, which are less than 200 kilometres away, yet we export more goods and services to the United Kingdom, which is more than 15,000 kilometres away, than we do to our largest near-neighbour. Much more can and should be done. There are opportunities, and this partnership agreement spells out a pathway to developing those opportunities. Indonesia, for its part, has an ambitious infrastructure investment agenda which will drive demand for steel and other Australian exports, including the construction of an entirely new capital for their country. What an exciting opportunity it is for the Indonesians on the island of Borneo in the province of East Kalimantan to be building a new capital from scratch.Indonesias economy is growing at more than five per cent per year. Indonesia imports, at the moment, enormous quantities of wheat, sugar and cotton from Australia, and wed like the opportunity to be able to expand the exportation in these product lines, but we can do more as well. Its interesting to note that Indonesia imports nearly $3 billion worth of wheat every year but only one-third of that wheat comes from one of the biggest wheat producers in the world, and that is Australia. So much of that is grown in Western Australia, which is so very, very close to the markets of Java and beyond. Demand in Indonesia for Australian services is strong and could be stronger—services such as education, health care and tourism; of course, there wouldnt be many Australians of my age who havent been to Bali several times—but we need to extend it beyond that. Our engineering services sector is just one area of services where we could be expanding our trade opportunities. Its already one of the largest markets for our significant mining technology equipment as well. Again, more can be done in that area.I want to say something about trade agreements at large. It has been the instinctive response of many within the Centre Left of politics in this country to have an opposition to free trade agreements. I understand fully the history to that: protection of jobs in industries that have grown up around tariff protection; provision of good jobs, good incomes, and good security for the workers and their families. That cannot be dismissed lightly. While the benefits of trade and free trade are distributed thinly but widely throughout the country, the impact of reducing tariff protection is felt very deeply and is concentrated in those communities which have been home to manufacturing and manufacturing production. So I do understand the concerns.But the majority of the work, if you like—the majority of reform—occurred in the 1990s. When your level of general tariff is at two per cent and you just consider the weekly and monthly fluctuation of the Australian dollar, youve virtually got no tariff barrier at two per cent. Any trade agreement that Australia has will have much more to do with facilitating access to a market with greater trade barriers than Australia has. Were not giving up very much at all, because were virtually at zero tariffs at the moment. In just about any trade agreement that Australia has at the moment, there is almost more to be gained than there is to be lost. There are some exceptions to that. Before people grab their keyboards and start sending emails, yes, of course there are exceptions to that, but the point remains: when your general tariff is at two per cent and a lot of the other trading partners have tariffs in the eight, nine and 10 per cent ranges, any market access that you can get that enables them to reduce their background tariffs is an advantage to Australians—to Australian producers and to workers in the businesses that are exporting to Indonesia. That is particularly the case for businesses within my electorate. I argue that this is good for the economy and good for the country as a whole. It is strategically important, but its actually economically important for the people that I represent. I want to pick a few sectors. One of Australias most significant steel manufacturers, BlueScope, is centred in Port Kembla and employs approximately 3½ thousand direct employees and an additional 4½ thousand to 5,000 employees indirectly. Most of them live in either my electorate or the electorate of the member for Cunningham. Its incredibly important. They represent approximately 10 per cent of all jobs throughout the Illawarra region and 11 per cent of gross regional product. Twenty-four per cent of the regions total output comes through those factory gates.On this basis, exporting around 700,000 tonnes of steel every year is incredibly important for the Port Kembla steelworks, because when youre making steel, particularly from the blast furnace method, its all about volume. Youve got to pump as much steel through that blast furnace and through the slab caster as you can every day—producing the slabs, rolling it into hot rolled coil and getting it out of the gates to the markets of Australia and the world. More markets mean more throughput, which means you can improve the profitability of that plant and the returns to the profitability of the plant, securing the jobs of the workers.BlueScope also has a fabricating and a processing plant in Indonesia. Hopefully, it will benefit from the massive infrastructure build thats underway there. This agreement will improve the ability of BlueScope to export hot rolled and cold rolled coil into Indonesia. It will be a significant boost to that factory and to the workers within that factory. So it is in the interests of steelworkers and those who represent them in the Illawarra.Its not just Port Kembla, although, as a town thats built around a port—as is the electorate—our livelihoods are built on the back of selling things to other countries and bringing things in and out of that port. We get the importance of trade. The agreement is also important in the area of education services. When I was growing up, the steelworks was the most important institution. I think it now shares that prize with the University of Wollongong. Its a world-class university, one of the best in Australia for its teaching quality, and it will substantially benefit from this agreement—because one of the areas where, again, were underdone economically, is in direct student exchange and in the university area. So there is great potential there as well.Ive got about a minute and a half left in this debate and I wanted to say one final thing on this. When Paul Keating said that we needed to do more as a nation to strengthen our relationship with Indonesia, one of the things he said was that its got to start in the classroom. Weve got to have students learning the Indonesian language and learning about Indonesian culture. It is a matter of great shame that there were more students learning Indonesian in the 1990s than there are today. If you look at the percentages for all year 12 students who are enrolled in a tertiary recognised language in Australia, there are 20 per cent doing Japanese, another 21 per cent doing French, seven per cent doing German, 19 per cent doing Chinese and nine per cent doing Italian. Do you know what percentage are doing Indonesian? Four per cent. Four per cent. Weve actually gone backwards. So, if were going to do something about the business relationships and something about the people-to-people-relationships, we need more people studying the language of Indonesia, Bahasa Indonesia, and it has to start in the classroom.I commend the bill to the House.","Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr STEPHEN JONES (Whitlam) ","(16:13):"
215,0,0,0,1,1,"Bandt, Adam, MP","M3C","Melbourne","AG","N/A",4771," These agreements give more rights to big corporations than to governments and to workers, and they should be opposed. These agreements are being negotiated by big corporations and their shills in the Liberal government, and it is appalling that now, when this wasnt even on the Notice Paper for today, Labor and the Liberals have done a dirty deal to rush this legislation through the parliament, over the very strong and legitimate objections of working people and non-government organisations right across Australia.These deals are not simply about trade. If they were simply about trade, theyd probably be unobjectionable. And theres nothing wrong with having an agreement with Indonesia or Peru or Hong Kong—although Ill come back to Hong Kong in a moment—or any other country in principle. Its not about saying you cant strike a deal. The question is: whats in it? The question is: is the government, at the behest of big corporations, signing away rights that most people in Australia think are part and parcel of a democracy? When you look at this deal, the answer is yes.It is no answer for Labor to come in here and say, We just negotiated a side deal with the government. This is the very same government theyve told us in the last few weeks we cant trust because theyre loose with the truth. Now apparently we have to just accept that its all going to be okay because there is a side letter from the minister that promises to fix the problems. Well, no. What this dodgy side letter from the minister boils down to is that all the existing loopholes will continue to apply. The big win that has been negotiated out of this is that the existing loopholes wont be expanded. Well, whoop-de-doo. At the moment, the problem is that there are holes in these agreements that are big enough to fly plane loads of exploited overseas workers through. That is bad for the overseas workers because they end up here being exploited, working with the threat of expulsion from the country always over their head, and that allows them to be put through conditions most of us would find objectionable. Its also bad because it means local wages and conditions get pushed down. That is why unions who have looked at this deal have said, Hang on, theres something wrong here.The problem with the way these agreements are negotiated is that you dont get to see the text before its put on the table and you have to either take it or leave it. The problem with these agreements is that even when the text is put on the table theres no independent analysis done. Alarm bells should be ringing for the government when the Productivity Commission and the Greens start agreeing about the need for cost-benefit analysis, but that is where we are at with these agreements because the governments come in here with all sorts of promises about how great these agreements are and the Productivity Commission is the first in line to stand up and say, Well, actually, if thats right, then test it. Do some analysis and test it. Put forward a case to parliament before each of us is asked to vote on it, as Labor and Liberal are asking us to do in this rush deal here today. Put up some economic analysis that shows that there might be some benefit—but theres none.We saw this with the ChAFTA agreement, when the minister at the time told us: Its all right. Its all going to be fine because there will be hundreds of jobs—600 or 700 jobs in the dairy industry in the first year alone. Thats what the minister said about ChAFTA. Well, no. Jobs in that industry have gone backwards. Even the spurious claims they make about previous agreements show you cant believe the spin. Thats why theyre not prepared to front up here with some kind of independent analysis about how great these deals are meant to be. The fact that they cant come in here with any analysis tells you everything you need to know. If you dont believe the Greens, listen to the Productivity Commission about it.The Liberals come in here and say: Weve got this great deal that weve negotiated on behalf of our corporate masters, and Im sorry it is going to mean a few diminutions of your labour standards, workers; youll just have to cop that. Sorry there are no enforceable labour chapters or environment chapters in this; youre just going to have to cop that. You expect that from the Liberals. I say to Labor: stop caving in to the government. Lets stand up to this government and the dodgy deals that it does. The sooner we do that, and the sooner an alternative is presented, the sooner theyll be out of office. At the moment theyve only got a one-seat majority in this place. Who knows whats going to happen and how many by-elections there will be; there are always by-elections during the course of a parliament. We could have this government out soon. But if you keep agreeing with them and giving them everything they want, then theyll just get emboldened.To go to some of the specifics about this, theres the local advertising of jobs. One would think its an unobjectionable principle to say that where there are jobs going here in Australia, we will advertise locally first. If we cant find someone locally then of course we can look overseas, because theres nothing in principle wrong with saying there might be skills gaps in Australia or that we want to have greater international cooperation, so well have a system that says people can come from other countries and work here. But the question is: what is in the agreement? You would think there would be something that says that you have to advertise locally first, but we know theres not, because we know there are whole carve-outs in this that say there can be new categories of people who dont have to go through that process.When we look at the text with respect to other labour matters, there are some real questions about qualifications and standards. For example, most people would think, if you have Australian rules and restrictions around someone who is an electrician, that anyone who is going to work in this country has been through an actual testing process to know they can comply with those standards. What happens under these agreements, though, is that someone from another country—a sponsor; a big corporation—puts in application and says, Its okay; I vouch that so-and-so has the appropriate standards. Do they have to go through a separate testing process? No. Does it have to be checked? Do they get assessed that they know how Australian electrical standards work? No. Someone sitting behind a desk does a paper check and, bang, they can come through.","Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BANDT (Melbourne) ","(16:28):"

218,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation","M3C","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr BANDT: We have heard interjections that this is rubbish. Obviously no-one has sat down and actually looked at some of the cases of systematic exploitation that have been unearthed by the use of contractual service suppliers or people on section 400 agreements. We see, time and again, people being put in the most exploitative conditions to build our buildings, service our industries and do work under these agreements, because, once someone comes here, they are under the thumb of the employer who says, If you dont accept these lower wages and conditions, Ill revoke your permission on the visa and you are on the next plane back. That is what allows for exploitation, which has been uncovered time and again.We also have clauses in here that allow corporations to sue governments if those governments dare to do something in the interests of their own people which somehow impinges on the profitability of those corporations. Peru is one of the countries being talked about. A company took Peru to court—it is not even a court; they are these secret tribunals where you dont have to have judicial qualifications. It is why the former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia has said, Hey, watch out; Australia is trading away its judicial sovereignty to these secret tribunals as part of these so-called ISDS clauses. You allow two or three people sitting in a room, a secret panel, to decide whether or not a corporation can sue the Australian government. When I say sue, its not just for money; they can actually require that we change the laws. Peru got sued through one of these tribunals, because it deigned to pass laws that benefited its Indigenous population. A French company sued the Egyptian government because that government passed laws with respect to lifting the minimum wage. That is why people do not like these.Lets get to the specifics of some of these. We know there is a problem, because the Labor Party have identified that there is a problem, but theyve wriggled out of it and said, Its okay; well sign up to the one the Liberals have negotiated. As I read the agreements, to give an example of this, previously governments have been taken to court when they tried to restrict tobacco by plain-packaging laws. In the Hong Kong agreement, as I understand it, there is mention of tobacco; in the Peru agreement there is mention of tobacco—but not in the Indonesian agreement. Why is there no mention of tobacco in the Indonesian agreement? Id be happily told that Im wrong. Why are there specific mentions in the other agreements and not the Indonesian one? Is it just coincidence that that happens to be a country where the tobacco industry has a significant stake? Are we opening the door to more litigation against Australia on the tobacco front? You can sure as hell bet we are on the aged-care front and in a bunch of other service industries. Where we in this parliament think we are democratically elected to pass laws, we will find we no longer have the capacity to legislate, because someone will come along and say, Hang on, you cant pass that, because that might affect the profitability of corporation X over here; were going to wind it back.The situation in Hong Kong is especially concerning if you are concerned about democracy. What we have seen recently in Hong Kong is continued brutal repression of democracy activists and leaders. One of the things that those democracy leaders have asked us is to defer any agreements that apply to Hong Kong until the situation there is resolved. We have had members of the Liberal Party, of the government in this place, get themselves photographed with the Hong Kong demonstrators to say, Yes, we stand with you in support of democracy. Well, those very same activists are saying, Please do not give legitimacy to the other side by proceeding with a deal at a very time when we are being attacked and our lives are under threat. That is a very sensible call that no-one should be able to refuse. So when we come to the consideration in detail stage we will be moving an amendment to delay, should, as I expect, Labor go over and sit with the government to support something their corporate masters have negotiated.If the bills are going to go ahead, then, at the least, we should do three things. First, we should not proceed with the agreement with Hong Kong until the situation there is resolved; we are proposing at least a years breathing space. Second, we should not allow this legislation that is being debated here to give corporations the right to sue our government and get us to change our laws just because our government does something that is for the benefit of the Australian people. We have the capacity to pass amendments to say, No, these deals dont come into effect until you go back and negotiate something better.As I said before, we are presented with a take it or leave it, which means we cant get into the specifics of any individual agreement and take this bit out or that bit out. In that context, thats why we are going to oppose them. But if the parliament is going to approve them, then enough of this, Oh, well do something different if we are in government from the opposition. No; weve got the capacity to put changes through now and to say to the government: If you are so desperate to pass this deal, go back and negotiate something that the parliament wants. If this deal has to be done, if its really that desperate, go back and negotiate something that takes out those provisions that allow corporations to sue government and to get us to change our laws. Also, go and do something else. Again, we dont need to have, If only wed had a change of government at the election; we can fix this here and now. We can say, Go back and renegotiate the agreements to make it explicit that you advertise locally first.To all those people who are loudly yapping away from the government backbenches, who have never even read the text of the agreement, saying, Its okay, its all rubbish; you can be assured of our protections: if we can be assured of the protections, then you wont have any problem with supporting an amendment that says that we are going to renegotiate some side deals that make it crystal clear that you will advertise locally first. What would be the objection to that?","Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[11]","N/A","N/A"

223,0,0,0,1,1,"Claydon, Sharon, MP",248181,"Newcastle","ALP","N/A",4775," Im very pleased to rise in support of Labors amendment and to make a contribution to the debate this evening on the Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019 and the conjoined bill, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019. Importantly, these bills give effect to the governments proposed trade agreements with Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru. In principle, Labor supports free trade. Indeed, we have a long history of doing so.For a cautionary tale of how important free trade is, you need only look at the chaos and upheaval weve seen in recent months as a result of the current US-China trade wars. Reducing trade barriers opens up new markets, creates more competitive industries and delivers lower prices and greater choice for Australian consumers, but this should never come at the expense of protecting local jobs and the working conditions of Australian men and women—working conditions that have been hard-fought for and long secured in this nation by the collective actions of our union movement.When we first saw what was being proposed by the government, Labor had a number of serious concerns. Firstly, we were profoundly worried that there was the potential for labour market testing to be waived for contract service suppliers in the future. Labour market testing is an absolutely fundamental protection for local workers. It ensures that, wherever possible, Australian jobs go to Australians. Of course, we have always understood that, where there are genuine skill shortages and a genuine incapacity to fill those positions with Australian workers, then opportunities and pathways are opened up to suitably trained and qualified people migrating to Australia or visiting on relevant visas to undertake that work. That has never been an issue. The point for Australian Labor members has been whether or not genuine market testing has been taking place in this country beforehand. We have seen numerous examples of where that process has not been treated with the due respect that it should be given, by corporations and local businesses in Australia. As I said, labour market testing remains a fundamental protection for local workers and one that the Australian Labor Party is especially focused on.But we were also worried that, unless the existing bilateral treaty with Indonesia was terminated, we would be left with the current antiquated ISDS provisions—and that those antiquated provisions would have remained in force. And that was not in anyones interest. Those outdated investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms are a direct attack on our national sovereignty. They provide a framework for multinational corporations to sue countries for implementing legislation that affects their profits. Lets not forget the attack that Philip Morris made on the Australian government for having the audacity to put the health of our citizens at the top of our priorities and to push for what were world-leading, ground-breaking laws at the time, that demanded the plain packaging of tobacco products in Australia. So there are very good reasons for Australia to be concerned about outdated ISDS mechanisms.Indeed, it must be said that, if Labor were in government, these are not the agreements that we would have negotiated, but this is the reality that we are dealing with. We have two bills before us—and, as I said, Labor has already raised a number of concerns, many of which the government has made agreements on, and I will come back to those matters in a moment. But it is clearly unconscionable for us to have those outdated ISDS mechanisms remain in situ, in any agreement, because of the implications they have for our national sovereignty.Labor wanted to ensure that the new trade agreement with Indonesia would include modern safeguards, as well as a review of these new ISDS operations after a five-year period. In order to address these matters, Labors shadow minister for trade, the member for Brand, Madeleine King, wrote to the trade minister, outlining Labors concerns. These include the issues Ive just outlined, as well as protections for working holiday-makers and confirmation that nothing in the agreements would require the privatisation of government services, among other things. Im very pleased that the government has agreed to all of these requests and I would like to congratulate the shadow minister for standing strong and achieving such a great outcome.Importantly, the government has also agreed to an inquiry into the treaty-making process, to look at how we can improve transparency and increase consultation for further agreements. This is a critical issue for the Australian people. We need to lift the veil of secrecy on trade arrangements being made behind closed doors so that there is confidence always in the processes of government. Anything we can do to improve transparency and increase consultation for further trade agreements is absolutely worth prosecuting, and Im glad that the government has agreed to at least having an inquiry into the mechanisms and pathways that we could take in order for this to improve, as I said, the transparency and the consultation process of future trade agreements.I would also like to thank the trade minister for working collaboratively with Labor to achieve a better outcome and a better deal, importantly, for Australian workers. That being said, there are still fundamental issues that we have with the way in which these agreements are negotiated. Given the far-reaching impacts that they have across our economy and, indeed, our workforce, the impacts of a bad deal are very dire indeed. I have met with many of my workers in Newcastle and their representative unions over the last few weeks and months and, more recently, last Friday back in Newcastle. Theyve expressed serious concerns because there is a lack of trust in whether the government is going to put the working rights and conditions of Australian men and women at the forefront of their thoughts. There is a long history to suggest that the rights of working men and women in Australia havent always been front and centre of conservative governments minds.It must be said that, for a lot of Australians, their experience of a free trade agreement hasnt always been positive. I think we need to recognise that. We know that the benefits of these agreements have not been equally distributed throughout the community. There needs to be careful attention paid by the government, irrespective of whos in power, as to how you remedy those kinds of inequities that can occur as a result of free trade agreements. To this end, it is very disappointing that the government continues to reject Labors request for mandatory independent economic modelling be done for these and future trade agreements because, without this modelling, how can we possibly know whether these deals are good for our country and our communities? There is little data, certainly little independent economic data, which we can turn to that would give greater confidence to Australian working men and women and their families that these agreements will, in fact, deliver some benefit to them and to their neighbouring communities. Labor will continue to prosecute the case for better transparency, for greater analysis and oversight of all trade agreements to make sure that they are always in Australias best interests and in the interests of business, workers and consumers alike.I would like to end with a very serious issue that was raised with me by the ETU in Newcastle last Friday with regards to the increased prevalence of unlicensed electricians working on projects across multiple jurisdictions, across all states and territories in Australia. This is not an issue that is directly relevant to the free trade agreements before us, except to say that there is a significant level of anxiety about the apparent incapacity for state and territory governments to enforce existing state and territory laws that would ensure that all workers, whether they be Australian workers, migrant workers or holiday-makers, are suitably trained and qualified to conduct work in Australia according to Australian standards and laws. As I said, this is an especially critical issue for electrical workers in Australia.This is certainly an issue that Labor will continue to prosecute, because Australians have every right to expect that the people wiring our schools, our homes and our businesses, for example, would be fully trained and qualified electricians according to Australian standards. If that is not the case, it is a shameful state of affairs. But, lets be clear: that is not the result of free trade agreements; it is the result of the current incapacity of state and territory governments to enforce the existing laws that we have.We should all be shouting very loudly at every opportunity to insist that these laws be enforced, that there are—to borrow an expression from the government that is often used—an adequate number of cops on the beat in our Australian workplaces to ensure that Australian standards are being complied with. It is all very well for government members to be outraged by union activity on worksites, but why dont they insist on inspecting the quality of work being done onsite to ensure that workers have been adequately trained and supported on site and that there is no lessening of standards at any point, especially critical industries like electrical trades.Labor will always stand up for the rights of Australian working men and women. We will continue to hold the government to account for the concessions that the government has given on these free trade agreements. I note that the member for Brand, the shadow minister, has been in the chamber throughout this debate, and I welcome her presence and her earlier contribution. As I said before, Labor is absolutely adamant that Australian workers receive the due respect and protections that they deserve; that we should have a stronger focus on the labour-market testing laws in Australia and ensure that they are the most rigorous they can be; and that Australian men and women are always given the priority they deserve in the workforce.","Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CLAYDON (Newcastle) ","(16:43):"

They started off the first industry to be deregulated. The first industry to be deregulated was the wool industry. The wool industry was bigger than coal. It was $6,000 million, and coal is about $5,800 million. Keating comprehensively destroyed the wool industry by deregulation. Our forefathers fought—and every time I leave this parliamentary chamber, youll watch me hold up my fist in salute to the first member for Kennedy, the Labor member who held the seat for 25 years. He fought like a tiger to secure arbitration—decent pay and conditions for us. The farmers deserve decent pay and conditions as well. The Country Party, God bless them, got arbitration for the farmers. So every single farming industry, with the exception of cattle, had arbitration, for the sake of a better word.Mr Keating, coming from the party that fathered arbitration in this place, came in here, and the first thing he did was deregulate the greatest source of income that this nation has had in its entire history. Every single year for over 100 years, the economy of Australia depended upon the wool industry, and he destroyed it. Within three years the wool industry was one-third the income it was before that man deregulated and destroyed it. He took on the farmers first, but, believe me, if hed stayed around, hed have taken on the workers too, because this man was driven by ideology. We have a saying in the bush: when your neighbour starts preaching religion, reach for your branding iron. I find it to be very true. When we talk about ideology, I start getting twitchy.Ive referred to the figures for wool—62 per cent of the sheep herd has gone, never to return. It was destroyed by deregulation. Ive referred to fruit and vegetables—were importing more than twice as much fruit and vegetables into Australia as we are exporting. I have referred to the pork industry. I have referred to the fishing industry. But exactly what food products do we export positively? Cattle is the only thing left, and—heaven only knows—the Labor government did a fair job of destroying the cattle industry with their ban on live cattle exports. Cattle is down from 32 million to 23 million. Dairy production is down 19 per cent. Sugar is down from 5.4 million tonnes to 4.7 million tonnes. And sheep are down 62 per cent.Lets turn to manufacturing. The motor vehicle industry has gone completely. The petrol industry has gone completely—or near enough to completely. The whitegoods industry has gone almost completely. The textile, footwear and clothing industry has been decimated. This country is not a mining country. Everyone says, All weve got left is mining. No, you dont have mining; you have quarrying. Mining is when you dig it out of the ground and sell a metal. We dont dig it out of the ground and sell a metal; we dig it out of the ground and sell the ground. Thats called quarrying—thats iron ore and coal. More than half of this nations income now comes from two quarries—the iron ore and the coal quarry. There are a lot of people in this place who believe the coal industry should be closed down. Thats a good idea! Wed have no income at all.Weve still got a few to go. We gave the gas industry away. The brilliant leadership in this place sold all of our gas for 6c a unit. For those of you in the Labor Party, I got that by going to the convention of the ACTU. They had it up, covering the whole front of the dais. We sold the gas for 6c. Then, Labor governments were up to their eyeballs in it, and the ACTU is pulling no punches on it. We sold it for 6c. We now buy it back for $16. How can we stay internationally competitive in areas like fertiliser—I represent the biggest fertiliser plant in Australia, bringing in $2,000 million a year to the Australian economy—when were paying $16 a unit for gas and our competitors are paying between $6 and $7 a unit for gas?The steel industry has said, If you keep going with your present free-market electricity, therell be no steel industry in Australia. Half of it has already gone. Theres been absolutely no effort made to stop the super-cheap steel coming in from China. Aluminium is concealed electricity, and since Australia has the highest electricity charges in the world—theres an advertisement on the television every night stating that, and, from the figures Ive seen, thats most certainly correct.Let me turn to agriculture. I got vilified by the rural action council of Mareeba, maybe the best fighting group this nation has ever seen in the area of agriculture, because John Anderson, the leader of the National Party, of which I was a member at the time, had said, We dont need 240,000 farmers. He was being criticised because people were exiting the industry all the time. He said: We dont need 240,000 farmers. We only need 120,000. And Ill quote the boys at the rural action council up there in Far North Queensland—in, I might add, the electorate of Ted Theodore, the greatest man that ever walked into this place, with the possible exception of Jack McEwen; Red Ted Theodore was Clyde Packers closest personal friend, I might add, as well as the leader of the Labor Party in Australia—who said, If we dont need 240,000, whats he advocating? That we lose 120,000 farmers? Well, we have! When he made that statement, we had 240,000 farmers. Now weve got 120,000. And its thanks to his free trade policies.Today we have listened to a member from Newcastle talking about making sure our wages are protected. We are going one-on-one against the biggest, or soon-to-be the biggest, coal producing nation on earth, Indonesia—we are going one-on-one against it. And were going to pay the same wages, are we? We were enjoying $200,000 a year for our miners. Heaven only knows, theyre in industries that are extremely dangerous. They work in extremely adverse conditions. And, thanks to the weak-kneed Labor governments of Queensland and Western Australia that allowed fly-ins, they dont see their families and theyve got to live away from home for most of their lives, thanks to the weak-kneed Labor governments in Western Australia and in Queensland. The Liberal Party of Western Australia banned fly-ins. Under my own party, under the much-maligned Bjelke-Petersen, fly-ins were banned.","Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[17]","N/A","N/A"

The Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019 amends the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to implement Australias obligations relating to goods under the same three free trade agreements. These agreements will contribute to Australias prosperity, create jobs and boost Australias investment and exports across the Asia-Pacific. This legislation is necessary for Australia to ratify the Indonesia, Peru and the Hong Kong free-trade agreements. Under IA-CEPA, over 99 per cent of Australian goods exports will enter duty-free, or under improved arrangements, building upon the 85 per cent in the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement, and Indonesia will guarantee automatic issuance of import permits for key products.Over 99 per cent of all of Perus tariffs will ultimately be eliminated under the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The Australia-Hong Kong Free Trade Agreement ensures that Australias existing duty-free access is guaranteed.I urge the parliament to pass these bills without any further delay so that Australian businesses, exporters, workers, investors and farmers can benefit from these three agreements. What business wants and what these agreements deliver is certainty. Business, farmers and peak bodies from across the Australian economy have called on their parliamentarians to get together and get this done. The government wishes to thank the Labor Party for supporting these important bills, which will help grow Australias export opportunities across the Asia-Pacific. The passage of these bills is an important step in implementing the trade agreements with Indonesia, Peru and Hong Kong. At a time of global uncertainty and trade tensions this shows that the Morrison Liberal and Nationals government is creating more opportunities and better market access for Australian farmers, workers, exporters, investors and businesses. As a nation that has long depended on trade and investment, these agreements will open a new chapter in Australias trading relationships across the Asia-Pacific. I commend the bills to the House. The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Brand has moved as an amendment that all words after That be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question before the House is that the amendment be agreed to. The question now is that this bill be read a second time.A division having been called and the bells having been rung— As there are fewer than five members on the side for the noes in this division, I declare the question resolved in the affirmative in accordance with standing order 127.

254,0,0,0,1,1,"Bandt, Adam, MP","M3C","Melbourne","AG","N/A",4784," by leave—I move amendment (1) as circulated in my name:(1) Clause 2, pages 2 and 3, table items 2 to 4, omit the table items, substitute:2. Schedule 1If the Peru‑Australia Free Trade Agreement, done at Canberra on 12 February 2018, enters into force for Australia—the first day that bilateral side letters exchanged between Australia and each other party to the Agreement agreeing that the part of the agreement which deals with investor-State disputes does not apply in relation to an investment in Australia by an investor of the other party are in force for Australia.However, the provisions do not commence at all unless all of the events mentioned in this item occur.N/AThis amendment deals with the very pernicious clauses that are in these agreements that give corporations the right to sue governments. People may not be aware of what is in these clauses. They sometimes go by the technical name of ISDS clauses but they have very, very real impacts. Because these so-called free trade agreements have effectively been written by big corporations with their representatives in the Liberal Party and endorsed by the Labor Party, these agreements give corporations the right to prosecute and sue governments when governments have the temerity to pass laws that are in the interests of the wellbeing of their own citizens.To give you an idea of how these clauses have operated in the past—this is not a fanciful issue; this is a very, very real issue—they have been used to sue governments who try to take action with respect to plain packaging for tobacco. Peru, who is one of the signatories to one of the agreements were talking about, was on the receiving end of an action when it passed laws that protected the rights of its indigenous people. Egypt, as I understand it, got sued by a French company because they had the temerity to pass legislation that lifted or addressed the minimum wage. So these clauses can have very real impact. And you dont go to a court to have these things heard. You dont go to some big court where the rules of procedural fairness apply. You have two or three people behind closed doors, using secret rules—they dont even need to be judges—and interpreting the agreements, and then they come up with decisions that say, Yes, youre right, Big Corporation, that country is trying to do things that benefit the environment, or its workers or its first inhabitants. That country now has to change its laws. Were not even talking about compensation here; you can be forced to change your laws as a result of this, because all of a sudden youre found to be non-compliant.That is why so many people have objected to these agreements. If they were just free trade agreements between two countries, that would be one thing. But, when big corporations from another country are able to tell our government what to do, that is a problem. Its why the former Chief Justice of Australia rang the alarm bells and said just in the last couple of years, We are at risk of trading away Australias judicial sovereignty, and he is right. He is right. If you dont want to believe the Greens, if you dont want to believe the unions who have pored over every detail of these agreements, if you dont want to believe people in civil society, if you dont want to believe the Labor Party members who voted against it at their own conference—but are now going back on that—then listen to the former Chief Justice.But theres something we can do about it. We dont have to accept the hand-wringing of unenforceable side letters from the trade minister, from the very same government weve been told for the last couple of weeks by the Labor opposition that we shouldnt trust because theyre loose with the truth. Well, if theyre loose with the truth, which I agree with, you shouldnt believe something theyve written in a side letter! We can actually do something here. We dont need to wait for a change of government—and I for one hope a change of government comes very soon, and it can if we start standing up to them instead of agreeing and rolling over and letting them tickle our tummies all the time, which is whats happening at the moment. We could pass this amendment and do something substantial.This amendment is saying to the government, Weve just had the second reading vote. We didnt get our way. I opposed it. A number of others did as well. Fine, youre going to go ahead with it—but, if youre going to go ahead with it, then park it until youve gone back and taken these terrible clauses out of the agreement. A lot of people in this place think these clauses are wrong, so were saying to you: if you want to have your agreements, then, fine, have your agreements, but go back and renegotiate to strip out these terrible clauses. If you want them that much, go back and take these clauses out, because we know that these clauses do harm. These clauses prevent governments from doing things that their people have elected them to do. There is no reason not to support this amendment, because if everyone, whether part of a party or an Independent, sitting here says, We dont like these, then we can take them out— (Time expired)","Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BANDT (Melbourne) ","(17:28):"

Time has moved on very dramatically from then. There might have been two blackfellas here in Canberra, 250 years ago, saying: These whitefellas are real good. I get blankets off them and I get trinkets off them and I get mirrors off them. Theyre really good blokes. Im right in with these whitefellas. Well, that may not have been a really good idea for the Australians who were here then. Is there any difference to the people here in Canberra today saying, Oh, yes; this is great for us. This foreign investment is just marvellous. Were getting so much out of it? I dont know what were getting out of it. In Queensland, we provided the money to build the railway lines into the mines. We provided the money to build the ports, and the people of Queensland owned the railway lines and the ports and benefited from it. With the federal government under Doug Anthony during that period, we maintained ownership of all of our airports. We dont now. Its very hard to find what exactly we as Australians do own.The member for Melbourne is quite right in his comments that you are giving away your sovereignty and making the same mistakes that we as Australians made 250 years ago. People will curse your name. The history books will curse your name. Theyll say, Who gave this country away? Already people cannot believe that the two sides of this parliament sold all of our gas reserves for 6c and were now buying the gas back for $16. We cant afford to buy it, so industries are closing throughout Australia. Many of the great industries of my electorate are under very serious threat because of the price of gas. The state member, Shane Knuth, a member of our party, says it constantly. Mr Beattie got up and told us that, if we opened the door to competition in the electricity industry, prices would go down. Competition would drive the prices down. Well, we went from $670 to $2,400 a household on the free market. To me it is extraordinary. We had the free market agreement with the United States. They wanted quarantine laws emasculated, and they got exactly what they wanted. Its oversighted now by a body which is half American and half Australian. Thats exactly what they wanted and they got it. They wanted pharmaceuticals—virtually an open-door policy—and they got it.There are three things we wanted, according to the Financial Review and The Australian: dairy access, beef access and sugar access. As youre well aware, I represent a major part of the Australian beef industry. We always got a fair go from America. I really cant complain. As to why we needed some extra access, I dont really know, because Ive never received a complaint about access into the United States. Ive represented probably the biggest beef area in Australia for almost 50 years and Ive never received a single complaint. So forget about beef. The benefit to the Australian dairy industry was one ice cream per week for every dairy farmer. That was the benefit they got out of it. Nothing! And the sugar industry was wiped completely. So we got nothing out of it; they got everything they wanted.This is the manifestation of the sycophantic nature of this place. They we there grovelling to the white fellas 250 years ago. Now theyre grovelling to the big corporates. Youre watching the corporate colonisation of our country. I applaud the member. We may disagree violently on many things, but I applaud him and the member from Hobart for their strong stand and consistent stand.

Centre Alliance, formerly the Nick Xenophon Team, has had a very longstanding concern with ISDS provisions. We should not give multinationals the green light to sue our nation over our laws that we make in the best interests of Australians.I will briefly touch upon the Philip Morris v Australia case from 2011. That took four years to resolve. That cost taxpayers time and money. The reason for that is Philip Morris thought they could use ISDS provisions to sue Australia for its plain packaging of cigarettes. Many countries are now looking at ISDS provisions and realising that they are not in their nations interests, and I would urge the government to very strongly consider removing any ISDS provisions from any free trade agreement that we are about to decide and sign as a nation. We should never allow multinationals to have rule and control over what happens in this parliament.

It would be wrong of me to not take this opportunity to point out that the whole issue of ISDS is particularly relevant to my home state of Tasmania. Were obviously a small state with a small economy—a state government with a small budget and small financial resources—but we are one of the six states of the Commonwealth, and we should have equal standing with the other states. But in this regard, when it comes to investor-state disputes, we are particularly disadvantaged. What would happen if a large foreign company were to try and sue the Tasmanian government for its GM-free status? There is every chance that that foreign company would have the resources of, or more resources than, the Tasmanian state government. What would happen if a foreign company wanted to sue the Tasmanian government because of its extra-tough quarantine requirements on its aquaculture? Chances are that that foreign company would have every advantage over the Tasmanian government; it could, in fact, have more financial resources than the Tasmanian government.What I am saying is that the ability for an Australian government to defend itself is even more pronounced when it comes to my home state of Tasmania, because it would be so much easier for enormously wealthy foreign companies, armed to the eyeballs with a legion of lawyers, to take us on. It would obviously put the Tasmanian government at a significant disadvantage if those companies were to take us on. So, if only for Tasmania, and things like our GM-free status and our extra-tough quarantine safeguards, this amendment from the member for Melbourne must be embraced.I dont see why a federal government cant, for once in its life, instead of being hostile to improvements from the crossbench, think, You characters on the crossbench have a good idea there; well take that on board and well actually support that amendment. That would be in the public interest nationally—for all of the states that are represented here on the crossbench; that is, Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania. It would be in all of our interests—it would be in the public interest—if the federal government would swallow their pride and say, Good idea; well take that on board and well support the excellent amendment moved by the member for Melbourne.

Okay; we voted against that, but we are now in a situation where it is going ahead. Because these deals dont allow you to go back and renegotiate individual terms—which is a flaw in the process, but thats where were at—we now have to take the agreement, as it seems, on its face. One of the things we can do, though, is say, Some problems with it have been raised, including around whats called labour market testing, which means advertising for jobs locally before allowing the use of classes of visas or provisions under this agreement; we want you to go back and negotiate something else before we enter into this. Thats what we should do.Many, many people have raised the very legitimate point that, under these agreements, what you do is open up whole new categories of people who are able to be brought here through the loopholes without there having to be local advertising first. I want to be clear: there is nothing inherently wrong with saying, Lets have people who live overseas come here and have a chance to work. Of course that can happen. But most people in this country would think, as a basic matter of principle, that you advertise locally first to check theres no-one available who wants the job or who could do the job with a reasonable amount of training. But what weve found under these agreements that have happened so far is that once you start opening up categories of people like contractual service suppliers, as are referred to in previous agreements like ChAFTA and are referred to in this as well, and give them the fast track around all of Australias labour laws, they end up coming here and working and being exploited on below local wages and conditions. That is terrible for them. That is terrible for those people. Ive even seen it in my electorate. They get brought here under a visa where the employer is able to say: Youve got to do what we say because your ability to stay in this country depends on me. If you dont do what I say then I, as the employer, will deport you. Well organise for you to be deported by revoking your visa.So what has happened? In Victoria, for example, on our power networks—the poles and wires that bring electricity to people—it cannot be said that there is a shortage of local workers available to do that kind of work, but we have seen instances of the big corporations bringing in people to do things like line maintenance at below local wages and conditions. These poor workers are told, If you speak up about it, well deport you. In Richmond, in my electorate, they were building apartment blocks where they had people installing lift stackers—as if you cant find someone here to do it. People are working on construction projects more broadly across Australia, and theyre getting paid about half of what people locally would get paid, and theyre being forced to sleep in places where there are many to a room. None of us would put up with that.Why are they doing it? Theyre doing it because theyre brought out here on these promises of great deals, and then theyre told, If you speak up, if you go to a union, if you speak to anyone else, youre on the next plane back. Why does that happen? It happens because there are not provisions in place that require proper testing of the labour market here—proper, decent advertising of local jobs. After youve been through that process, if you still cant find someone, theres probably no-one in this country who would object to you saying, Well bring in someone else if no-one here is willing to do it. But the point is that these agreements circumvent all of that. They now put in place new categories where it is clear the labour market testing does not apply with the kind of rigour it should.The government will say: Its okay. Weve got safeguards in place and weve just written a letter to the Labor Party—which theyve been foolish enough to accept as being worth something, even though its just a letter that doesnt actually mean anything—that says, Its okay; existing provisions will continue to apply.

I regret to say this because some of these farmers are my friends, but Ive been into the accommodation. There are three beds on that side, one on top of the other, and there are three beds on that side, and I could not put both my elbows up. There was no space between the beds; just enough space to walk. Their clothing was stacked on sticks. Theyd broken off branches of trees or they had some broom handles or something, and they just had their clothes on them. There was nowhere for them to hang their clothes. It was about a 25-metre walk to the toilets. Theyre probably paying $100, I thought. The bloke who was showing me around said, Its $150 a week theyre paying in rent. Thats $150 a week to share a little room thats 10 feet wide and with six beds in it. Are they paying the industrial award rate? Yes, they are, but theres a little round robin taking place here—that is, theyve got to pay the labour hire company back for getting them the job in Australia. Then the labour hire company pays the employer because the employers getting a beaut deal. So there are lovely little round robins taking place everywhere, and theyre quite legal. Theres nothing illegal about them. When Keating said he was going to free up the market, I threw a boot at the wall because I thought: Is this bloke completely mad? Are we going to go down to Asian slave labour wage levels or are we going to close every industry in Australia? There are only two possibilities. Our industries cant possibly survive competing against people that pay their workers—the last time I looked, and this is a few years ago, in the United States, farm labour cost was $5 an hour, mostly to Mexicans, wetback labour, in agriculture, and over here it was $15 an hour. How can we possibly compete against this? We cant. Theres no doubt that our wages are tumbling in Australia.Mining is probably the biggest employer in this country; the honourable member here for Western Australia would back me up on that. In mining, an experienced miner earned $200,000 some seven, eight, nine years ago. Hes now lucky if hes on $100,000, and he has no permanent job. Theres contractual work that might last one or two years, and hes living away from home. This is all as a result of your free trade, and it will just go down and down until we have the same labour conditions that they enjoy in Third World countries. The men that fought to bring these laws in—as I mentioned before, every time I walk out past, I salute Charlie McDonald, the first member for Kennedy because he was fighting the same battles that the member for Kennedy is fighting 110 years later. Winston Churchill said that those who cannot learn from history will be forced to re-suffer it. That is what is happening here. Our wage structures are collapsing through the floor.The member for Melbourne is absolutely 100 per cent right. Ive seen the accommodation with my own eyes. Ive been told—admittedly, I havent got any documentary proof. That would be very hard to get. Im not holding it against the employers. What are they supposed to do? Its a free market now, so theyre competing against slave labour produced products from overseas. What should they do—close their doors? You cant blame them for going down this pathway. And that is why some of us consistently and continuously oppose what has been disastrous for this country.I repeat: we have no motor vehicle industry. We have very little textile, footwear and clothing industry left. Weve even managed to export a quarter of our electricity industry. Instead of having coal-fired power stations in Australia, we now have solar panel factories in China. We figured out how to do that. We were 90 per cent self-sufficient in petrol before this free trade agreement rubbish started off. Now were three per cent self-sufficient in petrol. The last whitegoods factory closed in Orange, New South Wales, three years ago, so weve got no whitegoods. What exactly do we produce? Were down to two quarries. Thats all. Were not a mining country. Im a mining man. Ive lived all of my life in and out of mining, and mining is when you dig it out and sell the metal.

267,0,0,0,1,1,"Wilkie, Andrew, MP","C2T","Clark","IND","N/A",4792," Can I take this opportunity to back the member for Kennedy on a couple of really important points he made. One was this practice with foreign workers who appear to be being paid Australian wages but are not. I have heard stories in Hobart from a number of sources that this is exactly what happens. A foreign worker on some sort of temporary work visa will get the Australian wage, but when he walks out the door hes expected to hand a portion of it back to his employer, the result being that those people are being paid substantially less than their Australian counterparts. Thats why these foreign workers are so desirable in Australia, thats why so many of them are being brought in—because they get paid less than their Australian counterparts. That has a number of effects. It means that there are Australian workers who are not being paid instead and it means that those Australian workers who are being employed are suffering downward pressure on their wages and conditions.The government cant claim that this isnt happening. For years I have been hearing stories around Hobart. Weve been very lucky to have a commercial construction boom in recent years, but at just about every big construction site in Hobart you will see foreign workers. You will see foreign plasterers, foreign tilers and foreign glaziers. You cant tell me that we don’t have plasterers and tilers in Australia who arent looking for work. Of course we do. Sure, they may be in short supply in Hobart, because weve got a construction boom in Hobart, but you cant tell me that there arent tilers and plasterers, among other trades, in Melbourne, in Sydney and, in particular, in regional mainland cities, who arent looking for work. Of course, they are out there looking for work.The system is not working, and the simple and undeniable fact is that these free trade agreements are costing Australian jobs and creating downward pressure on wages and conditions for Australian workers. This nonsense from the government and, I suspect, from the opposition—in fact, I know that it is from the opposition, because during the 43rd Parliament there was a real surge in the number of foreign workers coming into this country—that these foreign workers are not costing Australian jobs and that these foreign workers are being paid Australian wages and enjoying Australian conditions is just not true. The government and the opposition know that. Either they know it and they are wilfully ignorant or they are clueless. If people like me walking the streets and talking to construction workers in Hobart can see it, surely the government and the opposition should be able to see. The member for Kennedy—way up there in North Queensland—is aware of it. So we can only assume that the government and the opposition are either wilfully ignorant or are well aware of it and they are misleading this place.","Customs Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019, Customs Tariff Amendment (Growing Australian Export Opportunities Across the Asia-Pacific) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WILKIE (Clark) ","(18:08):"
268,0,0,0,1,1,"Bandt, Adam, MP","M3C","Melbourne","AG","N/A",4793," I thought that Labor or Liberal might rise to talk and say, No; its okay; we dont need these amendments because weve got these great side letters that weve just exchanged. So dont you worry about that; itll all be fine. The fact that neither of them are prepared to get up and defend these agreements and rebut the points that Im making tells you everything that you need to know—that they know that the points I am making are true. They know that, in these agreements, you will be able to bypass Australian labour law.We were here on this issue with ChAFTA, the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, where we tried to get some protections to stop the circumventing of Australian labour law. And what happened? Well, Labor sold out the electricians on that one. With that agreement, we ended up with classes of workers, contractual service suppliers and other independent contract people who were able to come in and bypass the existing labour laws and any other agreements that might have been put around the side to give the fiction that there was going to be some proper labour market testing—and we have seen it come to pass. Now, we are back here again with the same provisions about introducing whole new swathes of workers that allow you to bypass Australian labour law—and they cant even be bothered to get up and say, No, its all right; we fixed that this time, because they know that they havent.That is why so many working people and their representatives have worked so hard to get a change of position from at least one of the parties in this place and for them to say: Weve got to start saying no to these labour market testing provisions and to allowing Australian labour law to be circumvented. Weve got to start putting in a hard floor in this country so that, no matter where you come from, you get Australian wages and conditions when you work here, and that involves some rigorous labour marketing testing and rigorous checking to make sure that there arent some locals who can do the job first.Weve been debating this for many, many years—and weve certainly been debating it since the China free trade agreement. I note that one contributor from the opposition said that someone will come in here and start trying to make some cheap political points. Well, no, we have been raising this year after year because there is a problem, and you know there is a problem! You dont even have the courage to get up and speak to these amendments, because you know that you are about to vote to create huge loopholes that will allow plane-loads of exploited overseas workers to fly through. That will be bad for them and it will be bad for local wages and conditions as well. You know it!This government has a one-seat majority and if we worked together and took the fight up to this government, come the next by-election they could be out on their ear—and there will be a by-election during this parliament, because there always is. But if Labor keeps going over to the government and saying, Oh, yep, well side with you on that, every time the government wants tax cuts for the rich, and says Yep, well vote with you for that, like we did last week, every time the government wants to rip $4 billion out of education, then you are just giving this government kudos it doesnt deserve. You are facilitating their agenda, Labor! We should be standing up to them and presenting an alternative, rather than doing exactly what they want. I accept that maybe Labor wants to vote with the Liberals to give tax cuts to the rich, instead of voting with the Greens, and maybe Labor wants to vote with the Liberals to rip $4 billion out of education, instead of voting with the Greens, but I would have thought Labor might vote with us to protect workers rights. But it is left to the Greens and the crossbench to say, Lets address these problems. Do you know why? It is because we are not on the payroll of the big corporations, but Labor and the Liberals are. Every time the big corporations say that they want the right to do whatever they like to undermine your hard-won and hard-fought-for local labour laws that have taken you over a century to build up, Liberal and Labor ask, How high do you want us to jump? How much do you want us to trade off?If there were any time to stand up to the government, it is now. I am deeply sorry that there wasnt a change of government at the last election. There wasnt, but now we have the chance to do something about it by standing up and presenting an alternative. So, I say to Labor: Look at it. You are the opposition—the clue is in the title.

I have much to be humble about. I wrote a book and it was the best-selling history book in the year it came out. Murdoch Books used Kevin Rudd to launch it in Sydney, to over 1,000 people, and Barrie Cassidy to launch it in Melbourne, to over 1,000 people. I have great faith in the Australian people. If I do, then I believe theyre going to slaughter these two parties. There was a little group called the Labor Party—my family are very wealthy and very powerful but they backed the labour movement with every ounce of energy that they had. We had seven seats in Queensland and eight seats in New South Wales. Within 15 years we controlled the parliaments of Australia and ran Queensland for the next 50 years straight. We won every seat outside of the south-east corner and every election for 50 years. But what you dont see is happening. Tony Abbott stood up in this place and led the clapping to congratulate the then trade minister on the free trade deal. The minister sold the Port of Darwin and then went on $880,000 a year from the Port of Darwin owners the next year. Tony Abbott stood up and clapped, as did all of the Liberal Party, all the little sycophants that are in this place. I said to the honourable member for Clark, Hes finished. He will never survive this. Within three months he was destroyed—completely. Now, if you think youre going to get away with continuing down this free trade path—people wonder why were associated with it—I was there in the room when Michael OConnor tore into the Labor Party, like Id never before heard anyone at a public meeting rip into a Prime Minister, over the section 457 workers. These people actually didnt do that; it was the Labor Party that did it. They were bringing in about 30,000 and then Labor came in and they brought in 165,000. OConnor was quite right. Hes providing the money for the ALP and hes getting a big kick in the backside and a kick in the head from them in this place with their free trade deals. There is not the slightest doubt that the member for Melbourne and the member for Clark are dead right. If youre seriously going to say to the Australian people that it is not going to undermine their pay and conditions, you have to assume every Australian is a drongo and a mug.

Those democracy leaders said, Dont proceed with this agreement, because of the pressure that we are under, because of the assaults that we are under, because it will strengthen the case against us.

I dont think Ive ever done this before, but its worth doing because they report that Hong Kong pro-democracy leader, Bonnie Leung, has urged Australian MPs not to ratify a new trade deal with the Chinese territory unless human rights guarantees are inserted into the agreement. Ms Leung issued the plea to members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Thursday, saying Hong Kong had become a police state without accountability for those attacking the protesters. Ms Leung said Australia should use the deal to put some pressure on the administration of Hong Kong Chief Executive, Carrie Lam. These quotes from her are important. She said:They should pause the trade deal and put in some guarantees on human rights and an independent investigation on police brutality.I’m not asking them to scrap this deal. I’m sure it will be beneficial to both sides. But more importantly if we are facing imminent danger, if we are about to be killed, what good is the trade deal for us?Lets put aside whether you think these agreements are good or bad. Theres clearly a majority in this place that wants to proceed with them. Lets put aside all the other issues about labour market testing and corporations being able to sue individual governments and the loss of sovereignty. Lets just focus specifically on the one agreement and the one request that is being made of us at the moment. The democracy leaders in Hong Kong are putting their lives on the line. They told us to not rip up the agreement. They told us to not refuse to go ahead with it. They just said, Please give us some breathing space and send a message that what is happening now is not right.This amendment does a very simple thing. It buys a years breathing space for the situation there to unfold and hopefully resolve itself peacefully and hopefully resolve itself in the interest of democracy. Were saying that you can have the agreement. This amendment doesnt even seek to alter any of the terms of it, in effect. It does not seek side agreements. It just says, Have the agreement as negotiated, but send a message that we have heard the Hong Kong democracy leaders. This agreement will not come into effect, to allow time for those human rights safeguards to be negotiated.The Australian government, people sitting on the backbenches of the Liberal Party, are out there at the moment, flaunting their colours and saying, We stand with the democracy leaders. Well, show it. Show it by doing it really simply and really straightforwardly. Send a message back to the Chinese government saying: No, you have to do better than what is happening at the moment. You have to come up with a peaceful solution that respects democracy and that listens to democracy leaders. We are not going to put trade and money over democracy and lives. That is what is happening here. Democracy leaders are pleading with us and saying that their lives are on the line—Do not put money ahead of human life. Do not put what corporations want ahead of democracy. Thats what theyre asking.

This bill recognises the unique nature of military service, and acknowledges and gives thanks to veterans and their families for the sacrifices they have made while serving in the Australian Defence Force. The government shares the Australian peoples appreciation of the contribution made to our nation by our military, those who have defended Australia and those prepared to defend it.The welfare of veterans and their families remains a priority for this government. An annual statement to parliament on the governments ongoing commitment to veterans and their families has been delivered by the Minister for Veterans Affairs each year since 2017, and I was privileged to deliver this years statement just last week.The introduction of this bill sees the realisation of an Australian Defence Veterans Covenant, where everyone can acknowledge, support and pay respect to all who have served or are currently serving in the Australian Army, Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force, or Reserve. The Australian Defence Veterans Covenant enables Australians from all walks of life to honour Australias proud military history. The bill enshrines the Australian Defence Veterans Covenant in legislation, providing an opportunity for the nation to recognise the service and the sacrifice of all who have committed to defend the nation and those who continue to do so, and to pledge their commitment to support veterans and their families.The government acknowledges through this bill the sacrifices made by veterans and their families, and the challenges they may experience during and after their military service. Also recognised and acknowledged is that veterans can require additional support to be provided in a way that is appropriate and sensitive to their individual circumstances.In addition to the covenant, anyone with a single day of service will receive a veterans card and a lapel pin once released. The card and lapel pin will provide a visual method for the Australian community and businesses to recognise a veteran and for veterans to recognise one another. Importantly, the bill also includes a statement in relation to the beneficial nature of veterans legislation to provide further support to the principles of statutory interpretation that determinations are to be made fairly, justly, consistent with legislation and similar type claims, and in a timely manner so that the public may trust and have confidence in the determinations made.I commend this bill.","Australian Veterans Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CHESTER (Gippsland—Minister for Veterans and Defence Personnel and Deputy Leader of the House) ","(18:43):"
283,0,0,0,1,1,"Neumann, Shayne, MP","HVO","Blair","ALP","N/A",4799," I rise today to speak on the Australian Veterans Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019, which has bipartisan support. This bill creates a new act which will provide a framework for government, business and community to recognise and acknowledge the unique nature of military service, and support veterans and their families. Importantly, this bill establishes the Australian Defence Veterans Covenant, which formalises or gives effect to the solemn pledge of a grateful nation to its veterans. Its an important development.Many in this place would be aware that in September last year it was Labor who first announced that, if elected, we would establish a military covenant. Labors proposed covenant would have covered both current and ex-serving personnel and their families, as we saw the need to recognise the commitment and sacrifice they make in serving our country by formalising Australias commitment to provide them with the ongoing support they need. That is why Labor welcomes the governments adoption of a covenant through this bill. However, I must note that we would like to see the covenant extended to all Defence personnel, current and serving, as well as their families. Its unfortunate that whats before us today covers only those who have previously served, and their loved ones.Another notable absence from this bill—but part of Labors proposal at the last election—is an annual reporting in the form of a statement to parliament. We wanted this included to ensure that, whoever the government is, it is accountable for meeting its obligation to current and serving personnel. While we recognise that there is currently an annual statement to the parliament—indeed, the minister delivered the third such statement last week, and I gave a reply to it—that is purely a decision of government, a convention you have, not a statement to the parliament as part of legislation.When this bill was first introduced in the 45th Parliament, we raised concerns about the omission of these elements. We therefore referred the bill to a Senate inquiry so that the veterans community had the opportunity to view and provide feedback on the governments proposed covenant. This was followed by providing additional comments on these issues as part of a Senate Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade Legislation Committee inquiry report. It was Labors view both then and now, and through thorough consultation with those who would be affected by the covenant, that this occur. Whilst it is regrettable and a missed opportunity that it does not include those currently serving, that doesnt diminish the overwhelming positives of this covenant. For this reason, Labor is willing to support the bill both in principle and in practice.In order to not further hold up the passage of this legislation, we requested that the Senate committee conclude their inquiry by 22 March this year to enable both an examination of the legislation and the process to be completed in time to be reviewed by the Senate by early April this year. We believed that this was appropriate and would ensure there was time to review the legislation to enable the current and ex-serving community the opportunity to be involved in the process and not delay the passage of the bill. The committee indeed did report back on 22 March, recommending that the bill be passed without amendment. At the same time, Labor senators on the committee canvassed the issues of including current serving personnel and strengthening the reporting element, in additional comments to the report.However, as it happened, while the bill was debated in April, there was not sufficient time for it to be passed in the House of Representatives in the final week before the election, and it lapsed, sadly. Given the Senate committees recommendations and the broad support amongst veterans for the bill and the covenant itself, the delay in the bills passage we found curious. But Labor is willing to be pragmatic and support the bill in its current form.Our commitment to those whove served is formalised in this covenant, and its vital we get it right. In addition to the introduction of a covenant, the bill inserts a general recognition clause, which acknowledges the unique nature of military service, the demands placed on those who serve, the additional support they require post service and the Commonwealths commitment to supporting veterans, reflecting the fact that veterans have complex needs and need special support. Furthermore, it acknowledges the demands placed on and the sacrifices made by families of veterans. This is an important component and one which has not always been acknowledged, and it should be.These are just some of the reasons why Labor wholeheartedly supports this recognition and the ongoing obligation to those who put their lives on hold in service of our country—and to their families, I might add. As an extension of this general recognition, the bill includes an overarching statement in relation to the beneficial nature of the Veterans Affairs portfolio legislation, making it clear that the legislation has a beneficial purpose and should be interpreted accordingly. In this section well note that the Commonwealth has committed to ensuring that those who make decisions involving veterans interpret legislation in a way that benefits them and their families, where that interpretation is consistent with the purpose of the provision. I think thats a good legislative reform.This bill will provide for departmental training and a guide to ensure that decision-makers understand and appropriately apply the beneficial legislation to support the intent of this clause, and Im sure veterans communities around the country would appreciate that. In addition, a paragraph will also be inserted that provides that claims decisions will be made within a time that is proportionate to the complexity of the matter, acknowledging the variety of complex client claims and that there will be differences in timeliness. One of the most common complaints about the Department of Veterans Affairs is the lengthy and complex claim process. So any commitment to timeliness will be welcomed by the veteran and ex-serving communities.Finally, this bill will provide recognition to veterans and their families in the form of lapel pins, veterans cards and other artefacts. Labor is broadly supportive of these kinds of symbolic forms of veteran recognition through items such as cards and pins. To the extent that the veterans card would be accompanied by a discount scheme, it was hoped that it would deliver tangible benefits as well. The government has completely botched the rollout, and veterans have been waiting for almost a year now for the card and the discount scheme and would have been struggling to get even basic information on what businesses were involved and the discounts available.Since the card was announced nearly a year ago, the only public commitment was made by Virgin Australia, who offered priority boarding. This was derided by many in the veterans community as a tokenistic gesture, and the offer was withdrawn. Its also unclear how the veterans cards will interact with other existing veterans discount schemes. Since that time, there have been no public commitments from businesses in relation to the card. There is widespread frustration among veterans over the delay, and cynicism about whether this is just a cheap stunt from the government. We hear that interest in the lapel pins has been fairly low. As to the veterans card, first it was going to be different from the DVA health cards, and then we found out it was actually to be rebadged and reissued as the DVA white card, at the cost of $11.1 million. It has been a complete mess from the start.So we hope that the government will address the implementation issues and that more information will become available about the veterans discount card and the practical benefits it would deliver. We also hope the government briefs the opposition and the veterans communities about that. Given that these measures were first announced almost a year ago and the bill is only now coming before this chamber, we ask just how serious the government was to introduce them if they announced this about 12 months ago.The strong feedback from veterans has been that these sorts of initiatives must be backed up by substance such as better veteran support services. While symbolic recognition is important, Labor too wants to see tangible support of veterans, including things like a more efficient military compensation and rehabilitation scheme; better access to health care, mental health and suicide prevention programs; and more effective civilian transition through training, employment programs and family assistance, just to name a few. Thats why Labor supported the amendments to the bill made by Senator Lambie in the Senate as a good example about practical recognition and we will be supporting them here in this place.These amendments will ensure that the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission and the Department of Veterans Affairs commit to a 90-day time limit on determination for claims under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, commonly known as the MRCA. While Labor notes concerns about legislative time frames for the processing of claims in general, we believe an aspirational target of 90 days for MRCA determinations is reasonable, realistic and achievable. This is because it would simply reflect whats happening already in terms of significant progress thats been made when it comes to assessing rehabilitation and compensation claims as a result of DVAs veteran-centric reform project.We have seen the average wait time for compensation claims in the MRCA come down in recent years below 90 days. For example, in response to a Labor question on notice in the last additional estimates, DVA advised that in 2017-18, the median time taken to process permanent impairment claims under the MRCA was now 78 days, the median time to process incapacity claims was 34 days and the median time to process liability claims was 72 days, all of which are obviously less than 90 days. That said, more recently, there have been reports that DVA is struggling to deal with a spike in claims through the online claims portal MyService and claims processing times have blown out.We know DVA, like many agencies, has been hard hit by the ongoing funding reductions due to the efficiency dividend, which is affecting service delivery, and the department has pointed to the need for more staff to meet the needs of its clients. The government needs to make sure the department is properly resourced so it can do its job and meet the expectation of veterans. Any improvements or commitments to addressing the timeliness of claims will be welcome by Labor and by veterans communities.We on this side hope these amendments will further incentivise the government and the department to resolve these claims that continue to blow out. In addition, we would have preferred that any legislative time frames be applied in a holistic way to all relevant veterans legislations, not just to one act, not just to MRCA. However, Labor wants to be pragmatic and we think it is a useful first step and, in that time, time frames should be considered in context of the Veterans Entitlement Act and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act, known as DRCA.The rationale for considering legislative time frames is that there is now extensive evidence and research showing the military compensation scheme is having an adverse impact on the mental health and wellbeing of veterans and, in some cases, contributing to veteran suicide and mental health issues. A 2018 Phoenix Australia report, the 2019 review of this report and other literature by Professor Alex Collie, commissioned by DVA, have highlighted that aspects of the system such as delays in claims processing can have serious effects on applicants. As I said earlier, one of the most common complaints about DVA is the lengthy and complex claims process. While the bill already contains a general commitment to timeliness, we believe these amendments could help further mitigate the psychological impact of these processes. In addition, military compensation lawyers have pointed out Australias military compensation system is one of the few systems that doesnt include time frames for responding to claims or for making decisions. Defence personnel in the UK, US, Canada and New Zealand are all protected by decision-making time limits. In addition, every state and territory in Australia has time frames for decision-making under civil workers compensation schemes. The recent Productivity Commission inquiry into compensation and rehabilitation of veterans recommended the system be redesigned based on the best practice features of contemporary workers compensation and social insurance schemes. To that end, a 90-day time frame for determination would go some way to bringing MRCA decisions in line with best practices in schemes in other jurisdictions. Such a time frame would be complemented by an allowance for extensions to be granted in certain circumstances.In summary: Labor is willing to support the amendments to this bill. Like Senator Lambie we want to improve the timeliness of compensation claims. In closing I thank all those in the veterans communities who provided feedback to us on our side of the chamber, lobbied for recognition for the military covenant, participated in the Senate inquiry into the bill and continue to advocate for veterans each and every day. Going forward it would be good to consider the ways we can strengthen legislation through regular reporting to parliament and inclusion of current serving ADF members and their families. However, we support the principles of the bill and acknowledge the support of those who served and their loved ones. Labors commitment to those who serve or have served is rock solid, and we welcome the changes brought by this legislation that increase recognition for veterans and their loved ones. Fundamentally this bill seeks to provide greater recognition for veterans by government and acknowledges the unique nature of military service and obligation of those that served. In conclusion, this recognition is very important. Its a message from parliament on behalf of the Australian community that we honour and thank veterans for their service and we recognise the sacrifice that they and their families have made for our country. I commend the bill to the House.","Australian Veterans Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr NEUMANN (Blair) ","(18:46):"

286,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation",101351,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr KHALIL: Thank you, Minister. We would have liked to see people currently serving in our defence forces included, but the government has decided not to include them. Nonetheless, the bill has the broad support of the veterans community, and Labor supports the bill on this basis.We talk a lot about the decision a person makes to join the Australian Defence Force, a decision that is about sacrifice and love of country—in many respects a difficult one, because of the pressure thats placed not just on that person who has made the choice but also on their family. Although people did not always have the choice to join, we as a society should always respect, recognise and remember that choice made by so many thousands of Australians. I think that recognition and remembrance of service comes in part because of the personal connections so many Australians have with men and women whove served. We have seen this amazing phenomenon of our Anzac Day celebrations growing over the decades and becoming more and more popular, particularly with younger people. Perhaps it is that personal connection, wanting to remember the service of a great-grandfather who fought and died in World War I, a grandfather in World War II or an uncle in Vietnam.I think of my uncle, who served in the Australian Army driving the Leopard tanks at Puckapunyal, and my grandfather, who was an Egyptian auxiliary for the British in Montgomerys Eight Army in North Africa during World War II. He used to tell me snatches of stories about that service. He reckons that he singlehandedly, with just his rifle, took prisoner a whole unit of Italian artillery. I was too young to tell whether he was having me on. He noted that the enemy Italian units he took prisoner just wanted to get out of the hot desert and to the relative comfort of a British POW camp in Cairo. I wish now that I had asked him more questions about that period, so that I could remember more and better. Now he has passed away and that opportunity no longer exists.So its a bit personal, obviously, to many of us who have relatives who have served, but I think its more than personal. Bills like this one come from our acknowledgement as a nation of something more than just the personal. Obviously, deep in our hearts, deep inside the marrow of our bones, Australians know, through the history of our nation, the service of two million men and women in uniform and the ultimate sacrifice of 102,000 diggers, that that is pretty much why we enjoy the freedoms of Australian democracy. I think we know that; we understand that. Our diggers today are deployed in some of the far-flung places that so many of our diggers are buried, such as among the rocky hills and deserts of the Middle East. Today, as did our forebears, they defend our nation, they protect our way of life and they defend our democracy, ensuring we can continue to enjoy the freedoms that we have. That is why Australians want to recognise and commemorate their sacrifice and their service.This covenant is another way that we will remember them. Ive always stood in solemn respect—and Im sure all of my colleagues here would have done so—at least intellectually understanding the history of that sacrifice. However, it never really hit me, at least emotionally, until an Anzac Day dawn service I attended when I was in Iraq in 2004. I spent almost a year in Iraq, posted by the Australian government in 2003 and 2004, working on a whole range of national security and counterterrorism tasks. There was the 2004 dawn service in Baghdad, at the Australian headquarters. Youd see, every morning at dawn, the coalition headquarters being hit by mortars and rockets, so the Anzac service had a particularly eerie feel about it, especially because of the backdrop we had. You would see tracer fire lighting up the pre-dawn and the background noise of helicopter gunships rumbling across the skies as we commenced the service. As the sun rose and the Last Post was played, I saw the silhouette of the bugler against the blood-orange sky. At that moment, an emotion hit me that is difficult to describe. I intellectually knew that diggers all around me at this service were putting their lives at risk every day. They were protecting us as we moved around Baghdad and other parts of Iraq in the ASLAVs and other convoys, but those experiences really opened up a better understanding, a deeper understanding, of what the first Anzacs had to go through—those who paid the ultimate sacrifice in France, the Middle East and of course Gallipoli. How many more have made that same sacrifice since then? At that particular moment during the service at Baghdad, I felt an enormous gratitude for the generations of our service men and women who fought and died for our freedoms. I dont do it often, but I did shed a tear at that service.Im reminded through these experiences in my electorate of Wills that theres always more work to do to fully recognise our veterans. There are a number of veterans who live in my electorate, and there are those who are currently serving, with families in my electorate. We need to look after them when they return and look after their families and their loved ones if they dont. RSLs have obviously been doing this on the ground for generations. After the end of World War II, RSLs were at the very heart of many of our local communities and they played a huge role in supporting our veterans and connecting people through shared experience. There are many other organisations now that also do some of this great work.I visit the RSLs in my electorate—the Coburg RSL, the Pascoe Vale RSL, the Glenroy RSL and the Fawkner RSL—and speak with some of the older diggers there, but unfortunately I dont see a lot of the younger ones. The next generation is largely missing. A lot of the men and women who served in Afghanistan, Iraq and East Timor dont tend to go to these RSLs as much as previous generations of veterans. Maybe thats changing or it will change as they get older and they seek to be with their fellow veterans in a setting.I know there are many from the more recent conflicts who are struggling. Many of them are struggling; many families are struggling. A lot of veterans have issues such as PTSD and they have mental health issues. The issues are not just physical; they are emotionally affected by what theyve seen and what theyve experienced. Its really up to us to not just recognise them, remember and commemorate. Thats all very important. Those Anzac Day services and Remembrance Day services that we all attend are critically important to keep the memory alive.","Australian Veterans Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"

289,0,0,0,1,1,"Wallace, Andrew, MP",265967,"Fisher","LNP","N/A",4806," Before I start, Id like to acknowledge and join with the remarks from the member for Wills and acknowledge the unique service to his country that he provided, which I think was quite exceptional and should be recognised, along with the service of all members in this place. Earlier this year I had the privilege of presenting a unit citation for gallantry to my constituent Geoffrey Eaton. Geoff was a private on the front lines during the battles for fire support bases Coral and Balmoral during the Vietnam War. He did me the honour of requesting that I present him with the citation, in lieu of his units commanding officer. At the presentation, Geoff told me his story and described some of the harrowing experiences he went through during those days in 1968. It was another moving reminder for me of how critical it is that we appropriately recognise and acknowledge our veterans service. I believe that todays bill is another important step, both practical and symbolic, towards proper recognition for all of our former service men and women.In August last year I held a Fisher veterans forum at the Caloundra RSL, in my electorate. I invited then-senator Jim Molan to take part in the forum. The veterans we spoke with were passionate about the importance of service and the ADF. They were modest about their contributions and, most importantly, they were passionate about supporting one another. When it came to the help they wanted from government, the message was loud and clear. Veterans want the support that we provide to be straightforward to access and they want practical, pragmatic solutions. It is clear from this concise and well-designed bill that the government has heard that feedback, having created a Veterans Recognition Program that is practical and straightforward. I want to thank the Minister for Veterans Affairs for his efficient and committed work on this matter.The bill before the House, the Australian Veterans Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019, has two aspects. One sets down clearly in legislation the commitment that the Commonwealth government owes to veterans in return for their selfless service to our country. The second sets up the legislative framework for some of the governments simple and practical measures to aid in the further recognition of veterans in the community. The first aspect, part 2, lays out the minimum that veterans can expect from our community in return for their service. The second aspect, part 3, sets up the means for our community to go further.Service to our nation is, at the best of times, exacting and tough. It imposes great discipline and even in peacetime exposes men and women to risks that are not faced in civilian life. Service in peacetime requires sacrifice of time, of freedom, of comforts and of family. It can involve long stretches away from home in unfamiliar and hostile places. As weve seen recently in the Queensland floods, it can require a willingness to go into situations that others are seeking to flee and to deal with the worst that nature can do to ordinary people. Its physically demanding, emotionally tough and psychologically stressful. In times of conflict, while on deployment there is another layer of sacrifice that is hard for civilians to imagine. Few of us understand what it is to intentionally risk our own lives. Few know how it feels to be vulnerable to armed attack or to watch close friends and colleagues be injured, or even killed. Service men and women in conflict zones live with constant stress and privation from the luxuries of home. They can be required to deal with the worst of human suffering and to operate effectively in almost impossible situations. Its clear that these experiences, these sacrifices, are like nothing else in a persons life.It is therefore right that the government recognises and acknowledges the uniqueness of that sacrifice in this bill. It is absolutely right that the government acknowledges that those who return from service of this kind may need special support with their health, with getting new employment and housing, and with enjoying some of the day-to-day activities in which we all take part. We owe our service men and women a great debt. It is right that the government, with this bill, acknowledges that in fulfilling that debt it must provide the care and support that veterans need to participate in education or employment, or to achieve economic wellbeing and sustainability. This represents, I believe, the governments acknowledgement of the least that we can do.The second part of the bill provides the government with the ability to go further. By authorising the production of visible symbols of service, including the lapel pin and the veterans card, which will form part of the coalition governments Veterans Recognition Program, we will make it easier for individuals and organisations to provide extra acknowledgment in veterans day-to-day lives. This may be as simple as a thank you in the street or a seat given up on the train, but it might include discounts, concessions or other special offers made by businesses and organisations in the community. With the proposed covenant, a uniquely Australian oath in its unpretentious simplicity, this bill also provides a means for all of us to buy into these same commitments. Alongside our government, alongside businesses and community groups, the covenant gives ordinary Australians the opportunity to give thanks and to acknowledge the debt we all owe to our service men and women.Ive sought in my own way in my electorate of Fisher to create more opportunities to acknowledge our veterans. In the process I have encountered one of the very challenges that this bill will overcome. On 11 October last year I held the first annual Sunshine Coast Veterans Day. I worked closely with Fisher and national icon Australia Zoo to provide free entry to the zoo for a day for all veterans and their partners. I received significant support from our local RSLs, including, especially, the nearby Glasshouse Country RSL sub branch and local veterans organisation Wet Vets. Mates4Mates held their regular catch-up at Australia Zoo. In total, hundreds of former service men and women visited the zoo to enjoy the unique wildlife experiences throughout the day. Im grateful to Wes Mannion, Bill Ferguson and the Irwin family of Australia Zoo and to Jamie Hope of Wet Vets for helping me organise the day.Im delighted to say that weve already set up and announced the second annual Sunshine Coast Veterans Day, on Monday 28 October. This year the Minister for Veterans Affairs himself will be joining us on the day to share the experience and chat to our service men and women past and present. Once again, I want to thank the zoo and our local RSLs, especially Brian Machin, Wendy and Dave Siebrecht and Nick Shelley of the Glasshouse Country RSL sub branch, for helping me to promote the event. Ill be having a stall at the zoo. Id encourage current and former service men and women, whether they live on the Sunshine Coast or not, to come along, enjoy the zoos terrific experiences for free and pop by my stand and say hello.The Sunshine Coast Veterans Day has received terrific goodwill and support from everyone involved, but we have faced challenges in putting it together. Perhaps the most important has been appropriately identifying veterans. Without a universal identification card its been difficult to create a clear and appropriate means of confirming their status. We had no desire to challenge veterans or to grill them on their service, nor did we want any confusion among the zoos many ticket desk workers as to eligibility for the scheme. In the end, last year, it was necessary to trust to common sense and to the communitys goodwill. The provision in the bill before us today for a single, clearly marked veterans card will make this process significantly easier for everyone in future years. The veterans card, the veterans covenant and the lapel pin are simple, practical and timely measures that will enable our community and local businesses to get behind the recognition of veterans and easily offer them the thanks that they deserve. I urge them to do just that.Before I close, I want to acknowledge once again the work of my constituent Graeme Mickelberg and his son, the hardworking state member for Buderim, Brent Mickelberg. Graeme and Brent both served in the Australian Army and have been tireless proponents of greater recognition for veterans for many years. Brent has consistently highlighted the challenges of transition for recent veterans and has spoken movingly in the Queensland parliament about post-traumatic stress disorder, which made his own return to civilian life so very difficult. Graeme is a passionate man whose insistence and tenacious advocacy is impossible to ignore. After 40 years of service as an infantry officer at home and overseas, he is as knowledgeable as he is determined, and he deserves a great deal of credit for helping to bring about the bill before us today.As far back as May 2013, Graeme wrote in the Sunshine Coasts Hinterland Times that Australia would be well served to consider a military covenant that recognises the unique nature of military service and enhances the respect accorded to Defence Force members and veterans. Since then both Graeme and Brent have joined me in Canberra to meet with the Minister for Veterans Affairs and have been a very active part of supporting the development of this veterans recognition program. I know that Graeme and Brent will be very pleased to see this bill making progress today. I want to thank them for their hard work on behalf of veterans on the Sunshine Coast and all over Australia.On behalf of everyone here today in this place, I would like to honour all of those on the Sunshine Coast and all over Australia who serve or who have served in our nations armed forces. We thank you for your service, and we remember their families, who have lived with separation and often with fear of what may come. This bill contains not only a landmark acknowledgment on behalf of the government of our responsibility to honour that service but practical steps to help our community to go further. In the words of the new Australian Defence Veterans Covenant: for what they have done, this we will do. I commend the bill to the House.","Australian Veterans Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WALLACE (Fisher) ","(19:10):"
290,0,0,0,1,1,"Mitchell, Brian, MP",129164,"Lyons","ALP","N/A",4808," Imagine a country where a man or a woman who has served their country in uniform requires assistance from the government and gets it without having to jump through a tortuous serious of loops; where veterans can call the DVA and get hold of someone straightaway who then goes out of their way to help that veteran in every way they can, who regularly stays in touch to keep that veteran informed of the progress of their concern—a country where the DVA treats every veteran with courtesy and respect. We are not in that country yet, but it is hoped that the passage of this bill will get us closer to it. Labor are supporting the Australian Veterans’ Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019, just as we did when it came before the parliament in the weeks before the 18 May election. We all hoped, back in April, that it would get through the parliament before the election, but, unfortunately, that did not happen. Im pleased the government saw fit to place the bill back on the parliamentary schedule on 4 July so that its measures can finally become law.Labor does continue to harbour concerns that this bill does not cover currently serving personnel, but in the interests of bipartisanship and a speedy resolution, particularly as the bill has the support of the veterans community, Labor is backing the bill without amendment. Importantly, this bill establishes the Australian Defence Veterans Covenant. As members are aware, back in September 2018, eight months before the election, Labor announced that, if we were to win government, we would establish a military covenant based on the UK Armed Forces Covenant. In February of this year, the government presented its own version, absent the provisions for currently serving personnel.The bill is symbolic. It enshrines in legislation the social contract established at the end of World War I for the nation to honour and look after our veterans. It does not create or give rise to any new legal rights or obligations and does not allow veterans to revisit or re-litigate previous cases or causes—for example, around claims for compensation. The key difference between our promise on this side and the covenant the government subsequently put to the parliament is that ours would have also covered current Defence personnel and their families. Labor do stand by our view that excising current serving personnel from the covenant is a mistake, but we have no wish to put obstacles in the way of a bill that we otherwise strongly support and which we would have enacted if we were in government. In addition, Labor would have preferred to see in the covenant a requirement for annual reporting in the form of an official statement to the parliament on how the government is meeting its obligation to current and ex-serving personnel. Good intentions are one thing, but the prospect of shortcomings being exposed can serve as a handy incentive to action.Tasmania has a strong history of involvement in Australias Defence Force and military activities. In World War I, approximately 15,000 men and some women went to war, from a small population of just over 200,000 people. Today, that would be like 37,500 Tasmanians signing up—the combined populations of all the men, women and children in the towns of Sorell, Brighton, Longford, St Helens, New Norfolk, Deloraine, Bridgewater, Prospect Vale, Campbell Town, Sheffield, Westbury, Swansea, Cressy and Richmond in my electorate. Tasmanians again showed their mettle in World War II, Vietnam and the host of conflicts that have come since. And Tasmanias military history is a rich one. Fourteen Tasmanians have been awarded a Victoria Cross for their valour in the face of the enemy. In fact, the first two VCs awarded to Australians were awarded to Tasmanians. My own electorate of Lyons, a vast agricultural seat, is home to a number of Victoria Cross recipients, notably John Bisdee, Walter Brown, Lewis McGee, Harry Murray, James Newland and Percy Statton. Many of the small communities in my electorate remember with sadness and pride the departure of so many sons and the fact some never returned.Ive visited the Woodsdale Museum in the Midlands. Housed in an old schoolhouse built in 1884, the museum, founded by a group of enthusiastic history buffs and run entirely by volunteers, has been transformed through state, local and federal government grants, and it features heavily the regions contribution to the Australian war effort. Collected over time, the volunteers now have portraits of almost all the men and women who left this very small community to go to war. There are halls throughout my electorate with similar memorabilia.Brighton has a long history as a military town. Troops destined for the Boer War and World War I trained in paddocks near the Jordan River, and a permanent camp site was built in October 1939 to train enlisted men. Sadly, the Brighton army barracks no longer exists, having been burnt down. Those who went to fight in later wars, particularly the Korean and Vietnam wars, also used this site for training. Although the camp burned down, the sites gates still stand, and a sculpture by local sculptor Folko Kooper has been erected just outside them in remembrance of the young men who marched through the gates as they headed overseas.Recently, I had the opportunity to support an application under the Stronger Communities Program for funding a statue in Magra, a small town just outside New Norfolk. This was for two local brothers, the Harris boys, who gave their lives in World War I and who now, proudly, have statues remembering their service looking over the local CWA hall carved out of cypress pines that were dying.But, for a nation that shows such deserved pride in our military history and the contributions of so many men and women, we have failed utterly to look after those who make it home. This bill sets out to redress that failure, and I hope its enough. But, if its not enough, we must stand ready to do more and without delay. My office has been working with Brett, a veteran whos applied for invalidity benefits due to a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. During his service, Brett, a highly specialised soldier who received high commendations and who lived for his service, regularly jumped from planes. His last jump caused an injury, leaving him unfit for operational duties.Debate interrupted.","Australian Veterans Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/subdebate.1[3]/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) ","(19:23):"

292,0,0,0,1,1,"Wilson, Josh, MP",265970,"Fremantle","ALP","N/A",4810," There is a waste crisis in Australia that has been brought into focus by the decision taken by China and other countries to stop receiving our plastic rubbish. The import ban has been driven by the recognition in China and elsewhere that a number of so-called recycling operations in those countries have in fact been burning or dumping a significant amount of plastic. So, while the immediate alarm is about the current stockpiling of plastic here and even the prospect of seeing freight containers of plastic rubbish returned, we should be concerned that for years we have blithely sent our rubbish away to be dealt with on a very poorly regulated basis in less developed countries, almost certainly to their environmental detriment.The current import ban has shown our inability to reprocess and recycle plastic in Australia other than on a very small scale. We need to do a lot better at every step of the waste reduction hierarchy. We need to use less; we need to re-use and recycle more. Thats going to require leadership and investment and regulatory reform. There is a great deal of community interest in seeing this occur, but it will not happen by itself. It will not happen through voluntary schemes. Its not going to be driven by some obvious market imperative or cost signal, because they dont exist. Thats precisely why plastic waste in particular represents a gross market failure.On current trends, there will be twice as much plastic produced in 2025 as there is in 2019, and each year up to 15 million tonnes of plastic is poured into our oceans, with a devastating effect on our marine life. As the shadow assistant minister for the environment, I have benefited from meeting with a series of industry stakeholders, including the Boomerang Alliance and the Australian Council for Recycling, among others. There is no doubt that our recycling industry is ready, willing and able to be part of major change led by government, if government can get on that path. There are businesses already showing what is possible. The other day I had the opportunity to visit Advanced Plastic Recycling, which has developed a wood-plastic composite that can be extruded into fence posts, bollards and decking at its plant in Adelaide. Companies like this need the support of positive procurement policies to underwrite demand. At the moment, where that does occur, its coming from local and state government.As in other policy areas, the coalition government has not done enough in the last six years to build on the national waste strategy and related reforms that were commenced under the Labor government. We now confront a waste crisis, and the question is whether the government will do something about it. Im glad the Prime Minister has declared it will be a priority, but Im concerned about the level of commitment to getting on with meaningful reform. Just as the government has had its belated waste awakening, we did learn last week that the PM had cancelled the December COAG meeting that was supposed to reach an agreement with the states on a strategy to stop waste exports.We know the so-called recycling investment plan is predominantly bulked out with prepackaged or repackaged funds. The hundred million dollars in the Australian Recycling Investment Fund consists of nothing more than a fresh label on existing clean energy finance moneys. The $16 million over six years for the Pacific Ocean Litter Project has been drawn out of an already diminished regional Pacific fund within our aid budget. Under the governments plan, there is unfortunately no direct funding for recycling infrastructure and no leadership on a national container deposit or a ban on single-use plastic bags, both of which are being pursued at the moment by several state governments. There is no sign of the product stewardship scheme review, which weve been waiting for for some time, and there is certainly no reform when it comes to product stewardship more generally. And there is no commitment, as yet, to government procurement of recycled materials.Since the middle of the year, tackling waste has been touted as one of the governments signature policy objectives. Thats a good thing, but I think in the Prime Ministers case its been for the sake of distraction more than anything that, on the one hand, he has claimed that combating ocean plastic is a more important and immediate issue than climate change and, on the other hand, that Australia is somehow a leader in the reduction of ocean plastic through innovation. At the moment, neither of those things is true. What is true is that, until we see an effective form of national leadership, with corresponding action, Australia will continue to lag behind when it comes to waste reduction and resource management. That impacts on our environment, and it holds us back from the manufacturing and design innovation that should be the source of new jobs and economic activity in this country. It should be the basis of regional leadership in addressing the terrible scourge of ocean plastic, and that is taking its toll on our environment. It will ultimately take its toll on our health.","Waste Management and Recycling","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JOSH WILSON (Fremantle) ","(19:30):"
293,0,0,0,1,1,"McIntosh, Melissa, MP",281513,"Lindsay","LP","N/A",4812," Menzies, Howard, Morrison: last week, the Liberal Party celebrated our 75th anniversary. In my maiden speech I mentioned that Lindsay is in so many ways a microcosm of the Australian community. Its got families; its got retired people; its got lots and lots of small businesses; and its got a very strong community spirit. These are the words of former Prime Minister John Howard OM AC on his visit to Lindsay during the campaign—and, as Ive said before, former Prime Minister Howard is always right: From Menzies forgotten people to Howards battlers to Morrisons quiet Australians, Lindsay has been and will remain a microcosm of Australia. From working for former Prime Minister Howard to working with Prime Minister Morrison, it is now my responsibility to ensure the hardworking, aspirational people of Lindsay continue to be listened to and fought for.Almost 70 years ago, Australia elected the first Liberal government. Since then, we have witnessed Dame Enid Lyons enter the House of Representatives and serve in cabinet, and Neville Bonner and Minister Ken Wyatt, our first ever Indigenous cabinet minister and Minister for Indigenous Australians.Sir Robert Menzies extended an invitation to my dad in the early 1950s to come to Australia from a little town in Austria called Graz. In my early twenties, I worked for former Prime Minister John Howard, and he supported me during our recent campaign. Now, as I have said, I have the privilege of working with Prime Minister Morrison.Since 2013, the Morrison government has been getting on with the job of delivering jobs for Australians. Since coming to government, we have created nearly 1.5 million jobs. In Western Sydney alone, the Morrison governments $5.3 billion infrastructure investment will see 11,000 jobs created during construction of the Nancy Bird Walton international airport, and 28,000 jobs after opening. Our partnership and collaboration with the New South Wales government will mean that over 200,000 jobs will be created as part of the Western Sydney City Deal. Thats just the beginning.I speak a lot about the commute I did from my home into the city—over 15 hours a week over 10 years. Every day, 300,000 people commute out of Western Sydney for their jobs. As Ive said before, my story isnt unique, particularly in Lindsay. Its about family, opportunities, aspiration, wanting a good job and working hard to get ahead for your family. I think this has always been the Lindsay way. The Morrison government are creating jobs for those people, and locally were working on collaborative projects such as the Lindsay Jobs of the Future Forum, to prepare our local kids for those jobs that are coming in science, advanced manufacturing and even the space industry, as part of this great infrastructure investment by the Morrison government. As the Prime Minister said last week: There are more people in work today than at any other time in our history. And for more than 30 years, we have the lowest level of welfare dependence of the working-age population than any other time in that period.Having worked at the US Studies Centre leading a think-tank program, I know that the Liberal government has always had a very strong relationship with the United States over our 75 years—and our relationship with the United States is stronger than ever. Since we first forged a partnership at the Battle of Hamel in 1918, we have worked closely on our economic and security relationship while holding the same values and commitment to peace, prosperity and liberty. As our largest economic partner, the investment between Australia and the US is worth more than $1.2 trillion and it supports hundreds of thousands of jobs. We recently announced a partnership with the US on space and science and technology breakthroughs, and our two-way trade has grown almost 60 per cent since we signed the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement. I was lucky enough to meet with US Chamber of Commerce representatives last month and discuss our very positive relationship. Our government is unlocking the potential between our two great countries, and this has been important for well over 75 years.Australians elected our government to ease the cost-of-living pressures and unlock the potential here in Australia and with our international friends, including the US. I look forward to continuing to work for my community as we celebrate these 75 years of our Liberal Party.","Liberal Party of Australia: 75th Anniversary, Morrison Government","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs McINTOSH (Lindsay) ","(19:35):"
294,0,0,0,1,1,"Zappia, Tony, MP","HWB","Makin","ALP","N/A",4813," For over two decades, Murray-Darling Basin communities have struggled with uncertainty constantly hanging over them. A combination of prolonged droughts, restricted water supplies, volatile water prices, water theft, water diversions, fluctuating commodity prices and ongoing disagreement between regions and states over water plans have all contributed to their woes. Like a growing world population competing for diminishing resources, too many vested interests are competing for diminishing water in the Murray-Darling Basin. In parts of the basin, the uncertainty has never been greater. Water supplies are critically low and could run out before the years end.The unprecedented fish deaths in the Darling are a confronting reality of the crisis being faced. The report by the Academy of Science into the fish deaths did not attribute the deaths solely to drought or climate change. In particular, the report highlighted a reduction of around 50 per cent in annual flows in some places on the river because of on-farm harvesting of water. The report also noted that the Menindee Lakes were full in 2016. That raises questions about the management and, in particular, the draining of Menindee Lakes by New South Wales authorities.There are also questions about the accuracy of water inflow and extraction data. Water volumes are assumed to be accurate when in reality they are best estimates based on one or more assumptions. Whilst wrong assumptions are not necessarily intentional, estimates can be and possibly have been exaggerated to justify water-saving grants for various projects.The basin has been and, in the view of many, continues to be poorly managed, with each of the states and water regions operating differently. Of greater concern, the 2012 Murray-Darling Basin Plan has been consistently undermined by competing vested interests. It has not been allowed to be rolled out as planned. Likewise, creating a water market has allowed speculators to manipulate the price of water and profiteer at the expense of desperate farmers who are forced to pay up to $800 per megalitre of water. Only water users should have right to buy water, and the market prices should be regulated. Recommendation 9 of the governments 2014 independent review of the Water Act makes reference to regulation of the water market. The recommendation was not followed through by the government, and I have little faith that the recently announced ACCC inquiry will restore stability into the price or supply of water. The decision by the government to abolish the National Water Commission in 2014, which Labor did not support, was short-sighted. Had the commission still existed, market manipulation may have been prevented and the water allocations would have been better managed.Regardless of mistakes over the years, considerable investments have to date been made by food growers and farmers throughout the basin. Peoples life savings, their future and the future of whole communities are at stake. Their concerns are real. I note the growing calls for more inquiries and even a royal commission into the basin. My view is that there have been enough inquiries and that the underlying causes of the Basin Plan uncertainty are well known. The report of the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin Royal Commission, which regrettably was not fully cooperated with by all parties and whose report has been completely ignored, nevertheless comprehensively outlines the problems with the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. What is required is an independent, non-political, non-partisan body to assist the implementation of the Basin Plan to date, to have the authority to make any necessary changes to the plan, to factor in climate change, and to set out a long-term strategy that provides stability and fairness to all communities across the basin.Ultimately the plan will only work if every community is committed to it, and that will only occur if every community has confidence in it. Over two million Australians live within the basin, and it produces more than 39 per cent of Australias gross value in agricultural production. For some basin communities, the situation is dire. Farmers are already walking away from the land, their lives shattered. These are real people, with dependent family members. They deserve better. They dont need patronising words or more time-wasting inquiries. They need a government that stands with them, and a Basin Plan that they can have confidence in. For South Australians, being at the end of the system and dependent on upstream inflows, a sustainable plan is critical.","Murray-Darling Basin","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ZAPPIA (Makin) ","(19:40):"
295,0,0,0,1,1,"Martin, Fiona, MP",282982,"Reid","LP","N/A",4814," I would like to take this opportunity to update the House on a number of major projects in Reid, some of which the Morrison government committed to in the recent federal election.I consider myself fortunate to represent a community that loves sport and loves to be active, and I hold these values close to my heart too. It is incredibly important that our local sporting facilities offer residents and families the opportunity to have an active lifestyle, cultivate friendships and connect with the community through sporting organisations.I recently attended the opening of new facilities at Blair Park in Croydon. The federal government invested $1.3 million in the project, and has worked with Burwood Council and Burwood Football Club to see the project come to fruition. The upgrade has provided new field lighting, a new clubhouse with storage space, a picnic shelter and a playground. Burwood Football Club has not been the only one to benefit from the new facilities. Local schools will be able to use the park to host sporting carnivals and other school sports events. The new upgrades to playground equipment and a purpose-built bocce court have also been well received by local families in the area.Im also pleased to report that, in September, work began on a $1.6 million amenities upgrade for Cintra Park Netball Courts in Concord. The federal government has dedicated $1.2 million to the project, which was a key part of the Morrison governments 2019 election commitments to key sporting infrastructure in Reid. To have already broken ground on such a significant project only months after the election speaks to the commitment of our government to deliver for residents of Reid.The amenities upgrade will include a new canteen, covered spectator areas, change rooms, a medical room and new administration spaces. I am pleased to be working with Canada Bay council and local sporting organisations to see this project through from start to finish. The Inner Western Suburbs Netball Association are thrilled to see the swift progress on the amenities upgrade, as their membership has increased to 3,700 members, from five-year-olds to senior players. This is a big win for women in our area, as the majority of netball players are girls and young women.Works at Strathfield Park have also commenced, after Strathfield Council received $1 million to update their amenities block. The new upgrade will provide male and female change rooms and toilets, kitchens, serving facilities, meeting rooms, outdoor seating and scoreboards. These new facilities will accommodate the growing number of people using the park recreationally or for sporting games. It has been a pleasure to work with both Strathfield Council and the Strathfield Strikers to deliver these outstanding results. I have visited the club to celebrate the end of their season, and heard from parents how much of a difference these facilities will make to their kids. I can also report that work on a number of other projects in Reid, including at Goddard Park and Timbrell Park, will be commencing soon.I am passionate about improving our local sporting facilities, because participation in sport strengthens physical and mental wellbeing. These projects will help deliver fit-for-purpose amenities buildings to support the growth of local sporting groups across the electorate. I am particularly pleased that, with these upgrades, for the first time in many of these facilities, girls and women will have access to the same changing rooms and amenities as their fellow male players. It is fantastic that the Morrison government is supporting womens growing participation in sports by ensuring that all local facilities can be accessible and gender inclusive.I am proud to be part of a government that continually invests in our local communities through sport, and I look forward to seeing these projects roll out across Reid, knowing that their positive impact will be widely felt. I will update the House as projects progress.","Reid Electorate: Sports Infrastructure","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr MARTIN (Reid) ","(19:45):"

I certainly think that Cowan is one of the best electorates in Australia, and I want to use the incredible privilege that I have here to advocate on behalf of the people of Cowan. I know that many of us come here and find its a great forum for us to celebrate the achievements of people in our electorates, but tonight I want to talk about some of those people who dont get mentioned—people who havent won medals or any major competitions, but who, in many ways, probably need us to talk about them more.There are people like Belinda, whos a grandparent but also a single parent. Shes working full time and raising her two grandchildren. She was referred to my office by Grandparents Rearing Grandchildren after her nine-year-old grandson was rejected for the NDIS. My office helped her to appeal the case, and now her grandson is eligible for the NDIS and finally they are receiving the help that they need. I know that all members have cases like that of Belinda.Then there is the case of Caroline. She owed $740.90 to Centrelink, calculated as an overpayment on family tax benefit. The debt was written off in February and they advised Caroline of this in writing, but then, just in August, they intercepted her tax return and took the $740.90 without notifying her. Her presentation at my office meant that she got that full refund back.Then there is Sunali. She is a single mum and a survivor of domestic violence. Her son has just turned eight, so she has been moved onto Newstart, which means that her income is now smaller than before, but she is in her final year of undertaking a degree in speech pathology, and she has got some massive requirements to complete her degree. As a single mum myself, who did a postgraduate degree, a Masters degree and then later a PhD as a single mum, I understand how much the commitments of work and study can be, as well as the commitments of family, particularly when there has been family violence and particularly when, as is the case with Sunali, there has been trauma.Then there is Sally. Sally is such a beautiful lady. She came into my office. She is 75 years old. Unfortunately, Sally is a victim of cybercrime. Unaware, she was duped by somebody in a $60,000 romance scam. She lost her house and $60,000. I often say to people, Nobodys ever won the Mexican lottery, and there are no Nigerian princes waiting to marry us, so be cyberaware and be cybersafe. Currently were helping Sally with the issues that she has from being scammed through this cybercrime scheme.Gosh—Jason. He is 29 years old. He was born with some severe physical disabilities. A few years ago he was told he was no longer eligible for a disability support pension and he has been on Newstart since. Because he couldnt complete school because of his disabilities and being away from school so much, he really has no prospect of finding a job and hes finding it really difficult on Newstart.Joy contacted me. She looks after her grandson whos nine years old. Her grandsons mum is a single parent on Centrelink benefits. Joys grandson needs spectacles and she simply cant afford them.Finally, Id like to talk about Pat and Troy in my electorate who recently found out that their gorgeous son Lachie has type I diabetes. Of course Im an advocate for the JDRF, the juvenile diabetes research fund, and Ive been to visit Pat and Troy to help them through that transition of being parents of a child with T1.Theyre just some examples of people in my electorate, and I hope that their voices get heard too.","Cowan Electorate: Pensions and Benefits","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALY (Cowan) ","(19:49):"

Diwali symbolises the spiritual victory of good over evil, light over dark and knowledge over ignorance. Diwali runs for five days. It is a beautiful display of Indian culture, often seeing women beautifully dressed, and homes and community centres brightly lit. On Saturday, I took the opportunity to celebrate Diwali with the Indian Senior Citizens Association of Victoria, which is based in my electorate. It was great to visit the association again, since my election. The Indian Senior Citizens Association of Victoria started in 1995 with only a handful of people—about six or seven. Two years later, in 1997, the organisation formally established themselves and they have been going strong ever since. The organisation has grown to hundreds of members and they make some amazing and valuable contributions to both the Indian community in Chisolm and the wider Chisolm community today.Saturdays celebration was filled with traditional music, dancing and great food. However, I still managed to speak to members of the organisation and hear their thoughts and concerns. Some of the guests I spoke to have called Australia home for over 40 years, while others had only recently come to Australia. Regardless of who I spoke to, there was one common thing in all their stories. Like many migrants, they all came to Australia to build a better life for themselves and, most importantly, for their children.We as Australians should be proud of the fact that our way of life draws people from all over the globe to settle here. Many of the guests that I spoke to had migration stories that resonated with mine. I came to Australia 34 years ago. I was a student with no money, no family, no friends and very little English. Like many migrants, I came here with a determination to succeed. I raised my children in this country and I worked immensely hard to start my own business, as so many migrants do. I was actively involved in my local community, and my passion to make Australia a great place to live in is what has brought me here to this place in which I am speaking to you today.Australia embraced me and provided me with countless opportunities, and I know that the coalition government will continue to work tirelessly to provide opportunities for migrants to succeed. As the Prime Minister says, If you have a go, you get a go. Migrants, after all, are an important part of why Australia is the great place to live that it is today, and we should all work together so that we can continue to contribute and make Australia an even better place to live into the future.This story is not unique to me or to the Indian community of my electorate. It is the story of many migrants around Australia, who have come from different parts of the world. Whether migrants of today or from a few generations back, we can all proudly call this great country home.

Bert is the sort of bloke who deserves to have his name and his story etched into the record of this place. Bert was born almost 104 years ago and hes still with us; hes still ticking. Hes a pretty extraordinary bloke. Hes the oldest member of the Labor Party, at least in the Bankstown area. Hes the oldest member of Bankstown RSL. Hes been a member now for 58 years. He was the oldest veteran to march in the Anzac parade in Sydney this year. Hes part of that very special generation of Australians that helped to fight, defend and save Australia in our darkest hour, and it cost him. He was hit by shrapnel but survived.Hes a pretty tough bloke, old Bert. He didnt just survive the war; he didnt just survive being hit by shrapnel. He had a heart attack a couple of years ago and he survived that. He has had a stroke and he has survived that. Two years ago he was diagnosed with stage 4 malignant melanoma. The tumour had spread to his brain, liver, bones and lungs, and he survived that. Hes the oldest Australian to survive melanoma, to survive skin cancer, through the use of a special drug called Keytruda. I went over to see Bert on Friday. Its important that the chamber knows that, as well as being a tough bloke, hes also a very gentle and loving bloke. I asked him: Whats the secret to a long life? He said two things: first, dont eat too much and, second, be nice to everybody.Tomorrow is my little boy Jacks third birthday, and Bert, who is 100 years older than him, has made him a music box for his birthday. And Bert got a present himself last week. Theres an organisation that its important the chamber knows about called Quilts of Valour Australia. Set up about eight years ago, it makes quilts, as the name suggests. They can take months to make. They cost hundreds of dollars to make. Theyre made by volunteers and, over the last few years, theyve produced over 1,000 for veterans and their families here in Australia and for veterans serving overseas. Last week, Bert finally got his. Its a beautiful quilt, and its a beautiful gesture for such a wonderful man as he heads into his 104th year—a man that Im very fortunate to call my friend.","Collins, Mr Bert, Quilts of Valour Australia","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CLARE (Blaxland) ","(10:30):"

I visited the club while it was under construction and enjoyed its official opening on Anzac Day this year, and it looks great. After two years without a permanent home, its satisfying to see the City of Mandurah RSL with their own home again. Thanks and recognition must go to the Mandurah Bowling and Recreation Club, who hosted the RSL during their sojourn. Im pleased to note the assistance of the Morrison government by way of an $8,400 grant for the installation of CCTV, alarms and lighting. This was an important part of the new build. Its great to see the government getting alongside the City of Mandurah RSL. It may seem a small thing but it did make a difference to the sub-branch.I was also pleased to recently present the Mandurah RSL with some modern memorabilia. A little while ago they approached me for some memorabilia that would reflect younger veterans experiences and would also help complete the historical narrative. Of course, we celebrate World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam, so I was able to provide the club with four framed photos taken by my ASLAV gunner, Brenden, from our tour in 2009, as well as a painting by Stan from the SAS picturing two 1 Squadron operators. Brenden is now a surf photographer based in Wollongong, and you can check him out his handle on Instagram @beejonroy. Its great; hes a very talented photographer.I want to note for the chamber that the City of Mandurah RSL has also been successful in its application for a further $4,870 under the federal governments Building Excellence in Support and Training grant program. The government provided $4.115 million nationally under the most recent round of the BEST grants scheme, which is divided proportionally among the ex-service organisations that apply. The BEST grants are important as part of the commitment to support ex-service organisations and our contribution towards the costs incurred in providing advocacy services to the veterans communities.Finally, I want to congratulate Mr Dave Mabbs, the newly elected president of the City of Mandurah RSL. Dave has been an active member of the sub-branch for many years and is a fine choice for this position. I particularly want to note his service every Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, organising official events. I also acknowledge the outgoing president, Mr Brian Dillon, for his service and leadership in this role through a very busy and demanding time for the sub-branch. Congratulations to Dave and Brian for their service, both to our country and uniform but also to our local community through the Mandurah RSL sub-branch.","City of Mandurah Returned and Services League of Australia Sub-branch","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HASTIE (Canning) ","(10:32):"

This is what it looks like when our journalists say, Enough! to a government fighting media freedom and the publics right to know. As a Labor politician and an avid newspaper reader, I believe a strong and independent media is vital to holding governments—and oppositions, for that matter—to account. The Right to Know coalition is an historic, united campaign fighting for press freedom. We know that police raids on media offices and the homes of journalists right here in Canberra should not be the norm. We know the country deserves better than a Prime Minister who is loose with the truth and who repeatedly avoids answering even the simplest questions that attempt to hold him to account in his office.To the Prime Minister I say: accountability isnt a bubble issue. Nine out of 10 Australians tell survey researchers they value transparency. Only four out of 10 say its happening right now. And, sadly, this is not a new issue for this third-term government. Under this Prime Minister, weve seen the government refuse to answer questions from journalists and from members of the public. Extraordinarily, when asked questions about the raids in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, the communications minister interrupted a third question to state, To be honest with you, Ive said about as much as Im going to say on this topic, and, if thats the only thing youre interested in talking about, then probably Ill draw the interview to an end. They wont even talk about their attempts to silence the truth. Weve seen the government ignore its legal obligations to provide information under freedom-of-information laws. Weve seen them use criminal law to intimidate people who embarrass them. Its not acceptable in Australia. Its not acceptable in any democracy.My Labor colleagues and I stand shoulder to shoulder with the Right to Know coalition. We want the government to rule out prosecution of Dan Oakes, Sam Clark and Annika Smethurst. We want better protection for journalists whose only so-called crime is doing their jobs. We want whistleblowers protected and we want the government to answer questions put to it. This isnt a campaign for the self-interest of journalists; its a campaign for democracy and for the right of every Australian to know the truth. To quote the Right To Know campaign, When government keeps the truth from you, what are they covering up?","Media","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"

We have groups, from students to corporations, fighting to understand or change the world to make it a better place every day. I could talk about many locals and the difference they are making to improve our lives, but today I would like to focus on one very special person. I would like to congratulate a local resident of Bennelong who has conducted some extraordinary research into diseases and has been recognised with one of the countrys highest prizes. Associate Professor Elizabeth New has pioneered the development of new chemical imaging tools to observe healthy and diseased cells. For this she is the worthy recipient of the Malcolm McIntosh Prize for Physical Scientist of the Year, a prize which was awarded at the Prime Ministers Prizes for Science in the Great Hall last week. I was very proud to see her there to accept this illustrious award.Associate Professor New has developed molecules that act as fluorescent sensors, emitting light to make the observation of complex chemical processes within cells possible. This will assist in the identification of potential treatments for diseases associated with ageing, for cardiovascular cancer and for diabetes, an important breakthrough considering that these diseases affect 50 per cent of the Australian population and contribute to 85 per cent of deaths. The imaging tools are revealing the critical role of copper in metabolic processes, new insights into cisplatin based anticancer drugs, and the study of oxidative stress in cells. Associate Professor New has an outstanding body of work, including 70 referred publications, with more than 50 as first or lead author; nearly 40 invitations to lecture at major conferences; and more than $5 million in research grants and $1.4 million in equipment grants. She is an award-winning teacher and mentor and has donated a significant amount of time to professional science organisations.I spoke to the associate professor about the use of copper in treating progressively debilitating diseases like Parkinsons and motor neurone disease. My personal interest in this comes from the strange correlation between tennis players and MND. I have lost a number of close friends to this condition and Im passionate about any steps towards finding a cure. A few years ago, I walked around the electorate raising money for motor neurone disease, and I am heartened by reports that copper is being used in a manner to slow the spread of this condition. From a personal as well as a professional perspective, I cannot thank the associate professor enough for the research that she is doing in making our lives better.","New, Associate Professor Elizabeth","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALEXANDER (Bennelong) ","(10:38):"

To my surprise and delight he was kind enough to invite me around for morning tea in his house in Medina, so I went along and had a great old chinwag with David and his lovely daughter Lynne. It was a pleasure to chat with David and to share some stories about how the community in which I was born and grew up has changed over the years. He has lived in Medina for a very long time. I was born in Calista, the nearby suburb, also a very long time ago. David, like my dad, worked at the BP refinery and recalls giving my dad a lift home once from the CBD down to Shoalwater Bay after a Red Cross donors lunch in the city—so its a small world, over many decades. Id like to thank David and Lynne for the kind invitation to come over to their home and to enjoy some lamingtons and a lovely morning tea. Happy birthday, David, and many more years to come.Later that day, I also went to the official opening of the WA BMX championships at the Southern Districts BMX club, also in Medina. Id like to thank BMX Sports WA for inviting me along, particularly President Warren Edwardes and the whole BMX WA board; my state colleague Pierre Yang, MLC; Kwinana mayor Carol Adams; and those councillors from the City of Kwinana that came along. It was an amazing day, with 500 people packed around the outside of a great BMX track. People came from far and wide across what is a massive state, from Mandurah and Busselton in the south, all the way up to Port Hedland and Geraldton in the north. I hope you had a great weekend of competition. I even enjoyed the minicross, which is a group of fearless two- and three-year-olds—would you believe it?—going across a bike track. The boys and girls were having a real whale of a time, increasing their coordination and having good fun. They went round that track again and again—there was no stopping them. Congratulations to everyone that participated.Also, when I was last in the electorate, I went to the City of Rockingham Pioneers Luncheon. This is a celebratory lunch that pays tribute to those long-serving and long-term residents of the City of Rockingham that have been in the district for 50 years or more and have contributed to the community that we call home. I want to acknowledge the City of Rockingham for putting on this great event that acknowledges longstanding citizens of the city. My mum, Diana Morris, is a pioneer of Rockingham; along with her friend Fay Winter; old family friends Pearl Warner and Dr Bob Warner, who has served the community for many, many decades; and Lori Smith and Nola Smith. I want to thank them and all the pioneers of the city of Rockingham for the contribution they have made to our great community over so long. They enjoyed the lunch and got to reminisce about old times. It was a pleasure to be there, along with the Premier, Mark McGowan.

Its because time spent sitting in traffic is far better spent either at work being productive or at home with friends and family, relaxing after a long days work. Trackless tram is the vision of the City of Stirling, led by Mayor Mark Irwin, whom I congratulate on his re-election over the weekend.The City of Stirling is the largest local government area by population in Western Australia, with 220,000 residents. Over the next 30 years, this population is predicted to grow by 50 per cent. There are already 3,709 vehicles using Scarborough Beach Road every hour, and during peak hour that number accelerates to 5,000 vehicles per hour. Thankfully, the City of Stirling identified this problem early on and for the last decade has been championing the trackless tram project. At stage 1, the federal government has already committed $65 million to the Stephenson Avenue Road Network development, with the state also contributing $60 million. Stage 2 of the plan is to deliver trackless tram from the new Stirling City Centre to the iconic Scarborough Beach along Scarborough Beach Road. It will also link in with heavy rail at Glendalough station.A trackless tram is neither a train nor a bus. It looks like a train but uses electric propulsion and rubber wheels. Its half the weight of a bus, has no carbon or noise emissions, can recharge fully in 10 minutes and, importantly, can transport up to 250 people in three carriages per journey. This is ground-breaking technology that has the potential to transform the way we commute. It will unlock development potential along Scarborough Beach Road, enabling mixed use business and housing hubs.As those at the City of Stirling say, this is a big, bold vision. As we know, the Morrison government also has a big, bold vision for busting congestion, and I, and my neighbouring colleague the member for Curtin, believe in this vision and we are committed to seeing it become a reality. Working along with the City of Stirling, we aim to deliver trackless tram for the many thousands of residents who are set to benefit from this exciting project.","Stirling Electorate: Transport","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CONNELLY (Stirling) ","(10:44):"

For over a decade now, the biennale has been the centrepiece of our citys increasingly busy arts calendar, and with every edition its grown bigger and bigger, reaching out to more and more in our community. Two years ago, over 26,000 visitors came to enjoy the show, each with an unforgettable experience right here in central Victoria. This year, initial estimates suggest that over 35,000 visitors have come to our city during the biennale. Looking at the amount of yellow tote bags around the city and town and further beyond, so many visitors is no surprise at all. These tens of thousands of visitors have come to see the core program of works from world-class artists in world-class settings like the Ballarat fine art gallery and in other formal spaces. But, even beyond the core program, the biennale has truly taken over the entire city.One of the great joys of the biennale comes from the art that you stumble across as you walk into a cafe, a restaurant, a bar or a store, and on the walls of laneways and those cafes are works that stretch beyond your imagination and make you consider those places in a new way. Our laneways, our cafes, our pizzerias, shopping centres, public gardens, churches and even bike stores—just about every imaginable space in Ballarat—have been filled with art. You wander into a space that you know so well and you see incredible art on the walls. It is such a privilege.For this gift to our community, thanks must go particularly to Fiona Sweet and her team of staff and the many volunteers who have made the biennale this year such a fantastic event. I want to thank them personally for all that they have done to the city. Our home is a much more exciting place because of their efforts, their initiative and their hard work. The chances that they have taken with the biennale—putting on an international event such as this is not an easy thing to do—and with the purchase of one of our heritage buildings and the life that theyre now giving to that in the new National Centre for Photography have absolutely transformed our city and the citys art scene forever. Opportunities are being provided for students, particularly from our public schools, to learn photography from some incredibly skilled professionals. Now, with the biennale finishing over the weekend, like the rest of the community I will spend my time looking forward to the next event, in two years time.","Ballarat International Foto Biennale","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[7]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CATHERINE KING (Ballarat) ","(10:47):"

For the year to March, over 700,000 people were reported to have visited the north, up two per cent on the previous year. I may be biased, but, really, why wouldnt you want to visit? One day you could take a walk through the stunning natural beauty of the Cataract Gorge and then enjoy some incredible wine on the Tamar Valley Wine Route and the next day enjoy a dip in the ocean at Bridport and be on the world-class Blue Derby mountain bike trails by the afternoon.Launcestons Cataract Gorge this year hosted over 800 tourism finalists in the Qantas Australian Tourism Awards. To have the prestigious national awards held in a regional city—only the second time it has happened—was a huge coup for the city, led by Rick Marton, whose passion and dedication were crucial in securing the event. A showcase for the incredible food by local restaurants and chefs, including Massimo Mele from Grain of the Silos and Matt Adams from Timbre, naturally our food and wine offering was a highlight, but I was particularly taken by a story that made the event a truly community affair. Organisers realised thered be a bit of a juggle for visitors eating a canape whilst holding a drink and shaking hands, and they called on the talented resources of Mens Sheds at Rocherlea and Ravenswood, who produced 600 handcrafted canape boards for the event. Well done to all of those who made this event such a success.I am also extremely proud of our world-class mountain biking trails in Northern Tasmania. The town of Derby has flourished in recent years as it has become an internationally acclaimed mountain-biking venue, twice hosting the Enduro World Series. The town has grown from strength to strength with the tourism boom. Some homegrown talent includes Tara and Steve Howell, with their award-winning Blue Derby Pods Ride. I commend the Morrison governments investment in regional tourism in Tasmania, including funding for a new Georgetown mountain bike trail.The growth of our tourism offerings is because of the passion and drive of the hardworking people in hundreds of tourism businesses in the north, across accommodation, attractions, food and beverage operations and more. Credit also goes to Tourism Northern Tasmania and the Launceston and Tamar Valley Tourism Association for all the work that they do to support tourism businesses and initiatives in the region. Tasmania produces some of the finest cheese, chocolate, wine, whisky, honey, beef and lamb in the world. We have a growing number of whisky and gin distilleries, cider houses and microbreweries cropping up across Northern Tasmania.

The imminent closure of the Henry Kendall Aged Care facility in Wyoming and the 14-bed dementia unit at the Orchards in Lisarow is unsettling for residents and their carers and families. The Morrison governments failure to meet the demand for home care packages and the shortage of aged-care beds mean those needing residential care, particularly in crisis, may have little or no choice.The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety is shining a light on poor practices in residential aged care. The health and welfare of elderly residents, their families and carers must be paramount. In demanding best practice from aged-care providers—which we must—we must also demand real action from this government. The Morrison government has failed to fix the crisis in home care packages, failed to give the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission adequate powers to keep residents safe and cut $2 billion in funding from the aged-care system. Those cuts, made by then Treasurer Scott Morrison, have left some residential aged-care providers, many in regional and remote communities, struggling to stay afloat. Without proper funding, more closures are likely.Sadly, at least one elderly couple has already been separated by the closure of the dementia unit at the Orchards. The couple purchased a low-care unit in the belief they could move to a high level of care if and when they needed it. Their granddaughter Haley let me know her grandmother had settled into the dementia care unit when her family was informed over the phone that the unit would be closing in October and theyd need to find alternative accommodation for their grandmother. Her grandfather still lives at the Orchards and the family could afford the $500,000 bond to move their grandmother into another facility; however, the distance between the facilities makes visits for the couple very difficult. Haley is very concerned and said, We are worried that if my grandfather starts to show the same symptoms we will need to find him a new home too.The closure of aged-care facilities is a concern, as we have an ageing population on the Central Coast and a shortage of beds, particularly for those living with dementia. Providers need to understand that moving an elderly resident, particularly at this time in their life, is like kicking them out of their own home. The health, relationship, and financial consequences can be devastating for the elderly residents, their families and carers.I speak here today as the patron of the Central Coast Dementia Alliance and as someone whose father lived with dementia. This is urgent. Its a crisis. And this government must act now. They need to act urgently and properly care for elderly Australians.","Dobell Electorate: Aged Care","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[9]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms McBRIDE (Dobell) ","(10:53):"

I was pleased to be able to join around 150 locals at the Davistown waterfront recently for the annual JDRF One Walk to help turn type 1 into type none.Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Australia has invested more than $152 million in research, which will help to improve the day-to-day lives of those who live with type 1 diabetes as well as, we hope, to eventually prevent and cure the condition. The annual JDRF One Walk raises critical funds for clinical research, specifically for trials, employing local researchers in Australia, and accelerating the lab-to-trial stage to allow faster access and greater outcomes.Over the past five years, Ive had the privilege of attending and taking part in the JDRF One Walk on the Central Coast, and every year Ive really been struck by the communitys determination to raise awareness locally and to help find a cure. And so today Id really like to acknowledge the incredible efforts of a number of members of the Central Coast community who are able to not only raise awareness of type 1 diabetes but also help raise much-needed funds for critical research in the future.This year, the JDRF One Walk on the Central Coast managed to raise more than $40,000, and this would not have been possible without the efforts of those who took part in the walk. I acknowledge Maddison Sewell, who was the top individual fundraiser for the walk this year. She managed to raise, individually, more than $2,200 for the walk, and she was among the top 10 fundraisers in New South Wales. Jaynie Moloney is another fantastic local, who raised an amazing $1,700. She got involved after her son Nate was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes over a year ago. She was also part of team Type One-derful, which raised almost $4,000 for the walk. The team from St Josephs Catholic College raised more than $5,400, and I want to pay tribute to the great efforts of Gemma, Liv and Tilly from the Joeys T1 Team. This is an incredible achievement, and something that these students, their parents and their teachers should be very proud of.This fantastic event would not have been possible without the hard work of the wonderful Margaret Sheridan and Helen Quirk, who hosted this years walk. Id like to congratulate you both on another successful year and thank you for your passion, your advocacy and your leadership in making our local community aware of the prevalence of type 1 diabetes. This was highlighted by Margarets own fundraising efforts of more than $1,500, which is an illustration of her ability to consistently lead by example. I thank all of the local families, schools and businesses across the coast who contributed this year. With your contributions, the Central Coast was the second-largest fundraiser in New South Wales.

The south side of Brisbane is particularly diverse. There are many cultures, many ethnicities and many religions. Happily, for the most part my community is a thriving melting pot and the epitome of social harmony. Sadly, there are people both in the community and in this very parliament who want to destroy the social harmony that exists in our communities. For some time now, gutless, nasty individuals have targeted religious minorities across Australia. I would suggest that these individuals are encouraged by politicians, commentators and others with a public platform who want to destroy the social cohesion that we are so proud of in my community—in fact, in every community.Some recent incidents have shaken the south side to its core and will have a lasting impact on those involved. The exposure draft of the Morrison governments religious freedom bill purports to provide freedom for individuals to manifest their religious belief and practice in their speech and in their teaching within the confines of the law. So far, the exposure draft has received much criticism from almost everyone, from business groups right through to religious bodies. Well need to wait and see what the Morrison government eventually settles on in the final bill, but one thing is certain: the bill in its current form does not provide any protections from vilification or even violence based on a persons religious belief, the very thing that my community wants and needs. The dangerous physical attacks experienced recently by people of Muslim faith in my community were likely seeded in religious vilification and incitement of hatred going unchecked. I know that my good friend Ed Husic has mentioned that in parliament as well.The cowardly online warriors are spraying their bile 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and our young people are faced with this all the time. The Office of the eSafety Commissioner in a research study found that 53 per cent of Australian youth have witnessed anti-Muslim harmful content online. These are young Australians aged between 12 and 17—just children. Imagine what impact this has on these kids. Online vilification and incitement of hatred is the seed that culminates in hate crime. Hate breeds harm and often even worse. Online vilification and incitement of hatred has real-world consequences. It emboldens those susceptible to that rhetoric to go out and harm real people. Sadly, attacks on Australian citizens are more likely to be directed against Muslim women because of their modest clothing choices, often when theyre accompanied by their children. Most victims of these cowardly attacks do not report them to the police.Islamophobia is the most prolific online vilification, according to the eSafety Commissioner, but other religious people such as those of the Jewish faith and Christians are also targeted online. If were to protect religious freedom in Australia, its core to that freedom that individuals are free to manifest their faith and belief without fear of vilification or violence to themselves or to their family. For my community on the south side of Brisbane, it is vitally important that we do not lose the social harmony weve worked so hard to achieve over the last few decades.The Islamic community is a crucial part of that fabric on Brisbanes south side. Theyre always ready to support and help those who are most vulnerable. Here are just a couple of examples of their selfless generosity. Theyve donated funds for swimmers with down syndrome to compete in the Down Syndrome World Swimming Championships overseas. Theyve donated bales of hay for animals in drought-affected parts of Queensland. Theyve fundraised and donated drinking water to the residents of Stanthorpe. Theyve supplied snack packs for Brothers in Need, as well as hot food and sleeping bags for the homeless in Brisbane. Hopefully, it wont be necessary next month, but, if it doesnt rain, theyll also deliver hay and water to Stanthorpe again.These are the people who are experiencing vilification in our community. Theyre generous. Theyre warm-hearted. Theyre community-minded people who wont walk past a person in need without reaching out and offering support. In fact, their faith demands it of them. Theyre the first to support and celebrate our diverse and multifaith community, theyre the first to volunteer in times of disaster and theyre the first to be vilified when its convenient for commentators and politicians who want to stir up fear and division for their own selfish political or media games.Theyre our friends, and theyre our neighbours. Theyre my friends and theyre my neighbours. I call on the Morrison government to protect this community and all religious communities at risk of endangerment from vilification and incitement of hatred and violence. I ask all the Abrahamic faiths and other religions to join me in this cause.","Discrimination","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PERRETT (Moreton) ","(10:59):"

323,0,0,0,1,2,"Alexander, John, MP","M3M","Bennelong","LP","N/A",4829," Thank you to the member for Moreton for bringing forward this debate. Violence, vilification and discrimination can never be allowed to occur, and its important that we recognise and verbalise this important statement regularly in this House for all Australians to see and hear.Im proud of Bennelong for many reasons. We are a bright, innovative and friendly electorate, with an exciting future to look forward to. But perhaps the thing I am most proud of is our multicultural community. Since the fifties Bennelong has been a melting pot, welcoming Italians, Armenians, Indians, Chinese, Koreans and many other people from around the planet. Communities from across the globe have come to Bennelong and made a permanent home, combining the great benefits of our two cultures.The strong diversity is instantly apparent to any visitor to Bennelong. It can even be quantified, thanks to the last census. Nearly 22 per cent of all residents speak either Cantonese or Mandarin; a further 9,000 residents speak Korean; just under 3,000 speak Italian, and a similar number speak Arabic; and there are also high levels of Armenian and Farsi spoken. In total, over 51 per cent of homes in Bennelong speak a language other than English at home. Each of these communities has brought their culture with them, obviously, but they have also shared their cultures with the existing community. As a result, we have a wholesome community made richer by the cultures that make it up. We eat with Chinese and Korean diners, we play chess with Armenian masters, we play sport with Indian teammates and we laugh and live together.Our greatest strength is our diversity. I hope our community can be an example to others, because there are places in Australia where multiculturalism has not yet led to harmony. Bennelong shows how, by sharing our lives and our communities with others, the whole community benefits.We have not been without our troubles, of course. Back in 2014 there was a spate of assaults in Eastwood, many suspected to be as a result of the victims cultural backgrounds. In discussions with leaders from the Chinese and Korean communities, my friends Hugh Lee and Jason Koh explained to me that there was often a stigma amongst certain cultures against reporting being the victim of a crime; people being held back by language or even issues of saving face. Eastwood police were aware of the problem, but struggling to cross the cultural divide. As a result, I was delighted to work closely with the Australian Asian Association of Bennelong and the Korean Chamber of Commerce, as well as the state member, Victor Dominello, to secure $200,000 in federal grants for the City of Ryde for the installation of CCTV cameras in some of the underlit parks and car parks of Eastwood. Reports of assaults have gone down in these areas. Indeed, one park is where I launched my campaign just a few months ago, right in the cultural heart of Bennelong.Cameras and law enforcement are all well and good, but in order to reduce the violence felt by minorities we require something more: a change in ourselves. We need to be better people, sympathetic and open. Everyone has a context and we must try to understand this background before we judge their situation or their actions. Most importantly, we must call out abuse. As policymakers and leaders of this nation it is our responsibility to ensure that racism and ignorance do not combine again. That starts by identifying and rejecting them, something we must do with full voice and full conviction.Thank you again to the member for Moreton—who seems to be getting a head start on the Movember race that we often engage in!—for raising this issue today. His game of tennis needs some improvement, too! Bringing cohesion to Australia is the most important thing we do in this place, and if we can stop discrimination we will set this country up for a strong, united and exciting future. Im looking forward to our next game!","Discrimination","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALEXANDER (Bennelong) ","(11:05):"
324,0,0,0,1,2,"Stanley, Anne, MP",265990,"Werriwa","ALP","N/A",4830," I rise to speak in support of the member for Moretons motion on this very important issue, the vilification of minority groups. Im proud to represent the electorate of Werriwa for many reasons. Chief amongst them is its strong, diverse multicultural community. We recognise it, we celebrate it and were stronger for it.Australia is the most successful multicultural nation on earth. Our migration and settlement program is an exemplar and is looked to by other nations as worlds best practice, and rightly so. But it needs to stay that way. Not a week goes by when I am not witness to the best of multicultural Australia in my electorate, either in my public capacity or my private capacity, whether at a cultural festival or citizenship ceremony or at one of the many shops, and in shopkeepers that are neighbours to my electorate office or in the diverse faces in childcare centres and schools in our community. A mark of multicultural Australias success is that for the vast majority of us it is so unremarkable. It is important to ensure that it remains so and that people are safe in our community.Werriwa is a proud community of many different cultures and many different backgrounds, and it is strong for exactly that reason. We understand and welcome all the cultures that have made this country the great place it is today. It is a value driven community, not only of the people who live there but of the organisations that work for the people of Werriwa. Just yesterday, I was present at the bicentennial celebration service for St Lukes Anglican Church in Liverpool. A Francis Greenway designed church, it has been holding services on the same site for 200 years. Reverend Stuart Pearson led the service in front of the New South Wales Governor, the Hon. Margaret Beazley; the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, Dr Davies; and the Bishop of Georges River, Reverend Lin. The service was most definitely reflective of our multicultural community, acknowledging the traditional owners as well as reflecting 19 different language groups within the congregation when the Bible verse John 3:16 was recited in different languages, from Auslan to Nepalese and Cantonese, as well as Arabic, Italian, French, Vietnamese and many more. As Councillor Charishma Kaliyanda said, it represented our diversity and unity, as many voices use the same words to provide the same message of love and respect.Another organisation that lives and breathes those values is Al-Muntada, the Iraqi Australian University Graduates Forum. Al-Muntada works across south-west Sydney, including in my seat of Werriwa, to provide cultural and educational harmony. Since 2008, it has run projects, held activities and events that foster cultural exchange between the local Iraqi community and the wider Australian community. Amongst those most Australians value is the recognition of the transformative nature of education as well as the love of song and dance in the defence of human rights. The group includes members from all of Iraqs major cultures, religions and denominations—Sunni, Shia, Christian, Mandaean, Kurdish, Arabic and Assyrian. They embody both the rich depth of the history and culture of their Iraqi heritage and the harmonious multicultural values of their Australian homeland. Each year, they hold the Shanasheel Iraqi Cultural Festival at the Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre. Last years keynote speech was from orthopaedic surgeon and former asylum seeker Dr Munjed Al Muderis.Dr Al Muderiss story is like so many great Australian migrant stories, one of someone who has come to this country with nothing but the clothes on his back and has built a prosperous and successful life in the country that has given them a second chance. Dr Al Muderis fled Saddam Husseins Iraq as a young surgeon after refusing to mutilate the ears of army deserters. After reaching Australia by boat, via Indonesia and Malaysia, he was kept in the Curtin detention centre, including a stint in solitary confinement. Despite this, after being released he continued his career in medicine, becoming a pioneer and a world leader in developing a new method for the implanting of prosthetic limbs.We should embrace and value the contribution of all our community, wherever they come from. This is what brings us together. Everyone should feel safe and be safe and have the opportunity to live together peacefully. It is better for all us when this happens.","Discrimination","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STANLEY (Werriwa—Opposition Whip) ","(11:09):"
325,0,0,0,1,2,"Leeser, Julian, MP",109556,"Berowra","LP","N/A",4831," Id like to thank the member for Moreton for moving his motion. The member raises this motion at a time when theres been a real increase in the rise of racist violence in our community and a motion such as this is most important. Over time, in our country, weve seen an erosion in tolerance. As parliamentarians we have a duty to stand up and decry racial and religious vilification where it occurs. We must remind Australians of the values that bind us together as a nation.Today I want to provide a particularly personal perspective as a Jewish Australian. In the last year, Australia has witnessed a 60 per cent increase in anti-Semitic attacks. Long discredited anti-Semitic ideas are now being given credence by the far Left and the far Right, and, with social media unchallenged, anti-Semitic ideas spread quickly.The election campaign seemed to be a lightning rod for these activities. During the election, I was one of several candidates from all parties who had posters defaced by people trying to intimidate me by sending a message of hate. First, it was swastikas and Hitler moustaches on my posters in a street of Normanhurst. Then, my campaign office, private property, was plastered with antipodean resistance stickers. And, finally, the photo on my campaign office was painted over with dollar signs. The Treasurer experienced similar attacks when his posters were daubed with dollar signs and other anti-Semitic messages. Thats not because hes Treasurer; its because, like me, hes Jewish and, like me, hes been targeted by the merchants of hate. The dollar signs refer to the old anti-Semitic lies of an international Jewish banking conspiracy. These sentiments were used by those who have sought to spread the hatred of Jews for centuries. Ive been involved in politics for 27 years, but Ive never seen anything like this before.These werent isolated incidents. A few weeks earlier, a restaurant in Epping, just outside my constituency, was plastered with anti-Semitic slogans, including Watch out Jews and Kill Jews. Vicious emails were also distributed about the former member for Wentworth, Kerryn Phelps, which falsely claimed she had been disqualified from the election because as a Jew she was in breach of section 44.These acts didnt stop or start with the election. In September last year, the Labor member for Eden-Monaro, a prominent supporter of Israel and the Jewish community, had neo-Nazi stickers and a bag of pig entrails thrown at his office. The Treasurer continues to be harassed by what is nothing more than an anti-Semitic legal action questioning his right to sit in this place. But none of this compares to the most appalling incidents, which occurred in two public schools in Melbourne. A 12-year-old Jewish boy was forced to get down on his knees and kiss the shoes of a Muslim classmate. The boy had been bullied into this act, with older students threatening violence if he didnt comply with their request. He was also sent texts that threatened hed be slaughtered and that asked if he thought about suicide. And a five-year-old boy was so taunted by other children in the bathroom for being a Jew and being circumcised that he wet himself rather than going to the toilet. When this type of hatred is appearing in our children, we should be deeply concerned about the future of this country. As Jonathan Sacks, the former chief rabbi of the Commonwealth, has written, The hate that begins with Jews never ends with Jews.Late last year, a Hindu temple in Regents Park was vandalised. Holy statues were strewn across the floor, instruments broken and the room was smeared with paint. The vandals didnt steal anything; they wanted to destroy the house of worship. Near Wollongong in April, a Muslim family had gathered at a lookout for a picnic and a man began screaming anti-Islamic sentiments at them. He proceeded to get in his car and drive around them doing burnouts on the grass where theyd set up, just so he could intimidate them. This is absolutely un-Australian, but unfortunately its becoming increasingly common.The day after the Christchurch terror attack, I went to visit the Imam Hasan centre, a mosque at Annangrove in my electorate. I told the congregants I knew they were scared and I knew exactly how they felt, because the recent synagogue shootings in the United States had made me feel exactly the same way when I attended my synagogue. I came home and I called Minister Coleman and the Prime Minister and lobbied for increased funding so that people of faith, particularly religious minorities, can attend houses of worship and other places of communal gathering in safety. Im pleased the government responded with a $55 million increase in the Safer Communities Fund, putting in place long-needed security infrastructure in communal buildings for a range of faiths.In a recent speech to the Thomas More Society, I noted the rise in discrimination against Christians. The rise in religious discrimination is the reason why the government is preparing a religious discrimination act. Australia is the most successful multicultural country on earth. Our differences are what make us strong and are what make us interesting. Governments can provide laws and funding, but only individual citizens can create that shared space for us to live together in harmony. That is a national project worth pursuing.Honourable members: Hear, hear!","Discrimination","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LEESER (Berowra) ","(11:14):"
326,0,0,0,1,2,"Aly, Anne, MP",13050,"Cowan","ALP","N/A",4832," Can I start by commending the members for Moreton and Bonner for putting forward this motion to the House and also to my colleagues who have spoken here today on both sides, particularly the member for Berowra for sharing his own experiences of religious discrimination, religious hatred.On the weekend I heard a wonderful saying: Unity does not start with a million people; it starts with just two. And in the case of today it starts with a handful of us coming together to speak on this motion. This motion deals explicitly with vilification of individuals and groups of religious faith. Just to give some examples of that over the past few years, in my home state of Western Australia in 2010 we had two members of Combat 18 shoot a mosque in Perth. In 2014 a pigs head was left at the door of a Perth mosque. In 2015 another mosque was also vandalised with a pigs head. Later that year, that mosque had white power graffitied on its walls. In 2016 a car exploded outside a Perth mosque with a fire bomb. And in 2018 another Perth mosque was fire bombed. These kinds of incidents may be few and far between—although they are becoming more and more regular and more and more prevalent—but these kinds of violent incidents begin with rhetoric, they begin with language and they begin with behaviour that normalises everyday acts of vilification and discrimination.The Office of the e-Safety Commissioner reported that 53 per cent of Australian youth have witnessed anti-Muslim harmful content online. Its also reported that 78 per cent of in-person attacks were against Muslim women. These were attacks in the presence of their children, where their children were also targeted—attacks of hatred in public. And 96 per cent of targeted women were Muslim women who are visibly Muslim because they wear the hijab. The Islamophobia Register is soon to release its second report but in its first report painted a very bleak picture of the rise of Islamophobia and religious discrimination here in Australia.I have had rather, I guess, a lot of experience in talking to people who are formers—who have left violent extremism in various iterations and various forms, from former violent jihadists to former IRA and, indeed, former white supremacists. I have to say this, of all dozens of formers that I have met none of them have ever left the movement because they were presented with a fact sheet. No white supremacist ever left white suprematism behind because somebody gave them a report on how great multiculturalism is for our economy or for our society. Indeed, everyone that I have met who left a hate movement left because of a personal connection with an individual or a group who they had perceived to be the enemy. Thats why its so important that we come together. Its why its so important that we come together to speak out against hatred, to speak out against vilification, but also to recognise, as the member for Berowra said, that hatred against one group doesnt end there. Often that hatred spreads to a whole range of other groups as well.Despite the fact that, as I say, no individual has ever changed their world view because of a fact sheet, we can do more by setting moral and legal standards as an important step to acknowledging that, in this country, in Australia, we have no tolerance for hatred, we have no tolerance for vilification and we have no tolerance for people who would target individuals of religious minorities because of their faith, particularly those who are most vulnerable to targeting, particularly Muslim women who wear the hijab, men who wear religious dress in any form, and—as the member for Berowra so eloquently talked about—cases involving children. We do not want our children to be targeted as well. Once again, I commend all members of the chamber today for speaking on this very important topic.","Discrimination","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALY (Cowan) ","(11:19):"
327,0,0,0,1,2,"van Manen, Bert, MP",188315,"Forde","LNP","N/A",4833," I want to thank my good friend the member for Moreton for bringing this motion to the House, because both of us represent communities that have a large multicultural component to them. In Logan there are some 217 different cultures represented, and I suspect the member for Moretons electorate wouldnt be too many fewer than that. It would be pretty close.It tells a story, as the previous speakers have on this motion, of the wonderful success story that is Australia. Its the wonderful success story of a multicultural society that is the envy of the world. I reflect on that as somebody whose parents came out from Europe in the mid-sixties. But I also reflect on that in the context of the electorate that I represent. At first, it was largely settled by German immigrants back in the 1860s. So its not just that large flow of migrants to Australia after World War II and in the subsequent years; its also a story that goes back well over 100 years, with migrants coming to this country—whether they were the Chinese for the gold rush or the Germans, particularly, escaping persecution in Germany at that time for religious beliefs—to seek a new and better life.We should be very proud as a nation of our success in this area, because its through the shared experiences that our migrants have brought to this country that we have built the country we have today. It is their ingenuity, their hard work and their willingness to get involved in our community which have created the communities that we live in today. Whether they are from European backgrounds, or have an Asian cultural heritage or a Middle Eastern cultural heritage, all those people bring something to the fabric of our society.This is why I think its incredibly disappointing that we see people in our communities who are prepared to vilify and denigrate those with a different cultural background. It brings nothing to our society or to strengthening our communities to denigrate somebody else because of their cultural beliefs or views. It fails to recognise the facts about what these people bring to our society. Im pleased to say that in my electorate, unlike some of the stories weve heard from others, that has been a rare occurrence.I look at some of the contributions by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in the floods we had several years ago, and the work that they did to get out into the community and support flood victims by cleaning up their houses, making sure that they were fed and helping to restore their property and their lives, and what was really satisfying to see was that they worked hand in hand with the Christian community groups to do those things. It was not, Oh, the Christians are over here, and were Muslim, so were over here. All of those community groups came together to support people in our community who were going through a very difficult time.My local Islamic community group, particularly the mosque at Eagleby, was traumatised by what happened in Christchurch. In speaking to them, I made it very clear that they had my support, that I did not for one minute support what happened over there and that it was not my view of how our community worked and operated. Those at the mosque at Eagleby—quietly, I might add—do lots of little things in our community that help to strengthen it. Its interesting: the design of the mosque there is not a traditional mosque design. When driving past, most people wouldnt know that we had a mosque in Eagleby. But they get out and are involved quietly in the community, just making it a stronger and better place.Its people from all walks and all cultures who have built this country, and we should be extraordinarily proud of them. We should continue to call out, as this motion has done, those who seek to vilify and denigrate the people who have made this country what it is today.","Discrimination","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr VAN MANEN (Forde—Chief Government Whip) ","(11:24):"
328,0,0,0,1,2,"Hayes, Chris, MP","ECV","Fowler","ALP","N/A",4834,"Mr HAYES ( Fowler — Chief Opposition Whip ) ( 11:29 ): Our vision is an Australia with a hopeful and vibrant sense of nationhood; one that owns and celebrates its cosmopolitan nature. Necessary to that nationhood is the ability to grasp the most difficult contentions and tensions with honesty, genuine listening and mutual respect. Thats an extract from the Australian National Imams Council submission on the Religious Discrimination Bill, which is currently in exposure draft form. I decided to use that extract because I believe it succinctly puts into perspective the need for action to be taken to protect the social harmony of our diverse communities, with this being so crucial to the continuation not only of our multiculturalism but of Australian democracy itself.I have the honour of representing one of the most multicultural communities in this country, made up of a diverse range of people that have come from various parts of the world, bringing with them their culture and their religious backgrounds. I have personally seen the benefits that come from multicultural communities and, to that end, multiculturally diverse nations such as the one we live in, Australia. We are a bigger, better and bolder nation because of the contribution of those who have come across the seas to make this country their home.All Australians should be able to go about their lives free from discrimination, religious vilification and hate-motivated violence. Unfortunately, in recent times, many Australians havent had the ability to enjoy those freedoms following events such as the Islamophobic attack at the mosque in Christchurch and the anti-Semitic attack on Jewish worshippers in a synagogue in Germany. These things have really become a point of contention in many areas of the community. It is these hate-filled crimes which have motivated white supremacist ideology on our shores, including the repeated attacks on the Holland Park mosque in Brisbane—and I thank the member for Moreton for bringing this motion to our attention. Only last week, an incident was reported of a man carrying a machete walking towards a congregation of worshippers at that very mosque. Luckily, in that instance, neighbours of the mosque brought to the groups attention what this fellow was up to, and as a consequence he departed. Nevertheless, that would have left people pretty shaken—to think that someone was trying to enter a mosque with a machete.Research by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry last year found that there had been a 60 per cent increase in anti-Semitic incidents in the preceding 12 months. Similarly, the Office of the eSafety Commissioner has noted that 53 per cent of youth in Australia have witnessed anti-Muslim content online. Its just reprehensible to think that this is occurring on our watch. In social policy terms, the impacts are grave, with research indicating that such behaviour creates an environment which cultivates discrimination and vilification, normalises negative attitudes and, moreover, is linked to extremism, such as that we witnessed in Christchurch.To this extent, the Islamophobia Register has found that discrimination facing our community comes in the form of bullying at schools; personal attacks, including verbal insults; vandalising of buildings with graffiti; and targeting religious dress. What is more distressing, quite frankly, is that women are the main targets of personal attacks based on religion and that almost half of all personal attacks that have occurred on women have occurred in public and crowded places. That should be a concern to all of us. It is these statistics which reinforce our collective need to protect religious communities and minorities at risk of danger from incitement of hatred and violence. We must stand united and stand against hatred. Hatred stands in stark contrast to the values we all subscribe to.For those who mask freedom of speech as a form of protecting against racism, let me say to members that freedom of speech does not and should not ever equate to the freedom to spread intolerance and division in our community.

That is, of course, incorrect. All Australian governments are responsible for protecting Australians from incitement to hatred or violence. At the Commonwealth level, we do this through the Criminal Code. Sections 80.2A and 80.2B make it an offence to urge the use of violence or force against religious groups or their members, punishable by up to seven years imprisonment. These penalties reflect that incitement to hatred and violence is a very serious criminal matter. Other jurisdictions also make incitement to hatred or violence against religious groups a criminal offence. New South Wales, Queensland, ACT and my home state of Victoria all have criminal offences relating to the incitement of violence against religious groups, but the maximum penalties in those jurisdictions are lower than the penalties that apply under the Commonwealth law.I want to talk about protecting the ability of religious communities to live in accordance with their faith. A central plank in the governments efforts to protect Australias religious communities is our Religious Discrimination Bill. That bill will introduce laws at the Commonwealth level that, for the first time, protect Australians from discrimination on the basis of their religious beliefs or activities. The bill will fill an obvious gap in Australias human rights laws. It will protect Australians from religious discrimination in the same way they are protected from discrimination on the basis of age, sex, race or disability. For example, if its passed, that bill would, for the first time, make it unlawful for a Jewish man in Victoria to be turned away by a taxi because of his faith, or a Muslim woman in New South Wales to be refused service at a shop because she is wearing a hijab.The bill also protects the ability of religious communities to say what they believe. The bill simply says that Australians should not face a discrimination lawsuit just for saying what they believe. All Australians should be free to live in accordance with their faith, and to share that faith that others, without being subject to lawsuits because others find the faith offensive. Critically, the bill also balances this protection by putting in place very clear safeguards which ensure that there are no protections for speech that is malicious, that harasses or vilifies people, or that incites violence or hatred. This is a balanced, straightforward safeguard that protects all Australians.The bill also contains protections for religious bodies. Very often it is our religious institutions that are the central pillars of Australian religious communities. For example, the synagogue might be the heart of a Jewish community, and an Islamic community might be built around a mosque. Our Religious Discrimination Bill protects those institutions by making clear that, for the purposes of the bill, they do not discriminate on the grounds of religious belief or activity by acting in accordance with their faith. So I can say that what the motion asks the House to recognise is definitely incorrect.","Discrimination","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms LIU (Chisholm) ","(11:34):"

332,0,0,0,1,2,"Entsch, Warren, MP","7K6","Leichhardt","LNP","N/A",4836," I move:That this House:(1) notes:(a) 14 September 2019 marks National Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Day; and(b) 20 September 2019 marks the 20th anniversary of the deployment of the International Force East Timor (INTERFET), the peacemaking taskforce that came to Timor-Leste to address the humanitarian and security crisis from 1999-2000;(2) recognises:(a) the vital role of Australians in peace operations and their more than 70 years of dedicated service to the international community; and(b) the more than 5,500 personnel who contributed to INTERFET—including that of former Governor-General, General Sir Peter Cosgrove, AK, CVO, MC (Retd)—and the important contribution they made at a critical time in the history of Timor-Leste; and(3) acknowledges:(a) the service and sacrifice of all those who served in peacekeeping operations and the families who supported them; and(b) those currently serving in the UN Truce Supervision Organisation, the UN Mission in the Republic of South Sudan, the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, and the UN Disengagement Observer Force.It gives me immense pleasure to rise today to speak on this motion and to mark National Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Day, which was observed on 14 September 2019. Australia has always played a leading and vital role in peacekeeping missions around the world, none more so than that leading 22 nations in the deployment of the International Force East Timor, the peacemaking task force that went to Timor-Leste to address the humanitarian and security crisis between 1999 and 2000. The 20th anniversary of that significant deployment to Timor-Leste was observed on 14 September this year.Theres no greater honour than to serve your country. The sacrifices Australian men and women make for our country are truly remarkable—in some cases the ultimate sacrifice. All too often they are away from loved ones for long periods of time, missing birthdays, anniversaries, family gatherings and so on. Imagine having to say goodbye to loved ones—your wife, husband, partner, children, parents and friends—every three, six or 12 months, not knowing whether youll actually see them again or whether they will see you. Thats what were asking our men and our women in our armed forces and their families to do, and I would like everyone in this chamber just to pause and think about that for a moment.More than 5,000 Australian personnel contributed to the International Force East Timor, including the former Governor-General, Sir Peter Cosgrove. To say things were unstable in the region at the time is an absolute understatement. Following the announcement of the referendum result on 4 September 1999, violent and deadly clashes instigated by anti-independence militias broke out. Many East Timorese were killed. An estimated 500,000 were displaced and around half fled the territory. Australia, under the leadership of former Prime Minister John Howard, could not sit back and watch this crisis unfold on our doorstep. And I have to say that, as a member of the government of that time, it was great to see, as we do in many of these types of situations, the very strong bipartisan support we had in dealing with that matter.I will not get into the nitty-gritty aspects of the mission, but on 28 February 2000 International Force East Timor handed over command of military operations to the United Nations transitional administration in East Timor, which provided an interim civil administration and oversaw the peacekeeping mission until the countrys independence on 20 May 2002. The country remains fragile, and political rivalries extending back into its guerrilla past have required the help of the Australian Army again in 2006 and 2009, but it certainly has a bright future.Sadly, during the Australian deployment four Australian soldiers lost their lives. However, none of these deaths were due to enemy actions. Many also came back home very different people after witnessing horrors and atrocities we simply cant fathom. Sadly, this is an all-too-familiar story for many of our veterans that return home from active service.I want to personally thank all of those personnel for their sacrifice and their service—all of those who served in peacekeeping operations in the past and those currently serving in the UN Truce Supervision Organization, the UN Mission in South Sudan, the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and the UN Disengagement Observer Force. Let me tell you that serving in these operations, unless youve actually been over there and witnessed yourself what happens at the time, is very hard to imagine. Theres a huge amount of pride that goes with serving and contributing something positive to what was the re-establishment of Timor-Leste as a nation. Weve seen the same thing happening in many other areas where our troops have gone in as peacekeepers, and I think we should always be very mindful and respectful of the contribution and the sacrifices that they make willingly. It is a sacrifice the burden of which is in many ways also carried by their families. I have to say to them all: you are the real, true heroes in my eyes.","Peacekeeping Operations","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ENTSCH (Leichhardt) ","(11:40):"

335,0,0,0,1,2,"Stevens, James, MP",176304,"Sturt","LP","N/A",4838," I second the motion, and commend the member for Leichardt for moving it. This year, 14 September marked National Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Day, and 20 September, of course, marked the 20th anniversary of the deployment of the International Force East Timor, INTERFET, the peacekeeping force that went to Timor Leste to address the humanitarian and security crisis that was engulfing that place. Its wonderful to have the opportunity to talk about the outstanding contribution of Australians and all those whove served and continue to serve in international peacekeeping operations, as well as the families who support them. They are heroes as well.Its very important that we recognise that approximately 65,000 servicemen and women have been involved in over 50 peacekeeping operations worldwide on behalf of our country since 1947. There are still some serving currently in UN peacekeeping operations. Since Australia has been involved, there have been 70 years of service to the international community. Tragically, weve seen the loss of life and weve seen others come home, as the member for Leichhardt said, never to be the same again. Australian peacekeepers have served in some of the most challenging environments around the world, involving operations in places such as Kashmir, Cyprus, the Middle East, Timor Leste, Cambodia, Rwanda, Bougainville and others. Peacekeeping operations often involve, primarily, our Defence Force, but there are also Australians from various police forces around the country, and civilians who are making contributions of a humanitarian and community development nature.As I said, 20 September marked the 20th anniversary of INTERFET, a multinational peacekeeping task force mandated by the United Nations to address the humanitarian and security situation in Timor Leste, which had deteriorated—we recall the pictures we saw on TV. It was also the first time Australia led a major international coalition. Apart from the response of the Prime Minister, John Howard, to the Port Arthur tragedy, I thought that East Timor was probably close to one of the finest things he did as Prime Minister. I say that in a bipartisan way. I thought he did a tremendous job in that regard. I also want to commend Major General Peter Cosgrove of the Australian Army, who went on to become the Chief of the Defence Force and a distinguished Governor-General of this country.I know there are a range of commemorative activities across the country, and in Dili there were government ministers—as well as, I understand, my opposition colleague the member for Solomon and Timor Leste veteran, Luke Gosling—who attended. On 21 September I attended a special Ipswich RSL Sub Branch INTERFET commemorative service at the Ipswich Memorial Gardens, beside the hall, in my electorate. I laid a wreath to honour all those who served in Timor Leste. It was a privilege to meet a number of local INTERFET and Timor veterans and to reflect on the outstanding contribution they made to Timor Lestes success today. Its an independent, democratic and economically sustainable nation, but I agree with the member for Leichhardt: there are challenges that that small country faces. The speeches in Ipswich reminded those present of the peacekeeping operations and the challenges—and even risks—that were there. It was the right thing to do at the time. It was deeply supported by the Australian public and deeply appreciated by the overwhelming majority of people in Timor Leste. In recent times, peacekeeping has been an important part of Australias defence posture. Indeed, we still have a number of service personnel deployed in peacekeeping operations around the world, and the things we learned in Timor Leste have been applied. All of us were reminded of this at the recent event in Ipswich.The Australian Peacekeeping Memorial on Anzac Parade here in Canberra was inaugurated in 2017 to commemorate the service and sacrifice of Australians who served in peacekeeping or peacekeeping missions around the world. I know that my colleague the member for Bean, Dave Smith, represented federal Labor—certainly on my behalf—here in Canberra at the Australian Peacekeeping Day commemoration held at the memorial.This memorial and these events are an important chapter in our Anzac history. Sadly, some former Australian peacekeepers have felt theyve been forgotten and their service has not been properly recognised. I hope today they dont feel that. In the national parliament we are showing our gratitude and our support to let them know theyve made an invaluable contribution to our national security and the security of our country. We salute them. Its vital that they know we honour them, we understand the sacrifices theyve made and we hope their sacrifice is getting the recognition it deserves. I thank the member for the motion and commend it to the chamber.","Peacekeeping Operations","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr STEVENS (Sturt) ","(11:45):"
336,0,0,0,1,2,"Connelly, Vince, MP",282984,"Stirling","LP","N/A",4839," Let me start with a quote from first-century theologian and philosopher Saint Augustine, who said this:We do not seek peace in order to be at war, but we go to war that we may have peace. Be peaceful, therefore, in warring, so that you may vanquish those whom you war against, and bring them to the prosperity of peace.I have always been firmly of a mind that the strong should help the weak, that those who are prosperous should help those who are poor. In fact, we have a moral obligation to support those for whom violence and poverty is the daily norm. As a young Australian Army officer I had the wonderful opportunity to serve as a platoon commander in East Timor. Here, Australia led the United Nations effort to end the bloodshed and so enable the birth of a new sovereign state, Timor-Leste. Later, as a captain and second in command of the rifle Australian infantry company, I had the opportunity to be one of the first on the deployment to the Solomon Islands, where we conducted cordon and search operations, collected criminals and thousands of weapons, and restored peace to our Pacific neighbour.For more than 70 years Australian peacekeepers have played—and they continue to play—an important role in advancing peace around the globe. An estimated 65,000 service men and women have been involved in 50 peacekeeping operations worldwide since 1947. And since 1964, along with members of the ADF, members of Australias police service have joined peacekeeping operations internationally. On 14 September each year, National Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Day, we honour the courage and professionalism of Australian servicemen, servicewomen and police.While the first Australian peacekeepers worked as unarmed military observers, over time the nature of peacekeeping operations has evolved to include the management of more complex and volatile environments. These have ranged from operations as military observers, providing logistical support and monitoring ceasefires, to landmine clearance operations, and also supporting democratic elections and providing policing support and humanitarian aid.Australian peacekeepers have often served in hostile and volatile environments, including operations in Kashmir, Cyprus, the Middle East, East Timor, Cambodia, Rwanda and Bougainville. This year also marked, as we heard earlier, the 20th anniversary of the INTERFET mission, the peacemaking task force that went to Timor-Leste to address the humanitarian and security crisis in 1999-2000. At the time, the INTERFET mission was the largest single Australian deployment since the Second World War. To mark this important time in our history, veterans who put boots on the ground between 1999 and 2000 in Timor-Leste participated in a commemorative ceremony at the Palacio do Governo, which was followed by an official parade of remembrance to the Dili Convention Centre. INTERFET commander and former Governor-General of Australia Sir Peter Cosgrove was one of those who attended. His role crossed between the lines of soldier and diplomat, and under great pressure he made decisions that have helped to shape history. His leadership during INTERFET was highly and widely respected and is a testament to all that he has achieved since, moving on to become Chief of Army, Chief of the Defence Force and, of course, Governor-General of Australia.Tragically, 16 Australians have died serving as peacekeepers, and their names are listed on the walls at the Australian War Memorial. Its also important to remember today those deployed in peacekeeping operations right now around the world, including in South Sudan, the Middle East and Cyprus. The international community is no doubt also thankful for the valuable service of our peacekeepers.As we look ahead, we should recognise that next month we commemorate Remembrance Day. This is the day we all acknowledge the almost two million Australians who have served and still serve in the defence of our nation. I encourage everyone to get along to their local Remembrance Day ceremony and pause for a moments silence. Lest we forget.","Peacekeeping Operations","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CONNELLY (Stirling) ","(11:50):"

It followed National Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Day, 14 September 2019, six days earlier.These days are important and must be remembered as part of our national calendar because they speak not just to the legacy and the memory of our peacekeepers but to the character and the objectives of this country itself. Australia has always sought to be a peaceful nation and to bring, as part of a community of nations, stability and peace for humanity. For more than 70 years, Australian peacekeepers have played—and they continue to play—a critical role in Australia and beyond our shores to assist that effort. Weve had an estimated 65,000 service men and women whove been involved in over 50 peacekeeping operations worldwide since 1947. Behind each one of those peacekeepers have been human stories and an ambition for the type of world that we want to be. Since 1964, along with members of the ADF, members of Australias police services have also served in peacekeeping operations around the world, aiding and assisting those in situations of need and conflict to bring about the peace that we seek.Weve had peacekeepers often operating in very hostile environments, and, tragically, 16 have been killed in pursuit of their mission. Their memories, their names, their legacy and their contribution to our great nation and the world are recognised at the Australian War Memorial. Our peacekeepers havent just stayed in safety or ease; theyve seen the realisation of what they want to give to the world in often hostile and volatile environments, including operations in Kashmir, Cyprus, the Middle East, East Timor, Cambodia, Rwanda and Bougainville. We must always acknowledge their sacrifice, because, when you think about the strength and resilience of our great country, it comes not from ease or from circumstances that we often would wish for ourselves but on the backs and the might and the sacrifice of those who make a greater contribution. Thats why the acknowledgement of our peacekeepers—particularly this year, the 20th anniversary of the INTERFET mission—is so critical.Just on our borders and beyond our shores, a new nation faced serious threats and a humanitarian and security crisis. Every country in those situations faces choices. Yes, they face a choice about the impact it might have on themselves, but they also face a choice about what they can do to strengthen the bonds between a country and its internal resilience, and to show their humanity and humanitarianism for our allies. Thats why we engaged to support peacekeeping operations, with 5,500 of our peacekeepers deployed in 1999. The legacy of their contribution continues today in the success of the ongoing journey of the country of Timor-Leste. We must never forget that there are people who stood tall but also fell. When we come to Remembrance Day, its time to remember their legacy and their contribution as part of the ongoing story of our great nation.

340,0,0,0,1,2,"Owens, Julie, MP","E09","Parramatta","ALP","N/A",4841," I move:That this House:(1) notes that:(a) the latest Government report indicates around 120,000 older Australians are waiting for their approved home care package; and(b) more than 72,000 older Australians on the waiting list have no home care package at all;(2) recognises:(a) the majority of older Australians waiting for level three and level four packages have high care needs;(b) some older Australians have been waiting more than two years for their approved package, many of whom are in their 90s and others who have terminal illnesses; and(c) older Australians are entering residential aged care or even emergency departments instead of receiving their approved home care package;(3) condemns the Government for failing to stop the wait list growing; and(4) calls on the Government to listen to the growing chorus of voices for urgent action to fix the home care packages wait list now and properly address this national crisis.Its with some frustration I rise to speak yet again about the failure of the government to adequately support the incredibly important Home Care Packages Program. Home care packages play a really important role in ageing. They allow people to stay home as they age, whether they need a small amount of support on level 1 or a great deal of support on level 4.Unfortunately, with the release of the latest data on home care packages, it appears that the fate of many older Australians is sealed when it comes to receiving the support they need to age with dignity in their homes. Not long ago I spoke about a woman in my electorate of Parramatta, Mary Seeward, who died before she received approval for a level 4 home care package after waiting for many, many months. After speaking about Mary, a number of my constituents called to relay their own family stories about their issues with My Aged Care. One persons mother had been assessed in March and had still not heard anything back in August. He waited 5½ hours on the phone to speak to My Aged Care before he gave up. Another man had been waiting for the assessment of his needs for My Aged Care. After prompting from our office, the assessment was finalised, but he still has to wait for three to six months for a level 1 package and nine to 12 months for the package that he requires, which is a level 2.We know the population is ageing. There are more than 18,000 people aged over 65 in my electorate alone, but on this governments watch the home care package waiting list has increased from 88,000 people to 120,000 people. This just isnt good enough. There are 72,000 older Australians on the waiting list who have absolutely no home care package at all. These are real people waiting, sometimes for years, worried and distraught about their future and the condition of their health. Forty-two per cent of people are waiting for level 2 funding, but one in six people are waiting for level 4. These are real people with chronic conditions and in many cases their needs are time sensitive, such as for my constituent Mary, who has now passed.We know that the home care model is the best approach for aged care, both economically and socially. What is best for the older person is often the most affordable option for the taxpayer. It just kind of works. Home care allows a person to stay connected to their neighbourhood and their family home with all its memories, to retain connection to their much-loved pets and to keep their independence. For the family, it eases carer responsibility, and for people who are already struggling to balance their work and home life its essential. And, conveniently, it is the most economically sustainable model for government, as it keeps people from going into nursing homes prematurely and helps prevent the visit to the emergency department. With that in mind, it is incomprehensible that almost 120,000 people are still waiting for their home care packages to be approved.This is a no-brainer. If you manage the program well, everybody wins. Yet the government is idle, standing by while this incredibly important program fails so many of our older neighbours. The unbelievably long waiting list for home care packages is symptomatic of a deeper crisis of underresourcing. It is a system collapsing before our eyes. This month, TheSydney Morning Herald reported the findings of a study of almost 5,000 aged-care staff, and what they had to say should be of great concern to everybody in this House: 81 per cent of workers said they did not have the time to do the tasks they are required to do, and they admitted that they are so stretched theyre cutting corners and not giving the elderly people the help they deserve, leading to more residents being left unshowered, rushed during meals or placed at the risk of serious injury; and 67 per cent of home care workers reported an increase in complex needs, including more people with dementia. This is a growing need, and this government is failing to address it. The Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, is responsible for billions of dollars of cuts to the aged-care sector in the past five years—$1.2 billion cut from aged care in his first budget as Treasurer, backing in the $500 million cut in the 2015 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook.In spite of the growing needs of an ageing population, there is both a challenge and an opportunity for our nation. Aged care is not even a cabinet portfolio. There is no holistic, whole-of-government approach to aged care. In addition to underresourcing, blowouts in waiting times and funding cuts, there is a labour crisis, which has only been made worse by the governments cuts to TAFE.Where is the plan? Waiting times now are ridiculous, and a third of aged-care workers plan to leave the industry in the next five years. Its going to get worse. There will be more people in care and fewer people to serve them. Scott Morrison has no plan now and he has no plan for the future. If he doesnt think theres a problem then hes seriously out of touch. He needs to act and he needs to act now.","Aged Care","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms OWENS (Parramatta) ","(12:00):"

345,0,0,0,1,2,"Wilson, Tim, MP","IMW","Goldstein","LP","N/A",4843," In moving this motion, the previous speaker, the member for Parramatta, referred to her frustration. I can understand and respect that, because an elected member of parliament who stands at the podium here or in the chamber does so because they seek to pursue the best interests of the community that they represent and, as part of that, to make sure that we are providing the support services to people when they are at the most vulnerable stages of life. Thats what this government has been doing.The frustration that I and other government members feel is that, after committing billions of dollars towards extra home care packages, as we have, including in the last budget, to make sure that all senior Australians at that vulnerable stage of life get the support and care they need, we come into this chamber and have an opposition member move a motion such as this, when at the last election she ran on a platform of providing exactly 0.0 dollars for extra home care packages in Australia. Lets think about that. This goes to an issue of trust. When it comes down to who Australians trust to provide the support and assistance they need, we know it isnt the opposition that Australians trust. This is not a partisan attack, but it is a criticism of the honesty that sits behind this debate.We have done so much to reform aged care and provide the support and assistance that people need at the different gradations of health and wellbeing associated with their ageing. Weve made sure that people are in a situation where there is sufficient funding to make sure that people can get aged-care places. That is particularly challenging because the number of people who are staying in their homes is growing and they are staying there for longer periods. Those who are going into residential aged care need support at a more acute level, particularly around issues such as the rising rates of dementia.One of the reasons that people are able to stay in their homes longer—it is not just out of wish or ambition—is that the taxpayer, through the Commonwealth, funds support services for them to be able do so. This government has invested $2.2 billion to address the waiting list for home care packages. No-one is trying to pretend that there isnt more work to be done. There is, because of the enormous and increasing number of people who are staying in their homes longer and who are in need of support. But the reality is that there is only one way that we can make sure that we meet that expectation and that challenge, and that is to have a strong economy so that we have the tax revenue to make sure that we can fund the ongoing services. Thats the basis on which this government was elected and is meeting the aspirations of the Australian people.If you compare that to the alternative approach, that of the opposition, of going to the election with 0.0 dollars of extra commitments, you start to see very clearly why some of us find motions such as this frustrating. Were investing an extra $150 million over three years from 2019-20 to expand Commonwealth Home Support Program packages in priority across Australia, and around 18,000 people are expected to benefit. And, of course, since the 2018-19 budget, the government has provided $2.2 billion, as I already mentioned, to release an additional 34,000 home care packages—34,000 more home care packages than those put forward by the mover of this motion.Its about time we had an honest conversation about the challenges confronting Australia in aged care. Its part of the rich challenge that we face with an ageing population. The basis on which we start that conversation is by actually being honest. Thats the problem I have with this motion. For this mover to stand at the lectern and move this motion—when those opposite offered nothing to the Australian people when they went to the election; perhaps thats one of the reasons why they now sit on the opposition benches—and to make political use of some of Australias most vulnerable people without full acknowledgment of their lack of support and care for them, is something that, frankly, I find despicable. But that is their choice and theyll be judged accordingly for their conduct. I think what we should focus on as a parliament is continuing to bring people together to support the governments program and to support the home care packages that Australians so desperately need.","Aged Care","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) ","(12:06):"
346,0,0,0,1,2,"Dick, Milton, MP",53517,"Oxley","ALP","N/A",4844," I will pick up on what the previous speaker, the member for Goldstein, was saying. He is frustrated that hes got to defend this governments appalling record. He wants an honest conversation about whats happening in aged care in this nation. Well, Im going to give him one, and Im going to give him some honesty, because, whilst the government is frustrated about motions in this parliament, I wish it were frustrated about the 120,000 Australians who, on its watch, are waiting for home care packages. That is practically an entire electorate of people who are not receiving the care that they desperately need. Perhaps most shocking of all is that 72,000 elderly Australians have no home care package at all. There are 72,000 people in this country with their names on a list—parents, loved ones, people with children and grandchildren—and the government come to this chamber and say, Were frustrated that we have to get up and talk about these issues.I bet you theyre frustrated! How about the people who are frustrated and worried about their parents, their mothers-in-law and grandparents who are frail and invalid in their homes? Thats whats frustrating, not sitting in this chamber and lecturing everyone to just wait until you get a stronger economy. Where is it? Where is the stronger economy? Whens that happening? The last time I checked, our economy was starting to tank.Lets not have any more weasel words from this government. Get on your feet and start apologising to Australians. Thats the first step you need to take. The number is growing. In their time, in almost seven years in government, the waiting list for home care has grown from 88,000 to 120,000 older Australians. We have been calling for action on reducing the waiting list since the first release of data, and we are not alone. Doctors and nurses are banding together to call for immediate action to fix the nations aged-care system. Fine, ignore what Labor has to say, but listen to what the health professionals are saying. Listen to what doctors are saying about what we need to do with regards to fixing the aged-care crisis in this country. The AMA President, Dr Tony Bartone, said that the peak medical body can no longer wait and watch the aged-care system in Australia deteriorate.That is part of their detailed submission to the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, which has been extended for six months and has so far received more than 6,000 submissions and heard hundreds of hours of evidence, including of alleged neglect and mistreatment. People in aged-care facilities are malnourished. People in aged-care facilities are dehydrated. And we hear from this government that its frustrated that its got to come and debate a motion today. Ill tell you whats frustrating: its when youre in an aged-care facility and youre dehydrated and malnourished, or youre a son or grandchild worried about the care of your parents or your grandparents in their own home. There is no more serious statistic in the AMA submission, when they called for a big investment in home care packages, than that there are 119,524 older people waiting for the level of package they had been assessed for in June, and 16,000 people had died waiting for one. And the previous speaker says, You shouldnt politicise this issue. Well, it is political. Youre in charge; do something about it!So not only would we be saving peoples lives; this would also help the budget, because at the moment many older Australians are waiting for more than 12 months for the package they have been approved for and some are waiting for more than two years. This is unacceptable. We know that 14,000 elderly Australians have had to enter residential aged care because they could no longer stay at home waiting for the care that wasnt there. Others enter the hospital system and emergency departments. A week does not go by without another disturbing account emerging about the mistreatment or neglect of older Australians in residential care. Review after review has been ignored. Recommendations after recommendations have been ignored. Not only are the government not putting extra money in aged care; whats worse is that the government are cutting funds meant to find ways to improve the system.We see time and time again that the health and wellbeing of our eldest Australians should not be a political football. I will agree on that. But this should hardly come as a shock when we have a prime minister with an awful track record when it comes to funding for aged care in this nation. We know that the government has ripped billions of dollars out of the aged-care sector for the past five years. Funding for residents has indeed gone backwards. The Prime Minister cut $1.2 billion from aged care in his first budget paper as Treasurer, backing in a $500 million cut in the 2015 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. Not with a mediocre handout but with a decisive response that this crisis deserves, this government should be hearing these messages. I commend the member for Parramatta for sticking up for older Australians—Ill continue to do so, as every single Labor member will.","Aged Care","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DICK (Oxley) ","(12:11):"
347,0,0,0,1,2,"Conaghan, Patrick, MP",279991,"Cowper","Nats","N/A",4846," I rise to speak against the motion on this governments actions to assist older Australians to stay in their homes longer. As I said in my maiden speech, we do need to do more for our older Australians who need assistance. I commend the minister and this government on making it a priority to invest more in aged care. In my electorate of Cowper, 27 per cent are over the age of 65 and that is rising at 1.3 per cent per year. This government promised to increase the number of home care packages, Commonwealth Home Support and residential home care places and that is what it has done. And it can only be done with a strong budget underpinning investment. We have increased our aged-care funding from $13.3 billion, when this government came in, to over $23.5 billion in 2021.In the last 12 months we have increased the numbers of home care packages from 99,000 up to over 125,000. This is now projected to increase to 157,000 by 2022-23. This increase has seen a significant reduction in the waiting times and a decrease in the number of people waiting for their approved packages—down by 9,000 in the previous quarter.The opposition claim that this government cuts spending on aged care when it has actually increased year on year. They need to stick to facts, look at the real story and offer meaningful debate over the best way to address the challenges ahead in aged care.The national prioritisation system, or queue, provides a framework for the assessment and allocation of home care packages consistently and equitably across the nation based on a persons needs and circumstances. A persons position in the national queue is determined by their priority for home care services and the time they have waited for care. People receiving approval for packages can receive an interim package whilst remaining in the queue. Over 97 per cent of people are provided with the opportunity to access services under the Commonwealth Home Support Program to ensure that they have options to address their care needs whilst awaiting their approved home care package. The system ensures that most people who are approved for care, and particularly high needs of care, have access to some level of subsidised care in their home whilst waiting for packages at their approved level.As at 30 June 2019 there were 47,000 people waiting for home care packages at their approved level who had been offered a lower level package. This figure is down by over 5,800. In the June 2019 quarter, 74 per cent of people had accepted the offer of an interim package while still considering their offer. Just over 12,000 of these people did not take up the offer for various reasons—perhaps they decided to go into residential care, they did not need the level of care approved for that time or they were happy with the services they had been receiving. I accept, if were going to have an honest conversation, that there are still 72,000 people who are waiting for a home care package at the approved level who have not been offered a package. However, that figure is down from the last quarter. Whilst this figure represents a considerable challenge, 95.6 per cent had been provided with access to the Commonwealth Home Support Program. Importantly, the number of people approved for level 4 packages who have not yet been offered a package fell by 34 per cent, or 11,000 people. The number waiting for a level 3 package also fell.I, like many of my colleagues, would rather engage in policy discussion on how to ensure older people in our regions and rural and remote communities can have a choice in providers, can access services and can stay in communities and close to their families. I recently met with a constituent in my electorate. Her husband has approval for a level 4 package but cannot find a provider to travel the 53 kilometres from Kempsey to provide services that will enable him to come home from his residential care facility. Im pleased that the number of home care providers has continued to grow, including in my region of the mid-north coast. I will continue to work with my constituents, our regional providers and my colleagues on how we can improve access to services.There is more work to do. There are challenges now and into the future. The government have a plan and we have been doing that in a calm and considered way.","Aged Care","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CONAGHAN (Cowper) ","(12:16):"
348,0,0,0,1,2,"Phillips, Fiona, MP",147140,"Gilmore","ALP","N/A",4847," Id like to thank the member for Parramatta for the opportunity to talk on the subject of this motion today. In my electorate on the New South Wales south coast we have one of the highest numbers of age pensioners in Australia and Im regularly hearing from people who are suffering because of this governments failure to provide them with adequate home care packages. One hundred and twenty thousand people in Australia are waiting for home care packages. This sounds like a high number; it is. But I want to talk about a smaller number: the individuals.In January, Margaret was approved for a level 2 home care package. Margaret has mobility and neurological issues that cause her back and neck pain. She was discharged from the hospital in February and began receiving help through the Commonwealth Home Support Program. She was paying $140 out of her pension every fortnight for support services to help her shower, dry and dress, as well as cleaning and transport for shopping. It took Margaret eight months even to be offered an interim level 1 package, but this was less support than she was already receiving. In September she was reassessed and approved for a level 3 package, but all she has been told is that she will have to wait another three to six months before she can even get a level 2 package. Margaret, like many people in my electorate, lives on her own and is frail. She needs more support, but she has been abandoned by this government.Then there is Laurel. When she contacted my office, Laurel was in desperate need of a wheelchair. She needed help with weekly shopping, transport and social services. She needed to be on a level 3 home care package. She had been approved for the level 3 package, but she was only on an interim level 2. When she first applied for the level 3, Laurel was told that the waiting time was 12 months, but this soon blew out to 18 months. But, in fact, she waited 20 months, close to two years—long enough for her needs to have increased, and she is now approved for a level 4 package. I understand she is still waiting.These are not isolated cases in my electorate. I was recently contacted by the daughter of a 92-year-old woman from Berry. She has a severe hearing disability and is very frail, but she wants to stay in her home. In July 2018, she was approved for a level 2 home care package. She is asking for someone to help with the housework and general maintenance. She wants a personal alarm in case she falls, because she wont be able to get help. These are just basic things to help this lady in her 90s stay at home. At the moment, all the help she gets is two hours of housework a fortnight and someone once a month to take her grocery shopping. After waiting 12 months for a home care package, her family tried to find out how much longer it would be and they were told she would have to wait another three to seven months—some quite distressing news for her family that wants to grant their mothers wish to remain independent. Perhaps the most heartbreaking case of all was the poor gentleman who tried to get some help for his wife. She had been approved for a level 4 package but was only receiving an interim level 2 package. She was terminally ill, but she waited six months for her home care package. Devastatingly, she passed away before that assistance arrived.This isnt about statistics. It isnt about numbers. It is about people—real people who are struggling, real people who deserve better than to wait years for the small level of help that can give them the dignity, support and independence they deserve. Without the support of these packages, many of these people could end up in our already overrun hospital emergency departments. They could be forced into aged-care homes before they are ready or before they should have to go into them. They could injure themselves, deteriorate their conditions further, or worse.The people of my electorate deserve better. Their families deserve better. We need urgent action from this government to fix the mess that it has created. The government has to act now to stop the waiting list from continuing to blow out. It needs to show some real compassion and care to older Australians. These arent numbers; these are real people—someones mother or father, someones wife or husband. They are someone to somebody. They are someone to me, and I will keep fighting to make sure they get the help they deserve.","Aged Care","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs PHILLIPS (Gilmore) ","(12:21):"
349,0,0,0,1,2,"Haines, Helen, MP",282335,"Indi","IND","N/A",4848," I thank the member for Parramatta for highlighting this pressing issue. Assistance to age in place has become the most in demand form of aged care. Its about showing respect for the wishes of older people to remain in their homes and part of their communities. Of the 72,000 people waiting without having been offered any package, 11,000 are assessed as requiring a level 4 package to stay in their homes—worth $50,000 per year. That most of those waiting have been approved for Commonwealth Home Support Program, CHSP, services is not an adequate remedy. It is a confusingly similar name but a very different program. The CHSP is designed to provide entry-level care to an amount below the lowest home care package. This is far less care than someone waiting for a level 4 package needs and deserves.I see this lack of adequate care in the thousands of people on the waiting list being forced to enter residential care even though they can and want to stay at home. One man with motor neurone disease wrote to me to say he was told that his waiting time would exceed his prognosis, and still they put him in the queue. Another man wrote to me about how his wife was waiting so long for a home care package that he was no longer able to take care of her and had to place her in a residential care home. This makes little sense for government, as the annual spend on residential care per resident is higher than for a level 4 home care package. The lack of packages being made available is preventing the use of a lower cost option that the person concerned would actually prefer.The current waiting time for packages is over 12 months. I have heard from constituents who have been waiting for over two years. We heard about them here this afternoon. But, in many cases, their care needs arise suddenly and they need immediate help. Earlier this year, I heard from a constituent who was the full-time carer for her husband. She was involved in an accident and needed to go to Melbourne for surgery. She was unsure how long she would be away. Not wanting her husband to go into care, she could not get the surgery without first getting funding for a full-time carer to replace her while she was away. When care at home is needed, older people are rarely in situations where waiting is easy. It puts strain on their families, and on their communities as well. When a person is approved for a package, they are assessed for what their needs are now, not in 12 months time.Concern about waiting for home care is of special importance in regional and rural areas. We have older populations who are increasingly needing care. In my electorate of Indi, 21 per cent of people are over 65, compared with 15 per cent nationally. People in regional areas use residential care less than those in cities and face higher costs in travelling to services. In the Hume region, where my electorate is, there are 948 people on the waiting list.I commend the government for increasing the number of packages available and reducing the length of the waiting list in the last quarter; however, for older people and their families who need help now these changes are not moving fast enough. If we want to offer a consumer driven and market based home care system, we cannot have the number of packages capped so far below demand. I encourage the government to increase their rate of releasing new packages to clear the backlog. And, if the government cannot solve the problem, then we need to legislate maximum waiting times so that, in the future, older people can be certain of getting the right amount of care at the time that they need it.","Aged Care","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr HAINES (Indi) ","(12:26):"
350,0,0,0,1,2,"Collins, Julie, MP","HWM","Franklin","ALP","N/A",4849," I, too, want to thank the member for Parramatta for bringing this important issue to the parliament. Shes been very passionate, as have many on this side, about this home care waiting list for some time. We do acknowledge that the government has done a little bit of work here, but when youve got 120,000 people on the home care waiting list, when you have seen the waiting list blow out from 88,000 people 2½ years ago to 120,000 now, when its only due to political pressure from the community, from this side of the House, from unions, from workers in the sector that the government has finally actually done something—it wasnt a priority prior to that pressure—then I think it shows just what sort of government this is. This government isnt doing anywhere near enough when it comes to aged care generally, as weve seen from the royal commission, but particularly in home care packages.This is something the government could fix today if it wanted to. The government could easily bring forward packages that are in the forward estimates and deal with this issue today. The government also knows that theres about half a billion dollars currently sitting in unspent funds that could be utilised for people who have been approved a home care package. The government could also prioritise people with terminal illnesses who have less than six months to live or people in their 90s. The government could do so much more today if it chose to do so, but the fact that weve had six years of this government, four ministers, and the waiting list blowout over the last 2½ years, from 88,000 to the 120,000 that it is today, shows that whatever the governments doing it is nowhere near enough and its not good enough for all of those people and their loved ones who are advocating so hard to try to get them the care they need.As weve heard from so many speakers, these people want to stay in their own homes. Theyre able to stay in their own homes with a little bit of support. When youre in your 80s and your 90s and youve contributed to this country and you want a bit of support to stay in your home, you would have thought that the government of the day would actually be able to provide that support. Well, thats not whats happening in Australia today. Were a wealthy nation; the government should be able to fix this.As weve heard, tragically, 16,000 Australians died whilst they were waiting for home care in the 2017-18 financial year. They died without receiving the home care they had been approved to receive. We also have heard that around 14,000 people on that waiting list went into residential care or hospital before they wanted to, or before they needed to, because the care that they needed to stay at home was also not available under this government. The government needs to listen to these stories; it needs to do more. You had the Prime Minister on 7.30 saying that aged care, and home care particularly, was a priority. Well, its not something you sit on for years if its a priority; its something you act on if its a priority, and the government has been very slow to act. As Ive said, they only acted in response to pressure.Were going to turn up that pressure. Indeed, the parliament last week in the Senate approved a motion that was moved by my Tasmanian colleagues Senator Carol Brown and Catryna Bilyk that actually condemned the government for the shameful number of home care packages and the number of people on the waiting list today. So thats one chamber of this place that has actually moved a motion, which has been supported, to say the government needs to do more, as well as condemning the lack of action to date.Interestingly, we have the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook coming later this year—its just a few weeks away—and this would be an opportunity for the government to do something about the home care package waiting list. Youve got the Prime Minister saying, Well, its a priority for me, on 7.30 and then a couple of weeks later we have him in the parliament saying, No, no, no; Im going to wait till the end of the royal commission. This is something that doesnt have to wait. My call to the Prime Minister is this: you can fix this today. You can do things today to help people on this waiting list today. You have the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook in late November, early December. This is a great opportunity for the government to show that it is prioritising older Australians, to show that it will actually fund some home care packages. The government needs to deal with the home care package waiting list. It is simply not good enough that we still have today 120,000 older Australians on that waiting list. It is terrible to get those calls—as many members in here do, as weve heard today—from loved ones trying to advocate for their loved person, to get them care so that they can stay at home, because they prefer to stay at home. In this country today, this should be able to happen. Australians who want to stay at home should be able to stay at home.","Aged Care","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms COLLINS (Franklin) ","(12:30):"

It is a traditional country show with a fierce fruitcake competition and rows of prize sheep and cattle. But, amongst the fairy floss, there is also a show of force from the Strathalbyn and Communities Suicide Prevention Network. The group spent the day promoting mental health by handing out quick guides on how to access help when you need it and working to ensure that we reduce the stigma of suicide. They visited every stall, including mine.The network adopts a community based approach to mental health and empowers individuals, groups and organisations to look after the mental health and wellbeing of their patch, of each other, in our community. As they explained to me, its about having the right conversations, offering the appropriate support and encouraging our communities to adopt a culture where its okay to talk—an important message to get across in our rural communities at a time when even earning a living is proving to be a challenge for many of our farming families. Sadly, it is often our young men who find it hardest to speak up and ask for help when they are struggling to cope with the pressures of life. In 2018, suicide accounted for over 43 per cent of all deaths among 15- to 19-year-old young men and almost 40 per cent of males aged 20 to 24 years of age.As a federal MP, you attend many funerals in your community, showing your support, paying respect and joining your community to say goodbye. Earlier this year I attended a funeral not as an MP but as a friend to a young man just 19 years of age. Ive known him since he was four, when he was at kindy with my eldest son. He was a little blonde Harry Potter. He was bright. He was creative. He had so much to give and live for. But he didnt realise, and it was too much. And now his family will never, ever be the same. I think of him so often and his beautiful, attentive mum, who kept every kindy painting. She adored her son. She will never get to see the man that he should have had time to become. She recently said to me, Its an epidemic, Rebekah. Since the loss of her beautiful boy, she has heard from so many young people who have attempted or thought of suicide and from family members of people who have completed suicide. It is a fear that so many of us as parents face. The vulnerability of our young people is forever real.Ive spoken at great length in this place about the need to improve services available for our young people in rural and regional South Australia, and I will continue to advocate for increased resources for headspace services in Mount Barker and Victor Harbor and the surrounding regions, including Strathalbyn and Kangaroo Island. My community, before I was elected, did not have a single headspace—no footprint—across more than 9,000 square kilometres. Headspace is not a panacea for all mental health issues for young people, but it is certainly a start. We must do all we can to equip our young people with the skills they need to navigate life, because the statistics show that they will confront the same if not greater challenges in later life.ABS data collected from Mindframe shows that, for men, the highest suicide rates occur after the age of 80. In 2017, Monash University reviewed 140 nursing home suicides that occurred between 2000 and 2013 in an attempt to better understand why. The study identified a diagnosis of depression in two-thirds of cases and that two in five experienced loneliness. This is something very real. Over half of men and women in residential care suffer from depression, compared to 15 per cent of individuals who live in the community.A KPMG report commissioned by Suicide Prevention Australia and released in September this year found that tackling social isolation in aged care is a priority because the statistics are high. But depression is not a normal part of ageing; we need to look at how we are caring for the physical and psychological health of our older Australians. I hope that when we have the interim report from the royal commission it will shed some light for us onto the treatment of mental health in aged care.Id just like to close by saying that were losing too many—too many—of our good young people and older people in our community. It is such a wicked problem that people have such a great sense of loss and a feeling that there is no hope. We must change this, and we can do this in our society.","World Suicide Prevention Day","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) ","(12:36):"
354,0,0,0,1,2,"Allen, Katrina, MP",282986,"Higgins","LP","N/A",4852," I rise to acknowledge the recent World Suicide Prevention Day. The mental health of each of us in our community is one of the most important things that we can pay attention to. I recognise and celebrate the fact that we are taking action to deal with suicide issues all around the world, but particularly here in Australia.Mental disorders affect up to 45 per cent of Australians, and they have far-ranging effects that are long lasting. In fact, 3,000 Australians die each year from intentional self-harm. Thats 3,000 individuals, 3,000 families and 3,000 communities affected by the terrible outcome of suicide. It has a major impact on our society. In fact, more than 100,000 life years are lost every year, and thats more than from all the 20 leading causes of death around Australia.Unfortunately, men are affected more than women, with the suicide success rate—if you can call it success—of men being three times that of women. My own family has been affected by suicide. In fact, my brother Tim was lucky enough to survive multiple attempts at suicide. But my cousin Matthew, unfortunately, did not. Thats because of the lack of services which we could wrap around my cousin Matthew, who was actually in a rural area.So Im very proud to be part of the Morrison government, which is making prevention of suicide one of its highest priorities in health. There has been a significant commitment to the Long Term National Health Plan. This is not only a personal priority of our Prime Minister, Scott Morrison; it is also a personal priority of Greg Hunt, our Minister for Health. This is so important.And its not just an investment in terms of money; its an investment in terms of strategy. There is $736 million being invested in mental health. Thats a significant investment; in fact, its the largest investment to date. Of that, $500 million is for youth and Indigenous mental health, and to look at suicide prevention plans. Importantly, Christine Morgan has been declared the National Suicide Prevention Adviser. Thats to ensure that we have a whole-of-government approach to suicide. Because mental health actually affects so many different sectors of society, we need to have a whole-of-government approach.What are the specifics of what our government is doing with regard to investment in this very important problem? We are establishing 12 National Suicide Prevention Trial sites across Australia. These are to look at trials and factors that can be used to prevent suicide. There is $48 million being invested into this initiative to help understand how to improve strategies for the effective prevention of suicide. Were also investing $9 million in infrastructure projects, through state and territory governments, to ensure that we can deter people from using locations which we know are at high risk of being used for suicide. Were investing $33 million in Lifeline, which is an incredibly important telephone crisis support service. Were investing $36 million in the National Suicide Prevention Leadership and Support Program and were investing $12 million in Suicide Prevention Australia. Importantly, as we know, headspace is a wonderful initiative for our youth. It helps with prevention, and were rolling out 36 new headspaces across the whole of Australia. Im delighted that one will be rolled out in Higgins, my own electorate. This is important because we have one of the highest proportions of young people in my electorate and we have a thriving LGBTI community. We know that those who are from that important community have a much greater burden when it comes to issues with regard to mental health and suicide. So Im very delighted that this vibrant community in Higgins will be supported by the new Higgins headspace.Additionally, there are two significant changes that we are making at the system level, and they are a real-time suicide and self-harm monitoring system, with a $15 million investment, which is a really exciting change, and also that we are appointing this National Suicide Prevention Adviser. Investing in mental health and suicide prevention is not a choice; its a must.","World Suicide Prevention Day","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALLEN (Higgins) ","(12:41):"
355,0,0,0,1,2,"Hayes, Chris, MP","ECV","Fowler","ALP","N/A",4853," Tuesday 10 September marked World Suicide Prevention Day, a day which we observe to raise awareness and to commit to action to prevent suicides in our communities. Suicide is an issue that no doubt directly affects many communities and families across the nation. Recent statistics by the ABS have found that last year alone 3,046 deaths by suicide occurred. Suicide rates amongst males are three times higher than for females. To put these figures in perspective, thats eight people dying by suicide each day in Australia. These numbers make it remarkably clear that we must work together to develop an integrated and coordinated response to this very concerning issue.On this note, Id like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the tireless efforts of an organisation called MATES in Construction. Its an undertaking and its worked in this sphere, and I pay particular respect to a good friend of mine, Brad Parker, who is the CEO of the New South Wales division of MATES. I pay respect to his dedication and commitment to leading the charge against suicide in construction. MATES in Construction was established in 2008 with the support of employers and the trade union movement to address high levels of suicide in the construction industry. It was formed in direct response to a report commissioned by the Australian Institute of Suicide Research and Prevention. The report found suicide rates in the construction industry were up to 2½ times higher than the national average. The research also revealed some very confronting facts. Every year, 190 Australians in the construction industry are taking their own lives. This means that we are losing one construction worker to suicide every second day. Research also indicates that most men in these industries tend not to speak about their feelings and emotions with their colleagues at work, pride being the main barrier. But also they found that a second problem was people not being prepared to seek out support. Given that I have two sons, Nicholas and Jonathon, both working in the construction industry, this area is pretty close to my heart. MATES in Constructions program is based on the notion that suicide is everybodys business. In order to see a sizable improvement in the building and construction industry, we must not shift the responsibility solely onto mental health professionals; rather, we must ensure that everybody in the industry is playing their role.For workers in construction, suicide appears to be part of the reality of working in that industry, which is dominated by tough working conditions, very strict guidelines, time constraints and a highly transient workforce. MATES in Construction recognises that the program must be aimed at providing both training and support. Without both, the results would be insufficient. According to MATES, to do only training, without pathways, is potentially dangerous, and to do support without raising awareness is simply another employee assistance program.The MATES in Construction program delivers general awareness training to workers on site, firstly to raise awareness that there are problems with suicides in the construction industry and also to alert workers to the contributing factors and warning signs that they should look out for amongst their fellow colleagues. The next step is to provide support through clear pathways of help, with case management processes being an integral part of ensuring that workers in need of support are connected with the appropriate help. Onsite visits by field officers are also conducted to support a site and its workers, ensuring their presence until the site is closed.As have many of my side, I have had the opportunity to attend training sessions with MATES in Construction. I did one at one of my local construction sites and got to see firsthand the grassroots work that they are undertaking to improve mental health and to lower suicide rates in the construction industry. As I said, MATES in Construction is supported by all major employers in the industry, as well as by the various unions operating in that space. I encourage every member to get behind this great organisation. Make an arrangement to attend, as I did, a training session on a site. Youll get to see the absolutely instrumental and groundbreaking work being undertaken by this organisation, which is making a difference for the better in our industry.","World Suicide Prevention Day","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HAYES (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) ","(12:46):"
356,0,0,0,1,2,"Bell, Angie, MP",282981,"Moncrieff","LNP","N/A",4854," World Suicide Prevention Day is a time to reflect on those lives weve lost to suicide and to share the responsibility that we as a community have to check in on our loved ones. Its also a time to restate the commitment the Morrison government has to progress the goal of zero deaths from suicide. Im pleased to see the governments support for mental health and suicide prevention delivering more than $60 million to the Gold Coast in the five-year period from 2016-17 to 2021-22 for various programs. Unfortunately, the Gold Coast endured a higher suicide rate than the national average of 12 lives per 100,000 people, losing 14 lives per 100,000 people between 2013 and 2017.In Moncrieff, there are some very special community groups who provide invaluable services to our community to assist those with mental illness. Southport headspace are to be commended for the wonderful job they do to assist youth living with mental illness. Suicide continues to be one of the leading causes of death for our young people, as weve heard from many members today. This is why the Morrison government is delivering over $1.1 million in the next year to headspace Southport for the services they provide to those in need of help in our community.Just a few weeks ago I had the privilege of attending the headspace day, where a toolkit for a healthy headspace, with seven tips for a healthy headspace, was highlighted. The seven tips are to get into life, to learn skills for the tough times, to create connections, to eat well, to stay active, to get enough sleep and, of course, to cut back on alcohol and other drugs. Myf and Steve and the rest of the team are doing a terrific job to raise awareness of issues such as bullying and alcohol and drug use. Headspace Southport is one of the busiest centres in the country, with 11,600 occasions of service in the last financial year, compared to the national average of 3,700.The Gold Coast Centre Against Sexual Violence is another organisation doing an incredible job of providing free counselling, advocacy, information and practical legal support for women who have experienced sexual violence. This centre was founded by Di Macleod and is the only one of its type on the Gold Coast. I commend her work and the work that she does at the coalface, which changes the lives of many Gold Coasters. It was incredibly moving to hear the brave survivors stories as part of their candle-lighting ceremony recently.Towards the latter years of our lives, there can also be a tendency to feel lonely or depressed. I want to acknowledge the great work mens sheds are doing in my electorate, helping our senior Aussies with their mental health and wellbeing by preventing social isolation and providing meaningful projects. On the central Gold Coast we have the Veterans Support Group Mens Shed, the Ashmore Mens Shed and the Nerang Mens Shed. I recently visited the Ashmore shed as part of national Mens Shed Week. The fellows there are currently putting the finishing touches on a mezzanine and a refreshments area, which is looking great. I was privileged to hear the stories of the president, Gil, and of Graeme, David, Mal and Don. Don summed up the importance of the mens shed quite perfectly when he explained that if it were not for his new mates at the mens shed hed still be at the pub instead of enjoying two years of sobriety and a healthy social life.The Vietnam Veterans Federation has just received additional funding from the Morrison governments BEST Program. The $135½ thousand will go to supporting their advocacy service, for which there is high demand and which assists ex-service personnel and their families with their entitlements. The service is important because it assists in reducing the waiting time when our veterans most need it. Next door to the advocacy service is a mens shed for male and female military veterans, which is an additional place for support. Congratulations to Peter and Peter, who have worked to get this project off the ground. Nerangs mens shed will be hosting an expo at Country Paradise Parklands this week—74 sheds have been invited to attend the event. Unfortunately, I will be unable to make it, but I congratulate them on holding this event, which is connecting mens sheds around Australia. There are so many great organisations that play an important role in reaching out to some of the most vulnerable in our community.I take the opportunity to commend the governments commitment to work with local communities to reduce the number of deaths by suicide in Australia. I welcome the establishment in 2019 of the office of the National Suicide Prevention Adviser to support a whole-of-government approach to suicide prevention. This will ensure the coordination of suicide prevention activities reach Australians in the right way at the right time. To close, a conversation can make a difference and it can save a life. Be sure to ask your loved ones the important question: R U OK?","World Suicide Prevention Day","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms BELL (Moncrieff) ","(12:51):"
357,0,0,0,1,2,"Murphy, Peta, MP",133646,"Dunkley","ALP","N/A",4856," This motion, noting World Suicide Prevention Day, provides an opportunity for this parliament to acknowledge the grief that we feel across our community about those we have lost to suicide and to share the responsibility for preventing further suicides. Modelling released in September of this year by Suicide Prevention Australia shows that suicide rates will grow by up to 40 per cent over the next 10 years without better prevention and earlier intervention. The government has the full support of Labor to bring about that better prevention and earlier intervention.The Morrison governments target of reducing the suicide rate to zero, along with the appointment of Ms Christine Morgan as National Suicide Prevention Adviser to the Prime Minister, is commendable. Like all other Labor members, I look forward to working with Suicide Prevention Australia and members of the government to bring about this ambition of zero suicides. There is of course much to be done by all of us in this chamber and across the community, working together, to achieve it.Recommendations in the newly released National Mental Health Commissions 2019 report on mental health and suicide prevention reform are an excellent starting point for the work we need to get on with together, such as the collection of high-quality data, particularly on the scope of disorders and high-risk community groups, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders; undertaking a mental health service gaps analysis and implementing a National Mental Health Commission workforce strategy; addressing the broader social and economic factors that contribute to mental illness and suicide; fixing the NDIS so that streamlined access for people with psychosocial disability is working and continuing to deliver support for those who are ineligible for the NDIS; and making sure that all relevant government departments—Health, Education, Justice, Social Services, and Housing—are responsible for the design and implementation of all future national suicide prevention strategies.While suicide doesnt always occur with mental illness, experts tell us that vulnerable individuals who have an accumulation of adverse life events and are experiencing mental illness are particularly vulnerable to taking their own life. Each year, around 950,000 young Australians aged 12 to 25 will be affected by a mental health issue. Nationally, there are 110 headspace centres that support young people to strengthen their wellbeing and manage their mental health. We are very proud of the Frankston headspace, in my electorate of Dunkley, which is operated by YSAS. It delivers support for young people in the areas of not just mental health but physical health, drug and alcohol issues, and work and study, including through a youth health clinic staffed by local GPs; a GPs in schools program at McClelland College and Mornington Secondary College; and Peninsula Pride, which is a queer-straight alliance youth program funded through the Victorian state governments Healthy Equal Youth project that aims to raise awareness, promote diversity, eliminate stigma and discrimination and improve the overall mental health of young LGBTIQA+ people in our community.While headspaces across the country, like ours in Frankston, encourage resilience in young people today and every day, it is important also to note the unmet demand for youth mental health services. Headspace has assisted 520,000 young people since it was established in 2006, but we know that close to a million Australians aged 12 to 25 will face a mental health challenge each year. The majority of young people with mental health difficulties do not access services, and thats something that we need to change.Were working in my community to do that. On 2 October, the Mental Health Foundation of Australia held a Youth Suicide and Mental Health Forum in Frankston. I was fortunate to be on the speaking panel with Professor Richard Newton, the clinical director of Peninsula Mental Health Service, whose keynote speech was informative and challenging, and Im grateful to him for providing me with a lot of the data that he relied on, and which I am relying on today. We have high rates in our area of people presenting to ED with self-harm. We have high rates, unfortunately, of people committing suicide and we have a number of young people who have killed themselves who are connected, but we are working hard in my community to support programs to address this. One of those programs is THRIVE, which is a commitment to ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of every member of the school communities of Elisabeth Murdoch College, Langwarrin Primary, Langwarrin Park Primary and Woodlands. Its the Langwarrin positive education and community network, and it is doing terrific work: students thrive, parents thrive, teachers thrive and the community thrives. Ill be pleased to keep supporting that initiative as I continue as the member for Dunkley.","World Suicide Prevention Day","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MURPHY (Dunkley) ","(12:56):"
358,0,0,0,1,2,"Leeser, Julian, MP",109556,"Berowra","LP","N/A",4857," Im pleased to speak on this motion, as one of the co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of Suicide Prevention with my friend the member for Eden-Monaro. I want to take this opportunity to wish the member for Eden-Monaro well, as hes recovering from some medical matters. He makes a wonderful contribution to this topic, which has a very strong degree of bipartisan support.Death is such a dark topic, and suicide, in particular, is such a dark topic. We all know the statistics: eight people in Australia die by suicide every single day. Between 2013 and 2017, the average was 2,918 deaths by suicide per year. Its the leading cause of death for young people aged 15 to 44. Seventy-five per cent of people who die by suicide are men, 68 people of people who attempt to take their own lives are women and 65,000 Australians have attempted suicide over the past year. For every death by suicide that occurs, there are families and loved ones who, like me and countless others across Australia, are bereaved and struggle to put their lives back together with the loss of their loved one.Despite the darkness, what has given me hope in this space since I have been a member of parliament is the number of people who have made it their lifes mission and focus to do something about suicide prevention. We have something of the order of 35,000 organisations in this country. Its worth just saying that number again: there are 35,000 organisations that deal with mental health and suicide prevention. That says something about the scale of the challenge and the wide effect that suicide has right across our community. As we know, not everybody who has a mental illness will die by suicide and not everybody who dies by suicide has a mental illness, but there is a strong connection between the two of them.Im pleased to be part of a government where the Prime Minister has made zero suicides a focus of his policy. It would have been easy to say, Well promise to reduce the suicide rate by 10 per cent, but hes taken the courageous decision of saying, Let us reduce it to zero. The Prime Minister is right in doing so, because any death by suicide is a death that should have been avoided. We need to send the message to Australians more broadly that the world is better off with them. Thats why I think the governments focus, particularly on the mental health and suicide prevention of young people and Indigenous people, is so important. There is the package of over $500 million targeted at Indigenous people, particularly in the Kimberley, and those two committees that are being chaired by the minister himself. We are looking at ensuring that youve got round-the-clock phone counselling and culturally appropriate material for Indigenous people, and also that youve got awareness across the community of the signs people might see when somebody they know might be contemplating suicide, and awareness of what to do about it—thats such an important process.I think there are three particular areas where we can make an impact on suicide prevention. First, we know people who are released from acute mental health units who have made an attempt on their own lives are the most likely people to die by suicide. If you go to hospital for a broken leg or a broken arm youll often go to rehab. Sadly, in our country, not everybody who is discharged from an acute mental health unit goes into a community mental health facility. Its the reason why the government chose, in the previous budget, to fund Beyond Blue for some of the work theyre doing with the way back program, providing rehabilitation and getting people back into their communities. We need to continue to do this because they are the obvious group of people who we know are most at risk.Second, we know that the crisis lines—all privately run, like Lifeline, good people doing good works—try and answer as many calls as they can but they dont answer every call. The government has provided, in the previous budget, $34 million to increase the number of calls that are being taken by Lifeline, but we can always do more to increase those calls.Third, we need to create greater community awareness so people know the signs and know what to do if a person might be contemplating suicide.I want to end my contribution today with a quote from Arthur Millers Death Of A Salesman. At the end of that play, Willy Lomans wife, Linda, has this to say:Willy Loman never made a lot of money. His name was never in the paper. Hes not the finest character that ever lived. But hes a human being, and a terrible thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid. Hes not to be allowed to fall into his grave like an old dog. Attention, attention must be finally paid to such a person.We need to pay attention to all those in need.","World Suicide Prevention Day","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LEESER (Berowra) ","(13:01):"
359,0,0,0,1,2,"Conaghan, Patrick, MP",279991,"Cowper","Nats","N/A",4858," Im very pleased to be able to speak on this bill. In a previous life, prior to coming to this place, I served as a police officer in a country town. I attended many suicides as a police officer—many dozens over a period of four years. In fact, on one particular day I attended on three suicides. Im very pleased to hear today that both sides of the floor are bipartisan and intent on reducing deaths by suicide to zero. Im also very pleased to be part of a government that has that policy and is working towards that.The effect that suicide not only has on the families of those who die, but has on the community around them is astounding and tragic. Its tragic for the first responders—the police, the ambulance, those who have to attend, the medical officers and the people around them—particularly attending on those who are young. They were the hardest deaths to attend as a police officer, the teenagers. The teenagers who felt that they had nothing or had no-one and had no future, and yet the signs were all around that thats how they felt. But that was back in the late eighties, early nineties, and so much has changed since then. We have changed to recognise that firstly we need to have that conversation. We need to have that conversation about mental health. Over the past two or three decades, we have come so far to talk about that, to have that conversation, to ask, Are you okay?The development of headspace centres—and Im particularly proud of the headspace centres in Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbour and the work that they do. I can say that they are overloaded. They are stretched so thin. I can guarantee them that I will continue to fight for further funding for those centres. I am also very proud to say that there will be a further headspace centre set up in Kempsey where the overrepresentation of youth suicide exceeds far and beyond not only the state but Australia.I am happy to be able to speak on World Suicide Prevention Day, as I am on headspace day and R U OK? Day, because this government has now invested a record amount—never seen before—towards suicide prevention, towards talking to the community and towards talking to those who feel that they have nothing to offer. In my 18 years as a criminal defence lawyer I dealt with many who had mental health issues. I dealt with many who, unfortunately, took their lives by their own hand because of the situations they found themselves in.I feel that if the progress which has been made over the last 10 years had not been reached we would still be in that position. But because of this governments investment, and because of the bipartisan approach—and I thank the other side for that—we are working towards that zero number. But it will take more than the governments contribution; it will take the contribution of those in the community to step outside of their comfort zones and speak to somebody, asking: Are you okay? Do you need help? They need to refer them to somebody, a professional, even sometimes against their own will. Thats because in time they will turn around and say, Thank you. Thats what we need to do for the benefit of our nation and for the benefit of our people. One life matters, and we can make that difference.I thank the Morrison government and I thank the other side for their bipartisan support. I will continue to do everything I can to support people with mental health issues.Debate adjourned.Sitting suspended from 13 : 12 to 16 : 00","World Suicide Prevention Day","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CONAGHAN (Cowper) ","(13:06):"

James is one of 4,000 hearing impaired Australians who rely on CapTel to maintain communication with friends, family, government services, clients, business associates, technicians and tradespeople. The existing CapTel service works like any phone, except the callers voice is changed to text on a small screen attached to the phone, with captions provided by the National Relay Service. From 1 February 2020, the NRS will no longer support the CapTel handset, so users must switch to a teletypewriter in order to receive captured phone calls.At my meeting with James, he invited me to use this new service. I have to say I was shocked at how difficult, complicated and prone to error it was. From my experience that day and from feedback I have received from James and many others like him, it seems this new service is a step backwards. It is too difficult to use, especially for the elderly. We are facing the very real danger that members of our community who are already in a vulnerable and isolated state are about to lose a very important service and sense of connectivity.

That is far too long. Why does it take so long? There have been six workplace fatalities in the mining industry in the last 12 months. That is six too many.Jack was operating a large mining excavator and became entangled in the retractable ladder.

This is part of a year-long unique right-of-passage educational program, and I want to congratulate Sue Hibbard, the secondary schoolteacher who organised and coordinated all of these groups. Why was it so important? Because it was a little bit different. What it was about was ensuring that individual groups of students can come into a local MPs office, or somewhere like the city library or the Bendigo Bank or a post office, and they had some challenges put forward to them. They had to ask to speak to the nominated person. They had to ask four general questions. They had to introduce themselves and their team with a firm handshake and to look in the eye of the person they were speaking to. I think thats an incredibly good thing to be doing in terms of education, because it teaches them to be independent, to be organised, to be on time, to be confident and have a go. There were a few which were a little bit challenging for them to get past. The eye contact, I have to say, was difficult for a couple of participants, but they got through it. I want to congratulate the Christian college and, once again, Sue Hibbard for the work that she is doing to encourage independence in our young students and to encourage confidence, because, if I could give our young children anything at all, it would the confidence to get on with what it is that they want to achieve in their life.

Seven or eight years ago, their industry was in crisis when they were losing up to 80 per cent of their stock to a problem with the food supply. They retreated down to Port Lincoln, but they have stabilised those problems. Theyve overcome those problems and they are back with a vengeance. They are planning to double production over the next three years, to 4,000 tonnes a year of premium product. They won $2½ million from the Regional Jobs and Investment Package into the Upper Spencer Gulf and have been negotiating to bring fish farming back to Whyalla, where it had been previously successfully done. Theyve had a few teething issues with the council, getting access to the marina there, but I am very confident that resolution will be found soon and this great industry will be expanding back at Whyalla.","Clean Seas Seafood","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[10]/speech/talk.text/body/p","Mr RAMSEY (Grey—Government Whip) ","(16:11):"

The event encourages young people to embrace creative and positive pursuits, and the festival also has an important educational function in my electorate. This event is the culmination of nine months of work for the dedicated volunteers, who successfully promote strong positive messages about the vitality, diversity and cultural richness of Melbournes west, also helping to dispel some misconceptions of the area.

For over 12 months the 7th Brigade has been in their ready period, which made them the go-to brigade for Australias land force requirements. The period involves significantly more training as well as a number of operational deployments for the service personnel across that period. Within the brigade there were almost 2,000 people who were deployed during the ready period, on five different operations overseas, as well as 400 members that went for training in Malaysia. Theyve had a particular focus during the ready period on our pacific region—our neighbours—with a number of them having come to train in Australia with our forces. So, for the service men and women of the 7th, this has been a key period of their service where their skills were put to the test.For their families it was a particular sacrifice requiring the serving mums and dads, husbands and wives to be away from their loved ones for lengthy periods. These families, who play an enabling role, are just as important as the service personnel themselves. They mark the end of this busy ready period with an open day at the Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera, where those families can come and spend some time on the base and share some quality time together.The open day was well supported by the local community who especially enjoyed seeing the new boxer vehicle, but, like me, they wanted to extend their gratitude to the service men and women of the 7th and their families for their efforts and sacrifices.","Australian Army: 7th Brigade","MOTIONS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[14]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SIMMONDS (Ryan) ","(16:17):"

Just a few weeks ago, 4,000 of these solar powered lights were delivered to villages along the Kokoda Track in Papua New Guinea. Approximately 40 per cent of children under the age of eight in Papua New Guinea cant read or write. In part, this is due to a lack of lighting after dark. This is an entirely preventable issue, and yet without adequate lighting for study a childs ability to develop the skills needed to read and write to break the cycle of poverty is impeded.The SolarBuddy workshop aims to tackle social injustice in the sphere of learning, and highlights the importance of light in a childs education. In Australia, lighting is a resource we take for granted, and its certainly not the first thing that comes to mind when we talk about study resources. However, in countries like Papua New Guinea it is just as important as pencils, paper, books and teachers.

Thats a century of advancing social justice and promoting decent work. Theres a reason to celebrate, because quite simply the world today is a better place because of the ILO. As a specialised agency of the United Nations, its been a key force across borders in helping to reduce exploitation, discrimination and inequality, and promote collective bargaining. The organisation was established following the First World War in an effort to bridge the gap between governments, employers and working people.The ILO rose from the ashes of that disastrous conflict, the war that was meant to end all wars, created in the belief that social justice is essential to universal and lasting peace. Originally an agency of the League of Nations, the ILO has continued as a specialist agency for over a century. Today, 187 member states work together on improving labour standards and developing standards throughout the world. Its a tripartite organisation that seeks cooperation between governments, employers and workers through the development of policy, standards and programs that reflect the views of all representative groups.The ILO has a rich history of fighting for some of the worlds poorest people. Its played an important role in Australia and beyond our shores by improving incomes, working conditions, safety, equality and protections at work, as well as boosting productivity and living standards. The organisation has been a driving force behind reforming oppressive work practices, removing discrimination and, importantly, ending child labour. The ILO has passed some of the most important international agreements that Australia is a signatory to, including the Forced Labour Convention of 1930, banning forced or compulsory labour; the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention of 1948, providing the right to union organising for collective bargaining; the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention of 1949, protecting against discrimination for joining a trade union and taking collective action; the Equal Remuneration Convention of 1951, providing the right to equal pay, and the removal of gender discrimination; the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention of 1958, providing the right not to be discriminated against on the grounds of race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin; and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention of 1999, prohibiting the worst forms of child labour, notably slavery, prostitution, drug trafficking and other dangerous jobs. Today the work of this wonderful organisation has made a profound transformation. The next century will see globalisation and technological change create even more new paths to prosperity, but so too will existing work arrangements be upended. The disrupters will soon be disrupted.Climate change, shifting demographics, migration and changes in the organisation of work will affect all societies, including our own. The demand for some jobs will change, while others will disappear or may not resemble what they used to be. The ILO will remain a constant among this certain change. Thats why Labor calls on the government to adopt a more cooperative approach to workplace relations in Australia, in the model of the ILO tradition thats been in place for 100 years. That tradition is one of the parties getting together and working together on problems in workplaces throughout the world, ending some of the worst forms of discrimination; introducing equality; boosting the wages, conditions and living standards of workers; and, in doing so, lifting national income and lifting people out of poverty in so many societies throughout the world. Its that tradition, instead of one based on conflict and union bashing, that we call on the government to adopt in their approach to industrial relations. Working with unions and employers can help to improve Australias incomes and living standards, and Im very pleased that the member for Cooper, who has had a long involvement with the ILO through her role as the head of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, will be seconding this motion.","International Labour Organization: 100th Anniversary","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr THISTLETHWAITE (Kingsford Smith) ","(16:46):"

397,0,0,0,1,2,"Wallace, Andrew, MP",265967,"Fisher","LNP","N/A",4874," Im extraordinarily grateful to the member for Kingsford Smith since he gives me the perfect opportunity to highlight once again for the benefit of the House the stark contrast which exists between some of the best of what has been achieved in protecting workers and the diabolical conduct of the absolute embarrassment which passes for a trade union in the Australian construction sector today.Banning forced or compulsory labour; prohibiting discrimination on race, gender, religious or political grounds; and working to stop dangerous child labour are critical projects, and doubtless the International Labour Organization has played a valuable and worthwhile role. But, in stark contrast to these admirable achievements, what is todays CFMMEU fighting for? It is the right for workers to walk off the job if the temperature exceeds 28 degrees Celsius and the humidity rises above 75 per cent in South-East Queensland. For the benefit of our southern members, 28 degrees is not a hot day in South-East Queensland. Frankly, I hope the CFMMEU officials who dreamt this up are ashamed of themselves, but I wouldnt hold my breath. There were 13 days last year which wouldve been lost as a result of these conditions.So thats what todays CFMMEU is fighting for: nearly an extra three working weeks off for its members, which most workers would be ashamed to take, surely. Those are 13 days a year on which our police officers, firefighters, council workers, farmers, and posties will carry on working and contributing to this country while watching our construction workers shirk off for a lie-down in the shade—that is, only those construction workers working on a CFMMEU building site.","International Labour Organization: 100th Anniversary","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WALLACE (Fisher) ","(16:52):"

Unfortunately, however, as we know, todays CFMMEU gets much worse than simply proposing unproductive and unfair rules like this. Just a few days ago we saw the latest in a seemingly endless procession of fines imposed on the CFMMEU for unlawful behaviour. No amount of financial penalties, it seems, is enough to make these recidivist law-breakers reconsider their constant contraventions. Theres an irony to this motion coming, as it does, in the wake of this latest judgement. The member for Kingsford Smith asks the House to recognise the ILOs role in promoting freedom of association, while, all over Australia, its a freedom that the CFMMEU consistently denies to workers in the construction industry. In the most recent case, a CFMMEU official, Kevin Pattinson, defied that right by preventing an electrician and a young apprentice from working on a site at Monash University, because they were not members of the union. As Justice Snaden said:It is bad enough that it should so casually intrude upon rights of free association so valued by societies of conscience; much worse that it should do so, yet again, in deliberate defiance of the law that it has been told time and time again that it must obey.I doubt the fines of $69,000 imposed by the court will do anything to stem the tide of CFMMEU law breaking—$16 million of previous fines have not. As Justice Snaden pointed out, there is a long list of judicial officers whose exasperated admonitions appear to have been met with studied indifference.Victorian state secretary John Setka is reported to have been dismissive of judges who:… call us criminals [and] all sorts of things [and] fine us millions of dollars [despite having] probably never done a day’s work in their li[ves].If Mr Setka and his co-conspirators in the CFMMEU do not want their organisation to be called criminal, I would suggest that a simple remedy exists: stop behaving like criminals, learn to obey the laws of the country and get back to work. This week Mr Setka is taking part in the CFMMEUs national conference in Adelaide. I understand hes trying to bring the South Australian branch of the union under his own branchs control. God help the country and God help the currently successful and growing construction industry in South Australia if his empire building is allowed to go on.","International Labour Organization: 100th Anniversary","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[5]","N/A","N/A"
400,0,0,0,1,2,"Kearney, Ged, MP","LTU","Cooper","ALP","N/A",4875," Im incredibly pleased to second this motion, and I will not resort to such tripe as the member for Fisher has by denigrating this important anniversary of the International Labour Organization on 29 October. At the Lowy Institute, the Prime Minister said that sovereign nations need to eschew an unaccountable internationalist bureaucracy and the world needs to avoid negative globalisation. Hed be surprised to hear the member for Fisher singing the praises of the ILO, one of those negative, globalist institutionalist bureaucracies. Maybe the Prime Minister needs to listen to the member for Fisher.It is international globalisation and solidarity that have delivered some of the most significant social protections and advances, over a long period of time. This is true of the ILO, which was formed in 1919. As my friend the member for Kingsford Smith, who moved this great motion, let us know, it was formed out of the wreckage of the First World War. It then ran smack bang into the turmoil of the Great Depression, fascism and the resulting Second World War. In the midst of that war in 1944, the US and other allies had the foresight to recognise that the ILO would be a key part in building a more prosperous and peaceful world. In 1944, the countries that could gathered together as the ILO issued the Philadelphia declaration. The declaration formed a series of key principles to embody the work of the ILO:(a) labour is not a commodity;(b) freedom of expression and of association are essential to sustainedprogress;(c) poverty anywhere constitutes a danger to prosperity everywhere;(d) the war against want requires … unrelenting vigour—for the… promotion of the common welfare.Over the last 73 years, the governing body of the ILO, the annual International Labour Conference, ILO committees and ILO expert bodies—which I have proudly been a part of—have played a major role in making us think about global standards for workplace rights and safety, fair jobs and social protections. The remarkable thing about the ILO is that it is tripartite—the only United Nations organisation so structured. One half of the votes are the participating nations, one quarter are representatives of employers and one quarter are representatives of workers organisations—unions. This means that, when conventions and recommendations are adopted, theyve been carefully worked through to achieve an outcome that most tripartite partners are comfortable with.The other remarkable thing is that, unlike the mythology about UN organisations, no outcome is imposed on any country. Apart from the core eight conventions, its up to individual countries themselves to adopt and ratify conventions and their recommendations. However, the foundation of the ILO is a recognition that isolationism by wealthy countries will be to the detriment of every country. That is because unless you lift living standards and workers entitlements then we all know that poverty and inequality within and between countries will lead to conflict and that low wages and low living standards will see capital and jobs move from one country to another. That is even more true today than it was in 1919 or 1944.In the modern world, the ILO has an enormous amount of work to do to ensure that we consider and understand the future of work, consider the effects of mass migration of labour and consider the behaviour and responsibilities of transnational corporations. In a world where many of them have bigger budgets than many small countries, it has been the ILO that has done such important work in the last two decades—in Burma, after democracy was restored; in Bangladesh, after Rana Plaza; and in Cambodia. The ILO assists developing countries to build modern regulatory systems, and it would be to our detriment and to the detriment of millions of workers around the world if we did not have these standards.Many of the problems that face workers today are age-old in nature. To name just a few, there is modern slavery, sex discrimination and lack of social support. Im honoured to have been part of the ILO process and, in particular, the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention. I actually pay tribute to the then Liberal IR minister, Eric Abetz, who ensured that it was ratified by Australia. There is the Domestic Workers Convention. There is the Violence and Harassment Convention, which absolutely outlines that employers and workplaces have a role in dealing with family and domestic violence.Coalition governments over the last six years have not fulsomely funded Australian ILO participation or the work of the ILO. On the occasion of the ILOs 100th anniversary, we should recognise it as one of the most enduring, important and successful of all the United Nations bodies. We should all recommit, in a bipartisan way, to supporting the ILO in its important work and to funding it accordingly. I say today: happy birthday to the ILO, and thank goodness we have it.","International Labour Organization: 100th Anniversary","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms KEARNEY (Cooper) ","(16:57):"
401,0,0,0,1,2,"Wilson, Tim, MP","IMW","Goldstein","LP","N/A",4877," Its a privilege to be able to speak on this motion, because at the heart of this motion is the very aspiration of a nation and a global community to achieve the good ends of a hard days pay for a hard days work, of people living with the dignity of work and of being able to build a better world. Thats why Im actually quite happy to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the International Labour Organization. Its an organisation that, despite the protests of the member for Cooper, is built from the idea that countries work together to achieve global ends based on our collective interests.But we wont be dictated to by those organisations; we will simply do what we can to work together with others when it achieves our ends. Of course, the mover of the motion, the member for Kingsford Smith, particularly called on those in the government to, as he said, stop union bashing. I might remind the member for Kingsford Smith of the traditions and the foundation of the modern Liberal Party. In fact, I have on my phone right here a flyer where the author, Sir Robert Menzies, talked about how we believe in the rights of wage earners and we stand for the best wages and conditions that industry can afford. We stand for incentive payments for increased production and for profit-sharing wherever possible and practical. We stand for the right of unions to express their wishes through the democratic medium of the secret ballot.Coalition governments have consistently supported the rights of working people. What we have never supported are the interests of trade unions over their members. We have stood by the workers, not by collective centralised interests. The member for Kingsford Smith, if he were honest, would recognise that he should not be calling for the end of union bashing; what he should be calling for is the end of union bashers, particularly where unions bash their members and their interests. Thats why the member for Fisher was so prescient in his observations, particularly about the CFMMEU and in the calling out of their conduct and their misbehaviour.When you think about the ambitions of the International Labour Organization, you think about global aspirations for the type of world that we want to live in—one where people can work, where were free from discrimination and slavery, where people can go about living their lives freely without coercion. Do you think today thats an aspiration that shared by people like John Setka, with the type of conduct that he has sanctioned and endorsed? Whether they like it or not, the Australian Labor Party, by choice, are joined at the hip with the CFMMEU and their acolytes, and, by that continued relationship, they are ultimately sanctioning and endorsing that type of conduct.Lets just look at some of the statements that have been made not by me, not by members of the government, but by people of independent courts, like Justice Bromberg from the Federal Court:The CFMMEU, and in particular the—Victorian Construction and General—Divisional Branch, has an appallingly long history of prior contraventions of industrial laws.… … …… there is no evidence before me … of any compliance regime ever put in place by the CFMMEU to address its long history of prior contraventions.And whats the response? Fine after fine after fine for their conduct. Justice Burnett from the Federal Circuit Court said:The CFMEU, as a holistic organisation, has an extensive history of contraventions dating back to at least 1999. The only reasonable conclusion to be drawn is that the organisation either does not understand or does not care for the legal restrictions on industrial activity imposed by the legislature and the courts.That is the despicable history of the CFMMEU, amongst many others.When we look at the 100th anniversary of the ILO and the aspirations that sit behind it, we look to the Australian trade union movement and their political representatives in this place and say: How about you aspire to meet the aspirations of the organisation that you want to celebrate on its centenary? Why dont we live up to the aspirations and why dont you sign up to the aspirations of improving living standards, engaging in lawful conduct and making sure we remove slavery and discrimination? That would be a sincere motion in defence of and advancing the aspirations of the ILO today.","International Labour Organization: 100th Anniversary","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) ","(17:02):"
402,0,0,0,1,2,"Claydon, Sharon, MP",248181,"Newcastle","ALP","N/A",4878," It gives me great pleasure to rise in support of the motion from the member for Kingsford Smith paying tribute to the International Labour Organization for reaching this incredible milestone of 100 years. Its a pity that the speaker before me didnt seem to actually appreciate the significant role that Australia has played as a founding member state of the ILO and a continuing key partner in the ILO in promoting in a decent work agenda for people across the globe. Indeed, the cooperation between Australia and the ILO in our region is profound and absolutely worth celebrating. As I said, Australia has been a member of the ILO since it was founded back in 1919.The ILO was the first specialised agency of the United Nations. It started at the end of World War I with the mission of advancing social justice and human and labour rights by establishing international labour standards. A former ILO director-general has described the primary role of the ILO today as being:… to promote opportunities for women and men to obtain decent and productive work, in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity.No matter which part of the world you live in, your ability to get decent, secure work will have an enormous impact on the kind of life youre able to live. Its very easy to take things like the eight-hour working day and minimum wages for granted, but we need to remember that they dont come about by themselves or by accident. They come about through the tireless commitment and hard work of organisations, of bodies, like the ILO. Indeed, the ILO has been at the forefront of defining, defending and enshrining these sorts of rights across the globe since its inception. It has a centurys worth of achievements in bringing to an end exploitation, standing up to discrimination and addressing inequality. And its driven some of the most important and wide-ranging international labour agreements and conventions in history. These include the banning of forced and child labour, enshrining the right to organise and the right to equal pay regardless of gender, and protection against discrimination on any grounds, including race, gender, religion, political affiliations or union membership.The ILO has also worked tirelessly to address specific issues of worker exploitation on the ground. I was very fortunate to be part of a parliamentary delegation to Doha last month. I was especially pleased to meet with the head of Qatars International Labour Organization Project Office. We discussed the ILOs work on the ground and the groundbreaking reforms they were embarking on in Qatar to protect the rights of migrant workers, including the freedom to change jobs, the removal of exit permits and a non-discriminatory minimum wage. Given that 90 per cent of the population in Qatar are migrant workers, these changes are profoundly important, and I am very pleased that Qatars Council of Ministers has now formally endorsed these reforms and that they will come into force in January of next year.All of this has been achieved through a very unique tripartite governing structure. Here representatives from government, employers and workers work together to debate and develop these important labour standards. The ILO has demonstrated time and time again that this is a fantastic model that works well. But of course it takes genuine commitment from all sides to be negotiating in good faith. This government could learn a lot from this model. Too many times weve seen this government take an actively aggressive position when it comes to workers rights—weve just heard the rhetoric from the speakers before me. Indeed, the only thing that seems to energise those opposite is attacking organisations that are there to protect workers and fight for better conditions.While the government has left energy policy to languish and hasnt attempted to solve issues like homelessness and poverty, it has devoted an incredible amount of time to policies designed to tear down unions and slash workers pay and conditions. We all know what thats led to: record profits and flat-lining wages, which, in turn, have driven widespread inequality, a hollowing out of the middle class and dangerously flagging growth. I urge this government to look at the evidence, listen to the experts and start a genuine engagement with workers and the organisations that represent them.","International Labour Organization: 100th Anniversary","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CLAYDON (Newcastle) ","(17:07):"

But there is an incredible difference between the ILO and the current Australian Labor Party, I have to say. Quite simply, the Australian Labor Party has abandoned workers in this country. They do not represent working people anymore, and Ill expand on that as in the next few minutes.Where do they come from? According to the ABS Characteristics of Employment in August of 2018, of the 10½ million employees who were surveyed in August 2018, 15 per cent reported being a member of a trade union associated with their main job—so roughly 1½ million members. Where have they come from? In 1976, there were 2½ million members. I think if we want to compare and contrast the 1976 ALP with the current one, we need to look at the change in population. In 1976, there were just 14 million Australians. There are now 25 million. That is an incredible change, over four decades, as to who was actually representing working people. Why is it so? Quite simply, the decisions made by Labor governments, whether they be state or federal, have not been in the interests of people who are out there working hard, who are putting on their steel cap boots and their high-vis shirts and their working helmets and construction gear and going out there and earning a living. These are individuals who are proud of what they do; theyre proud of their job and theyre proud of their industry, and they have every right to be so.For some examples we only need to look at the true Premier of Queensland, Jackie Trad, who said to the entire resources industry, You need to transition out of your industry into another job. This was to an industry that provides over $200 billion of GDP for Australia and over 200,000 jobs. And in some places generations of one family have worked in that industry—three, four or five generations, all the way back to when the first coal was actually shipped from here to India in the 1800s! It might have been earlier than that, but it was substantially a long time ago.So the Australian Labor Party no longer represents working people at all. If we look at the sugar industry: what theyve done now in Queensland is extend what they called the reef regulations into my region. These are the reef regulations which have been in place in Far North Queensland, in areas where there is run-off that goes out towards the Great Barrier Reef. But what we know, and whats been put up by scientists, is that my area of the catchment simply doesnt go into the reef. So they have put another layer of legislation and bureaucracy over those hardworking individuals who are on farms, whether they are members of unions or not, for a regulation which makes absolutely no difference to the outcome for the Great Barrier Reef.If we look at vegetation laws, its exactly the same. There is no greater renewable industry than the timber industry. It is the useful product which grows over a period of time and which can be replaced. Its been a very important industry right across Australia for a substantial amount of time and yet we have Labor governments continuing to put those people out of work.So once again we can look at what Australian Labor says compared to what it does. It is not about working people. Thats because it wants to take away their jobs and their right to earn; the ability for them to pay for themselves and their families, to educate their kids, to put food on the table and to pay for their own housing. I just think its abhorrent where the Labor Party has ended up over this period of time. Unfortunately, it now represents some kind of inner-city trend which is the slogan of the day. This morning we saw the announcement of a climate emergency. It was so important to the Australian Labor Party that there were six of them in the chamber—just six! That is sloganeering at its absolute worst.We can look at what happened in Queensland with the Paradise Dam. What a debacle! The Australian Labor Party and the Queensland Labor government have tried to spin their way out of this. The first thing was that it was free water for drought-stricken farmers. The next one was that it was an inquiry into emergency management procedures for downriver communities. The latest one is, Weve filled the weir at the Gregory River, which supplies the townships of Woodgate and Childers. Now of course we have an unspecified safety issue. The reality is that the loss of that water is the loss of wealth in my community; it is the loss of future jobs. It is something that the Australian Labor Party should be standing up for and delivering opportunities for those individuals, whether they live in the cities or in the regions. Unfortunately, they have absolutely lost their way.Debate adjourned.A division having been called in the House of Representatives—Sitting suspended from 17 : 18 to 17 : 31","International Labour Organization: 100th Anniversary","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PITT (Hinkler) ","(17:12):"
404,0,0,0,1,2,"OBrien, Llew, MP",265991,"Wide Bay","LNP","N/A",4881," I move:That this House:(1) notes the important, practical contribution the Black Spot Program makes in addressing the nations road toll under the National Road Safety Action Plan 2018-2020;(2) recognises the need for the Government to continue to invest in the Black Spot Program to improve road safety and reduce the death toll;(3) commends the Government for putting road safety at the forefront of infrastructure investment, with further commitments to providing an additional $50 million per year from 2019-20 to 2022-2023 to the Black Spot Program; and(4) acknowledges the Governments Black Spot Program reduces on average at the treated sites, death and serious injury from crashes by 30 per cent according to data from the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics.It is an important issue that I speak about today, this private members motion that Ive put forward. Im pleased to speak on it because road safety is everyones responsibility. It doesnt matter whether youre a truck driver or a cyclist or a pedestrian, you have a responsibility to use the road network, our road transport system, in a way that ensures that you get home safely and that your conduct gives other road users the best opportunity to get home safely. We all need to strive for that goal of zero fatalities.Here in Australia, and in most of the developed countries, weve adopted a safe systems approach. This is a methodology thats built on the premise that humans, road users, are fallible and that we will make mistakes and that we need to educate drivers to the best of our ability. But we also need to ensure that we have the best technologies for our vehicles to make them as safe as possible and that the standards for our vehicles are as high as they possibly can be. Another responsibility is, of course, building safe infrastructure and thats a very important element of the safe systems approach.As the federal government our main responsibility with the road transport network is the national highway—some 14,000 km of national highway. We heavily fund big infrastructure projects in conjunction with the states, but we mustnt forget, and we dont forget, as a government that there are some 900,000 kilometres of roads in this country and they are the responsibility of both the states and the local governments. Thats where the Commonwealth helps out with other kinds of funding, such as the Bridges Renewal Program and the Roads to Recovery program. These are major funding initiatives under which the Commonwealth, in conjunction with local governments and the states, puts forward money to ensure that we have the safest road network. The Black Spot Program fits into that category.The Black Spot program is part of our National Road Safety Strategy 2011-2020. Its a program that enables individuals, local governments or states to apply for funding where a location has a crash history or a record of serious incidents. Under the funding we can put in some form of treatment to remedy it. That treatment might be signage or a roundabout or lights. There are any number of different options that can be put forward under the Black Spot Program, which is why it is a successful program.The Commonwealth government takes this program very seriously. In the last budget we committed some $50 million in addition to the existing $60 million that had been contributed to the fund, putting our annual contribution to $110 million a year. Over the decade 2013 to 2023 well have spent some $1 billion. Already since weve been in government some 2,300 treatments to roads, improving their standard, have been completed under the Black Spot Program. We know that the majority of serious crashes happen in rural and regional areas, so 50 per cent of all black-spot funding is assured of going to non-metropolitan areas.The true indicator of the value of the black-spot funding is the results. It has been proven that where black-spot funding has been used there has been a 30 per cent reduction in fatal and serious accidents. That is quite an outstanding reduction in accidents and is something that we need to take note of. Its certainly something we need to continue to fund. Its estimated that some 280 lives will have been saved and 14,000 serious crashes will have been prevented in the decade. I encourage everyone to ensure that they keep a close eye on this program and put in an application where possible.","Black Spot Program","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LLEW OBRIEN (Wide Bay) ","(17:31):"

409,0,0,0,1,2,"Haines, Helen, MP",282335,"Indi","IND","N/A",4882," Im pleased to speak in support of the motion of the member for Wide Bay. The Black Spot Program is vitally important in any electorate but is particularly important across the rural communities that the member for Wide Bay and I represent. I acknowledge the latest round of funding, announced by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development in July, when the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development funded three black-spot projects in my north-east Victorian electorate of Indi. In Towong shire the program is contributing $179,000 to improve safety on the Lake Road near Bethanga. In neighbouring Alpine shire, on the spectacular Bogong High Plains Road, its providing $1.418 million for major safety upgrades. In the southern shire of Murrindindi its contributing $51,000 for kerb warning and speed signs and markers on Skyline Road near Eildon.The departments Black Spot Program web page shows that funding is mainly available for work to reduce road risks at known black spots or to improve safety on road lengths when there is a proven history of accidents. Eligibility can be considered when at intersections or mid-block or short road sections there is a history of at least three casualty crashes over a five-year period—on lengths of road there should be an average of 0.2 casualty crashes per kilometre per annum over the length in question over five years; sites have a recurring problem; and, finally, there are road locations that could be considered as accidents waiting to happen, where there should be a road safety audit.In this context, Id like to draw the chambers attention to a notorious section of a major highway in my electorate that should qualify for support from this program. In March 2002, The Age published a story about roads in the Southern Ranges. It said:Over the past five Easter breaks, the roads through the Yarra Ranges, and neighbouring shires of Murrindindi and Delatite—now the shire of Mansfield—… have proven to be among the most treacherous outside Melbourne, according to the Transport Accident Commission.In Easter breaks since 1997, crashes in these three municipalities alone left one person dead and 51 people seriously injured.In Easter breaks since 1997, crashes in these three municipalities alone left one person dead and 51 people seriously injured.Last year, crashes in the Yarra Ranges claimed 17 lives and caused 193 serious injuries.The winding Black Spur has had 99 casualty crashes since 1997: five fatalities, 35 serious casualty crashes and 59 lesser injury crashes.That story was 17 years ago, and its a road thats still to be fixed.The day before the 2019 election result was declared in Indi, I was visiting the communities of Marysville and Alexandra. In two meetings, local people again told me about the Black Spur section of Maroondah Highway. The highway has a history of distressing, fatal and numerous serious injury crashes, but community concern about the risks at Black Spur is so pronounced that two weeks ago at Marysville Community Centre up to 200 people gathered to discuss what can be done. My colleagues from the Victorian parliament Cindy McLeish MP, member for Eildon, and Tania Maxwell MLC, member for Northern Victoria, were present. So was Murrindindi Shire Councils chief executive Craig Lloyd, representatives from Murrindindi Inc. and VicRoads.Maroondah Highway is the only direct major road from the Yarra Valley town of Healesville, up towards Narbethong and through to Buxton or across to Marysville. It then goes north to Taggerty. From there it heads on to Alexandra, while another arterial road branches from it at Taggerty to carry traffic to and from Eildon. The highway is critical for business and tourism between Murrindindi communities and Melbournes east. Its also a spectacular drive, described to me as the ranges version of the Great Ocean Road.But Black Spur remains a serious challenge for people and communities on the highway because for much of its winding length of about 10 kilometres it is impossible—and illegal—to overtake. Its a road that needs better signage, more slow vehicle turnouts, better sealing, bicycle lanes and active management of old roadside trees, because the road passes through a wonderful forest of mountain ash. As it is, when trees fall or accidents occur, the road is often closed for hours. This forces travellers to take major detours on unsealed forest roads or back through Yea to drive an alternative route to Melbourne. Maroondah Highway is to be closed for three days this week and one day next week in daylight hours for major tree-felling works.The people in the communities of Murrindindi want a safe and reliable highway. The Black Spot Program can help to deliver one. I look forward to working with government to make this happen.","Black Spot Program","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr HAINES (Indi) ","(17:37):"
410,0,0,0,1,2,"Broadbent, Russell, MP","MT4","Monash","LP","N/A",4884," Road safety is a national priority for the Australian government, and its committed to reducing the number of deaths and serious injuries caused by road crashes. The Black Spot Program is part of that intention. Its estimated that over 10 years these 2,374 projects will have saved 280 lives and prevented 14,400 crashes. The Black Spot Program provides funding for safety works, including roundabouts, crash barriers and street lights at places where there have been serious crashes or where serious crashes are likely. Of the $1.7 billion federal contribution, a total of $19,720,471 has been put towards projects in my electorate. Thats a lot of money. In Monash, so far 55 of the proposed 68 projects have been completed, with the remaining 13 to be completed in the near future.In the 2019-20 budget the Australian government has committed to an additional $50 million per year to the Black Spot Program from 2019-20. This additional funding is part of a $2.2 billion Local and State Government Road Safety Package. The government will provide $1 billion to the Black Spot Program from 2013-14 to 2022-23. A total of 275 projects across Australia have been approved for the 2019-20 program year, bringing the total number of projects approved since 2013-14 to 2,374. I am concerned about where this money is being spent. Ive just been made chair of Victorias Black Spot Program committee and Ive learned a whole lot more about the program than I knew before. Thank you to the Deputy Prime Minister for the appointment, which carries no benefit but probably a lot of hard work!My concern is this: having been a product of local government, having known local government and having been in local government reform, we design councils so that they would be more viable around Victoria.

414,0,0,0,1,2,"Phillips, Fiona, MP",147140,"Gilmore","ALP","N/A",4885," I have spoken many times in this place about the safety of the Princes Highway. As the main road connecting many communities along the coast, its local and economic importance cannot be overstated. But the highway is not the only road that is in desperate need of safety upgrades in my electorate. Local roads in regional areas can be impacted by a number of things, like our population quadrupling over the holidays. We are a farming and defence community. Tractors, trucks and other heavy equipment are regular users of our roads. We are proud of our industries and we rely on our holiday-makers, but our roads can sometimes bear the brunt of that.Shoalhaven City Council has over 1,700 kilometres of council serviced roads to maintain, an expensive exercise by any estimation. The Black Spot Program is there to help councils make our roads safer, so we can try and reduce the ever-climbing national road toll. This program delivers strong road safety benefits, but it needs to have the right investment to achieve this goal, and there are real consequences for delays in that funding. All three councils in my electorate have applied for funding under the latest round of this program, and I want to talk a little about why these projects are so important.Shoalhaven City Council has 13 projects on its wish list, totalling almost $7.9 million. I understand that councils top priority this year is to fix the Currarong Road. The campaign to fix this road has been running for years, and residents have been left disappointed in the past. The Currarong Community Association has been leading this campaign, and, sadly, we have recently seen yet more evidence of why this road needs to be fixed. Our community has been left devastated by the news that a 17-year-old man from Erowal Bay has been left in an induced coma following a crash on this road on 12 October. There is a tragic list of injuries to this poor young man, and a GoFundMe campaign that has been set up to help his family has had strong local support. This road is dangerous. It needs fixing, and I am pleased that this is a top priority for council. If successful, funding will be used to widen the road and install a shoulder and for other safety treatments on a stretch of road spanning between 7½ and 11½ kilometres. At a total project cost of $4.6 million, this project is expensive. That can make it harder to meet the benefit-cost ratio the program requires, but it doesnt lessen the urgency.Another priority for council is Kangaroo Valley Road on Berri Mountain. Council wants $317,000 to install some fence line guideposts and rub rails to try and make the 12½ kilometres of this notorious road along the edge of the mountain safe. Council is also hoping to fund roundabouts at Currambene Street in Huskisson and Osborne Street in Nowra. Some of councils projects are more modest than others: $60,000 for design and investigation works at the corner of Osborne and North streets in Nowra, an intersection across from the local school—a small price to pay for our childrens safety.Eurobodalla Shire Council has three projects on its wish list. Council is asking for $4.3 million for a protective right lane turn and traffic signals on Beach Road, Batemans Bay. Council also wants $3.8 million to realign the bends on George Bass Drive at Lilli Pilli, and $3 million to enhance the shoulders, improve the line markings and increase sight lines at Tomakin Road at Mogo. Recently, Kiama Municipal Council successfully updated Crooked River Road in Gerroa, with more than $97,000 from the program to install Raptor crash cushions and other safety measures—a great example of the great things this program can do. This year, council is again asking for funding, with a focus on improving pedestrian safety in the area. These are all worthy projects, and it is obvious that the need in my electorate is great.We know this program can save lives. We know that the road toll continues to soar, and across Australia it is higher today than it was four years ago. Thats why I feel disheartened that the Morrison government continues to overpromise and underdeliver on the Black Spot Program: $123 million over the last five years has been underspent. Why? There is a huge need for this financial assistance in my community. No-one should have to face what the Currarong community is facing. No family should have to crowdfund so they can be with a loved one who has been critically injured on one of our roads. Lets hope that this year the government delivers what it promised. Our community cannot afford to wait.","Black Spot Program","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs PHILLIPS (Gilmore) ","(18:02):"
415,0,0,0,1,2,"Pasin, Tony, MP",240756,"Barker","LP","N/A",4886," I want to begin by congratulating the member for Wide Bay. Hes someone who comes to this place with, lets say, some real rubber left on the road when it comes to this motion. Hes a man who was involved with the police force, who was very often required to deliver tragic news to loved ones following road accidents. Hes someone who is really passionate about road safety, and not just this motion but his behaviour in the party room and in this place generally is proof positive of that. He and I are both chairs of our respective states black spot committees, a position I am very much honoured to hold, and its one which calls upon us once a year to sit with various stakeholders in a very constructive, collaborative meeting where we determine allocation of this funding.If I can go to the point the member for Gilmore made in error at the end of her contribution: Im sure she didnt intend to suggest our government wasnt allocating funding to the Black Spot Program. In fact, funding to this program is a billion dollars over 10 years, and this years annual funding goes from $60 million to $110 million, an increase of $50 million. She did point out that theres been an underspend. Theres an underspend because this funding is provided to state governments, who go about undertaking the works, and in some cases, sadly, this work is not being done on the ground. Theres no issue in terms of the allocation of these funds. The projects are funded, and I see it in the work I do in the black spot committee in South Australia. I have been incredibly disappointed with respect to one project, at Holder Top Road in Waikerie, which took not one but two years to break ground after we had approved the improvement of a dangerous intersection. Thats where this issue is. Quite frankly, to point this out is really just to go and find statistical politicking and point-scoring. Its not becoming, quite frankly, in this debate. Nobody in this place wants to put Australians in harms way in any endeavour. In fact, if it relates to road safety, I think we can all say across any aisle that it is a multiparty intention in this place to make road safety a very high priority. Of course, as a government, were doing that not just in relation to the Black Spot Program; theres $100 billion worth of infrastructure projects being rolled out.In preparation for this contribution, I asked for details of total federal government expenditure on the road network in my electorate since I had the privilege of being elected the member for Barker. I can tell the constituents of Barker that since I was elected in 2013 over $990 million has been expended on the road networks across my electorate. Almost $1 billion has come in to improve the road networks of Barker or is slated in the forward estimates to do so. I can point to $200 million for the Princes Highway and $70 million for the Renmark-to-Gawler section of the Sturt Highway. That is considerable funding in terms of the Black Spot Program. But, rather than spending this time highlighting each and every one of those projects, I can say, as someone who drives 100,000 kilometres in my electorate, that we need to do more. Governments need to do more. Local governments need to do more, state governments need to do more, and the federal government needs to continue to make a significant contribution.I conducted over 40 community meetings during the course of the last year or so, and in all those community meetings I asked constituents: If there were one thing you could do to your road network to make it safer, what would you do? On balance, we came to the resolution in each of those meetings that they wanted to see wider roads. Wider roads are safer roads, and Im talking in particular now of a country electorate like mine. So over time Id like to see us undertake a serious program of road widening across my electorate and, indeed, across all of our rural electorates. We know that it costs about $100,000 per kilometre to widen a road. Thats a small fraction of the cost of resurfacing a road, and it has a significant impact in terms of reducing likely road fatalities. I commend this motion to this place.","Black Spot Program","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PASIN (Barker) ","(18:07):"
416,0,0,0,1,2,"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",265980,"Mayo","CA","N/A",4887," Im a strong supporter of the federal Black Spot Program for regional roads. At more than 9,000 square kilometres, Mayo has a large road network and, sadly, a disproportionate number of South Australias fatalities and serious accidents. A program that successfully identifies where often limited amounts of federal funding can save many lives and prevent serious injuries is, without a doubt, an excellent use of funds. However, for my electorate of Mayo, analysis has found that most of the federal governments chosen funding commitments have not necessarily matched where we have the greatest number of crashes and casualties. Now I recognise that a good black spot program will also seek to identify where crashes are likely to occur and prevent them before they happen, but the mismatch between the data and the funding commitments is sometimes challenging. As the federal member, I would greatly appreciate more transparency around that.Although it is a little dated, the casualty crash data for Mayo for the five years between 2011 and 2015 identified three particularly bad intersections. The corner of Pfeiffer Road and the Woodside-Nairne Road, the corner of Nine Mile Road and Willyaroo Road between Strathalbyn and Willyaroo, and the corner of Main South Road and Norman Avenue in Normanville. The worst four stretches of road are the section of Mt Barker Road between Aldgate and Bridgewater, Birdwood Road between Gumeracha and Birdwood, Onkaparinga Road west of Mt Torrens, and Willunga Hill Road. Sadly, there are further dishonourable mentions. Ive spoken about the perils of the Victor Harbor Road extensively in this place, as well as those of Main South Road between Myponga and Yankalilla. Sadly, Long Valley Road has seen many tragic, and quite recent, accidents in my community. The state government continues to promise its going to act, with a review. Were yet to see the findings from that review, and I hope that their inaction will not cost any more lives.We need to make sure that our country roads are funded and fixed. Its not too often I agree with the member for Barker, but I certainly think a widening program would be particularly valuable, particularly because we have so many cyclists on our roads now. We have cyclists and trucks together, and the two combined are often a tragedy.I would like to mention the intersection between Old Princes Highway and the Woodside-Nairne Road, which, while less likely to cause death and serious injuries, is still a dangerous spot, because vehicles bank up over the railway line and there are morning commuters. Its an issue thats happening for years in Nairne and one that many of us avoid, but sometimes, if you live right near there, you cannot avoid that. In the last South Australian election, the state government promised to upgrade the intersection and, while survey work has been done, there are no plans on the table for the promised community consultation. I really urge the state government to work on that. I know the local member, the member for Kavel, has been particularly vocal on this matter, and thats whats important: state and local members talking about whats needed in our community.I will mention the on and off ramps that need to be extended on the South Eastern Freeway. Sadly, they too can be deadly, with slip lanes being particularly short with the uphill merges. I continue in this place to advocate very strongly for federal government funding for the Verdun interchange to be a properly upgraded bidirectional interchange as well as ensuring we can have a timely start to the Deputy Prime Ministers commitment to Mayo for an additional lane on the freeway between Crafers and Stirling.Lastly, I want to reassure my electorate that I will continue to push for ongoing supplementary road funding for South Australia. This remains a deeply critical source of funding for our states local roads. Centre Alliances advocacy has already returned $80 million in supplementary road funding to South Australia. This is for our regional roads, and approximately $9.2 million of that goes directly to Mayo. Anyone who lives rurally sadly knows people that we have lost in our community. In Mayo we have black markers and we have red markers, and all of those people are loved and deeply missed by their family. Theyre often young people. In our community we have huge gum trees that, while they look beautiful on our big roads, are, sadly, very unforgiving. I encourage, in particular, young people and P-platers to drive carefully on our rural roads. Your mum and dad will miss you too much. I commend this program. Im so grateful the federal government puts funding into our rural roads.","Black Spot Program","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) ","(18:12):"
417,0,0,0,1,2,"Wilson, Rick, MP",198084,"OConnor","LP","N/A",4888," As previous speakers have mentioned, we lose far too many people on our roads. In Western Australia, with the enormous distances that we travel, we see a disproportionate number of people lose their lives on country roads. The road toll in Western Australia reflects that around 50 per cent of the people who die on our roads die on country roads, and only 20 per cent of the population lives in regional areas. So as I say, a disproportionate number of people die on our country roads.Thats why Im very pleased that the Australian government has committed an extra $50 million per year to our road Black Spot Program. That will take the annual allocation from $60 million to $110 million. For WA, with that money distributed proportionally, that will see around $13½ million allocated to Western Australian roads. Under the funding formula, 50 per cent of that money has to be allocated to rural roads, so well see around $6 million to $7 million allocated to our rural road network.Last year we saw some good projects funded. The South Coast Highway between Albany and Denmark saw money allocated for a slip road at the turn-off to Young Siding, and I was also very pleased to tell my great mate, Nat Manton, the CEO of the Corrigin Shire, that there were two projects within the Corrigan Shire totalling together $650,000, which the shire will be able to upgrade. So weve been doing some good work, and Im pleased to say that the assistant minister, Scott Buchholz, has appointed me as the chair of the Western Australian committee for allocating this funding. I look forward to early in the year meeting with the agencies involved: Western Australia Main Roads, the RAC and other agencies that are on that body. Well be meeting in late January or early February to allocate this years funding.I have some numbers on the success of the program so far. Its estimated that over 10 years therell be 2,400 projects funded, around 280 lives saved and up to 14,400 crashes prevented. Its a very worthy project, Im sure you would agree, Acting Deputy Speaker Wallace. Its vitally important that the community is involved in nominating these black spots. So I would say to all of my constituents, where you see an issue, where you see an intersection or a section of road that you think is dangerous and may well lead to an accident in future, then, please, nominate that black spot and let the committee know.I want to talk about a couple of other road projects, which are very much related to road safety but not necessarily under the Black Spot Program. Under the urban infrastructure fund—the congestion busting fund, as its come to be known—theres $140 million from the Commonwealth government towards the Albany Ring Road project. In my home town of Albany we have a major intersection, a five-exit roundabout, which sees people in very small vehicles, particularly elderly drivers, interacting with three-trailer road trains. About a million tonnes of grain freight comes through that roundabout, and probably another half a million tonnes of woodchips, so there are a lot of very large trucks interacting with—A division having been called in the House of Representatives—Sitting suspended from 18:21 to 18:28","Black Spot Program","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RICK WILSON (OConnor) ","(18:17):"

Its through the outback, passes Uluru and goes through my electorate for nearly 1,000 kilometres, and particularly through the towns of Warburton and Warakurna on the way to the Northern Territory border.

These are the local black spots that are so important to our community members. The roundabout in question is in fact a local black spot. There have been over 16 accidents in the last five years, 11 of which required hospitalisations, seven of which where people were very seriously injured. For Labor members opposite to simply deride it as a local roundabout just goes to show how out of touch they are with the Australian people, who are looking to the government to make sure that these kinds of black spots and safety issues are fixed within their local areas.Its no surprise the Labor members opposite would deride something like fixing local congestion, because they dont believe in investing in roads. They dont want to do it. Theyve shown time and time again what theyre more interested is the social engineering of forcing behavioural change and getting people out of their cars, forcing people to leave their cars, whether its via congestion tax or simply failing to invest in the local infrastructure that enables people to use their roads in a non-congested way. Theyre trying to force people onto other forms of transport, or to get out of their car, whatever it is. The Labor Party is about removing choices for people, rather than investing in the local infrastructure that allows families to make the decisions that are best for them, to make the decisions that suit their families the best and allow them to enjoy a good and strong quality of life. That is why it is so important for the Morrison government that were investing in infrastructure, particularly in the Black Spot Program, not because its an end in itself—its no surprise that every politician loves cutting a ribbon; I wont deny that. But at the end of the day we invest in this infrastructure not because we can, not because it is there, but because were helping everyday families. Because every bit of infrastructure that we upgrade allows them to spend more time at home with their families, allows them to do more sport or things on the weekend, allows them to get home safer so that no family has to go through the experience of getting a call late at night from the police that something has happened to a significant loved one.The Black Spot Program is particularly important in this regard, because it targets those bits of infrastructure which have a demonstrated record of being unsafe. As part of the local and state government Road Safety Package, announced in the 2019-20 budget, the Australian government has committed an a additional $50 million per year for the Black Spot Program in 2019-20. I know from experience as a local councillor just how important this funding is for local councils, to be able to partner with the federal government, to achieve real outcomes on the ground.The government has, in fact, provided a billion dollars to the Black Spot Program between the 2013-14 financial year and the 2023 financial year, with an ongoing commitment of $110 million for each following year. As I said, its an important part of the National Road Safety Strategy. The strategys vision is to challenge the perception that serious injury or death is just an inevitable cost of road travel—it is not. We can and should do better. We should ensure we are doing everything to keep our roads as safe as they can possibly be and that theyre maintained to a high standard. Its important the community gets involved in nominating local intersections or bits of road that can be dangerous, where serious crashes have occurred, that can be part of this program. Ill be encouraging local Ryan residents to do exactly that.Debate adjourned.","Black Spot Program","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

423,0,0,0,1,2,"MemberContinuation",248353,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Ms McBRIDE: I move this motion because as a pharmacist, the only pharmacist in this place, I am dismayed by the Minister for Healths shameless politicisation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by spruiking the listing of new drugs and then claiming the credit. It occurred again this weekend with the long overdue listing of Symdeko, seven months after it was approved. As Niki Savva points out in Plots and Prayers: Previous health ministers would release the names of listed drugs en masse during the working week with little fanfare, receiving little or no publicity. Hunt knew how to get attention.It is my view that a PBS listing—that is, the subsidising of a medicine—should not be turned into a political stunt or self-promotion event. Listings are in the interest of public health and they matter. They should not be reduced to a photo opportunity for a political agenda. It is worth noting that the ministers public announcements dont deliver a single clinical outcome. These are delivered by the hardworking research scientists, by industry and by clinicians. Other health ministers havent engaged in this sort of fanfare.Early in my career, new medicines were routinely listed on the PBS at set intervals. One of my jobs was to make sure the floppy disk had been installed and the PBS updates had been applied in the community pharmacy where I worked. That was it. But if the minister must take credit for each new listing he must also take responsibility for the growing delays and failure to list medications which have been recommended by the independent experts, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. Labors record on the PBS, unlike that of those opposite, is rock solid. From its introduction by the Chifley government in 1948 in the face of strong opposition, including a High Court challenge, through to the first safety nets of the Hawke government in 1986, it is something that we on this side of the chamber can be proud of.When I gave notice of this motion in early September we were aware of some 20 medications that had not been listed, despite having been recommended by the PBAC. Since then the PBAC has made public its recommendations from the July meeting, which took the total number of drugs waiting to be listed by Minister Hunt to almost 60. These are drugs that have been recommended for listing by the independent experts, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, because they stack up on both clinical and cost grounds. Australians who are sick deserve to have a medication which has been approved by the PBAC listed as soon as possible. But this just isnt happening. At the same time the governments recent budget updates showed a $155 million underspend on the PBS.The ministers failure to act on PBAC recommendations to list medications in a timely manner or to list them at all is not the only barrier to Australians accessing affordable medicines. The governments own figures show that many Australians dont fill prescriptions because they just cant afford them. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 961,000 people a year delay or avoid taking prescribed medicines due to cost. The rate of people skipping prescriptions is twice as high in the most disadvantaged areas as it is in the least disadvantaged areas, meaning that the cost of medicines is contributing to health inequality in Australia today—and thats assuming that you can see a doctor to get a prescription.New Medicare figures confirm what Australians already know, that the out-of-pocket cost to see a doctor is higher than ever before. The governments own data shows that the average out-of-pocket cost to see a GP is $39.55, up $10.40 or 36 per cent since the Liberals were elected. The same is true for the cost of seeing a specialist. The average out-of-pocket cost to see a specialist is now $91.50, up a staggering $33.40 or 58 per cent since the Liberals were elected. These costs are pushing household budgets to breaking point. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare—the governments own experts—say that 1.3 million Australians a year delay or avoid Medicare services due to cost. Thats just not good enough. Its worth repeating: in a country that prides itself on universal access to health care, over a million people every year cant afford basic essential health care. The minister has repeatedly promised that if a medicine is recommended for listing by the experts, that if a medicine is recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, that he will list it. That is just not true, and its not good enough. The minister cant spruik drug listings and claim the credit for them. Its not okay.","Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[14]","N/A","N/A"

428,0,0,0,1,2,"Alexander, John, MP","M3M","Bennelong","LP","N/A",4893," Thank you to the member for Dobell for bringing forward this important debate. I have mentioned before about Bennelong being the capital of innovation. We have some of the most cutting edge companies in the world. Weve invented things that make your life better, from wi-fi to the Granny Smith apple. One of the biggest drivers of this innovation is the pharmaceutical companies. Most of them are based in Macquarie Park in Bennelong, so many that it is commonly referred to as Pill Hill. From these, over a dozen companies, come many of the drugs that are listed annually and are saving lives daily, thanks to the PBS. The PBAC considers and recommends medicines for listing on the PBS three times a year, and critically this government has a policy to list all positive recommendations on the PBS.From October 2013 to 1 September 2019, 2,185 new or amended items have been listed on the PBS. In 2012-13, the average was 321 days from PBAC recommendation to approval. But, last year, this was down to an average of 189 days. Obviously we can still get these numbers down further, but I think its important to recognise the efforts that have already been made in this area and governments efforts to make this better for companies and, more importantly, for their patients.Just this weekend Minister Hunt announced that patients can gain access to Symdeko and Orkambi immediately, with the manufacturer agreeing to the governments request to provide early access until the medicine is listed on the PBS on 1 December. This is expected to provide new or improved treatment options for over 1,400 patients. People might otherwise have to pay up to $250,000 a year for Symdeko or Orkambi. These two are amongst the 32 new and amended listings made by the government per month, approximately one per day. This is at an overall cost of around $10.6 billion.Amongst these dozens of listings are a number of local Pill Hill contributions. These include Apotex, which received a listing for flucloxacillin for treatment of serious staphylococcal infection and osteomyelitis. In 2018, more than 525,000 patients accessed a previously available brand of antibiotic for this condition and may now benefit from this new listing. And memorably, back on 1 June 2018, the government committed to $241.3 million for Spinraza, made by a local company Biogen. This is a life changing medicine that treats the devastating illness of spinal muscular atrophy. Without subsidy, patients would pay more than $367,000 per year.Additionally, since October 2013, the government has approved more than 100 new and amended listings for cancer on the PBS at an expected cost of more than $6.6 billion over the forward estimates. Local contributions to the cancer space include some really exciting innovations. MSDs Keytruda is an immunotherapy that could change the game for cancer treatment. It has already been listed for patients with local or advanced metastatic urothelial cancer, saving 430 patients over $91,000 per course of treatment, and many more will benefit as its listings grow. A newcomer to Bennelong, Merck, has had Bavencio listed, at a cost of over $81 million, for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and highly aggressive type of skin cancer. This will save 160 patients close to $150,000 a year. In 2019 under the PBS patients will pay a maximum of $40.30 per script, with concessional patients, including pensioners, paying just $6.50.The Australian government is continuing to meet its commitment to invest in new medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The government will list all medicines that are recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The industry has seen some tough legislative times in recent years, but thanks to an agreement signed by Medicines Australia and the dedication of our current excellent health minister, the future is looking bright for patients who need to access cutting-edge medicines.

429,0,0,0,1,2,"Murphy, Peta, MP",133646,"Dunkley","ALP","N/A",4894," I rise to support this important motion put forward by my colleague the member for Dobell about affordable access to medicines when Australians need them. I want to adopt what my colleague, the only pharmacist in this place, said—that access to affordable medicines and health care shouldnt be a political stunt. Its above politics because its about egalitarian access to health care, universal health care. Its really one of the great manifestations of one of the most fundamental of Australian values—fairness. Its something that we in this country are rightly proud of, and its something that we have to hold precious and hold dear and fight to protect. The promise of universal health care is the promise of an egalitarian society—a society where, no matter how much money you have in the bank, how much money you earn, or even if you dont earn any money at all, if you are sick, you know that youll have access to the best medical care, including the best medicines. When youre sick, the last thing you need to be worried about is how youre going to be able to afford to go to the doctor, to see the specialist or to buy the medicine, which in many cases is life-saving.Since 1948, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, proudly introduced by a Labor government, has been one of the most important elements of Australias universal healthcare system, along with that other great Labor reform, the Medicare system. We know that the aims of the PBS, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, are to ensure timely access to medicines that Australians need at a cost the individual and the community can afford, and also to make sure that medicines meet appropriate standards of quality, safety and efficacy. It is really important that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the work of PBAC, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, are not politicised, are not used as a weapon against the other side, and theyre allowed to go about doing their job; and when PBAC says, These medicines should be put on the PBS, then thats what happens. As the member for Dobell said, if the health minister wishes to claim credit for every drug that is put on the PBS, then he has to accept responsibility for the fact that there are 60 drugs which have been recommended by PBAC to put on the PBS which are not there—not only drugs that would improve the quality of life for many Australians who need it but drugs that in many cases would prolong and save Australians lives.There are also drugs that the Australian government needs to put on other schemes. One of them is flash continuous glucose monitoring. Despite the shadow minister for health tabling a petition of some 214,000 signatures requesting the Minister for Health to list the flash glucose monitor on the NDSS as soon as possible, it is not on the NDSS. That means that people like my constituent Jacqui cant afford to pay for it. Jacqui is very lucky that shes been put on a trial of FreeStyle Libre with Frankston Hospital. She came in to see me and told me how flash continuous glucose monitoring has changed her life as a diabetic. It has allowed her to undergo daily activities that most of us take for granted and to monitor her health and wellbeing. She came to see me and said: Peta, Im not just here for myself. In fact, Im predominantly not here for myself. Im here for all the other diabetics who are out there whose lives have been a constant battle just to have stability. I want them to have access to whatever they need so that they can be a contributing member of society and can feel that theyre a contributing member of society. I join those 214,000 Australians and the shadow minister for health and call on Minister Hunt to get flash glucose monitoring on the NDSS as soon as possible.We know that out-of-pocket costs for health care have gone up and up. We have Australians living with flat and stagnant wages, with rising household expenses and rising out-of-pocket costs for health care. We know that those who are the most disadvantaged, those who are struggling the hardest to get by, are the ones who are going without when it comes to health care. That is not good enough. That is undermining the promise of universal health care, and, like every other member of the Labor caucus in this federal parliament, I will stand up as often as I can to say we must fight for it and not let it be undermined.","Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MURPHY (Dunkley) ","(18:55):"
430,0,0,0,1,2,"Gillespie, David, MP",72184,"Lyne","Nats","N/A",4895," Im very proud to be talking to this motion on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Everyone in this room recognises that it is a wonderful system that was brought in by none other than Ben Chifley, as the member for Macarthur has pointed out. No-one disputes that; it is a great system. And, since 2013, it has gone ahead in leaps and bounds. Ill just outline some of the things that have been achieved, and then Ill correct the record on some of the distortions of fact that are appearing on the other side.First of all, we have listed 2,100—in fact, there are now 2,102—items on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme since we were given the responsibility of running government in 2013. Thats an exceptional golden period of new drugs. The latest ones that were listed on the weekend were for cystic fibrosis, the dual listing of Symdeko and Orkambi. I dont know of any other jurisdiction that subsidises the cost of these wonderful, life-changing drugs for people who are born with cystic fibrosis. Weve also lowered the age at which it becomes available, down to the age of two. Previously, you could only access one of these drugs once you were over the age of five.For lung cancer—one of the commonest and probably the most fatal of the solid organ cancers—weve got Keytruda, Tecentriq and Avastin. Now for those last two, its $189,000 for a course. For Keytruda, its $90,000 for a course. Weve added treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Sprycel; there are new drugs for ovarian cancer, for heart disease, for asthma, and the list goes on and on and on.Now, clause (2) of this motion refers to the government not listing 20 drugs. I have checked with the ministers office, and he has in turn checked with the department. The department is not a political animal; its a deliverer of the great health system that we have. There are no—Ill just get the exact words, so Im not misquoting. The department says, The PBS schedule will shortly be updated to reflect a number of additional medicines that will be listed on the PBS on 1 November. What they are referring to is the PBAC. It makes its recommendations; it does that three times a year. There is a delay between when it recommends it and—theres correspondence sent to the makers of these drugs. There was recently a nine-month delay for one drug before the overseas company agreed to the listing conditions; it took nine days from that letter being received to these last couple of drugs being listed. So its a pretty quick system.Its in the budget papers and its on the public record, but there can be delays. In 2011 the then Labor health minister, Nicola Roxon—I give her marks for being honest—said:Ultimately I think the important point is that we cant in every instance guarantee that a drug will be listed immediately because there are financial consequences for doing that …As a result, for some of the drugs that had been recommended, there was a willing seller, but there just wasnt money in the budget. That was for severe asthma; COPD, a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; endometriosis; IVF treatment; and some schizophrenia drugs.We have a very proud record of delivering for the people of Australia. You do have to manage your budget, because we have high-cost medication listings across the board. They do cost a lot of money, but those cystic fibrosis drugs will actually add, on average, 20 extra years of life to people who are born now and who start these wonderful drugs, which improve their lung function, at an early age. All the thick mucus damages their lungs and their pancreas and affects their bowel. All that will be limited. They will be better nourished. Their lungs will work. They will have a much better outcome.We should be celebrating the wonderful system that we have in this country. We have managed our budgetary pressures well. We are listing, at the moment, all the ones that have been recommended and the companies weve responded to have been listed, which is a pretty amazing outcome. What a turnaround since 2013.","Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr GILLESPIE (Lyne) ","(19:00):"
431,0,0,0,1,2,"Freelander, Mike, MP",265979,"Macarthur","ALP","N/A",4896," One thing I will not do tonight is politicise the argument about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The history is well known to everyone in this place. I think it is absolutely disgraceful that the present health minister is politicising what for 70 years has been a bipartisan scheme, and I will not do that. Ive been very pleased to speak on the motion moved by my good friend the member of Dobell. She is someone who has worked as a hospital pharmacist for many years. Id like to thank the member for bringing this important matter before the chamber and I associate myself with her words.Id also like to thank my friends from the other side of parliament, the member for Bennelong and the member for Lyne, for speaking on this motion, together with the other speakers. In the motion, the member of Dobell has hit the nail on the head. It has been the longstanding practice of successive governments to accept and act on the advice of independent experts—the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee—when listing medicines on the PBS. If we dont do that, we end up having an arms race of lobbyists who lobby for these respective medications. That is something that we must not do. It also leads us to an exploitative manipulation of our patients. As a doctor, one who has prescribed medications listed on the PBS for now over 40 years, I think that that is the last thing we should be doing. I think its a great shame that the current health minister has attempted to do this. What we need are evidence based ways of prescribing medications, and thats what the PBAC does with the PBS.In contrast to what the member for Lyne has said, we dont really know what the long-term benefits of some of these newer listings will be. It appears in the short term that medications such as Kalydeco and Symdeko for children with cystic fibrosis will extend their lives, but there is not enough accumulated evidence to really know that in the longer term. We rely on short-term evidence and the advice of experts to decide whether we should list these drugs. Cystic fibrosis is a dreadful, horrible disease, and any parent who has a child with cystic fibrosis knows what they have to go through. Certainly, at the present time, life expectancy is relatively short, although it is much better than when I started as a paediatric resident in the childrens hospital in 1979. We hope that these newer medications will improve lifestyles and life length in the long term, but we really dont know the exact ways and the exact end point. Thats why we rely on the advice of experts.Over recent years, we also have become accustomed to seeing this health minister grandstand and congratulate himself each and every time the government follows the independent advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, and I think thats a great shame. The PBS has enjoyed bipartisan support since it began in 1948. As has already been mentioned, it was started by the Chifley Labor government. As a doctor, I cannot underestimate the significance that the PBS has had on our society since its inception in assisting Australians to access affordable medicines. I want that to continue, and I want it to continue in a bipartisan way. Were now being faced with an absolute tsunami of new medications and new treatments. That will ramp up with the development of the new biologic and genetically targeted medications. I think that KEYTRUDA has already been listed as one, but there are many thousands that will need to be looked at and decisions made about their listing in the next few years. That number is increasing every day, even as I speak.We need to have a bipartisan, fair and equitable way of deciding which medications to list and which we dont. The health minister sometimes delays listing because of cost pressures. Recently, there was the example of a treatment which was a multipronged catheter for use in a condition called atrial fibrillation. I know—and the minister told me—that they would delay the listing because of the cost pressures. So to get up there and say that because their budget is going so well et cetera is why they list things is rubbish. We act on independent advice, we act on advice that is given to the minister and to the PBS, and thats how it should stay. We should stop exploiting patients.","Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr FREELANDER (Macarthur) ","(19:05):"
432,0,0,0,1,2,"Flint, Nicolle, MP",245550,"Boothby","LP","N/A",4897," I am pleased to speak on this motion today, because it gives me the opportunity to highlight some of the fantastic work our government is doing in this area.The Morrison Liberal government has a strong record of delivering more medicines through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and making those medicines more accessible and more affordable for Australians. We are listing all medicines that are recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee on the PBS as a matter of policy. Since 2013, our policy has resulted in approximately 2,200 new or amended medical listings on the PBS, valued at around $10.6 billion. This is an average of around 30 new or amended listings per month, or approximately one per day.Just yesterday, the health minister announced the addition of cystic fibrosis medicine SYMDEKO for patients over the age of 12 with specific gene mutations. The minister also announced that the listing for the medicine ORKAMBI would be expanded for children between the ages of two and five years old. This is expected to provide new or improved treatment options for over 1,400 people who might otherwise pay up to $250,000 a year. We are also helping 3,000 women with breast cancer by subsidising the medicine KISQALI, which, without subsidy, can cost more than $71,000 per year. We are also subsidising SPINRAZA for Australian children with spinal muscular atrophy, which would otherwise cost these families more than $367,000 a year. Clearly, that is completely out of reach for pretty much every single Australian. The cost of accessing these medicines without subsidy would just be completely prohibitive for these individuals and for these families.Make no mistake: these listings make a life-changing difference to these people who need the medicines, to their families and to their friends. Thats why our government is committed to continuing our strong record of making more medicines available to more people. In order to do this, we are lowering the PBS safety net threshold amounts for concessional and general patients and their families from 1 January 2020. This will benefit up to around 1.6 million concessional patients and 129,000 general patients, allowing them to reach the PBS safety net sooner and reducing their out-of-pocket costs. We can do all of this because of our governments strong economic management. When we have a strong economy we can afford to invest in essential services like hospitals, like Medicare and like the PBS.We dont have to look back too far, unfortunately, to understand the impact of poor economic management on delivering medicines to those who need them. Last time the Labor government, those opposite, were in government they reversed the policy of the coalition to list all medicines approved by the independent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, because they couldnt manage the economy. On 25 February 2011, Labor announced the unprecedented deferral of the listing of seven medicines under the PBS for conditions such as severe asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, endometriosis, IVF treatment and schizophrenia. In 2011, Labors then health minister, Nicola Roxon, said:Ultimately I think the important point is that we cant in every instance guarantee that a drug will be listed immediately because there are financial consequences for doing that …In other words, due to their own financial mismanagement Labor stopped listing medicines approved by the PBAC in an attempt to cut costs.This motion is yet another attempt by Labor to play politics with an issue of critical importance to so many Australians, but it does, however, give me an opportunity to remind those opposite of some facts about the process for the addition of medicines to the PBS for the benefit of so many Australians. By law, the government cannot list a medicine on the PBS unless it has been recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The PBAC meet three times per year to consider and recommend medicines for listing on the PBS. The time it takes for a medicine to be listed following a PBAC recommendation is usually determined by the approach of the sponsoring pharmaceutical company.I will finish by saying that the PBS needs a responsible government managing a strong economy, and that is exactly what the Liberal Morrison government is delivering.","Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms FLINT (Boothby—Government Whip) ","(19:10):"

438,0,0,0,1,2,"MemberContinuation",245550,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Ms FLINT: The National Broadband Network has well and truly arrived in my electorate of Boothby. Thanks to our government, more than 95,500 premises in my community are ready for service and almost 54,000 are already connected to the NBN. Nationally, the NBN is now available to more than 10.6 million homes and businesses, with over 5.8 million active connections providing fast and affordable internet across Australia.One of those connections belongs to Gary Paradise and his team at Concept Data, a fantastic local business in my electorate, in the suburb of Torrens Park. Concept Data are providing innovative IT solutions to clients and using the National Broadband Network to do so. I recently visited Concept Data with the Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts and representatives from the NBN Co to hear direct from Gary about how their connection to the NBN means they can deliver a better service for their customer base, which includes some of South Australias biggest brand names. Id like to take this opportunity to recognise the minister for his commitment to listening to the experiences of business owners like Gary and for the ministers hard work to resolve the NBN rollout challenges that we inherited from those opposite.The coalition government is connecting more users to the NBN every two weeks than Labor connected in six years of government. Ill just repeat that: were connecting more people to the NBN every two weeks than those opposite managed to connect in six years of government. Those opposite, the former Labor government, missed every rollout target they set themselves and they connected just 51,000 premises to the fixed-line network in six years. Labors fibre-to-the premises NBN policy would have cost $30 billion more and taken six to eight years longer to complete. This would have increased broadband bills by up to $500 per year. Labor paid $6 billion for the NBN to pass just two per cent of Australian premises. The rollout was so badly managed that contractors downed tools and stopped construction work in four states.In stark contrast, all Australians will be able to connect to the NBN by 2020 under the coalition government. In regional Australia, the NBN rollout is over 99 per cent complete or under construction, and in metro areas the rollout is more than 93 per cent complete or under construction. Were now rolling out a multitechnology mix just like the USA, UK, Germany, France and many other countries. This multitechnology mix will include fibre to the node, fibre to the curb, fibre to the premises, HFC, fixed wireless and satellite. Were rolling out better broadband across Australia in the fastest and most affordable way so Australians can get access to fast broadband sooner at a price they can afford. The coalitions changes to the NBN rollout have saved taxpayers around $30 billion, avoided a $43 increase in monthly internet bills and will connect all Australians six to eight years sooner. As you can see, our government is delivering on our commitment and delivering NBN for all Australians.Yet, unfortunately, we continue to see misinformation and false claims made in this place and in the media about the rollout of NBN. Id like to take this opportunity to clarify some of this information, as it directly relates to my community. In August, it was reported in the media that suburbs in my electorate, including Somerton Park, Glengowrie, Darlington, Warradale, Oaklands Park, Sturt, Seacombe Gardens, Glenelg, Glenelg North, Glenelg South and Marino, were in NBN limbo. Understandably, this was of great concern to me and residents in my local area, and, as a result, I immediately contacted the minister seeking clarification about the claims. Im pleased to inform the House today that Ive been advised by NBN Co that the majority of premises in my community, specifically in the suburbs I have just listed, are live and ready for service. If you break down the suburbs I have just noted, all but one are live. The majority of these connections were made in 2017-18, and the remaining module will be connected and ready for service by May 2020. NBN Co is working closely to resolve any connection difficulties experienced by individual households and businesses in these areas. I ask anyone needing further assistance to contact my office for help—you are most welcome to do so.","National Broadband Network","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[11]","N/A","N/A"

441,0,0,0,1,2,"Stanley, Anne, MP",265990,"Werriwa","ALP","N/A",4900," I thank the member for Boothby for moving this motion, as it gives me a chance to talk about the disaster that the NBN has been for many residents of Werriwa. Despite the spin, the NBN is a hotchpotch patchwork of a multitechnology mix that will rely on a very aged copper network well into the future. In fact, the copper wires in my suburb have been there for 58 years. This is not a network built for the future; it is a scattergun approach that has been put together by the Liberal government. When the NBN was planned by the Labor Party, it was a network that enabled fibre-to-the-premises connections for nearly all Australians. For those who have that connection, which was provided in the early rollout in my electorate, they have brilliant, high-speed connections. Unfortunately, too few have fibre to the premises. What they do have is slow, unreliable internet connections reliant on copper connection—if they have an NBN connection at all.The rollout is ongoing and delayed in Werriwa. Take the suburb of Long Point. Long Point is a suburb in the bushland along the Georges River, and it is heavily reliant on stable connections to the internet so it can be made aware of bushfires and so forth. Long Point is also just one example of many in my electorate and around the country of the failure of the rollout and the multitechnology mix. The people of Long Point have experienced frequent delays that have plagued the installation of the NBN over this small suburb of just three streets. Emails from NBN Co tell of the expected rollout to Long Point in the latter half of 2017. Yet, today in 2019, only a portion of the suburb is actually connected. Thats right: its two years later and most people in that suburb are still waiting for their NBN connection. The latest problem, Im told, is an infrastructure shortfall that is expected to be fixed by 2020. The NBN has provided the following explanation to me: This service area appears to be ready for the service, and most premises will receive NBN by fibre-to-the-node or HFC technology. There are a small number of premises within the fibre-to-the-node footprint that are unable to receive a connection. The email continues: In this instance, the distance of some of these premises from the NBN network means we cant connect properly, in the same way as we have connected others, because of the length of the copper. The signal degrades over distance, and it wouldnt be possible to achieve a service that meets the minimum requirements. At this stage, the expected service availability date is January 2020. So, three years after Long Point was originally scheduled for connection, some of the residents may get internet speeds of 25 megabits per second—hardly First World speeds for 15 kilometres away from Liverpool, and another example of why copper is not one of the best options.We have constituents who often have to go outside to find higher ground just to make phone calls. We have parents who are worried that a lack of internet access will mean their kids will fall behind in school, and there are university students who cant access multimedia and upload assignments.The NBN Cos own figures from February this year show that while the number of premises connected has increased by 38 per cent, speeds were still slow and certainly not up to standard. Australia is now ranked 62nd in the world in internet speeds, falling yet another three spots since 2018. The Ookla speedtest global index has Australia behind Kazakhstan and Cape Verde. It was the Liberal government that moved the majority of the network to fibre to the node, forcing the majority of users to rely on the aged copper network. It was then in 2016, under the same Liberal government, that fibre to the kerb was announced as another way to deliver the NBN, again relying on copper wiring.The internet is meant to connect people through technology, not unite communities and connect people through sheer frustration at the complete failure of government policy. Its sad that in 20 years time my constituents will still be relying on the copper network, a network that slows or becomes unusable just because it rains, a network that becomes nearly unusable just because its between 7.00 pm and 10.00 pm at night and the copper lines cant deal with the connection. Patchwork quilts wont serve a community, patchwork quilts wont deliver high-speed internet and patchwork quilts actually have a purpose and its not for the delivery of NBN. The government really does need to do better.","National Broadband Network","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[6]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STANLEY (Werriwa—Opposition Whip) ","(19:21):"
442,0,0,0,1,2,"Wilson, Tim, MP","IMW","Goldstein","LP","N/A",4901," I begin by thanking the member for Boothby for the opportunity to speak on this motion and moving it for discussion in the Federation Chamber, least because its important to have an honest conversation about the National Broadband Network. Deputy Speaker, I dont want to leave you under any illusion.I remember when Kevin Rudd first came up with the idea. When he thought the best thing that he could do was inject a giant monopoly into infrastructure investment, actively discouraging private investment and telecommunication companies to invest in a network to make sure that Australians had high-speed internet and to say, No, no, the government knows best. I remember that moment and thinking, This isnt going to go so well. And the reality is that is the legacy of the Labor Party and its National Broadband Network in the years it was in office.Over years, despite the number of written-down notes on the back of aeroplane napkins—written between abusing flight attendant staff—the reality is that in the six years of the previous Labor government just 51,000 users were connected to the NBN. To put that in perspective, its a third of the Goldstein electorate. What they thought, with the hubris and the arrogance that sat behind their agenda, was that by dissuading and discouraging private investment they would lead, and somehow be able to build, this perfect utopia. Its a monument to the failure of socialism in one project. They will always stand condemned because Australians have had worse internet, because of their legacy, ever since, and our job has been to fix their failure. I get angry about this, because when you get the chairman of Telstra coming out and saying, If you hadnt have gone down this mad path from the get go, Australians would have had better, cheaper, faster internet. They actively encouraged the digital divide because of their hubris and their arrogance. Some of us need to call it out.Since we have been in government we have, at every step, been fixing their mess. Under the Liberal-National coalition government over 60,000 premises are being connected to the NBN every two weeks. You compare that to 51,000 over the entire life of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government and you see the exposed sham of their agenda and why we need to stand up and be clear. But it doesnt change the fact that their active discouragement of private investment, their active dissuasion of getting Australians to invest in the future of internet technology in our country, still has lasting impacts. Every day I talk to constituents who have to deal with the consequences of Labors bad policy decisions.We now have more than 10 million homes and businesses connected to the National Broadband Network and we need to continue the rollout. Now we have to make sure that everybody has access to the sorts of technologies that we have. Thats why we congratulate the government on its legacy of fixing Labors failure and fixing the problems that they created which meant that they actively discouraged private investment into the sector. This government, at every point, has shown that prudence and responsibility can still be in vogue.The DEPUTY SPEAKER: The time allotted for this debate has expired.
