The Government has taken very firm action over a number of areas, not least over the Olympic Games. It has taken action over scientific and cultural exchanges- these have ceased; over fisheries arrangements- these have ceased; and over grain embargoes, which remain very effectively in place. I think that the answer to the Leader of the Oppositions question lies partly in what he has said and in what the Soviet leadership has said in Moscow. The Leader of the Opposition himself has said:","TRADE WITH SOVIET UNION: OLYMPIC GAMES","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[1]/answer/continue[2]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

But he has shown very plainly, by his changes of view in relation to it, that he is not prepared to work for that effective boycott of the Moscow Olympics. I believe that that is all the more unfortunate against the background that the Soviet Union itself has made it perfectly plain that it regards the holding of the Olympic Games in Moscow as a significant political event- a political event above and before a sporting event. The Soviet Union itself has said in a Communist Party document sent to Communist Party activists throughout the Soviet Union- on our information, to a million of them- that the awarding of the Olympic Games to Moscow represents a mark of the correctness, in its terms- approval, in our terms- of Soviet foreign policy. Against that background, how can we have a situation in which athletes from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Australia, New Zealand and many other countries go to Moscow and give the Russian people and the Russian Government that mark of approval to an act which basically we abhor?","TRADE WITH SOVIET UNION: OLYMPIC GAMES","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[1]/answer/continue[4]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

Travellers to and from Western Australia and the Northern Territory will have to meet a 1.7 per cent increase as against an 8 per cent average increase on all trunk routes throughout Australia. That will benefit the Sydney-Perth travellers, the Hobart-Perth travellers and so on. So progress has been made, but certainly we will be considering the concept of an alternative type of inquiry into the problem.","DOMESTIC AIR FARES","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[10]/answer/continue/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

In the meantime, the Foreign Minister trotted off to Association of South East Asian Nations countries, India and Pakistan. What clearer demonstration do the people of our region need about where this Governments priorities truly lie? It was perhaps understandable that a Menzies should not comprehend the changes in our place in the world in the 1950s and 1960s. It is unforgivable that a Fraser should, on the first hint of trouble, rush off to Washington and London, where his sycophancy and eagerness to be praised have nothing to do with the relationship of equality and friendship which Australian interests require.

We are quite able to sort out the fantasy from Soviet propaganda on other occasions. We can do it here. Is the Prime Minister frightened that our Olympians will become rabid communists, endorsing the occupation of Afghanistan? He talks about the propaganda surrounding the Nazi era Olympic Games in Berlin in 1 936. The world s abiding memory of the Berlin games is the performance of that great American athlete, Jesse Owens. Are we to understand that in participating and winning three gold medals Owens was somehow endorsing Hitlers re-occupation of the Rhineland or Nazi theories of racial supremacy? The suggestion that Australian athletes would be endorsing Soviet foreign policy by participating in Moscow is equally absurd, and an insult to their integrity and their intelligence.","N/A","AFGHANISTAN-INVASION BY SOVIET UNION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[2]/continue[6]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

He talks about two of his own assistants whom he would like to help, and in the process he mentions that the mother of one of his assistants died of starvation during the Pol Pot regime. All the members of another assistants family died of unknown causes during the Pol Pot regime. I mention this in detail because the other matters in the speech of the Prime Minister have been covered at length. We do not disagree with the indictment of the Soviet Union, but do not let us be so stupid and so blinkered as to think that we can divert public opinion in Australia on what is likely to happen to us. We look like being the last country in this region still to recognise Pol Pot. We are the last people still to attack the Vietnamese. I have been in Hanoi as well as in the ASEAN countries. We have the doubtful distinction of having an ambassador in Hanoi with nothing to do because we have withdrawn all aid from Vietnam- aid which, I might mention, was related to some cattle and to the fact that we might be going to educate some Vietnamese in Canberra. I cannot think of anything better for our interests, but if in the process the Government is going to adopt an attitude of isolating Vietnam from the ASEAN countries it is heading for trouble. It is driving Vietnam right into the arms of Russia. Would it make any difference then if the Vietnamese thought, because of their fear of China, that they should have a base in Cam Ranh Bay? What would that do for stability in the region? Our American friends have enough on their hands.","N/A","AFGHANISTAN-INVASION BY SOVIET UNION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[4]/continue[1]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

At that same conference the gentleman who was elected leader of the Young Labor Movement said: We have got to go left. They certainly achieved that; the conference could not even pass a motion condemning the Soviet Union for its actions in Afghanistan. The vote was split down the middle. But the Young Labor Movement conference was only too happy to pass unanimously a motion to the effect that it wanted no part of any form of compulsory military service in this land. Of course not! But we do not mind, says the Young Labor Conference, if the communists wish to invade Afghanistan or take on any other country which happens to share a border. It doesnt matter, says the honourable member for Blaxland, its so far away. If the honourable member bothered to study the trend of recent history he would rind that today distance is not a necessarily limiting criterion. The capacity of a state to maximise its force at a specific point to achieve an objective is a factor which the Soviet Union, almost since its inception in 1919, has demonstrated time after time.","N/A","AFGHANISTAN-INVASION BY SOVIET UNION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[5]/continue[1]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

It is our firm belief that the main aim of Soviet foreign policy has been to accumulate power and influence in the world while preserving the security of the Soviet state. In this context, unfortunately, two facts emerge. On the one hand, despite the Soviet Unions alleged policy of detente, it has built up a military machine which, at least at the conventional level, would have at the moment the most potent capacity of any in the world. There is still a possibility that the Soviet Union lags behind the United States in terms of atomic weapons. If so, the gap is being closed rapidly. This means that during the remaining years of the decade of the 1980s the Western world has absolutely no alternative but to face the reality of the need to re-arm where necessary to be able to demonstrate to the Soviet Union that it has not only the will but also the ability to withstand any threat that it may wish to pose to Australia or to countries of the Third World like Afghanistan.","N/A","AFGHANISTAN-INVASION BY SOVIET UNION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[5]/continue[2]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

After visiting the camps on the border I would like to pay tribute to the Australian doctors, nurses and officials there who are doing a great job for Australia working for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. I did not hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen) congratulate the Australians doing what they are doing there. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to Pol Pot and to the fact that Australia still recognises his Government. He said that we are being criticised for so doing. The reason Australia has not denied recognition to that government is that our Association of South East Asian Nations friends and neighbours say to us that to do so would be to recognise the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea. Our friends in South East Asia and ASEAN have asked us not to change yet because to do so soon would be unwise.","N/A","AFGHANISTAN-INVASION BY SOVIET UNION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[7]/continue[4]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

At that time I did not think it was necessary because we had a reserve force that could have done the job. What I do believe we need to do is to introduce, subject to our finance- we may have to go to 3.5 per cent to do it- national service for the reserve forces. This is an option that appears not to have been considered by any of the commentators whose views I have read in recent times. It would have to be introduced over a period so as to build up cadres for training and instruction. If we are to have the manpower that we might need in the future we have to move in ways in which other countries have done, such as Israel, Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. We have to ensure that if we need large numbers of men they are available for the worst case situations. In principle I can see no reason, balancing the freedom of the individual and his right to go about his ordinary business with the national interest, why it would not be sound and proper to have a national service scheme whereby young men immediately coming out of school would do six weeks training, two weeks before Christmas, with a weeks vacation and four weeks training in January. Thereafter, depending upon unit requirements, they would do one week-end per month, or one night a week, or whatever was required. In future years they would do two weeks camp per year and one week-end per month. This situation would probably have to be phased in. It would probably be necessary to do it over four years. I would hope that it could be done in three years. Unfortunately it would be necessary to ballot at the outset but as soon as possible it ought to be universal. I do not believe that the young people of this country would object if they understood that that service was for service within Australia and for the defence of Australia, as is the case under the legislation. For example, one would have 25 per cent or 33 per cent in the first year and one would have a carefully planned program to build up the cadres, the instructors and the training facilities. This would give a meaningful role to the present reserve forces and, of course, a very special role to the regular forces without taking away from their capacity to respond to immediate threats.","N/A","AFGHANISTAN-INVASION BY SOVIET UNION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[9]/continue/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

Recently, the director of recruiting for the armed forces said that one of the serious problems in maintaining a skilled Defence Force in Australia was the turnover of 8,000 persons per annum from the Defence Force. That was said within the last seven days. In 1978 in this House the Government withdrew the re-enlistment bonus, which had been made available during the period of the Labor Government in order to encourage members of the defence forces, who had been trained at extremely high cost to the Government and the taxpayer, to remain within the Defence Force. As the Minister said in this House, the bonus was withdrawn because there were no recruitment difficulties for the defence forces. Yet some 8,000 of the most skilled and highly trained servicemen are being lost every year. We find that there are not enough crews to man the Orion aircraft for the increased surveillance announced by the Prime Minister. We do not have sufficient crews to man the Oberon submarines when they are all in service.

Press people are no longer admitted to briefings in this country if they criticise the Prime Minister. They are excluded from planes travelling overseas. The biggest propaganda network that has ever been seen in Australia is manipulating the news for political purposes and that is against any form of civil liberties in this country. I want to say one other thing: The Wests record and our chances of maintaining the liberties and the freedom that we talk about so often and so glibly would be far better if we could name one case in the last 30 years where we have been prepared to support the majority of people in a country in their endeavours to govern themselves in the way in which they wish. Not one case can be named in 30 years where the West has supported a democratic, popularly elected government backed by the majority of its people. There are plenty that have been overthrown by the West.","N/A","AFGHANISTAN-INVASION BY SOVIET UNION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[10]/continue[25]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

The honourable member for Lalor has misunderstood the point. We say that this matter is an extremely important point. The Opposition has said continually this afternoon and this evening that it is of relatively little significance. It is a reasonable proposition to go through what the Opposition, as an alternative government, has said and to ask whether it has a consistent theme in what it has said in terms of policy. I will go through some of the remarks because they are fascinating. It took four days for the Opposition, through the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Wriedt), to respond. Previously the Opposition had been responding ahead of time on every issue. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate was not a crack marksman or a quick draw agent in responding because it took him four days to respond. A few days later, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) saidand this is a dreadful statement- that it was as immoral for the Russians to be in Afghanistan as it was for the Australians and the Americans to be in South Vietnam. I hope that he repeats that statement to lots of Australian soldiers who fought very honourably in South Vietnam. It is a dreadful statement. Unfortunately it is very like the excuse Evatt gave over Russia s invasion of Hungary in 1956 and not unlike the statements made by the then Leader of the Opposition concerning Russia in Czechoslovakia in 1 968- a half excuse for the Russian action; always going back to supposed faults of Western countries.","N/A","AFGHANISTAN-INVASION BY SOVIET UNION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[11]/continue[1]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

It is perfectly clear that the Games in Berlin gave him a propaganda weapon which was utilised successfully. It gave the country confidence to do what it should not have done. It gave the country confidence to wreak the havoc that it did. During those Games- again, it was a far more open country than is Russia today- it was clear that Jewish pogroms had been suspended for that period. People went there and said that everything was all right. Little was done during 1937, while a vestige of goodwill remained, yet ultimately these other events followed. We merely say to the Opposition and to this country: Know what has gone on before and do not ignore history in this respect.","N/A","AFGHANISTAN-INVASION BY SOVIET UNION","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[12]/speech[11]/continue[3]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

The invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union has been excellent from the point of view of the West. I know that what has happened in Afghanistan is extremely deplorable. I do not know whether the Russians have killed anybody there, or whether most of the people who have been killed happen to have been killed by the Afghan Government forces or by the rebels. As far as I am concerned the important thing is that what has happened has again exposed the Soviet Union as one of the greatest imperialist countries that has ever existed. It is important to remember this because people tend to forget. They woke up when this occurred in Hungary in 1956 and they woke up again when it occurred in Czechoslovakia in 1968. Then they forgot about it. They have been reminded again. The important point is that I think it has woken up many people in the West. It has significantly sharpened the attention of people here. Finally, I think it has woken up the so-called Islamic countries which have tended to support the Soviet Union for -","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/speech[1]/continue[1]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"

Peter Hastings put it very well. He said that the present Government, by making it a big issue, by not talking to the people concerned and by not doing a certain amount of behind the scenes organising has made it possible for the Soviet Union to achieve a propaganda victory. Surely we are all opposed to that.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/speech[1]/continue[2]/talk.start","N/A","N/A"
