They are already paying prices well above city prices and the proposed rise, with further increases in freight and margin mark-ups, would be savage.Your petitioners request that the Senate should: as a matter of urgency, relieve the impact of the fuel tax rise on rural South Australia by deleting it from all fuel sales further than 100 kilometres from Adelaides GPO.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/petition.grp/petition[1]/para[1]","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator FAULKNER","5K4","(New South Wales-","ALP","Minister for Veterans Affairs and Minister for Defence Science and Personnel)","668","—I table the explanatory memoranda relating to the bills, and move:That these bills be now read a second time.I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard .Leave granted.The speeches read as follows —INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL BILL 1994The purpose of this bill is to enable Australia to comply with binding international obligations which were imposed by the United Nations Security Council on 25 May 1993, when it adopted resolution 827. That resolution established the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, and adopted the Statute of the International Tribunal.The decision to establish the Tribunal as an enforcement measure under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter created, from 25 May 1993, an immediately binding obligation on UN Member States, including Australia, to take whatever action is necessary to implement the Security Councils decision and to meet the obligations imposed under the Statute of the International Tribunal. It is obviously desirable that Australia should be in a position to comply with requests for co-operation with the Tribunal as soon as they are received, and it is therefore important to have the legislation enacted as soon as possible.The Statute imposes obligations on Member States `to co-operate with the International Tribunal in the investigation and prosecution of accused persons and to comply `with any request for assistance or an order issued by a Trial Chamber. Such requests may involve, among other things, the identification and location of persons, the taking of testimony and the production of evidence, the service of documents, the arrest and detention of persons, and the surrender of accused persons to the Tribunal.The bill contains provisions enabling Australia to comply with these international obligations. It specifically provides for the handing over of accused persons to the Tribunal for trial; other forms of assistance to enable co-operation with the Tribunal in the investigation and prosecution of alleged offenders; the recovery and return of property and proceeds of crimes located within Australia; and the Tribunal to sit in Australia if it so desires. The aim was to keep the legislation as simple as possible, while still enabling us to meet our international obligations. The bill adopts a minimalist approach, providing only for the mandatory obligations imposed by the Statute.It was originally intended that the bill would also provide for imprisonment in Australia of persons convicted by the Tribunal. We have been consulting with the States and Territories on this issue, as any persons will need to be imprisoned in State and Territory prisons. The matter has not been included in this bill because not all States and Territories have responded on this issue, and imprisonment within Australia is not a mandatory obligation under the Statute. However, I recognise that it may be desirable to amend the legislation at an appropriate time, for example, when all the States and Territories have responded, and if the Tribunal commences proceedings against Australian citizens.I now mention some important features of the bill.Part 3 of the bill covers the surrender aspect of our obligations. The Statute requires countries to `comply without undue delay with any request for assistance or an order issued by a Trial Chamber, including . . . the surrender or the transfer of the accused to the International Tribunal.Although the Extradition Act 1988 was used as a general model for Part 3 of the bill, the bill departs from that Act in a number of ways because of the different circumstances and purposes of the legislation. In this case, Australia has binding international obligations to comply with requests for assistance by the Tribunal, and as a result the mechanism for handing over of persons to the Tribunal is more streamlined and has less grounds of refusal than under the Extradition Act. The reason for this different approach stems from the unique nature of our international obligations.One way in which this case differs from usual extradition situations is that the obligation to transfer accused persons to the Tribunal is derived not from a treaty-based obligation but from the duty of UN Member States to implement the decisions of the Security Council.In addition, persons would be surrendered to an international body, rather than to another country. In any event, persons surrendered to the Tribunal will have the benefit of internationally recognised procedural and legal safeguards.Furthermore, the bill provides for the Attorney-General to have a residual discretion to refuse the surrender of a person in exceptional circumstances. Although exercise of this discretion may cause some embarrassment internationally, it does provide discretionary protection for Australian residents that may not be available under the Tribunals safeguards.Parts 4 and 6 of the bill provide for other types of assistance to enable Australia to co-operate with the Tribunal in the investigation and prosecution of alleged offenders, as required by the Statute.Part 4 covers the taking of testimony and the production of evidence, the service of documents, search and seizure assistance, and assistance in relation to the giving of evidence at hearings, and assisting in investigations, in foreign countries.It also appears that the Tribunal may make forfeiture or confiscation orders under the Statute and then seek to have those orders enforced in Australia. However, it will not be totally clear until the Tribunal develops its own rules of evidence and procedure exactly what kinds of orders, if any, the Tribunal may make in relation to the proceeds of crime. It is only envisaged at this stage that the Tribunal is likely to make forfeiture orders and therefore the bill, in Part 6, includes provisions whereby such orders may be enforced in Australia. If the Tribunal determines at a later date that it will make restraining orders or pecuniary penalty orders which it might seek to have enforced in a particular country, or that it will issue information gathering orders, then it will be necessary at that time to amend the legislation.Parts 4 and 6 are based upon corresponding provisions in the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. However, one major difference is the grounds on which a request may be refused. While the Mutual Assistance Act contains a number of such grounds, the bill has only very limited grounds, namely that complying with the request would prejudice Australias sovereignty, security or national interest, or that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the non-compliance. This is a direct result of the binding international obligations in this situation. Apart from this matter, the procedures in Parts 4 and 6 of the bill are almost identical to those employed in similar situations under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act.Part 5 of the bill covers the possibility of the Tribunal sitting in Australia. Although this is considered to be a remote possibility, the provisions are necessary because the Security Council Resolution provides that while the Tribunal is to have its seat at the Hague, it may sit elsewhere when it considers it necessary for the efficient exercise of its functions.While sitting in Australia, the Tribunal would be exercising the judicial power of the international community, not the judicial power of the Commonwealth. However, Commonwealth legislation is required to authorise the Tribunal to exercise coercive powers within Australia (such as to compel attendance, and to require production of evidence). The Security Council resolution does not compel Australia to automatically authorise the exercise of such powers. As a matter of comity, countries would expect agreements to be reached about the exercise of power in their territory by a foreign tribunal.Part 5 of the bill therefore enables the Tribunal to sit in Australia for the purpose of performing its functions, and provides that the Tribunals powers while sitting in Australia will be such powers as are prescribed by regulations. Those regulations will implement agreements between the Commonwealth and the Tribunal about the powers that the Tribunal may exercise while sitting in Australia.The bill is expected to have little impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue in the short term. However, there are possible implications for Commonwealth agencies which may be affected by the legislation. For example, there may be resource implications for the Australian Federal Police, and cost and resource implications might arise if the Tribunal decides to sit in Australia.These costs cannot be quantified at all at this stage, as they will depend upon the extent to which the legislation is used in Australia. However, the legislation will be reviewed after it has been in place for a period of 12 months to determine the extent to which it has been utilised and to assess the resource implications.I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.I commend the bill to the Senate.INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994This bill is consequential upon the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill 1994. It makes consequential amendments to certain Commonwealth Acts.The amendment to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act is to the effect that decisions under the International War Crimes Tribunal Act 1994 will not be subject to review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. The reason for this amendment is that Australia has binding international obligations, imposed by the United Nations Security Council, to quickly and effectively comply with requests for assistance by the International Tribunal, as I explained in my second reading speech on the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill 1994.The purpose of the amendments to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act is to enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to appear in proceedings, and to grant indemnities to persons who are to give evidence for the purpose of proceedings, under the International War Crimes Tribunal Act.The amendments to the Migration Act simply facilitate the entry into Australia and subsequent departure of persons who are required in Australia for purposes connected with the International War Crimes Tribunal Act.The amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act enable forfeiture orders made by the International Tribunal and registered under the International War Crimes Tribunal Act to be enforced as if they were forfeiture orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Act at the time of registration. This is consistent with the approach by which foreign forfeiture orders registered in a court in Australia under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act are dealt with.The effect of the amendment to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act is to ensure that lawfully intercepted information can be used in proceedings under Division 1 of Part 4 of the International War Crimes Tribunal Act. Those proceedings cover the taking of evidence, or production of documents or other articles in Australia for the purposes of, and at the request of, the Tribunal.The bill is expected to have little impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue.I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.I commend the bill to the Senate.Debate (on motion by Senator Panizza ) adjourned.","N/A","INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL BILL 1994 INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[3]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator ALSTON","LD4","(Victoria-","LP","Deputy Leader of the Opposition)","670","—I move:That this bill be now read a second time.I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard .Leave granted.The speech read as follows —This bill proposes to amend the Telecommunications Act 1991 to ensure regional, rural and remote Australians have access to telecommunications of a standard available to the majority of the people of Australia.A simple enough aim, yet one ignored in the current legislation.If a telephone is considered an essential service in metropolitan communities it must be judged indispensable in rural and remote communities. However, gross inequities lie in the provision of telecommunication services between urban and rural centres.No formal mechanism exists to ensure telecommunications in rural areas keep pace with services accessible in metropolitan regions. In fact, there is a very real fear that service levels will deteriorate in rural Australia as a direct result of competition.The Federal Government must be made to honour its responsibility to provide equitable access to information services. Communications are the technological `highways to future development in rural and remote regions.Rural communities will face new threats to their viability if they cannot keep pace with businesses in the national and global economy. Rural Australian communities lacking digital switching equipment or that otherwise cannot reliably transmit facsimile, computer and other data, face a stunted future.This is the gloomy prospect facing many rural communities given the governments vague determination of the obligation under the Telecommunications Act 1991 to provide a standard telephone service to all people in Australia on an equitable basis.The Telecommunications Act 1991 (section 288) embodies the principle that all Australians are entitled to have reasonable access to a standard telephone service and to pay phones. This principle is know as the universal service obligation (USO). In its recent report on Mail, Courier and Parcel Services the Industry Commission defines a USO as an obligation which arises when a government requires a public enterprise to carry out activities which it would not elect to do on a commercial basis, or which it would only do commercially at higher prices.The Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation, or as it is better known, Telecom, as the universal service carrier, is responsible for discharging the USO. While the alternative telecommunications carrier, Optus, does not carry any formal USO of its own, it is required to reimburse Telecom for a portion of the USOs performed by AOTC.The obligation to provide a standard telephone service fails at the point of definition. In the Act (section 5), the standard telephone service is defined as a public switched telephone service, in other words, a basic service.However, the basic service provided in urban areas far exceeds the basic service provided in rural and remote areas. Furthermore, the USO makes no provision for enhancing telecommunication services to rural and remote areas when access to improved technology becomes generally available in metropolitan areas.The bush, once again, faces the prospect of lagging some 80 years behind in the telecommunications race, as was the case when the last manual exchange was phased out at Wanaaring, in western New South Wales, in 1991. While the basic telephone has reached 95% of all Australian households, service quality in urban areas surpasses that realised in rural areas.Analogue systems are still in operation throughout rural areas which, in effect, deny reliable transmission of facsimile, computer and other data. A significant number of Digital Radio Concentrator Systems, the predominant rural telecommunications medium, suffer a high incidence of capacity related technical reduction in quality of service including, lack of service, dropping-out and noisy lines.Such difficulties prohibit the reliable transmission of computer data. Furthermore, computer transmission speeds are now typically in the range of 2 400 to 9 600 bits per second with some computers communicating at even higher rates.The maximum data rate practically achievable on DRCS are 4 800 bits per second. As modems become faster and faster it is not inconceivable that inbuilt mechanisms will prohibit communication below a specified transmission rate. Given that there is no legislative requirement, or otherwise, for analogue or digital systems to be upgraded, the bush may lose the limited service access enjoyed today. This may occur, ironically, as a result of technological advancement.Further services unavailable to the bush, include caller line identification and itemised billing. Local call access to essential services and communities of interest is unavailable to many remote households. As these examples clearly illustrate the standard service in country areas does not equate to the standard service in urban regions. It can therefore be argued that in some areas service quality is such that Telecoms Universal Service Obligation is not being met. If such obligations are not being met now, there seems very little hope that rural telephone systems will accommodate information services of the future.Rural and remote Australia may have nothing to gain from competition within the telecommunications market, in fact these regions may have everything to lose. Obviously the pressure on both carriers is to spend capital where it will produce the most revenue—the heavily trafficked routes. Unless there is some enforceable mechanism to ensure that carrier money is also spent to maintain and upgrade the telecommunications network in rural and remote Australia, the ability of the network to deliver new and enhanced services will, over time, diminish.The enforcement mechanism necessary is a Universal Service Obligation relevant to todays information society. The standard telephone service, as defined in the Act, will become increasingly irrelevant in todays information and technological age.The definition must be updated to ensure rural and remote Australians have access to a standard of service comparable with the standard of service available to the majority of the people of Australia.This bill makes the necessary update.The amendment also provides that if a definition is to be set by regulation the standard or standards so determined must ensure that standards of service are comparable across Australia.The proposed amendment of section 38 of the Principal Act deals with AUSTELs general functions and would require that indicative performance standards recognise that services of similar standards should be available to all the people of Australia.The proposed amendments to section 246 dealing with technical standards would impose a new paragraph (b) to provide for similar standards for all people. The other provisions of section 246 would remain i.e. subsections (1) and (3), (4) and (5). The proposed new section 246 (A) would allow the Minister to give directions to AUSTEL about the performance of its functions in relation to section 246 (the determination of technical standards). This is consistent with the ability of the Minister to give directions to AUSTEL.The definition of a standard telephone service now in the Act can be changed by regulation. However, given that no such regulations have been prescribed the introduction of this Private Senators bill aims to trigger the necessary change.Given that it is argued that Telecoms obligation to provide a standard telephone service to all Australians is currently not being met there is justifiable concern that advancements in telecommunications will bypass the bush. Governments should not shirk from the responsibility of providing equitable and affordable access to information services.The vast nature of the Australian continent demands governments play a role in the provision of service equity. The Telecommunications (Performance Standards) Amendment Bill 1994 challenges the Government to maintain and improve regional and rural telecommunications.","N/A","TELECOMMUNICATIONS (PERFORMANCE STANDARDS) AMENDMENT BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator ALSTON","LD4","(Victoria-","LP","Deputy Leader of the Opposition)","670","—In addition to the incorporation of the second reading speech, I would like to say that we on our side of the chamber regard it as a very important matter that Telecom, as the universal common carrier, should be responsible for ensuring that the people outside the metropolitan areas are able to receive standards of telecommunications service equivalent to those in city areas. In order to do that, it is necessary that it be put in a position where there is, to put it bluntly, parliamentary pressure to ensure that that occurs.There are two distinct sets of problems. One relates to switching gear, and that is a matter Telecom certainly has under control. A condition of its licence is that all local exchanges be converted to digital by 1997. I think the latest Austel figures indicate that some 29 per cent of local exchanges have been digitalised. It is very important that Telecom adheres strictly to that timetable.If that occurs, then a number of intelligent network features such as caller line identification, voice mail and itemised billing will be available to those in rural and remote areas. That will ensure that they are able to properly calculate whether they have been overcharged or perhaps even undercharged. But certainly such people will have access to the facilities and features that are increasingly becoming available to people in metropolitan areas.Our concern is not so much in the area of switching but in transmission. The particular problem in that area is that, despite Telecom having spent $530 million through the late 1970s and early 1980s on the rural and remote areas program, people in those areas still experience a number of very significant problems, particularly congestion, call dropouts and general noise and interference. The figures indicate that about 80 per cent of people complain of those sorts of happenings on a reasonably regular basis. Certainly in remote areas the problem is that the digital remote concentrator systems need to be upgraded. There are some high speed concentrators being put in place but I think at a fairly slow rate—about four to date and about two a year over the next five years. But that is certainly not enough. As I understand it, Telecom is frantically conducting research to determine the most appropriate method of upgrading the technology, but there is certainly a long way to go.The purpose of this bill is to ensure that some form of timetable is identified by Telecom and adhered to. By having the act amended so as to require Telecom to maintain the roughly equivalent standard of service, we would hope that there will not be too great a time lag and that it will therefore recognise that the universal service obligation extends to all Australians.Debate (on motion by Senator Faulkner ) adjourned.","N/A","TELECOMMUNICATIONS (PERFORMANCE STANDARDS) AMENDMENT BILL 1994","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

Amendments Nos 5, 6 and 7 are very similar amendments. When we adjourned I was making the point that all these amendments relate to similar clauses, although the first one relates to the exploration licence and the others to other licences. Each of them relates to the conditions which may be attached—and that is the wording of the present bill—to the granting of those licences. A number of these conditions are of particular significance, especially those in relation to protection and insurance in the protection of the environment. We are saying that these kinds of conditions should be attached to every licence. Therefore, there should not be a discretion by the joint authority.In further explanation of that and picking up the point that the minister made in the second reading debate, I would point out that, while we are saying that a condition relating to each of these factors must be attached, that does not necessarily mean that the condition need be particularly arduous. But it would mean that in every case the joint authority in granting the licence would at least draw the attention of the licence holder to those particular conditions. For instance, on the one hand it may be a simple condition that the license holder must care for and not damage the environment. On the other hand, it may be a condition that sets out very specific requirements in protection of the environment.At least inclusion of the word `must means that the attention of the licence holder will be directed to each of those conditions when each of those licences is granted. Therefore, we would strongly defend the replacement of the word `may with the word `must. It is not a particularly arduous imposition on the joint authority. The first refers to the exploration licence. As I said, the other amendments refer to the other types of licences—the holding licences, the mining licences, the works licences and so on. They are all of a similar kind and therefore I urge them on the committee.","N/A","OFFSHORE MINERALS BILL 1993 OFFSHORE MINERALS (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1993 OFFSHORE MINERALS (RETENTION LICENCE FEES) BILL 1993 MINERALS (SUBMERGED LANDS) (ROYALTY) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

First, I note Senator Coulters concern about environmental matters. The exploration licence will always be referred for advice to the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, CEPA, and will be examined under the Environmental Protection Act. That will always occur.The other reason for opposing Senator Coulters four amendments is that the proposed subclause 118(3) deals with a number of provisions other than matters pertaining to the environment that Senator Coulter has referred to. For example, it refers to the exploration of a licence holder taking out insurance and to the licence holder lodging a security. They are just a couple of examples of a number of provisions that the joint authority may require of the licence holder.Senator Coulters proposal to substitute `may for `must means that a licence holder must follow all the provisions listed, not just the environmental provisions that Senator Coulter is concerned about. That would mean that a licence holder must take out insurance; no discretion is given. It is not necessarily desirable that a licence holder take out insurance in all circumstances.In relation to the other matter raised, it would also mean that a licence holder must lodge security. Again, that would depend on the circumstances. That is why we have the word `may there. The comments that I have made in relation to clause 118 apply to the other forms of licensing in the other three clauses that Senator Coulters amendments apply to. For those two reasons that I have outlined we oppose the amendment as proposed by the Australian Democrats.","N/A","OFFSHORE MINERALS BILL 1993 OFFSHORE MINERALS (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1993 OFFSHORE MINERALS (RETENTION LICENCE FEES) BILL 1993 MINERALS (SUBMERGED LANDS) (ROYALTY) AMENDMENT BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In other words, the document will contain those kinds of conditions, but the condition in relation to insurance might be that in this case the licence holder is not required to take out insurance. That might be the condition which is attached, but at least it would be attached. Attention must be drawn to that fact.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator MacGIBBON","YH4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A","675","—The Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 proposes a series of changes, primarily to the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986, with minor consequential amendments to a series of related acts. It introduces the issue of a seniors health card; restructures some child related payments; imposes a limitation on the Commonwealths liability, through an adjustment to disability pensions payable, to take account of any lump sum compensation paid for the same injury, disease or death; and introduces changes to the definition of retirement villages, ensuring that accommodation intended primarily for persons over 55 years of age will be taken as accommodation intended for people who are at least 55 years of age. There are provisions for deprivations concerning consideration for an assets test in relation to assets disposed of for up to five years in advance of the application for a pension. There are changes to managed investment rules, and changes with respect to the restitution of a pension where a person complies with a request for a tax file number within three months. There is provision to allow for oral, and not just written, withdrawal of an application to determine the qualifying period for a service pension claim. There are provisions to ensure that a carers pension may be withdrawn or suspended when not drawn on for six months; and a series of amendments concerning pensioner rate reduction, income test definitions, recovery of overpayments, and finally, a series of consequential, technical and minor amendments to four schedules.Broadly, this legislation fulfils the government commitment to introduce a seniors health card, which will give certain low income veterans not in receipt of a service pension and those who do not meet residency requirements for the age service pension access to concessional pharmaceutical benefits, hearing-aid concessions and an entitlement to dental and optometry services. It is estimated that this will benefit 10,000 veterans and their dependants.The amendments concerning child-related payments ensure service pensioners receive the same pension payment improvements that have been available for social security pensioners, who gained the benefit of the improvements when child-related payments were integrated into the family payment system. These improvements include the backdating of child-related payments from the date of birth, and a mechanism to allow them to be re-directed to the partner.There is an amendment dealing with the Commonwealth liability for disability pensions paid under part 2 of the act. This amendment seeks to provide consistency in the arrangements for offsetting compensation payments against a disability pension paid for the same incapacity or death for which compensation is paid under part 2 of the act. An offset arrangement for disability pensions paid under part 4 of the act in respect of defence or certain peacekeeping service has been in force since 1973. The offset arrangements mean that the Commonwealth requires compensation payments and damages recoverable at law from the Commonwealth or otherwise to be offset against any pension payable for the same injury, disease or death. This amendment aligns the offset provisions for disability pensions paid under part 2 in respect of war or operational service.The section on retirement villages is self-explanatory and removes the ambiguity as to the age at which a person can enter those facilities. The disposition of assets is similarly self-explanatory, taking it back to a period of five years before the application of a pension.The managed investment rules are to be changed to allow for: the offsetting of losses on realisation of an investment against profits realised on other managed investments; the offsetting of losses on an investment that is subject to an ongoing assessment against income distribution from other managed investments assessed on realisation only; and a formula for calculating the rate of return on an investment when there are multiple declarations for return rates or when only an interim rate of return has been declared. Investments in a friendly society which converts to a life company will not be affected by the change in status if certain criteria are met. There is clarification of a number of provisions relating to the treatment of an annuity for the purpose of an ordinary income test.I did not mention in my general introduction that contributions to the New South Wales Medically Acquired HIV Trust fund, which has been established to provide assistance to people in New South Wales who have medically acquired HIV, will not be considered as income under the income test. Contributions, therefore, will not affect the donor.The opposition supports the bill with the exception of those parts of it which relate to managed investments. Quite clearly, there are advantages and disadvantages to veterans coming from the changes proposed in this bill. As my colleague Mr Philip Ruddock said in speaking to the bill in the House of Representatives, there are winners and losers in those clauses. This part of the bill parallels changes which went through last year in social security legislation. Some of those changes were introduced into the Senate in the Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), which came before the Senate in the closing days of the session before Christmas. Again, the justification for those changes to be included in the Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) was that they were to parallel changes that had already been passed in the social security legislation.It is history that the decision of the Senate at that time was to reject those changes which affect retirement incomes until the government inquiry into retirement incomes has made its report. That is still the position of the Liberal and National parties today in relation to this bill. We will not support any further changes or amendments to legislation—either veterans affairs legislation or social security legislation—dealing with managed investments, asset testing or income testing until the complete review of the assets and income test agreed to by the government has been implemented.The operation of the changes to social security legislation which this bill sets out to replicate for veterans has been adverse to their interests. In plain English, some of them are worse off as a consequence. The current rise in stock market values will have some indirect impact on managed investments because all managed investments are pooled funds and some of their investments could well be in the form of shares. I do not propose to take up the time of the Senate this morning by running through the argument that we went through in considerable detail before Christmas; there is no point in doing that. I will only say that we will not support any changes to factors concerned with retirement income policy until we have seen what the government proposes to do in the light of its inquiry into this matter. We take that position because of the basic unfairness of making changes that are not part of a coherent whole, the effects of which will really disadvantage some people.The government may be concerned about that. I have no doubt that we will see from the Minister for Veterans Affairs (Senator Faulkner) a quite emotional outburst against what he would regard as the unfairness of what we are doing. But I put it to the minister that, if he is concerned about it, the solution lies in his own hands. The government has to accelerate the workings of that committee by giving it the resources and facilities it needs to get on with the job and carry out its task. As soon as that committee reports and the government has considered its response to that report, we will be prepared to consider what the government wants to do.I note in passing that the implementation of part 2, as clause 2(4) in the introductory part of the bill states, is not to commence until 1 July 1994. So the government has six months of this calendar year to get that committee up and running and reporting. If the government is genuinely concerned to effect legislative change in these areas, then it will see that the inquiry gets the resources that it needs, and it will get on with the job and expeditiously bring the findings of that committee before the Senate. With those few words I conclude my remarks.","N/A","VETERANS AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator BOURNE","TW4","(New South Wales)","AD","N/A","677","—As we have heard, the Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) proposes a number of changes to the Veterans Entitlements Act, with minor consequential amendments to related acts such as the Hearing Services Act 1991, the National Health Act 1953, the Social Security Act 1991 and the Defence Services Homes Act. The Australian Democrats welcome the introduction of the seniors health card as from July 1994 for certain low income, non-pensioner retirees.Long-term Democrat policy has called for eligibility for pensioner fringe benefits based on the amount of income received and not the source of that income. Self-funded retirees who have made sacrifices throughout their working lives to provide for their own retirement have in the past found themselves at a relative disadvantage compared with age pensioners. We have always argued that self-funded retirees on the same level of income as age pensioners should be entitled to all the benefits available to those pensioners.As stated by my colleague Senator Woodley last year during the debate on the social security legislation, the Democrats would like to see these people provided not only with health cards but also with the public transport concessions, reductions in telephone and electricity costs, as well as car registration fees and household rate concessions that age pensioners are able to claim. We ask the government once again to consider extending these benefits to independent retirees.We have consulted with the RSL on the rest of the contents of this bill and it has no major problems with any of the provisions apart from part 7 dealing with managed investments. The Democrats will not be moving any amendments to the bill but we will be opposing the managed investments provisions.When the Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 came before the Senate in December last year we refused to support the provision relating to allocated pensions and we asked the government not to proceed any further with changes to retirement incomes before we hear the findings of the inquiry into retirement incomes and means testing.We appreciate that the amendment referring to managed investments might not disadvantage all veterans, but we are not convinced that the formula is adequate to ensure that they will not be out of pocket in the end. In any case, we believe we should be consistent in our call for no more interference in retirement incomes until after the findings of that inquiry. There is no doubt that recent changes have caused a great deal of worry to veterans and elderly Australians and our constant tinkering with their incomes is causing a great deal of anxiety. We are making it very difficult for them to plan ahead.I again make the point that if we accept more changes to retirement incomes now, then we are assuming that the findings of the inquiry will have no impact on the governments intentions in this area, regardless of any recommendations made. If the inquiry is not a cynical exercise on the part of the government and it does intend to act on its findings, it is not unreasonable to expect that if we inflict this measure on veterans now we will be forced to consider changing it again further down the track. We simply cannot support changes which might not be necessary. We have to wait for this committee to report.The Democrats were pleased to hear from the Minister for Veterans Affairs (Senator Faulkner) that John Barber, formerly of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants, has been appointed as the independent consultant to this inquiry. We trust that the process will get under way very soon. The inquiry is due to make an initial draft report in July of this year, with the final report in September. It is, therefore, vital that the work of this committee begins as soon as possible.","N/A","VETERANS AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I am going to disappoint him because, as usual, I am not going to involve myself in any emotional outburst, but will objectively, rationally and reasonably argue the case against the miserable propositions that he put forward.This bill contains amendments that are part of the governments strategy announced in Building on strength: towards a fairer Australia and which seek to improve the position of low income retirees. This strategy is implemented by easing the pension assets test and by introducing a seniors health card. The government fulfilled the first part of this commitment by introducing legislation to ease the pensions assets test from 20 September 1993. Part 2 of this bill meets the second part of the commitment by introducing a seniors health card from 1 July 1994.The oppositions major concern—and this was reinforced in the contribution made by Senator Bourne—relates to the managed investment provisions of this bill. In particular, the opposition wants to delay any amendment to the income and assets test until the independent review of the income and assets test for service and social security pensions hands down its recommendations.It has to be placed on record that the income and assets amendments contained in this bill advantage service pensioners. For reasons that I really cannot understand, the opposition—and unfortunately the Australian Democrats are joining it—apparently is seeking to hold up these benefits for service pensioners.I mention also that failure to include the amendments could put the Veterans Entitlement Act out of kilter with the Social Security Act and maintain anomalies within the Veterans Entitlement Act. The government cannot responsibly delay these amendments for two years awaiting the outcome of a review to become law. The independent review will hand down its report in September this year. The governments response will be considered in the context of the 1995-96 budget and announced in that budget. As we all know, the drafting of any amending bill and the passage of such a bill takes time, particularly in this chamber.The government is keen not to make any major changes until the review has reported, but the effect of the opposition blocking these amendments will result in a piecemeal and inconsistent approach to pension assessment by creating differences and maintaining anomalies. I commend this bill to the Senate.Question resolved in the affirmative.Bill read a second time.Clauses 1 to 28—by leave—taken together, and agreed to.Clauses 29 to 39—by leave—taken together.","N/A","VETERANS AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator MacGIBBON","YH4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A","679","—Clauses 29 to 39 deal with managed investments—part of the area to be inquired into by the committee looking at income and asset testing. Issues relating to managed investments are only one aspect of this inquiry but they are of vital concern to both veterans and pensioners.I accepted in my speech in the second reading debate, as did Senator Bourne on behalf of the Australian Democrats, that there are winners and losers in the implementation of the clauses. We made the point that we do not accept any further piecemeal changes because there will be losers. We think that is basically unfair because we are looking at uncoordinated changes being proposed to retirement incomes. We believe that any changes should be after the review has been completed. For that reason, we will oppose clauses 29 to 39 for the purpose of postponing implementation until we see what the inquiry has had to say on the matter.I was surprised when the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner) said there would be a two-year delay in the implementation of retirement incomes. Even by the standards of this governments managerial incompetence, that is a pretty good stretching out of the legislative process. If there was a will to prosecute this matter sincerely and conscientiously, we could be looking at legislation in the middle of the year. If that happens there will be no detriment to anyones interests at all, because the opening part of this bill calls up a commencement date for one part of the bill of 1 July this year.Before Christmas we had before us the Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2); it was amended in the Senate and went down to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives did not even consider it, and to call its debate a kangaroo court would be too flattering a description. That place just turned that legislation around straight away and sent it back to us. When the Senate reaffirmed its original position, the government sulked and said that it would not proceed with the bill. It was quite open to the government, in the interests of legislative fairness, to accept the amended bill and then come back with further legislation. That would have overcome any disability to the pensioners and veterans.I seriously counsel the minister on this occasion to do the same with this bill.

There are three amendments contained in the proposal. The first clarifies the legislation by ensuring that all losses from managed investments can be offset against profits from other managed investments. The original legislation was not clear on this point in respect of some pre-1988 investments. This part of the bill will put the situation beyond doubt.The second amendment ensures that where an investment has been held for less than 12 months, and only an interim rate of return has been declared, that rate will be maintained as the annual rate of return. Applying the current provisions it is possible that the interim rate of return is extrapolated for 12 months. This can result in a higher rate of return being maintained in the service pension assessment than the actual rate of return over a 12-month period. This amendment will clarify the operation of this provision.The third amendment addresses industry changes occurring to friendly societies, and the effect that this has on certain investments. In the current economic climate a number of friendly societies have changed status. Under the act, a change in status of a friendly society would affect an investment made with that company. The investment would be considered as realised, and any profit that has accrued would be maintained in a persons service pension assessment for 12 months. Income is not assessed on friendly society investments made prior to 1 January 1988 until the investment is realised. If realised, the profit is assessed as income for the 12-month period following the realisation.This measure would safeguard these investments by providing that where the conditions of the investment remain substantially the same, the current investment rules will apply. Profits from the investment will not be assessed until they are realised by some other method.As all these measures are beneficial to service pensioners with these forms of investment, it is proposed that these measures commence from 1 April 1993. This date has been chosen as it is the date that a significant number of changes were originally made to this area of pension assessment.I think it was a very unreasonable point that Senator MacGibbon made during the debate about the timing of the review. The plan is to see the review recommendations announced in September this year. It is very difficult to see that it will occur before then. Then it will be addressed in next years budget. That is appropriate timing. It cannot be done more quickly than that. Any reasonable or objective observer would accept that that is a proper and appropriate time frame in these circumstances.I believe that the arguments put forward by the opposition—and unfortunately it has been joined by the Democrats on this occasion—are of very little substance. It is extraordinarily disappointing that those opposite cannot join with the government on this occasion and see these beneficial provisions to service pensioners go through this parliament.Question put:That clauses 29 to 39 be agreed to.Remainder of bill—by leave—taken as a whole, and agreed to.Bill reported with amendment; report adopted.","N/A","VETERANS AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[10]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator VANSTONE","7E4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A","681","—I do not want to take up the time of the Senate unnecessarily by repeating debate from the lower house on the Corporate Law Reform Bill 1993. The bill was debated in that chamber on 1 February and I particularly commend the speech of the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Daryl Williams QC, during the second reading debate to those people who are interested in the detailed provisions of this bill. However, I do want to make a number of general points and, in that sense, repeat some points made by Mr Williams and others in the debate. I also wish to take up one specific point raised by him, which was acknowledged by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) when he responded to the second reading debate in the other place, but he either glossed over it or simply missed the point—I am not sure which—so I will come back to that.I make the following initial points with respect to this bill. Everyone knows that this is, in effect, a replacement of an earlier attempt that was perhaps not so much a disaster but spectacularly unsuccessful. I do not mention that to be critical of the earlier attempt, but to praise the government for having made some attempt to listen to concerns raised by the business community and legal academics with respect to the consequences of proceeding with the bill in its original form. That point having been made, there are others to make of a general nature.I note that Mr Williams, in his speech in the other place, acknowledged the cost of new legislation. I see Senator Chris Evans and Senator McKiernan opposite. They are, relatively speaking, new members of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, but no doubt they will remain and be longstanding members of that committee and show a great interest in the committees main and most important reference, in my view, and that is the cost of justice. They will no doubt be familiar, as is Senator Spindler who is also on that committee, with the point that committee made in its second report.I take almost every opportunity to repeat this point because it needs to be repeated until everybody in this place understands it, that is, that new legislation is expensive. It is expensive not only in terms of the cost of drafting and the efforts put in by the Public Service to assist the government, and the efforts put in by parliamentarians, who are all paid by taxpayers, to try to do a decent job of this; but also, once the bill is implemented, the people who are affected by it need to re-learn that legislation and that needs to be taken into account as a cost of justice.When one goes to a lawyer, especially on a corporate matter where one might need accounting advice as well, the law has become so complex that the more we churn out of here the more expensive dealing with such matters is. It is all too easy, as Senators Evans, McKiernan and Spindler and I know, to make the inexpensive assumption that is easily grabbed by the media that the cost of justice is forced up because all lawyers are greedy so and sos who pay themselves far too much. I see Senator Cooney, the chairman of that committee, in here. It is important for us to understand the contribution we make to that cost by continuing to legislate and adding, just about every parliamentary day, to the burden of regulation that lawyers have to find their way through in order to be able to advise their clients. They have to charge to do that because the legal profession is not a charitable institution; it is not meant to be the Salvation Army.That committee has also made reference to the need for laws to be in plain English and to be simplified. We should try to simplify what we have got instead of adding to the mountain of it, and any new legislation put through should be in plain English. People should be able to open an act of parliament and see what the law is that they are supposed to be following, and lawyers should not have to spend so much time on the detail of one act and comparing it to another.Support for that type of reasoning is no doubt the reason why the government is engaging in a program of simplification of the Corporations Law. It is to be commended for that if, in fact, it is successful. This raises the question as to why, when the government has embarked upon that program and set up an advisory committee, it is nonetheless proceeding now with this legislation which deals primarily with continual disclosure and prospectuses.We understand and support the bill. It is important that investors have access to information which enables them to make proper judgments about where they should be putting their money. That does need fixing up. There is no denying that. But at the same time, we have a government that says, `We are going to overhaul the Corporations Law. We are going to simplify it yet while that simplification process is going on, it is adding to the Corporations Law. It seems as though we are fixing things on the run but adding to what needs to be fixed as we go along. One cannot help but notice that. Mr Williams made this point very early on in his speech in the other place.Once this bill is passed, regulations and administrative arrangements will have to be worked out. Just consider the range of people that need to be involved—lawyers, accountants, company directors, company secretaries and the courts. They are all going to be dealing with this legislation and the regulations and administrative arrangements that are worked out. Then, should these amendments need to be altered in some way as part of this overall simplification process, all of that learning exercise, all of the expense that has been incurred in terms of peoples time and money, simply gets tossed out. The government has yet to give an explanation as to why it is appropriate in these circumstances to move ahead as it is.Nonetheless, I come back to my original point that at least the government had the brains to consider the quite strenuous criticisms that were put forward as to the original format of this bill. A number of changes have been made, some of which have been advocated consistently by the coalition, and we are pleased about that. When the changes are implemented they will, without a shadow of a doubt, need monitoring—the government acknowledges that because the bill requires the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee to review the operation of continuous disclosure and the related enforcement provisions 18 months after their commencement.That only raises again the question: where will we be in 18-months time with the simplification process? Will there be a review in 18 months? Will some suggestions for change be made? Will we then, on the basis of that review, want to go ahead and make those changes without resolving the overriding process of simplification and still not knowing where this bill, in its then amended form, will fit in? This is a constant nightmare.It is worth labouring that point because day after day we hear on talkback programs and read in the papers about the high cost of justice and all the money that commercial lawyers make. Part of the reason they make that money is because we in this place make the law so complex and unwieldy. Mr Williams made the point in the other place—it bears repeating here as well—that complexity or simplification is a very relative thing. It would not matter if we did a 100 per cent first class job and we agreed on an all party basis—including the Democrats as a party, the Independents and the Greens—that we had got the corporations law to its most simple form, it would still be one of the most complex pieces of legislation that we produce in this place. Nonetheless, it would be expensive to administer and expensive to access in order to exercise ones rights. We look forward to seeing what comes out of the review.The detailed point that I want to raise—it was raised by Mr Williams and either glossed over or missed by Mr Lavarch in his response—relates to prospectuses. Towards the end of his speech during the second reading debate, Mr Williams made this point:The bill enables a document that purports to have been prepared by the ASC from the database by using a data processor to be admissible in a proceeding in a court as prima facie evidence of the matters stated in it. Certification of the document is not required. The amendment is intended to reduce substantially the circumstances in which routine and expensive formal certification of documents is required in court proceedings.He went on to say that he was somewhat concerned about the apparent breadth of that provision. It was not entirely clear to him from the wording of the provision how it could operate in practice. He then went on to give examples. He said:The provision would allow production of the document from the database to prove that the persons on the form were directors of the company at times stated in the document. That could be rebutted by evidence to the contrary. In a similar vein, the provision would be used to adduce evidence of the incorporation of a company, appointments of receiver or liquidator and registration of charges.He said that he had no problem with those sorts of things, that they are pretty formal matters, but that it is another matter when we turn to some other examples. He said an annual report contains, for example, the accounts of a company. Mr Williams went on to say:It is not objectionable that the provision should facilitate proof that the annual report was prepared, that it was lodged and that the accounts were signed off.Then Mr Williams raised the question: what about the truth of the contents of the accounts? He stated:Under the provision the annual report is admissible as `prima facie evidence of the matters stated in so much as the writing sets out what purports to be information obtained by the Commission. The effect seems to be that the provision is intended to prove the content of the annual accounts prima facie. That could be done by production of the ASC document without there being available to the party against whom the document is adduced the opportunity to cross-examine a witness who knows something about the accounts.He went on to say:In the report by the chairman or by the directors contained in most annual reports, contentious assertions of fact are not infrequently made. The effect of the provision appears to make the assertion prima facie proof of the truth of the assertion and not merely proof that the assertion was made. Again, that could be adduced into evidence without there being available to the party against whom the evidence is adduced the opportunity to cross-examine a witness who knows anything about the truth of the assertion.Mr Williams said that the manner in which the provisions operate in practice will need to be closely monitored to ensure there is not any particular injustice. In relation to that, the Attorney, I do not think in any condescending way, noted that the shadow Attorney made fair comment—it is very gracious of him to acknowledge that Mr Williams was making fair comment—in terms of the matters pertaining to the admissibility into court of information in the database. Mr Lavarch went on and kindly said that he thought Mr Williams put the case well. He also said:The point is that any evidence which is led in court on the basis of the provisions in this bill is the starting point of a submission to rebut. It is possible to lead evidence to overcome the prima facie nature of evidence which has previously been led. I think the honourable member argued that it would not be possible to bring forward a witness to rebut what was contained in an annual report or a chairmans statement. That is not my understanding of how it would work.Mr Williams has faxed a note to me and has this to say in response to Mr Lavarch:The Attorney-General has quite missed my point. I accept that it is open to the party against whom evidence is led . . . to rebut the effect of the prima facie effect of the evidence. But it must be understood that not infrequently the affairs of a company . . . may not be within the knowledge of the other party or any witnesses available to the other party. In those circumstances the other party would be dependent on cross-examination of a witness called by the party leading the evidence to rebut the prima facie effect of the material. Forcing the party asserting a fact to call a witness to prove the fact in order to expose the witness to cross-examination is a much-used and often essential tactic to enable the truth to be elicited and justice done.That is reasonably clear. I have tried to stick as best I can to what was said. It is a bit boring reading out word for word what someone said but I think each party has put its case fairly clearly. Mr Williams has raised an important concern to which there may be an answer—and the officials may be able to help us. The wording used by Mr Lavarch seems to miss the essential point that Mr Williams has made. We would be very pleased if the minister could deal with that point in his response to the second reading debate. If not, although there are no amendments, we could deal with it at the committee stage to see what we can do to clarify the situation and get some better response to the concern raised by Mr Williams, which is, I think, the most important one.","N/A","CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator SPINDLER","0X4","(Victoria)","AD","N/A","684","—Today the Senate is discussing the Corporate Law Reform Bill. The main purpose of the bill is to introduce a statutory-based system of continuous disclosure of information by those who issue invitations to the public to invest in securities, together with requirements that these entities submit half-yearly accounting reports. I make the comment that this is not before time.During the late 1980s, and with the financial disasters of that decade, we saw the markets lack of capacity to respond to the justified expectation of investors to be protected from the corporate cowboys who use a buoyant market to bolster their fortunes but who forget about the need to protect the interests of investors. In particular, they forget that capital will not flow through the marketplace unless the marketplace has confidence in the information available to it. So the central provisions of this bill are welcomed.In addition, the bill reforms prospectus provisions to take account of continuous disclosure; relaxes the present restrictions on companies indemnifying and insuring their officers and auditors; and facilitates the use of Securities Commission databases in court proceedings. It also provides for an improved flow of information between the Securities Commission and the Stock Exchange. Further, it seeks to enable accounting standards to be set in respect of the new disclosure requirements.The disasters of the 1980s clearly demonstrated that the level of disclosure from relevant bodies was seriously inadequate in relation to both listed and non-listed entities, such as building societies, life offices and building trusts. That was acknowledged by the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee in its report entitled Enhanced Statutory Disclosure systems and by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report The Rights of Shareholders.The governments response has been slow and inconsistent. First of all, we had the so-called Duffy bill which sought to improve disclosure via the Securities Commission. In 1992, Mr Duffy, the then Attorney-General, introduced the Corporate Law Reform Bill (No. 2) 1992, which ultimately lapsed. The central theme of that bill was to introduce an enhanced statutory disclosure system to be administered by the Securities Commission. The scheme was to be additional to the requirements of the Stock Exchange and was to apply also to non-listed entities.There were three criticisms of that bill: it duplicated reporting requirements—namely, those of the Securities Commission and the Stock Exchange; it created a discrepancy in reporting time frames—it specified both immediate disclosure and disclosure within three days; and it allowed the withholding of confidential or commercially sensitive information—a loophole one could drive a coach-and-four through.We now have the present Attorney-Generals approach—the Lavarch approach—which rests basically on the principle of self-regulation. I have some difficulties with that. Self-regulation does not seem to work all that well in the legal profession. I wonder why we are prepared to entrust the fortunes of our financial markets and investors—indeed, the whole issue of the probity and integrity of our capital market—to self-regulation. It seems to me that, in many ways, this is a bit like leaving the wolf in charge of the flock: stockbrokers will be monitoring stockbrokers.The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, in its report on corporate practices and the rights of shareholders, recommended that a regime of continuous disclosure by listing companies be enforced; that it be enforced through the Stock Exchange by revised listing rules; and that the Stock Exchange be given stronger statutory support under the Corporations Act.The legislation presently before us takes the line favoured by the committee and, as I said, is very heavily in favour of the principle of self-regulation—certainly at least as far as listed companies are concerned—by giving legislative sanction to listing rule 3A and leaving the Stock Exchange largely in charge of compliance. The bill will require disclosure information that is not generally available—that is commendable—and which a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of the security of the listed entity. In relation to non-listed entities, the bill provides for a statutory scheme of continuous disclosure to the Securities Commission.As I said before, this bill appears to leave the wolf in charge of the flock. I must say that there is little reason for confidence. The record of the Stock Exchange during the 1980s in ensuring compliance with the reporting requirements of its own rules was not good. The question must be asked: can the Stock Exchange do better this time?There are measures in this bill that strengthen the hand of the Stock Exchange and which may make it more active. I emphasise the word `may—it depends on whether it has the will to ensure compliance. Firstly, the Stock Exchange need not give an undertaking as to damages when seeking a court order in a breach of its rules; secondly, the Stock Exchange is given the protection of qualified privilege when it publishes material supplied under the disclosure scheme; and, thirdly, there is a provision for enhanced information flow between the Stock Exchange and the Securities Commission.Also welcomed is provision for shareholders to sue. Listed or unlisted entities who respectively fail to notify the Stock Exchange or the Securities Commission of relevant information can be sued by a person who suffers a loss as a result. Listed or unlisted entities who respectively fail to notify the Stock Exchange or the Securities Commission of relevant information can also be subject to criminal liability.However, it seems to the Australian Democrats that even more safeguards may be needed. One would be an earlier reporting date. The bill requires the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee to review the operation of the disclosure provisions after 18 months of operation, with a requirement that it report within a further six months. That gives us a two-year time scale before we have another hard look at whether this system works. Given the Stock Exchanges poor record during the 1980s, the enormous responsibilities vested in the Stock Exchange by this bill, and the present buoyancy of the market, that review should be taken much sooner. We request the government to consider having this done within 12 months.It is important that the committee review quickly whether self-regulation is ensuring compliance with the disclosure provisions. There are some areas where the bill leaves massive discretions to the Stock Exchange board which, in our view, should have been addressed in the legislation. The absence of carving-out provisions is the most obvious example. The bill allows for the formulation of carve-out provisions by the Stock Exchange through its listing rules. Apparently, the Stock Exchange has said that it intends to consider express confidentiality provisions for the listing rules, but there is no legislative time frame for that to be done. This prospect raises the spectre of the bill being weakened considerably in its provisions. One cannot be entirely confident that the Stock Exchange will not provide gaps for people who want to evade the disclosure provisions.One of the ways to make the Stock Exchange system of self-regulation more responsive and more accountable would be to look at the membership of the Australian Stock Exchange board. The board has 15 members, all drawn from the stockbroking or the business community. Given that these disclosure provisions are intended to protect investors—whether they are large institutional investors combining the funds of many private investors, or individual people who entrust their savings to our capital markets—it would seem to be an obvious move for the Stock Exchange to widen the representation of its board. The Australian Democrats will be pressing that this be done. We believe that there should be representation from the Australian Shareholders Association, from funds managers and from consumer organisations.We trust that this request is taken seriously. I would have preferred to have seen it in the bill but, seeing that this was not taken up and seeing that we have a prospective time frame of two years, the government should seriously consider urgently requesting the Australian Stock Exchange board to widen its representation in the way in which I have outlined.We also have the process to simplify the Corporations Law. Senator Vanstone welcomed it, and so do I. It would be highly desirable to have laws which enable ordinary investors—the mums and dads of our investment community—to look up the rules under which they entrust their moneys to the capital markets, and to take whatever action is necessary to preserve their interests. We certainly are not there now.While it could be argued that it is somewhat incongruous that this bill is brought in before the process of review and simplification of the Corporations Law as a whole is undertaken, time is of the essence. We need to move to provide as much protection as we can. Although the Australian Democrats have certain concerns about the way in which it is being done in this bill, it is important to move as quickly as possible and we will support this legislation.","N/A","CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator GIBSON","BX5","(Tasmania)","LP","N/A","686","—I rise to speak on the Corporate Law Reform Bill 1993. As my colleague Senator Vanstone has already said, the coalition supports this bill. I wish to make some general comments about the future of corporate governance. I rise because essentially my background is as a director of many companies; public listed companies, public unlisted companies, private companies, government business enterprises and companies limited by guarantee.In my experience, corporate governance is a very important matter for the future of the economy of Australia. The theme of my remarks to the Senate today is to urge the government to hurry up with the process of simplification of corporate law. The limited liability public company has been an enormous success in the world; firstly in separating owners and managers and secondly, in more recent times, in separating specialist investors who provide the capital from the specialist managers who know how to use it.Throughout to world shareholders are re-examining their relationships with company managers—which is corporate governance. We have seen many big companies get into trouble around the world, and we have also seen trouble with managers. The Maxwell affair was world famous. We also saw IBM get into trouble. The system needs checks and balances. Managers need the freedom to get on with the job. We need a system where we can change managers when they fail to do the job properly. But we also need to encourage investors by having a liquid market.My major point is that we must keep reminding ourselves that the capital and financial markets are now completely international; thus we cannot simply be talking of an Australian-only market for capital and finance. The larger Australian companies are now international companies. Unfortunately, the government has been doing its best in recent times to make them even more so by tending to drive them offshore with their investments. Instances late last year were the Industrial Relations Act and the Native Title Act. These acts will give further incentive to major companies to invest not in Australia, but offshore.Getting back to international competitiveness: corporate governance within Australia must be internationally competitive. We cannot isolate ourselves from the rest of the world. In recent years Canada, the United States of America and, in particular, New Zealand—countries with which we compete for investment funds—have modified their corporate governance legislation and they have much simpler systems than ours. Those systems are essentially based on principles, and not on detailed black letter law.I urge the government to review the situation in Australia and try to head in that direction. We have a very complex Corporations Law. Over the last three years the government has added something like 1,500 pages of law to corporations legislation. It is getting as bad as the tax act.The coalition welcomes the announcement by the Attorney-General last September that the government is about to embark on an ambitious program of simplification of the Corporations Law. I hope we end up getting a law based on principles—so-called fuzzy law—and not detailed black letter law. The courts can interpret the details in particular instances. We urge the government to get on with that process. The business community in general welcomes these amendments. The coalition welcomes the amendments, and we support the bill.(Quorum formed)","N/A","CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It was introduced as the latest in a series of reform bills. Being duty minister in the Senate is sometimes a bit of a lottery; one is never quite sure when one walks in here what weighty matters of state will be thrust upon ones shoulders. When I came into the chamber I did not expect I would be leading for the government in a debate on a bill of this importance. I am delighted to have the privilege; nonetheless, it was a surprise.Against that background, I have listened carefully to the debating points raised by honourable senators. There is broad unanimity that this bill is supported, and I thank both the opposition and the Australian Democrats for those indications of support. I also acknowledge, however, that in forging that consensus different reasons have been advanced by the other parties as to why they do so, and different emphases have been placed on the importance of company law reform as it is seen by them. I will not give an analysis of each argument and, therefore, reply with a similar weighting of the governments reasons, firstly, because they were adequately set out in the second reading speech and, secondly, because it would be an interesting technical discussion but one which would unnecessarily delay the Senate proceedings.I acknowledge what has been said by the coalition and the Australian Democrats. As usual, the Democrats have brought their distinctive views to this debate, with their particular insistent emphasis, not so much on self-regulation, but on more regulation. Suffice it to say, we all recognise that, out of the major company rorts that went on in the 1980s, a wide consensus in this community has emerged for company law reform. There have been a number of bills enacted, this one being the latest. The bill seeks to do a number of important things, one being the enhancement of the disclosure provisions to the stock exchange. It also seeks to reform the prospectuses put forward, and there are a series of other reforms. The financial impact of this bill is not that significant.The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), in putting this bill forward, has committed himself to an ongoing process of further consultations and continuing reform, and sees himself acting in consort with the heads of agreement between the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation.

However, one approaches an argument between two highly qualified and well advised legal practitioners, representing different points of the parliamentary spectrum in a debate in the other house, carefully, and with respect. This is a technical argument, and not one upon which one seeks to score political points. It is an argument over how best the law can operate. Having said that, I, too, approach this argument with care and respect.The debate in the House of Representatives can be said to have not concluded—to put the fairest view forward—because Senator Vanstone has been able to read into the Hansard record a further contribution to it by the shadow Attorney-General. The Attorney-General is in a position of not having been able to respond to that further point. Given the nature and tone of this debate it, therefore, requires me to make some observations on behalf of the government.The commitments I give are that we will, as a government, examine this point further. Although I have not consulted with the Attorney-General, I am sure he is open to further discussion with the shadow Attorney-General on this point. We will, therefore, give it due examination and pay it the respectful weight that the tone and nature of this debate require. That is not to say we will make a commitment necessarily to accept the point, and therefore change the legislation, but it is the appropriate response of the government to deal with what has been put forward. If we agree with the point—and I do not rule out that possibility—we will put forward in the next upcoming portfolio bill from the Attorney-General an amendment to take care of it.In those circumstances, I trust that that explanation and commitment satisfy honourable senators opposite that we as a government are properly and responsibly dealing with the issue. Therefore, I commend the legislation to the chamber.","N/A","CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[4]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

I also understand the ministers point that this is a legal matter. That is right; it is a legal matter, as indeed all bills are in that sense. I do not think the minister meant to infer that so long as we have the policy right, the lawyers can argue about the technicalities. It becomes costly when we pass legislation and lawyers have to argue about the legal technicalities that we do not get right. Therefore, it would be preferable to resolve this matter today.I will have what discussions I can to see whether we can resolve this matter today. In fact, I think we are in agreement. Having spoken to the officials and having read what has been said in general in the other place, I think that in schedule 4 the government is simply trying to say—the minister can correct me if I am wrong—that it is proof that this is the material that was given to the commission. That is all the government wants to say. It does not want to say it is prima facie evidence of the truth of the words contained therein. We agree with that position. All we are saying is that we have a deep suspicion that the wording the government has used takes it to be not only prima facie evidence of the fact that those words were given to the commission but as to the truth of those words as well.Question resolved in the affirmative.Bill read a second time.The bill.","N/A","CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1[1]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

With respect, I dissent from that view and suggest to him that our position is that we want more effective regulation, and possibly regulation by different people. It is not a matter of our wanting more or less regulation. I do not think that is what the debate is about.In that context, I would appreciate a comment from the minister on our request that the Australian Stock Exchange board be changed to represent the interests of consumers, shareholders and fund managers. I know that is not necessarily something that the government can order to take place but, if there is government support in principle for that, I think we can expect the stock exchanges to react with greater alacrity to the suggestion.The other point on which I would appreciate the ministers response relates to the suggestion that we should shorten the time span which elapses before the committee carries out a review of how this continuous disclosures system that this bill will bring into effect is actually functioning. This bill does make considerable changes to the current system and places responsibility on the Stock Exchange board. I believe that, in the interests of the financial community, the board must be held accountable. I do not think we should let the review go for 18 months, with a reporting date of another six months. I request the government to have that review undertaken within 12 months.

First of all, Senator Spindler has upbraided me about improperly characterising the Democrats position on regulation. I accept the correction and his way of styling it that the Democrats are not in favour of more regulation—I thank him for that undertaking—but that the regulation should be different and more effective. It is certainly different, but it is a matter of judgment as to whether it is more effective. Senator Spindler makes the judgment that his proposal is more effective. I regret to inform him that the government does not agree, and on that point we differ.Senator Spindler then asked me to comment on whether the Stock Exchange board should, to use his words, be more representative and include representatives from a range of different groups. Having thought about how I might couch this in more diplomatic language and having found that there is no way of saying `We dont agree diplomatically, I honestly have to tell Senator Spindler that we do not agree.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator ELLISON","9X5","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A","691","—If I might make an observation, I think that where any intended legislation talks of a presumption it should be approached with care. We are here talking about a presumption that these documents will be prima facie proof of the contents thereof. I understand that it was stated earlier that one could always lead evidence to rebut the content of the documents. The point, however, is this that, certainly in criminal proceedings, there is no onus at all on the accused. The golden thread of our judicial system is that the accused does not have to prove anything; that the accused is innocent until proven guilty.This casts an onus on the accused person to rebut any documentation. That may be all very well, but what happens if the contents of the document are not widely known? What is the position if the contents of a document—for example, the affairs of a company—only fall within the competent knowledge of a few witnesses who are not available to the accused? The proposed section is saying that when this document is produced it will be prima facie evidence of what is in the document. The person on the receiving end would not know enough about the company or its affairs to rebut the contents of the document and that puts that person at a disadvantage.I ask the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Senator Cook) to address that point in any future answer. Could the minister give me some idea as to whether that is how he sees the clause working, whether any problems arise from that, and whether the principle of a presumption in criminal proceedings is a desirable one? I might have to wait for that to be answered along with the other two questions I raised.","N/A","CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[7]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator COOK","RF4","(Western Australia-","ALP","Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development)","691","—The consultations that I earlier referred to are continuing outside the Senate chamber. I have no idea how much longer they will take or whether they will conclude satisfactorily to enable me to answer the senators question. To go to the last matter raised by Senator Ellison, it seems to me that this legislation is addressing the question of how one satisfactorily proves in proceedings the existence of company records germane to those proceedings. This legislation proposes that if one obtains a print-out on a particular company from the database of the Australian Securities Commission, that print-out is accepted as evidence.Senator Ellison seems to be asking whether that should be accepted as evidence and whether it is legitimately able to be accepted as evidence. He also raised the question of presumption. On my understanding of the procedure, companies are required to lodge their records with the Securities Commission. If one wanted to prove the existence of a particular document in a legal proceeding, one could, if one wished, go to the company, obtain the document and have it certified and proved as the company document. That is one way of doing it. I do not imagine that this legislation prevents people from doing that if they so wish.We should remember that the behaviour of takeover merchants and the abuse of company law has given rise to public concern and has led to better scrutiny of company law proceedings. That is what has brought us to this point. It seems to argue for a removal of technicality if it in no way endangers the rights of any of the parties to litigation. Removal of the technicality here means that, rather than going to the company source, people can actually go to the Securities Commission where companies lodge their records, obtain a print-out of the particular companys records and have that recognised as evidence or as the official documentation. From the governments point of view, that seems to be a satisfactory arrangement and a reasonable basis for having documents recognised as the documents in the proceedings.When the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) was questioned on this point in the House, he said, in effect, `It does not preclude the leading of evidence about those documents; that is open to the parties in a proceeding if they choose. That seems to be the belt that goes with the braces—ensuring that the document before a court is the official document in question.We could argue this back and forth but, with respect, this is a point that the government has undertaken to examine further. If it is satisfied about the veracity of the point, it will propose an amendment in further legislation. We have taken on board the learned intervention of the shadow Attorney-General and honourable senators. We are not dismissing it or rejecting it. We will properly and appropriately consider it. If there are further entreaties or arguments to be put directly to the Attorney-General outside the chamber, they can also be entered into. We will then amend this legislation further in a portfolio bill to be brought forward later this year.Senator Vanstone has re-entered the chamber. Under special leave at the end of the second reading debate she asked, in effect, why we do not fix it up now rather than waiting until later in the year. I commend Senator Vanstone for seeking efficient consideration of these things. It is a matter on which I will need to take advice from the Attorney-General, and I am not aware of his availability. I notice that the shadow Attorney-General is here. This is not a new point; the omission has not suddenly appeared with startling clarity. Rather, it is an old point on which there has been a lot of tired argument and consideration. It may be that it is not possible to fix it up on the run.Certainly the government, in making company law, would not want to be in any position where it is accused of changing its legislation in such a manner. It would rather be guilty of more sombre and considered weighing of the particular circumstances and making change, if in somewhat a lumbering way, nonetheless, in a fair and just way. I am not aware of whether it is possible to fix it up. There is no sign of the consultees returning to the chamber, which leaves me with the question that Senator Ellison first put to me. I understand that question has a technical answer, but consultations may inform me better about that technical answer. I will be interested to see whether there are any further interventions by honourable senators. If not, I will do my best to answer Senator Ellisons earlier question.","N/A","CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator ELLISON","9X5","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A","692","—Flowing from my earlier point—and it might assist the advice the minister is getting—I will give an example of how this provision would work. I was involved in a case where company minutes and documents were used in a prosecution. They were relevant to the prosecution case. It was the argument of the accused that these documents contained incorrect information and that another person had deliberately done this in an effort to blacken him and frame him—to set him up, if you like. There was a good deal of argument about these records and documents.He was lucky to the extent that he had an intimate knowledge of the workings of the company and was able to give evidence as to the detail contained therein, but if this provision is passed it would mean that those documents would have been accepted as prima facie evidence; that is, on the face of it, that the contents are true and correct. It would then be up to the accused person to rebut it, bearing in mind that an accused person under our judicial system has no onus whatsoever to prove anything, and it is up to the prosecution to prove everything. So these documents—these figures and details—would be accepted, on the face of it, as being correct.What of the situation where the accused does not have sufficient information to be able to rebut that? The person I represented was lucky enough to have the intimate knowledge to do so. But if he had not had that, if it had been the recording of details which were not personally within his knowledge but which indirectly prejudiced him and affected his position, then he would have been hamstrung because he would not have been able to bring any evidence to rebut it. He would have been facing the fact that the document, on the face of it, would be accepted as prima facie evidence; that is, the document speaks for itself.Normally, that is not the case. Normally one has to bring along the author to certify a document and give that evidence. That is why I am highlighting the point. It is really a fine point, but when we are dealing with matters of proof in evidence we have to deal with fine points because they are really the points that can convict or acquit. When we are dealing with a persons liberty we have to tread very carefully.I say to the minister that I am mainly looking at the criminal jurisdiction because that is where strict proof has always been required; that is where the case has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt to convict the accused. I say that so that the minister can see the relevance of my question in relation to what sort of documents we are talking about and what would be on this database. If it is just the registration of a company, that is normally not a controversial document, but it is when one delves into company records and returns that it could become controversial. That is why I asked the question earlier about what documents would be contained in this database.","N/A","CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[9]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

He said it is a fine point. I accept that it is a fine point. That does not mean to say it is a bad point and not worth arguing about because fine points deal with major matters and have significant outcomes; therefore, we should get it right. I accept that line of argument.Senator Ellison earlier asked what records are kept on this database. My understanding of what he said in his concluding remarks is that if it is just the company registration records, that may be unexceptional, but with other records it may not be, or words to that effect. We are really debating here whether or not the records that are adduced by this means are the true and accurate documents—the real documents.Clearly, the submission of any company records to the Securities Commission is a weighty and serious matter. If the documents are open to question, which goes against the interests of an accused, as I said, the Attorney-General has said that the accused can lead evidence to challenge that. That seems to me to be a reasonable protection. The government has taken on board the points that were made earlier and has indicated that if, on further reflection, it needs to change its legislation, it will do so. There is no antipathy in this debate; this is a concerted search across the chamber to resolve this point. Since I see an eagerness in Senator Vanstone to speak, perhaps I should sit down and hear what she has to say.","N/A","CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[10]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The effect of that would be that there would be prima facie evidence of the content; that is, the truth of some of these matters. That was a concern because, as I think Senator Ellison said and Mr Williams pointed out, there were plenty of opportunities in minutes of meetings and annual reports for contentious statements to be made that one would want challenged. We were initially suggesting that the wording in 1274A(2) be changed to read:After `prima facie evidence of the, insert `statement of the matters—That is, evidence of the matters that have been stated to the commission, but not as to the truth of those matters. We thought that would fix it. The trouble then is that some of the things we all agree we do want to have prima facie evidence of the truth of—such as that the company was incorporated—would not have that benefit. We do not want officers from the Public Service hanging around having to give evidence of that in court.I think we have now resolved the matter because Mr Lavarch made the point about the Ascot system when he was commenting in the lower house. It is not clear from this wording that it is only that particular database that this section is intended to refer to—except that it is only intended to refer to that. It is all very well to have in mind that it is not intended to include annual reports and minutes et cetera, but it is a question of clear wording. Therefore, I move:Schedule 4, page 61, at end of proposed subsection 1274B(1), add ; but does not include the Commissions document imaging system.That would therefore limit that section to the database to which the Attorney-General is referring—the database for which we want the section to operate—and would specifically exclude, on its plain face, the commissions document imaging system. There is a distinct possibility that the government may accept that amendment. We think that that would resolve the problem.Even though it seems only a small amendment, the Attorney-General would have to make a statement as to its effect when this bill is returned to the other place. This would seal off this problem nicely and we would have achieved something sensible today. So the minister might indicate whether the government is happy to accept such an amendment from the coalition.","N/A","CORPORATE LAW REFORM BILL 1993","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/debate.sub1[2]/speech[11]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

When I saw the article I immediately asked for a report. If indeed names had been given at an AAT hearing, it would have been a very serious breach of our privacy rules.The article by Jennifer Cooke on 15 January in the Sydney Morning Herald actually reported that a Melbourne law firm, which represented the families of some people who had died of CJD following human pituitary hormone treatment, had raised this alleged breach in a letter to the Privacy Commissioner dated 7 January.Unfortunately, the journalist concerned did not check the information with anyone in my department and, as far as I am aware, not with the AAT either. It was a very serious allegation. I contacted the departmental officers and quickly discovered that, while the allegation may have been serious, it was also outrageous, since not one patients name had been mentioned at the hearing. Moreover, the mention of names in documents tabled at the hearing had been subject to suppression orders. Even those who had their names appear in a document had been given protection by the AAT. The transcript of the hearing confirms the fact that no patient names were mentioned in evidence before the AAT.Last Saturday the Sydney Morning Herald carried a correction which acknowledged this but, as in all the circumstances when newspapers get it wrong, the article was big and the correction very small. The law firm involved, Rennick Gaynor Kiddle Briggs, has laid itself open to allegations of deliberate mischief or unprofessional conduct. It was this firms action in releasing correspondence to the Sydney Morning Herald which resulted in that newspaper naming one of the firms clients, despite this professed concern for privacy.The firm also released to the press information received under discovery in relation to pending court cases. That material, I might say, was subject to confidentiality undertakings by all concerned, including the firm. It is, however, this practice of putting out newspaper advertisements advising people not to appear before the inquiry until they have spoken to this particular law firm that causes me even greater concern. There is a case, I suppose, for everyone chasing a dollar in the capitalist system, but it ought to have proper limits. The proper limits ought to be protection for those who need it—and certainly those who have been involved in this exercise, at the very least, require their names to be protected. But more than that, it requires some commitment to finding out the truth, not to attempting, by any means, to mar that discovery.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[4]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The clear lesson from these inquiries is that in order to maintain public confidence in government, public officials, including ministers, must ensure that their actions and decisions do nothing to allow any suspicion that official power and position are being abused. Does the minister agree that the minimum standards the public now expects from the government are that administrative processes should be open and fair, that decisions should be based on principle and supported by documented reasons, and that those involved in making decisions should be accountable for their decisions?

What is appropriate documentation for a particular decision will depend on the circumstances of the particular case. One can readily accept the reference to the principle of accountability. One can readily accept her reference to processes being fair and straightforward and so on. But what counts as relevant and necessary documentation will, as I say, depend on the circumstances of the particular case.The sports grants program was a program where there were, as I understand it, very clear threshold criteria described in the program itself as to the kinds of grants that could be made, the kinds of applications which would justify a grant being made—the reference to need and so on. There has been, as I understand it, no serious suggestion made that any particular grant was, in fact, in breach of those criteria—in the sense that there has been no serious suggestion made of any improper process being applied so as to produce money being given to a particular project which did not satisfy the threshold criteria. The matter in issue is whether there were other projects that also satisfied the criteria, and how the minister should have picked and chosen between those which, prima facie, satisfied that initial hurdle.There is, necessarily, an element of discretion involved in the administration of any project of this particular kind. Mrs Kelly has described—in loving and elaborate detail in response to over 320 questions directed to her by the opposition last night over a space of six hours—the way in which she applied those discretionary considerations. She has described—by reference to the famous information tool, the whiteboard—how she had in front of her, at any given time, for particular regions of the country, the applications that were involved. Necessarily, there was obviously an element of discretion involved in how she picked and chose between the different applications.Some people do not like the outcome, but the reason they do not like it is not because of any failure of public administration, not because of any failure to satisfy criteria in any particular case and not because of any serious question of fraud or maladministration in that sense; they simply do not like it because they think they can make a political point about the way in which the discretion was exercised.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator FAULKNER","5K4","NSW","ALP","N/A","701","—I am pleased to say to Senator Evans and other interested senators that last Friday the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal approved a two per cent increase in pay for ADF members up to and including the rank of colonel and equivalent, with a further increase of two per cent to be paid from 15 December 1994. The increases are totally in line with those achieved by civilian Defence employees as part of a work place agency agreement endorsed by the Industrial Relations Commission earlier in the week.The increases for ADF members and civilians have been achieved through different avenues, but they recognise the integrated nature of the Defence organisation; the common commitment to productivity and efficiency, and the joint nature of many of the productivity achievements. The Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, and I supported the case put by the ADF, and we are very pleased that their commitment to change has been appropriately rewarded by the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal.While pay cases for the ADF are considered by the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal rather than by the Industrial Relations Commission, the tribunal took into account many of the same productivity initiatives as did the IRC. The DFRT decided that pay increases for the ADF were appropriate because of the participation of the Australian Defence Force members in a range of productivity initiatives, of which the major ones were the commercial support program, the RAAF non-technical trade structure review, the defence logistics redevelopment project, the devolution of personnel, financial management functions and the civilianisation of support functions.The cooperation of ADF members in these far-reaching reforms is an essential part of achieving the redirection of resources to enhance combat capability. This agreement lays to rest any lingering perception of Defence as a huge monolithic organisation which is generally resistant to change. In fact, the Defence organisation as a whole now leads the field in the Commonwealth public sector in productivity bargaining, having achieved the first two agreements.The significance of this is obvious when we consider that more than 110,000 civilians and Defence Force personnel are covered by and benefit from these two decisions. The results achieved by Defence demonstrate convincingly that Defence personnel can increase their wages while at the same time the Australian taxpayer receives better value for money. In short, I think last Fridays decision by the DFRT showed that the ADF has come up with the goods and has received an outcome that is well and truly deserved.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[6]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

To answer part three of her question, any export of defence equipment anywhere outside Australia takes into account a number of factors, not the least of which is a countrys human rights record. On the whole, our attitude to defence exports and the controls on those has been stated by this government on many occasions. I suggest that Senator Margetts might like to avail herself of the document that is produced and updated regularly which indicates the processes we go through before any defence equipment is exported.It is really a two-level process. Any manufacturer in Australia that wishes to export defence equipment seeks approval in principle. That is considered by an interdepartmental committee, with representatives from the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and, I think, the Attorney-Generals Department. This committee considers these particular matters and makes recommendations to me, as the final arbiter, and they are approved or not approved. That is not where the process finishes. When those companies make a final agreement to export any military equipment—either lethal or non-lethal—they are required again to seek approval and again go through that process, and the application is finally arbitrated on by me or otherwise.We have been quite conscious of taking advice from the specialists in this particular field and from Senator Evanss department on what the circumstances are in a particular country. It is no secret at all that we have a total embargo on either lethal or non-lethal arms sales to countries such as Burma.

Following the last few months of good results, many people expected a less good result than the previous month. We got a better result than expected, which is good for optimism and confidence in the Australian community.In March last year, the government made a commitment to create 500,000 new jobs in three years. We are well on target to achieve that with growth of nearly 150,000 in the 10 months since that commitment was made. The increase in part-time employment of 48,700 was shared equally by men and women. In trend terms, both male and female part-time and full-time employment are rising.Whilst I acknowledge that we should not get too carried away with todays figures, nevertheless the improvement is welcome and continues the trend of good economic news in recent weeks. That compares with the amazing statement by the shadow Treasurer today where he described the unemployment figures as the `blood of the unemployed. Mr Downer, as shadow Treasurer, is getting quite desperate to find a point to make when he starts using phrases such as the `blood of the unemployed when we have a clearly discernible trend that employment is improving and unemployment is going down.We still accept, of course, that unemployment is unacceptably high and that there is a risk that the most disadvantaged in the labour market will be left behind unless we assist them to improve their job skills and attractiveness to employers. That is the challenge the government is constructively dealing with at the moment in considering the employment statement, the industry statement and the regional strategy.Referring to the last part of Senator McKiernans question, the criticism we are getting from people such as Mr Downer takes no account of the fact that in the macro-economic settings we have low inflation, low interest rates, declining unemployment and investment going up. We are in one of the best periods of economic growth in Australia in a long time. It is a pity that honourable senators opposite seem to be more stuck on listening to the economic policies of Senator Bronwyn Bishop—those mad, lunatic ideas—than to what is really going on in the economy. Clearly, the business community in particular is turning away from the policies or the non-policies of those opposite.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[10]/answer/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

I know that the Minister for Resources has been in contact with the unions concerned and will take the opportunity to reiterate the governments view that the action would undermine a great deal of the progress that has been made. The union has been part of that, bringing more efficiencies into the coal industry.The important point to make, as far as the negotiators were concerned—and I am sure Senator Sandy Macdonald would agree—is the need to maintain our market share in that market. In competition with competitors such as the Canadians, there was very little option in terms of the price that was set—effectively by them—other than to succeed as we did in maintaining that market share.The matter mentioned by Senator Macdonald about industrial arrangements being made, I can confirm. The position of the government has been enunciated by the Minister for Industrial Relations. That matter is currently being considered by the government.

It is very interesting that despite ongoing negotiations between the Commonwealth and New South Wales and Victoria, both New South Wales and Victoria have failed to sign the national child-care strategy. Indeed, last December the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Fahey, advised that the New South Wales government was `actively considering its position on this matter. I do not know what people mean by active consideration, but New South Wales has been doing that since 1990, along with Victoria—they say they will, they say they wont, but they still havent. All I can say is that I have heard very little serious talk from either of these state governments about their intention to sign with the Commonwealth the national child-care strategy.It is quite clear that both of those states do not have much regard for the needs of working families and their need for child care. However, the Commonwealth government is very concerned about that and it is very determined that families in Victoria and New South Wales do not miss out. Because of that concern, we have delivered on a promise made by the Prime Minister during the last election that we would, if necessary, enter into direct partnerships with both local governments and community organisations and bypass the states to ensure that the parents in both of those states have access to ongoing child-care places.I am very pleased to tell the Senate today that our pilot program to establish 500 places in New South Wales and Victoria under these direct partnerships has been a success. Earlier this year I announced that we have finalised arrangements to establish 280 new long day care places in New South Wales and 221 new places in Victoria through these direct partnerships. In addition, over the same time, because of the failure of these two states to enter into an agreement, we have decided to provide 7,000 fully Commonwealth funded, outside school hours care places in both New South Wales and Victoria. I am also pleased to advise that to this point we are well on the way to meeting that target, with over 4,000 places now approved.I suspect all senators here have heard from their local community groups about the need for outside school hours places. They can assure their constituents in New South Wales and Victoria that it is the Commonwealth government that is making sure they get them, in the face of those two states simply refusing over more than four years now to be prepared to enter into an agreement. I hope that all senators, in the light of their constituents requests, will assist in applying pressure to the states to make sure that they fulfil their obligations to families in their own states.This is the International Year of the Family. Child care is an ongoing and critical issue for all families. Victoria and New South Wales cannot go on hiding behind their failure to deliver on a serious commitment to child care by failing to sign with the Commonwealth the national child-care strategy.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/qwn/question.block[14]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator HILL","BH4","(South Australia-","LP","Leader of the Opposition)","710","—I move:That the Senate take note of the statement made by the President during question time relating to privilege resolution No. 9 of 25 February 1988.Mr President, your intervention was unprecedented. Certainly in my experience in the nearly 13 years I have been in this place an incident has not occurred in which a President has stood during question time, without invitation in the form of a point of order being taken, to read to the Senate part of a resolution that it had previously carried in relation to privileges and, in effect, to warn the Senate to ensure that in asking questions a reference is not made that might include an allegation against someone.Mr President, it seems to me that resolution 9 of that particular resolution that you referred to is, as was stated by one of my colleagues, clearly included to protect third parties. It does not seem to me that it has anything to do with the rights and security of a senator in this place or a member in the other place whose rights are clearly protected by standing order 193(3). In other words, Mr President, if an unfair reflection is being made upon a senator or member, you clearly have a right under that standing order to protect that member.Resolution 9 relates to an entirely different matter, and that is to ensure that when speaking in the Senate or in committee senators do not unfairly refer to third parties, which are unable to respond. The final words are included for good and sensible reasons. If that interpretation is correct, one must wonder why you raised it in the middle of question time immediately following a question by Senator Baume referring to the Prime Minister. One can only fairly presume that you were in fact warning members of the opposition that they should not be asking questions of the nature of that asked by Senator Baume in relation to the Prime Minister.What did Senator Baume ask in relation to the Prime Minister? He said that there is evidence from ASC documentation to suggest that the Prime Minister, through his business interests, is indebted to Mr Brown, a former member of parliament and a current lobbyist, for a sum of money that could be in the area of millions of dollars. He raised the issue of a potential conflict of interest arising out of being so indebted to a lobbyist.I could not think of any more legitimate question for a member of parliament to ask. Surely a potential conflict of interest must arise with the Prime Minister taking on such an enormous and complex business interest at a time when he is Prime Minister. I understand that he took it on when he was Treasurer, but he advanced it when he was on the back bench in the form of reaching agreement with the Danes and carrying on the detailed running of the negotiations. He now says that he is at arms-length.But there must be a potential conflict of interest in every direction; whether it relates to the loans from the Commonwealth Bank, of which the Commonwealth, as a shareholder, has a major interest; whether it relates to relations with the Danes because the Danes are a party to this business; whether it relates to debts to lobbyists who were former members of parliament; whether it relates to the importation of semen; or whether it relates to the AQIS matters that were raised during the last parliament. All these are areas of potential conflict of interest that arise out of a Prime Minister of this country having the sort of business interests that Mr Keating has decided to embark upon.It is quite legitimate, I put to you, Mr President, for us to raise those issues in this place and question the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, as to the extent of those potential conflicts of interest. It is legitimate for us to ask whether Mr Keating has in fact made full disclosure in the cabinet room, and matters of that nature. I put it to you, Mr President, that that is not only a legitimate thing to do, but it is our responsibility to do it.Therefore, to be warned, in effect, in those circumstances that we should not be asking questions of this nature causes those of us on this side of the chamber great concern. I ask you in the course of this debate to explain why you chose, immediately after Senator Baumes question, to raise this particular resolution of the Senate. What were you seeking to communicate? What warning were you seeking to give to us? In informing us of that, I ask you to reflect upon what I have just put to you. I invite you to recognise that this resolution relates to something entirely different from what you were referring to, and that there is a relevant standing order that enables you to protect the Prime Minister from an unfair reflection. But it is not an unfair reflection when we raise matters—matters that are already on the public record—that perhaps contain obvious areas of both conflict of interest and potential conflict of interest.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

Mr President, what I understood you to be doing, in referring to standing order No. 9 on page 101 about the exercise of freedom of speech, was drawing attention to what has perhaps been an under-recognised and under-remembered provision of our standing orders concerning imputations, innuendos or smears against people outside the parliament. As I understood it, you were not purporting to be referring to every relevant standing order to substantiate your general point; you were making a particular reference to that one, to the extent that it does relate to people outside the parliament. It was proper that you did so, because unhappily it is an increasing practice in this place for these sorts of statements to be made under cover of privilege, and it is important that people who are making these statements be very careful about them.What I understood Senator Baume to be doing in his question, which did appear to trigger that response, was making just such an unsubstantiated allegation. There was a reference to a particular loan having been in existence and some reference to ASC documentation, but Senator Baume has not produced that documentation.

I do not know what Senator Baume is referring to. All I know is that he makes a broad, sweeping generalisation about some possible loan involving some possible conflict of interest. What he is doing in that respect is not only drawing imputations, innuendos or inferences, or seeking to have them drawn about the Prime Minister, but also he is doing so about another person, an outsider, that is, Mr Brown, about his potentially misusing his role and taking advantage of some leverage he might be thought to have over some minister of the Crown to advance in some improper way his business activities.There is a clear innuendo, a clear imputation, a clear smear against an outsider involved as well as against the Prime Minister himself.Mr President, I suggest that you are absolutely within your rights as the President of this place to draw attention to these matters at your own discretion, in your own way and in your own time when you regard it as appropriate to do so, to draw attention to the misuse or potential misuse of the forms and privileges of this House.It is all very well to make a substantiated allegation, but it is not very appropriate or legitimate to make an unsubstantiated allegation simply under the guise of raising some issue of public interest which might be involved. It is as if I were to ask Senator Baume the questions: `Is it or is it not the case that you have a half million dollar loan from that other pork company which is engaged as a business rival to Brown and Hatton? Is it not the case that you are acting in a way to try and destroy the commercial viability of Brown and Hatton? Is it not the case that you are misusing your position as a senator under cover of privilege to act in this way to the commercial damage of another company?If I were to ask Senator Baume those sorts of questions under the guise of doing so in the public interest—because there would be a clear issue of public interest involved if that is what he was doing—I would be acting utterly improperly in terms of the forms of this House and I would rightly be drawn to heel by the President and the proper forms of this house. That is not the way to behave in this place—to make unsubstantiated allegations. If Senator Baume has some substantiation for a particular allegation or some quantification of it, or if he has a question to raise about it, he should do it. But he should not do it in a way that smears or a way which, by innuendo, inference and negative imputation, draws people into the public domain with a series of allegations which simply do not stand up to scrutiny.Senator Baume has a track record of, over and over again, trying to make something of this issue and making allegations of conflict of interest. He has done it with AQIS, he has done it with the FIRB and he has done it with an allegation about a tax claim by the Prime Minister. He has been wrong in each case. It has to be drawn to public attention that he has been wrong in the past. It is entirely legitimate that we should approach any new allegation that Senator Baume makes with a very great sense of caution before taking it seriously and responding to it. Senator Baume does not deserve to be responded to seriously on the basis of anything he has raised in the past.Mr President, you were perfectly correct, on the prima facie way in which the question was asked in this place, to draw attention to those rules and the forms and practice in this place.

The allegations raised here have not been disposed of, despite constant questioning in this place. Senator Evans raised this example: what if he said that Senator Michael Baume was simply trying to raise these questions to upset some other company and had some private interest? He, of course, could answer those questions, but he has been asking a number of questions with respect to this piggery which have not been adequately answered. I ask you, Mr President, to consider whether you ever again make such an intervention in question time. I do not deny that your role as President is to keep order in this place, but you do have opportunities to implement that order other than by intervening in a public way at question time and clearly publicly giving the inference you are going to take such control of question time that you will decide what is an appropriate and inappropriate question.I put to you, Mr President, one other option available to you that has been taken by other presidents in the past when they thought someone had in one way or another been transgressing the standing orders or bringing this place into some form of disrepute; that is, a quiet phone call to say, `Would you like to come around and have a cup of tea?. That was available to you today; it has been available to you ever since you have had the job and it will be available to you in the future. I say to you that if you believe that someone or a group of people are in some way not doing the right thing, the appropriate course for you to choose in the future—if I may respectfully suggest—is not to make such a public intervention. What you do by doing so is to give the impression that you are now going to take control of question time and you are going to do it to advantage your own party.It is an unhappy accident, from your position, I suppose, that, with regard to the question you might have been referring to—despite, from what I understood you to say, what was a general intervention—your general intervention followed a specific question with respect to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The only inference that can be drawn in the publics eye is that it is that question you wanted to get to and that what you were trying to do was limit the opposition in its capacity to ask questions with respect to the Prime Minister and his financial affairs.It is equally unfortunate for you, I suggest, Mr President, that your intervention with respect to unsubstantiated allegations followed those remarks being made by Senator Evans time and time again in his response, accusing Senator Baume of making unsubstantiated allegations. To the untrained eye, when this debate is re-broadcast, it looks very much like you are taking instruction from the front table. We see that happening in the lower house. We have not seen happen here, and we do not want to see happen here, the President of this chamber—either substantively or giving the appearance of—taking instructions from the table, especially if it is from the side the President happened to come from before he took up that position. That is all very unfortunate for you, and on that basis I suggest that should you wish to direct senators attention to particular remarks in the future, you would do not only this place but yourself as well a great service if you did so privately.Last but not least, I want to raise the question of unsubstantiated allegations and the raising thereof. Senator Evans has sought time and time again basically to put the argument that, if senators raise an substantiated allegation, they must be doing so in bad faith, they must be doing so simply to make a political point and there must be nothing in the allegation. He somehow seems to give the impression that he already knows the answer.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator VANSTONE","7E4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A","713","—Senator Patterson interjects, `Brian Burke—we saw an example of this in that case. The very point about an allegation is that it is just that. It is not a completely made out case. One of the very important points and advantages of parliamentary privilege is that people out there—taxpayers who cannot afford to raise an allegation and find out that they are wrong; they are too frightened to do so because of what the bureaucracy will do to them if they do—can come to senators and honourable members with an allegation. I accept that some allegations are made in bad faith but, by and large, people come in good faith because they believe there is a problem.It is the job of people in this place to look at those allegations and get answers to them. By raising those questions, one either disposes of the allegation—in which case, the person about whom it is made is exonerated and completely satisfied; presumably, such people would not be worried about their affairs being raised—or, of course, one substantiates the allegation. It is just a non sequitur to suggest that the only things we can raise in here and the only facts we can ask about are facts that we already know. That is the very purpose of a question—to try to get to the facts behind something.In the case of an allegation, the benefit of allowing questions to be asked in this place is that either the allegation will be disposed of if people are willing to give the answers that can dispose of it; or it remains hanging around like a bad smell, as this particular one has; or, if the answers are given and substantiated, we have other political opportunities to take into account what we want to do.I conclude by making the point that it is a nonsense to suggest that people can ask questions in here only when they know the answers to them. It would make this whole place completely unworthwhile. Mr President, I simply ask you, in the chambers interest and, more particularly, in your own, that in future when you have such views to consider expressing them privately.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/speech[3]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator MICHAEL BAUME","LE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A","715","—Mr President, I have to say to you directly that I object to the remarks you made. I find it absolutely disgraceful that you should make them in the context of my question. I refer to the remarks about unsubstantiated allegations. You made those remarks in the context of a question which did not contain unsubstantiated allegations. However, they were so described by Senator Gareth Evans. Immediately after he had so described them, you made a statement saying effectively that unsubstantiated allegations should not be made in this chamber. I do not know who is scripting whom, but I find it absolutely offensive that you should accept, apparently, Senator Evanss version of these as unsubstantiated allegations as in fact a matter with which to chide me, because the context could only involve that inference.It seems, Mr President, from your prepared statement, that you made up your mind to hit a six off the next ball. It happens to have been the wrong ball. The fact is that my question—I will repeat it for your benefit—was: are the Australian people entitled to know the size of the financial obligation Mr Keatings half-owned companies owe to John Brown, his former ministerial colleague who has lobbied this government on behalf of various interest groups and has been a government appointee to official positions? In view of the four different versions of the debt to John Brown revealed in the Prime Ministers piggery groups chaotic accounts, ranging from the $4.5 million to nothing, will you tell the Australian people how much their Prime Ministers companies really owe Mr Brown?What are the unsubstantiated allegations?—because that is how you characterised them in the context of your remarks. Your remarks immediately followed my statements of fact. Senator Evans said, `But they are not facts; we have never seen them. We have gone to immense trouble in this chamber to present these facts, the reasons being that the government refused to do so, that Mr Keating refused to do so, that his companies have consistently failed to meet the requirements of the law and the Securities Commission. The only reason these facts are available is my continual protests in this chamber and the letter I wrote to the Securities Commission requiring it to take note of the fact that the law had been blatantly breached by Mr Keatings piggery companies.Let us get the position clear. In early 1992—that is, some seven or eight months after Mr Keating became an owner of this group—his company put in a return for the year 1990 when he was not an owner. It eventually put in a return which showed nothing about this kind of debt; it showed nothing about the details of the accounts. It was grossly inadequate, and as a result the Securities Commission required the company to come out with more detailed material. Eventually the company did, and that detailed material showed a debt—a liability—to Brown and Hatton, as it is called, Mr Browns company, of $4.5 million. Senator Evans says that he has never seen it, that he does not know anything about it.With your permission, Mr President, when I have been able to return to my office I shall bring that annual return here. Rather than simply table the returns, I will also seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the sections dealing with the indebtedness. I will present the four different versions of that indebtedness which appeared in the three subsequent returns that had to be put in because of the falsity of the returns that had been put in to the ASC. Those false returns had to be corrected. Those false returns massively understated the huge losses of those companies.I am dealing with facts. The facts are that there were four different versions, in the accounts that were reluctantly produced by Mr Keatings companies, of how much Mr Brown was owed. By good luck, I happen to have two of them with me. The annual return for the year 30 June 1990—the unaudited return, which is breaking the law—when in fact those companies were public companies for nine-tenths of the year, as I recall, said this in version No. 2 or No. 3, I cannot remember:The company has not recorded in its financial statements a potential liability of $4 million—I do not know what happened to the other $500,000. Five hundred thousand dollars does not mean much to prime ministers. They can find $430,000 out of nowhere to buy a half interest in a piggery company, so I suppose why worry about $500,000?. . . a potential liability of $4 million relating to the purchase price associated with the acquisition of the wholesale pig business and associated naming rights of Brown and Hatton Pty Ltd.Is the Australian Labor Party disputing the figure of $4 million?The $4 million will only be paid if the companys directors so determine and if the company makes sufficient profits and has sufficient funds available to pay the additional price of $4 million.If I recall, that one was signed by Mr Constantinidis, but I can check that later. It was, of course, unaudited. Another return says:The subordinated loans recorded in the companys balance sheet under shareholders equity have been determined by reference to the amount due to the previous owners of the business undertakings associated with Brown and Hatton Group Ltd. As subordinated loans, such amounts will be reduced commensurately subject to the future profitability of the company and the availability of cash resources.In fact, they were the audited 1991 parent company accounts filed with the Securities Commission. These are not unsubstantiated allegations. These are documents filed with the Securities Commission.Now what are the subordinated loans? They were listed as $3.38 million in 1990 and $2.76 million in 1991. That is why I asked which is the right amount that is really owed. Have these figures just been written down in the books because provisions have been made against them, or has the amount owed to Mr Brown been diminished because some payments have been made?When I ask whether the Australian people are entitled to know the size of the debt that Mr Keating owes to Mr Brown, the size of the debt itself obviously is a matter of some substance. I have asked various leading accountants about the extraordinary manner in which this debt to Mr Brown has been handled. Even in the latest accounts that are available, where it is regarded as a subordinated loan and therefore a part of shareholders equity, I have come across the universal view that the reclassification of the debt to equity was not only controversial but also wrong in principle. Paragraph 29 of the appendix giving guidance to people who put in annual returns says, under the statement of accounting concepts:In practice, subordinated loans have sometimes been classified as equity. However, the fact that a loan is subordinated, that is, given a lower ranking for repayment than some or all other debts of the entity, does not change the essential nature of these securities. Subordinated loans possess the essential characteristics of liabilities and should be recognised as such in the statement of financial position.I was obviously clearly entitled to ask: what is the real debt owing to John Brown if it is in the public interest to know by how much a Prime Minister is obligated—protected by the corporate veil—to a lobbyist and an appointee to various government boards? My leader, Senator Hill, said, `If that is not a proper question, then I find it very difficult to understand what a proper question is. If it is the sort of question that prompts and deserves the sort of response you gave it, Mr President, then I strongly disagree with your judgment on this matter.The other point I would like to make is that the Prime Minister by his inaction did nothing to correct those grievous errors in his groups accounts which I kept pointing out here, and which were dismissed by those opposite, and by the Prime Minister himself, as unsubstantiated muckraking. I repeat that: these facts have non-stop been described as unsubstantiated muckraking. I suppose I should be pleased, Mr President, that you only described them as unsubstantiated allegations. At least you have not got that part of the script correct.The Prime Ministers companies were only obliged to put in their correct returns after I wrote to the Securities Commission and the Securities Commission had an investigation which resulted in those false returns being corrected by the companies. But not by the companys own initiative, despite my repeated statements here—all described, as I said, as unsubstantiated muckraking—which were proven to be absolutely correct.When the Prime Minister half owns a company which fails to report that it owes $4.5 million to Mr John Brown, people can make whatever inference they like. I was simply seeking to know the facts. If I had wanted to make inferences I could have said: why is the Prime Minister hiding the fact that his company owes John Brown $4.5 million and that he is the half owner of the company that owes John Brown that money? As it was, we saw the Prime Minister not correcting the false impression created by a false return to the Securities Commission that his investment in this group was $43,000. That was an official document lodged with the Securities Commission.It was reported in the newspapers that the Prime Minister had made an investment of $43,000. When I eventually sought the corrected versions, the Securities Commission documents revealed that it was $430,000—just a slight typographical error—in the same way as the returns consistently failed to reveal that losses of hundreds of thousands of dollars were in fact losses because they were put there as profits. A slight typographical error!Mr President, I can say to you, that we simply wanted—and I simply wanted in asking that question—to know the extent to which the Prime Minister, through his half owned company, was under some obligation to another Australian. It does not seem that Senator Evanss suggestion that I was somehow blackguarding John Brown in this matter stands up. I was asking for the facts. I was asking whether it was sensible for a Prime Minister to be under a multimillion dollar obligation to a lobbyist and government appointee in this way.I have in the meantime, I hope, been given the annual returns. I would hope to be able to seek leave to incorporate in Hansard those sections of the annual returns which reveal the different manner in which this debt to John Brown has either been covered up or hidden. I believe that this chamber has the right to ask for that sort of information. We never expect to get an answer, but we have a right to ask. One would hope that the media would be interested in the fact that we never get an answer—that when we ask questions that are right and proper, we do not get answers. There was no answer to this one. There will be no answer to the right and proper questions—and I suggest, Mr President, that you might like to look at the others that I have asked since parliament resumed this year—that I have asked about the piggery matter.Where there is a potential conflict of interest, it is crucial to the issue that there should be full information. Information is the heart of the matter. We heard today, for example, the absolute nonsense of Senator Evans saying, `If we had the same sort of reporting standards that are required in the House of Representatives, we would see a few things. This has demonstrated that the House of Representatives and ministerial reporting standards are so inadequate, hopeless and capable of being got around by a cunning operative that, when the Prime Minister made his declaration of interest, when he said that he had bought an interest in a company which had an interest in a piggery, we had no idea that in fact he had bought the half ownership of a company which totally owned a piggery group. That is the way to get around it, is it not?This is the same Prime Minister who attacked Ian McLachlan in the other place saying, `You didnt reveal the properties owned by your companies that you listed in the annual return. Goodness me! I wonder why the Prime Minister in that case has never revealed the extensive property holdings of his half owned piggery group. If these things are going to be meaningful, let them be meaningful or not exist at all.So I say to you, Mr President, that I am offended by your remarks. I believe that the context in which you made them is indefensible. By repeating the exact phrase, `unsubstantiated allegations that was wrongly, falsely used—and deliberately so by Senator Evans because it is part of the campaign designed to denigrate the facts I have been presenting—you gave credibility and standing to a false, disgraceful attempt by Senator Evans to denigrate the facts of this matter. I have been presenting to this chamber and to the people of Australia facts that they would not otherwise have had access to if I had not taken the action I have by continually searching the documents that I have demonstrated were false and were corrected because of my assiduous attention to my duty. Mr President, statements such as yours will not discourage me from continuing to carry out my duty to the people of Australia.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/speech[4]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator COONEY","SF4","(Victoria)","ALP","N/A","718","—That is all that has been put. If the President makes a ruling—and presidents make rulings all the time—the opposition can object to it and take it on. But to take the President to task and say he is failing in his duties is taking the matter too far, particularly in reference to a President that all those opposite elected last week. For those opposite to say that in one particular instance they will go ahead in the way they are, is remarkable.If—and it is a big if—those opposite persist beyond a reasonable reaction to this statement, it would be reasonable for us on this side to say that their taking the President to task has a very big political element to it. If that is the situation, then those opposite are carrying out something they are accusing their President of doing. That would be wrong. So they are now in danger of making a political attack on the President. That should not happen.Senator Alston is looking at me. I have no objection to anyone saying, `I think that was an unfortunate statement you made in that context, Mr President. I do not think it was, but if Senator Alston says that, that is fair enough. But if it is taken beyond that, is this not a political attack on a person who has done an excellent job since those opposite unanimously elected him last week? If this occasion is used to make an attack on the President, we face the problem in this chamber of a poison starting to spread.Let me make it quite clear—I have said it before and I say it again—there is no objection to saying to the President, `I think that was an unfortunate juxtaposition of your statement with the question. But if it goes beyond that, what are we about in this chamber? The President is in a position that should be non-political. He has been pursuing it on a non-political basis, and for him to be attacked in a way that would poison the atmosphere in this chamber is a very bad thing.When it was brought to his notice, he immediately said, `I did not intend it in that way. So what those opposite are really arguing with is his contention that he in no way meant this to be a political action. Those opposite talk about the balance of fairness and about people being able to have a go. What fairness is there when, at the first opportunity, the President makes it quite clear that he did not intend his statement to be taken in the way suggested by the other side, those opposite do not accept it? What evidence is there that they should not accept that? Why should he not be accepted on the basis of what he said? If he is not accepted on that basis, what does that mean? Those opposite might ask themselves that question.The point has been made quite excellently by Senator Baume, who was involved. Why should it be taken further than that? Senator Vanstone, I thought, analysed this in a quite dispassionate and forceful fashion. Why should it be taken further than what she said? If people are to get up one after another and berate the President, we are on a very dangerous course in this chamber. If, on the other hand, people get up and take a reasoned and measured approach to it, all right.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/speech[5]/talk.start[9]/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator ALSTON","LD4","(Victoria-","LP","Deputy Leader of the Opposition)","721","—Mr President, I think the reason why we are taking this matter to the extent that we are is that we view it very seriously indeed. Certainly, at the outset of your presidency, I think it is fundamentally important that we all understand the ground rules.Senator Cooney made a great point of saying that you were elected unanimously. Putting aside certain numerical aspects to decision making of that sort, the fact is that we expected you, as we would expect any incumbent of your high office, to act impartially and not intervene gratuitously or inappropriately. I have to say that all of what has taken place today can lead to only one conclusion, and that is, that it was your intention before you came into this chamber to make the statement you did the next time that Senator Baume asked a question relating to the Prime Ministers financial interest. The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming.Otherwise, we would not have had the slightest idea of what you were talking about. You spoke about `unsubstantiated allegations; that term is not used in resolution 9 under `Exercise of Freedom of Speech. The term `unsubstantiated is one you chose to use on the back of what Senator Evans had to say in this matter, and follows a repeated assertion of that characterisation by Senator Evans in response to a number of questions from Senator Baume. You could only have been intending to refer to this issue, and this you saw as the perfect opportunity to jump in and make your views known.It is one thing to warn people in the abstract about thinking before they make allegations, but to intervene in the way that you did and to use that term `unsubstantiated is highly judgmental. You were effectively passing judgment. What is critical to remember is that halfway through that fulmination Senator Evans said, `I dont know the facts of this matter. He then proceeded to tell us his strategy. His strategy is that because he alleges that Senator Baume has got it wrong in the past—which, of course, none of us concedes in any shape or form; he has done a very thorough and diligent job based on a lot of careful research but, nonetheless, Senator Evans has chosen that tactic—therefore, Senator Evans is not going to answer the question. That has been the political approach of the government on a number of occasions. To simply ask a question does not constitute unsubstantiated allegations. `Unsubstantiated means that someone has ruled on the merits. Someone has looked at these allegations and found that they do not stack up. The last thing those opposite ought to be doing is passing judgement in that way. It is certainly not for them to characterise these as unsubstantiated allegations.Therefore, Mr President, your intervention was highly unfortunate. To the extent that it was intended to fire a warning shot across our bows, I can say that we will not be deterred. Indeed, if your intention was to try to up the ante, as it were, then you are effectively trying to plunge a dagger into the heart of one of the most cherished of democratic principles, and that is, freedom of speech.This place is all about asking questions and, quite often, getting non-responsive answers. That is what the game is often about. Senators do not want to come in here and raise matters without any foundation for the very good reason that it backfires on them, they lose credibility, they do not prove their point and they are simply not taken seriously in the future. There is a very real built-in restraint to so-called unsubstantiated allegations in this chamber.One can only inevitably conclude that you, Mr President, were trying to suggest that in this particular matter it is not appropriate for us to canvass issues of conflict of interest on the part of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister would have to be one of the worlds greatest bullies. He is one of the people who has almost unlimited opportunities to defend himself through all manners of procedures of this chamber. It was then suggested that somehow there is a relevance to resolution 9 to protect those persons who might have limited opportunities to respond and to have regard to the rights of others. The Prime Minister is in an unparalleled position to defend himself and to provide responsive answers if there are indeed answers to be made to Senator Baumes allegations.In those circumstances, Mr President, you ought to reflect very carefully. We do not stand here alleging any general lack of confidence in you. We very much want to see you get it right, and to get it right as often as is humanly possible. What we do not want, and what we have not had in this chamber in the eight years I have been here, is a President who is clearly one sided. I regret to say that is not the public perception of what goes on in the House of Representatives, but certainly we believe that your two predecessors in this chamber, Doug McClelland and Kerry Sibraa, acted with commendable impartiality, did not seek to intervene improperly and understood how we make this place function. When the government does not have the numbers, this place is potentially very unruly. That is why it is critically important that the President exercise a moderating influence, not an inflammatory one.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/speech[6]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

The timing of it, from my part, was unarguably designed to indicate that you disapproved of Senator Baumes question. You could certainly have raised it at any other time. You did not in the slightest try to indicate what you were referring to. What are we meant to learn from that little offering other than that it followed immediately after Senator Baume had asked a question which Senator Gareth Evans characterised as unsubstantiated allegations—and you repeated the same phrase. I cannot see the defence. Although Senator Cooney did his best, as he usually does, I would have thought even he would have pleaded guilty on your behalf if he had been asked to advise on the matter.I simply leave it at that.

I think that enough heat has been put into the debate and that perhaps we need to move on and learn from things.The point that I was making before that interjection was that there are members and senators who, from time to time, abuse the privileges that we get in this place. One of those very important privileges is that we are protected from civil action from the comments that we make. That is a very important privilege and one that we should not abuse merely because we happen to be elected as representatives in this place.I said in debate in this place on 14 December last year that I felt that I had only ever abused privilege on one occasion in the past. Since then, I have recalled another occasion on which I did that, and I regret that. It was not meant in any derogatory way, however. I will leave it at that small explanation.In the context of that debate on 14 December last year, Senator Crichton-Browne took me to task over some comments I had made in public on the radio in Perth—I was not using this chamber. Those comments came back to me this afternoon in the course of the debate when the person who I was then commenting about—the Attorney-General of Western Australia, Mrs Cheryl Edwardes—was in the gallery with her husband, Colin. They were in the chamber at the time and those comments came flooding back to me. When I am making these statements and trying to take some of the heat out of the debate, I am trying to say to the other side that there is lots of ammunition on this side of the chamber if we want to go out and denigrate individuals.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/speech[7]/talk.start[4]/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not rise to berate you but merely to say that I thought it was inappropriate and a masterpiece of mistiming when you made that statement. That statement was based on fact. Many other people in their contributions here have mentioned that this is the only opportunity that senators and other members of parliament have to bring to the parliament the worries, fears and problems of their constituents.Mr President, in your inaugural speech you admitted that you had to fill some pretty big shoes. You stood up and said that about your predecessors. I agree with that statement. I have been here for 12 years and your two predecessors have been the epitome of fairness, honesty and independence. When you took over the chair, you took on a very high role—one of the most important in Australia. I do not like to see you getting off to a bad start. I do not want to push this issue, but I sound a note of warning to the Senate that we are used to and we appreciate the independence of the President, which has been a feature of this place over the last 12 years that I have been here.I want to enter into the debate on the issue of what you, Mr President, regard as unsubstantiated allegations. Over the past two or three weeks that Senator Michael Baume has been raising questions on the piggery of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, has attempted to pour scorn on Senator Baume and say that some of the allegations that he has raised are not substantiated at all. He has raised the issue of AQIS. This was an issue that I also raised. Senator Baume and I brought up two issues. He followed the companys procedures and I raised what I thought was a very important issue to my constituents.Let me read out a letter that will prove to you, Mr President, that there is some substance to the allegations that I have raised. In 1992 there was a very important issue of the breeding material, semen and embryos that were to be brought into Australia. I believed that AQIS was changing its protocols. I believed it was receiving pressure from a very high office—the Prime Ministers department. I raise that issue because I have in front of me a letter from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. It states:Live pigsThe Danes first raised the possibility of access for live pigs in the mid 1980s. This request was not formally followed-up until 1990 when it re-emerged as an issue at Prime Ministerial level in the context of proposals for a joint venture between Danish and Australian pig breeding and processing interests. AQIS concerns regarding live pigs are the same as those associated with pig semen.There it is. That is not an unsubstantiated allegation; that is very much a substantiated allegation. It is very substantial evidence—a letter from AQIS saying that there was pressure coming from the Prime Ministers department. Let it not be said by anyone, including the Leader of the Government in the Senate, that the allegations that we have raised have no substance to them at all.I raised that issue and read out that quote verbatim from an AQIS letter so that you, Mr President, will know that the issues we are raising have substance. We are not just going out on a fishing expedition; we are not just trawling around with no substance to allegations. As my colleague Senator Alston said, if we come in here with no credibility or blow our credibility, then we lose badly. Mr President, I am prepared to let this issue go. I am prepared to say that I have confidence in you. But I hope that you will be more circumspect in your remarks in the future.","N/A","PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[15]/speech[8]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator TEAGUE","PJ4","(South Australia)","LP","N/A","724","—Mr President, I rise with the responsibility that I feel I have as a member of the privileges committee of the Senate and having dealt with some 40 inquiries that have arisen under the resolution which you quoted during question time. I am very familiar with this resolution and resolution 9. Throughout the whole life of the Senate in this building, I have been one of the Acting Deputy Presidents. I am very conscious of the responsibilities we all have when we occupy the chair in this chamber, as I was in the old Parliament House.I rise with respect to you, Mr President. You were elected last week. This is your first fortnight as President. You have kindly invited us all to drinks tonight to celebrate your election. I have applied as much thought as I can to the events of the past two hours. I believe that it is appropriate for us to give our views about this issue because you are in the beginning of what may be a long period of service as President of this Senate and there are some themes which need to be frankly put to you, and to this chamber, with regard to the exercise of your very high responsibilities as President.It is my considered view that intervening in question time in the way that we saw today was unprecedented, was not justified, and demonstrated most unfortunate timing. Whenever the President stands—as you do and need to do from time to time—the standing orders require the whole chamber to be silent, as it should be. It is, therefore, a unique privilege for the President of the Senate to stand in his place and to make an intervention. I hope that the events of today will not lead to any kind of debasing of that privilege.Mr President, not only did you take this unique opportunity to stand and require silence from the whole chamber, but you did so in the middle of question time when it was being televised. There was an exposure to the statement which would not have been the case had it been made after question time or at some other ad hoc period. The fact of its being unprecedented added a certain surprise, drama and particularity to the intervention which, I think, was the reason why we saw it as unfortunate. It happened to follow a particular senators question and it could only be inferred that the statement was made in respect of that senators question.I am satisfied by the explanation that Senator Michael Baume has given in the debate on this motion that there was no unsubstantiated allegation. There are, in this whole issue, numerous allegations. Perhaps some of them will need to be much more carefully substantiated. But, Mr President, I put to you some questions which I hope, in due course and as soon as possible, you may address. Did you prepare a statement to be made? Was that statement prepared—and it appeared that you were reading from written notes—in case there was any matter that led you to feel you needed to respond in that way? Was it prepared with particular senators in mind? Mr President, did you consult with the Leader of the Government prior to your composing that statement?

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator BISHOP","SE4","(New South Wales)","LP","N/A","725","—Earlier today in question time an article published in the Australian Financial Review written by Jennifer Hewett was used as the basis of an attack on me. Both the basis of the article and the nature of the attack totally misrepresented the position that I outlined in a speech which I gave to an organisation called CEDA some two weeks ago.The only connection between Ms Hewetts article and reality is that she correctly reports that I made some remarks about the Australian dollar. Ms Hewett misrepresented my remarks about the floating of the dollar in 1983. For those who were not present at the CEDA function and who possess only the warped account and what flowed in this chamber from it, I would like to make two matters perfectly clear.Firstly, I believe that the process by which the Hawke government floated the dollar in 1983 was wrong. Given that it was one of the most important decisions taken by any government in Australia during the 1980s, under our system of government it should have been endorsed by the full cabinet. It was not. Secondly, I made the point that in the early months of the Labor government in 1983 we saw that the Reserve Bank was unable to conduct proper monetary policy within the confines of a fixed exchange rate. In March 1983 the government devalued the dollar by 10 per cent. By the second week in December the dollar was virtually driven to its original level by large capital inflows.My point was a very simple one: that Mr Keating should have followed the advice given to the government in the months prior to December 1983, in either September or October, by the likes of Ross Garnaut, Ted Evans and others, and floated the dollar instead of delaying the decision until a currency crisis developed in 1983. Indeed, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bob Johnson, said:We didnt make a formal decision to float until the death knock.My point was precisely this: that Mr Keating failed to produce cabinet papers until the very day of the decision, instead of having a 10-day period for cabinet consideration, supports Mr Johnsons statement. Cabinet should have made a decision months earlier and the suggestion that I believe that the decision should have been delayed any further—that is, some 10 days beyond 9 December 1983—is totally and utterly wrong and totally misrepresents my position. That is the basis upon which the government chose to attack me today. I said categorically in my CEDA speech that the float should have occurred earlier and as a properly considered one, not one where the market had a gun to the Treasurers head.In his book The End of Certainty Paul Kelly details Paul Keatings failure to make a formal decision during the months leading up to December 1983. Kelly says of the float that Keating was not prepared to press the button; he wanted the Treasury to come with him.I would also like to point out that none of the alleged comments referred to in Ms Hewetts article, including the one that totally misrepresented my position, was checked for accuracy with either my staff or me prior to publication, which I find singularly amazing as the speech was made some two weeks ago. If she had done so, then her article may have been more balanced and less biased. I am disappointed that the Financial Review , which otherwise has a good reputation, should have in this instance totally misrepresented my position and what I said in the speech and, indeed, not even had the courtesy to check with my office. Thereby, the government has further misrepresented my position in a way that is quite unconscionable.However, if Bronwynomics means that we get a fair go for ordinary Australians, jobs for Australians and some hope for the long-term unemployed, and that we see some decent regional development, then I am happy to live with that term.","N/A","PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[16]/speech/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator KEMP","WW4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A","727","—I rise to support Senator Shorts motion in which he draws the Senates attention to the attacks that the Keating Government has made on a number of important Australian national symbols and significant institutions. Symbols are important to a nation; they remind citizens of their traditions and history; they become the focus for expressions of loyalty; and they help build national unity. In times of crisis symbols such as the flag can become important rallying points.Symbols, therefore, acquire a deep meaning and can arouse considerable emotion. Who could not have been moved when, some 12 months ago, the Vietnam veterans marched in the streets and 512 flags were carried by those old soldiers? Who could not have been moved to see the Australian flag being the symbol of their feelings towards their nation and their commemoration of their colleagues?When the prime minister of a nation attacks the nations symbols and central institutions—one central institution that is being attacked in this country is the constitutional monarchy—it inevitably becomes a matter of serious national concern. This, not surprisingly, can lead to widespread bitterness and division.I think it is true to say that the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, has made a habit of savagely attacking many of the cherished national symbols and institutions of this country. I believe that this attack is not based on nationalistic sentiment, but on his detestation of many aspects of Australias history and life.We have only to look at the current list of symbols that are coming under sustained attack from this government. Of course, the flag is regularly in the firing line. The Constitution is also in the firing line. It seems that we can barely have a celebration—whether it be the Bicentenary or Australia Day—without the so-called guilt industry and its cohorts in the government making some bitter observation. Just two weeks ago we celebrated Australia Day. But the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, did not; instead he issued a press release which claimed that Australia Day being held on 26 January is unlikely to be supported by a majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Of course, he presented no evidence to support this; nevertheless, on this important national day a senior minister came out and attacked us.I regret to say that even Christmas is sometimes in the firing line. We recently had a debate in this chamber where Senator McGauran raised the issue of child-care guidelines. Senator Crowley—who is in the chamber and who may wish to join in this debate—has put out guidelines which discourage Christmas carols in child-care centres because they are, to quote the guidelines, `culturally insensitive.A week or so ago the Victorian Government announced that the flag will be raised and the national anthem will be sung in Victorias schools each week. I would have thought that that was not a highly controversial issue. A government minister—not Mr Tickner this time, but the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Mr Free—apparently does not like the Australian flag. Mr Tickner does not like Australia Day, and Mr Free does not like the Australian flag being raised. Mr Frees office attacked the Australian flag—our flag for more than 90 years—as being British derived.Senator Short raises the question of the oath in his motion. We are arguably the worlds oldest democracy. The liberties of this country have flourished; Australian citizens have grown in prosperity; and the great Australian values of tolerance and equity have also grown over the last 90 years within this system. This system of government has served us well. Nevertheless, apparently we have to change the oath to fit in with the republican agenda. Mr Keating and his colleagues will find it difficult to bring in this republic. They cannot even tell us what sort of republic they want, but as soon as they do tell us, the republican movement will become hugely divided and fighting will break out amongst its members.But I believe there is something strange going on here. When the Prime Minister travels overseas he attacks our constitution in neighbouring countries—countries whose own democratic traditions are not all that strong. When he is overseas, the Prime Minister mocks our national flag. I do not believe Senator Spindler would support that behaviour by the nations Prime Minister. So there is something strange going on in this country, and it is something that I think needs to be debated. This is why I welcome Senator Shorts motion.I would like to focus on an institution in this nation that I and so many Australians cherish. I refer to the magnificent role of the Christian churches in Australian society. There is no doubt that so many Australian values reflect the western tradition and the Christian values which have been passed down from our forebears. Most Australians describe themselves in public opinion polls as Christian. I, like many Australians, went to the Remembrance Day service on 11 November for the committal of the unknown soldier. It was a very moving service, and there would be few Australians who did not feel a surge of emotion on that day. The mounted horse helping to escort the coffin, and the soldiers and women in the service dress of the First World War, painted a very dramatic, emotional picture.I had one concern about the service: it surprised me and others that in the prayers on this occasion there was no mention of Christ. In that sense it was not a Christian service. In my understanding of the military traditions, Christian services are very common, and even when the denomination of a soldier is not known, he is given a Christian burial. Some 90 per cent of soldiers in the First World War, I suspect, would have described themselves as Christian. I was, therefore, surprised, in the devising of the prayers for this occasion, the word `Christ was not mentioned. At the time I was not aware whether it was an oversight or a deliberate decision. In order to check this matter I wrote to Senator Faulkner, and I received a reply. I will not read his letter out in full but he said, among other things, that the religious component for the ceremony was carefully considered by the memorials council and the directing group responsible for the oversight of the entire project. Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to incorporate Senator Faulkners letter in Hansard . It is not a long letter.Leave granted.The letter read as follows —11 January 1994Senator Rod KempSenator for VictoriaPO Box 556MOONEE PONDS VIC 3039Dear Senator KempThank you for your letter of 22 November 1993 concerning the prayers spoken at the Funeral Service for the Unknown Australian Soldier.The religious component for the ceremony was carefully considered by the Memorials Council and by the Directing Group responsible for the oversight of the entire project.The Soldiers identity and of course his religious beliefs are unknown. It is therefore appropriate that the Funeral Service was one with which all denominations and religions could feel comfortable.The Australian Defence Force Service principal chaplains were nominated by the Directing Group to represent all religious groups in devising the prayers for the funeral. The principal chaplains sought the advice of the Religious Advisory Committee to the Services which is composed of eminent churchmen. I am sure that the principal chaplains carefully considered the appropriateness of any references to Christ in the prayers.The Council also considered the question of the words which might be said during the committal of the coffin to the Tomb. They were firmly of the opinion that words devised by Rabbi Apple, a member of the Religious Advisory Committee to the Services, which allowed Australians of all beliefs, Christian, non-Christian or secular, to pray or think about the Unknown Soldier according to their own religious forms or convictions, were most appropriate for the occasion. It was felt that these words reflected a sense that Australians, no matter what their individual forms of belief or worship, share a common sense of the spiritual. These words, followed by a pause for silent prayer, acted as the preamble to the Prayer of Committal.Enclosed is a copy of the Order of Ceremony, which includes the prayers, which may be of interest to you and your constituent.Yours sincerelyJOHN FAULKNER","N/A","CITIZENSHIP","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[1]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator KEMP","WW4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A","727","— In Senator Faulkners letter, I draw attention to these words:The principal chaplains sought the advice of the Religious Advisory Committee to the Services—that is called the RACS—which is composed of eminent churchmen. I am sure that the principal chaplains carefully considered the appropriateness of any references to Christ in the prayers.I took from that particular statement that the Religious Advisory Committee to the Services had been consulted. I interpreted from that that it had agreed to the form of service. I have since heard, however, that that statement in Senator Faulkners letter was most misleading. I have a copy of a motion unanimously passed by the Religious Advisory Committee to the Services at a meeting in December 1993, after the Remembrance Day service. Among other things, committee members congratulate the Australian War Memorial on the impressiveness of the service. In the second part of their motion they record their surprise and disappointment that the advice tendered by the RACS in connection with the form of the service was largely rejected by the Council of the War Memorial. They deplored—and I quote:the decision to omit any explicit Christian terminology from the prayers which the Christian Principal Chaplains were required to offer, thus causing offence to many Christians, failing to recognise that most Australians profess the Christian faith. . .The motion states that the decision by the Council of the War Memorial constituted a form of discrimination by omission.Another section of the motion records its strong protest—and I quote:at the exclusion of a Jewish representative from the officiants at the ceremony, bearing in mind that Jewish as well as Christian troops and chaplains served in the First AIF, that the Commander in Chief of the First AIF was Jewish. . .Arguably Australias greatest soldier, Sir John Monash, belonged to the Jewish faith, and was very proud to belong to it. The motion continued:. . .it is customary on such occasions of commemoration for Jewish and other non-Christian representatives to take part.We are a multicultural society, and I would have thought that we should have reflected the diversity of that society by recognising there are within the Christian church a number of denominations and to recognise there are people of non-Christian faith. It is appropriate on such an occasion that those denominations, and a rabbi from the Jewish faith, be represented officially. I would have thought that at least one prayer offered would have been seen to be a Christian prayer, but that was not the case.If we are going to be a multicultural society, let us recognise the diversity and try not to get to a common denominator all the time. Let us recognise that this country does have diversity and that there are, above all, a lot of people in this country who are Christian. If that diversity is recognised, surely, in the prayers that were offered on this very solemn and significant occasion, it would have been appropriate to have a prayer which could be seen to be a Christian prayer.I am advised it could not be done officially, which surprised me, and I hope it will be explained further to the chamber by Senator Faulkner. I do know that one of the bishops—and perhaps others—offered a silent Christian prayer as he followed the official party into the place of burial.It is significant that such a decision was made. I am sorry that Senator Faulkners letter to me did not give a full explanation for what had happened. In fact, I fear—and I would like to hear Senator Faulkners views on this—the way the letter was drafted was deliberately designed to give me the impression that the services were very comfortable with the arrangements, when in fact the Religious Advisory Committee to the Services was extremely unhappy about it and took the step of sending a motion to the relevant people at the Council of the War Memorial.I am comfortable with a multicultural society. My wife is French, of Jewish origin, and I profess the Christian faith. I have no difficulties with diversity, but what I do not like is the attempt by people who constantly talk about diversity to avoid recognising this diversity. It would have been interesting if Senator Crowley in her guidelines had said, `Ensure that where children of the Christian faith are in the centres Christmas carols are played. That would have been a proper recognition of diversity, but instead we have the reverse. I regret this seems to be a trend developing in our community.I would like Senator Faulkner to look again at the letter he sent me and at the motion that was passed. It is possible he was not aware of that motion, and I accept that. I would have no evidence that the government gave this ruling or influenced this decision, but I would like Senator Faulkners—Senator Crowley interjecting —","N/A","CITIZENSHIP","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[1]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator KEMP","WW4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A","727","—Senator Crowley can get up to explain what she means, but let me explain clearly to her and her government exactly what I mean: I think it is appropriate on such occasions to recognise the diversity of Australia. On this occasion, I would have preferred that we recognised the role of the Christian church in the services and the great work that it has done. I would have welcomed the active participation of very senior clerics in that service. I am aware that principal chaplains were involved, but I would like to have seen them there as representatives of the Catholic church, the Anglican church and the Protestant church. I would have welcomed the active participation of a Jewish rabbi because, above all, many of the servicemen in the First World War were Jewish, and we have mentioned the great role that Sir John Monash played.We had a similar debate about the nature of the prayers that should have been offered when this Parliament House was opened. In the case of Remembrance Day, I would have thought it would have been sensible for the relevant people to say, `We have made this decision, we believe it is right for the following reasons and we stand behind it. But that was not done and the service was conducted. A number of queries from people followed. We know that the Religious Advisory Committee to the Services was very upset about it. We know that Professor Blainey drew attention to the fact that a Christian prayer was not offered at this service.I point out to those opposite that, if people wish to make such decisions, they should come out and defend them. When people like me write a letter to Senator Faulkner, let it be stated clearly exactly what happened and why it was done. People should stand behind the decisions they make. Then we can have a proper debate to see whether that is what the community wants.I put it to Senator Crowley that the community is a diverse one, that it welcomes diversity and that it would be quite comfortable with a service which recognised that particular diversity. I felt that aspects of the prayers that were offered—I am expressing my personal opinion—were very well done. I felt other aspects simply did not touch any particular feelings that I had. As I said, on reflection I was surprised that at this service it was not considered appropriate to mention Christ in the prayers.I look forward to hearing from Senator Faulkner a fuller reason why that decision was made. I hope that he can explain why he mentioned in his letter the fact that the Religious Advisory Committee to the Services was consulted but failed to mention that it was extremely unhappy about the service.I am one who is very proud of this country. I regard myself as a nationalist. I regard myself as someone who treasures the achievements of this country and recognises Australia for its great virtues. Indeed, I am quite prepared to recognise that, under current values, we would not approve everything that has happened in our history. I want a society which can address those sorts of problems. But I am also one who is getting a little fed up by this governments constant attack on the institutions in this country. I am getting tired of the fact that every time we have Australia Day or discuss the flag or the oath of allegiance, this government starts to play around and complain about aspects of these things.I hope the government did not make this decision on Remembrance Day. As I said to Senator Crowley—this seemed to get her very upset—I have no evidence that Senator Faulkner or the government issued guidelines at all. All I would say is that I believe that those who made the decisions made the wrong ones. If they did make those decisions, I would like to see a full explanation as to why they decided to reject the advice of the Religious Advisory Committee to the Services.I think this issue about national symbols and institutions is part of a wider debate about what Australia will be like, how Australia will develop in the future. The Labor Party has broken with its own traditions. How many traditions has the Labor Party broken with during the Keating-Hawke years? We all welcome some of them, such as the dumping of its socialist philosophy after promoting it for some 83 years or so. It dropped that; it got the main game wrong, as indeed it so often gets the main game wrong. The Labor Party got the main game wrong on federation. The labour movement was generally opposed to federation; it was generally comfortable with the states remaining as they were. The Labor Party had a philosophy which even it acknowledges was one that would have produced results to the detriment of the Australian people.I believe that the Labor Party has got the main game wrong in quite a few areas. In relation to its desire for huge constitutional reform, the Labor Party has got it wrong again. This is a valid debate. I believe the Labor Party gets it wrong when it attacks the history and traditions of this country. I support the Labor Party when it draws attention to things which we should correct. But when it gratuitously attacks the history, the institutions and the symbols of this country, I believe that the Labor Party is totally out of touch with the sentiments of the Australian people.It is with great pleasure that I support Senator Shorts motion. It is an important one, and I look forward to hearing some response from a Labor member of parliament. If Senator Faulkner is listening, I ask him to come into the chamber to explain precisely why that decision was made.","N/A","CITIZENSHIP","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[1]/talk.start[5]/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator SPINDLER","0X4","(Victoria)","AD","N/A","731","—I rise briefly to speak on Senator Shorts motion. I do not support Senator Short in respect of most of the sentiments that are expressed in his motion. In fact, I wish to put on record the Australian Democrats support for the new oath of allegiance, which states:From this time forward, under God,I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.I believe that this oath of allegiance and its companion affirmation of allegiance is a noble statement. The Democrats supported it when it was passed by this chamber. I believe that Senator Shorts expression of regret that it was not going to be reviewed yet again in the review of the Australian Citizenship Act is misplaced. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs examined all the issues. Senator Short was present at most of the public hearings. We have had a good debate on this issue.I believe we should now move ahead. That is the basic sentiment that I would like to express. We should not get stuck in the past; we should not be held back by our history. I think our history is important; it is part of our culture. Our symbols are important. But with an oath of allegiance that we ask new citizens to this country to take, we should not be sidetracked by suggesting that they should pledge allegiance to a constitutional form. It should be to the substance; it should be to this country—to Australia.In contrast to most honourable senators who were lucky enough to be born in this country, I express those sentiments as one who chose to come to this country and to become a citizen of Australia and take this oath of allegiance—not in its current form; in its previous form. It was in 1952 that I took the oath of allegiance, some 2 1/2 years after I came to this country and decided that I wanted to make it my country, that I wanted it to be the country where I raised my family, where I wanted to be a loyal citizen and where I wanted my children to be citizens. I found it somewhat irrational that I was asked to swear allegiance to a queen who was not a part of this countrys everyday life. I believe that we must now recognise that the Queen will not be part of this countrys future, certainly not as its monarch.Therefore, I think that it is time we left historical relics behind us and moved ahead. It is time we thought about the future of this country in its substance and adjusted the symbols and the forms we are using to that substance. I express no view on what our flag should be. In fact, the Democrats are on record as saying that the flag should not be changed unless we have a referendum or a plebiscite of some sort so that the citizens of Australia can express a view and make their choice.As I said, the Australian Democrats supported the introduction of this new pledge. I was able to get the government to accept some amendments to the preamble which emphasised the obligations of citizenship as well as the rights. Also, the minister agreed to my suggestion that the preamble should be read out at each citizenship ceremony and that the certificates that citizens receive should include not only the oath of allegiance but also the preamble which I believe, in very clear and poetic words, expresses the rights and obligations of Australian citizenship which we all treasure.","N/A","CITIZENSHIP","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator MacGIBBON","YH4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A","732","—I have much pleasure in supporting the motion before the chair moved by Senator Short condemning the government for its divisive approach to Australias national symbols. I would like to deal briefly with the contribution we have just had from Senator Spindler of the Australian Democrats.I have always had the view that senators were entitled to speak their minds in this place, and I do not criticise Senator Spindler for having views that are different from my own. But there are two points I want to comment on. The first one is his claim that Australia in some way is held back by our history. Nothing could be further from the truth. In this country we have an enormous amount to be proud of. Our achievements in national development, I believe, stand second to no other country. Yet we hear from Senator Spindler that Australia should not be held back by our history.We should be proud of our history and, as the current generation, we should seek to emulate the achievements of the past. I can understand that Senator Spindler has a biased view of history if he takes his view of it from what appears on the ABC, and all those bowdlerised versions of docudramas where those in the new class write what they imagine happened in the past and interpret Australia through false sociological eyes. I can understand it if he listens to or reads the works of people like Manning Clark.But that is not what Australia is about. Australia does have a very proud history, and that history was one of achievement. I am very distressed that Australia has changed in my lifetime from a `can do society where people went off and did things for themselves and for the benefit of the community, into a society nurtured by the ALP, the Democrats and similar fringe groups where the belief is taught to kids in school that they have to rely on the government if they want anything done for them. If they want it done honestly, ethically, ecologically correct or politically correct, get the government to do it—the negation of the ability of the individual—and it was through the individual that this nation was built.It is also sad that Senator Spindler does not understand the legal and constitutional basis on which this country was founded. I do not intend to embark upon a lecture on constitutional law for Senator Spindler because I do not wish to spend the time.One of our great national symbols that I want to talk about for a few minutes is the veterans of this country. Senator Kemp spoke about the ceremony on Remembrance Day last year when the tomb of the unknown Australian soldier was consecrated at the War Memorial. We owe a great deal to the veterans of this country. They are one of our great national symbols. When this country went to war in 1914 the government of the day made certain promises to those who enlisted. One promise was, `We will look after you if you are injured and, if you are killed, we will look after your descendants. In that was the genesis of the first of the repatriation acts which, in the 80-odd years since the first bill was passed, have been developed and expanded into a very comprehensive service, currently administered under the Veterans Entitlements Act.It is proper that we honour and respect not only the letter of the law but also the spirit of the promise that the country made to those veterans at the time. Those people volunteered to lay down their lives for their country. They could not possibly have made a bigger sacrifice than that. Of course, their successors today are the members of the Australian Defence Force, the men and women who wear the uniform of this country.Despite the views of the government and various other people, they are not just Australian citizens doing a job that is a branch of the Public Service; they are special people filling a unique role. Their uniqueness comes from the fact that they literally die on orders. No member of the Public Service, least of all any member of this parliament, dies on orders when his leader tells him to do that. So they deserve a special place in the consciousness of this country. I would argue that veterans are very much part of Australian history and Australian culture, and it is up to this parliament to honour the undertakings that it made in years past.A point of great concern to me was the answer that Senator Faulkner gave at question time today to a question I asked yesterday as to how many veterans have had their service or disability pension suspended or cancelled for failure to provide a tax file number. He came back today with the answer that there were 125 veterans.I do not know the details of all those 125 veterans who have had their pensions cancelled or withdrawn for not providing a tax file number, but I do know some of them, and I know one in particular. In that case I find it absolutely indefensible that the Department of Veterans Affairs has withdrawn that persons pension. Even if there is only one case where there has been an unjust action, it is one case too many.As part of the compensation payments for war service, governments of all persuasions in Australia have instituted two pensions for veterans. One is the service pension, which is similar to, and in many ways exactly the same as, the age pension. The only difference is that it is paid five years earlier, at age 60, to a veteran, instead of age 65, in compensation for the reduction in his or her earning capacity through life as a consequence of war service. Like the age pension, it is income and assets tested.There is another pension known as the disability pension. This is paid in compensation for a reduction in the ability of veterans to live a normal life. They may be damaged psychologically or physically. They might have arthritis or have lost a limb or several limbs. They might be crippled to any degree. A disability pension is paid to veterans as compensation for the physical or mental limitation in enjoying life as a consequence of their war service. Because of that, it is different from the service pension, and it is not income or assets tested. It needs no imagination to see that there is a difference between these two pensions.I turn to the tax file number. The tax file number legislation was passed through this parliament with the primary purpose of preventing fraud and preventing people making unjustified or multiple claims against the Commonwealth for pensions or benefits of some sort, or rewards in some way or other. It was also introduced to make sure that people paid their taxes. In essence, it was designed to prevent fraud. How can we have fraud in relation to a disability pension? How is it possible to measure someones physical or mental disabilities and equate that with fraud? Remember, these disabilities come from war service and the fact that someone cannot enjoy life the way we can. A disability pension is paid, since it is not means tested, not only to paupers but also to millionaires. It is even paid to criminals in jail. A service pension is not paid to those in jail, nor am I aware of any other pension being paid. But a disability pension, because of the reason for its existence, is paid to rich and poor alike, irrespective of whether someone is in jail, convicted of fraud, or anything else.The case in question that I am very concerned about is that of an Australian veteran who served 5 1/2 years in the Second World War. He saw active service and had an outstanding war record. He was severely and permanently injured as a consequence of that—","N/A","CITIZENSHIP","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[3]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator MacGIBBON","YH4","(Queensland)","LP","N/A","732","—Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President. At the outset of my speech in this debate I said that I was speaking to clause (a) of notice 73. The particular part I am talking to is the condemnation of the government for its divisive approach to Australias national symbols. I defined quite clearly and without challenge at the time that I regard the veterans of Australia as part of our national symbols.This veteran whose case I am raising could have qualified as a TPI 40 years ago, but he is an independently minded, rugged individual. He battled on and made his own way. He received a disability pension many years ago. He is a self-funded retiree. He is in receipt of absolutely no pension or benefit from the Commonwealth. As a matter of principle, he refused to give his tax file number because he said, `There is no basis to relate my tax file number to a disability pension. I am not in receipt of any benefit from the Commonwealth at all apart from this. I have given them a statutory declaration. I have even given them a declaration from one of the managers of the Department of Social Security that I have not now, or ever, received a benefit. Yet this man had his disability pension withdrawn 12 months ago.He has protested in vain in the past 12 months, and no-one in the Department of Veterans Affairs has been prepared to enter the lists on his behalf and say that he has a case. I believe there has been a great miscarriage of justice to one of our national symbols. I am very concerned that the minister has not seen fit to exercise discretionary powers to grant him a pension. My reading of the tax file number legislation indicates that the minister and his officers in the department have the power to grant a waiver of a tax file number in this case, and it has just not been done. This is a matter of great concern. The man is entitled to a pension without doubt. He was paid one but it was withdrawn a year ago. This pension should be paid irrespective of whether he provides a tax file number or not. It is paid to the rich and poor alike; it is paid to people in jail.The really galling part about it is that if he lives long enough—another two or three years—he will reach the age of 80. Under the tax file number legislation, no-one aged 80 or over has to provide a tax file number. I have instanced this case to support the motion of Senator Short and Senator Kemp which is before the Senate. I believe that this government is not supporting the national symbols that made this country great. I call upon it to do so.","N/A","CITIZENSHIP","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator SHERRY","ZW4","(Tasmania-","ALP","Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy)","735","—I intend to make some comments about the motion before the Senate, unlike most of the contribution which we have just heard. Really, if government senators were seriously to advance in this House that the trade unions were a national symbol of Australia and talk about various aspects of industrial relations, I am sure those opposite would get up and argue that it was not a relevant contribution. Whilst I do sympathise with the case that Senator MacGibbon has outlined, there is a time and place for it. It certainly was not the time and place in respect of the motion that has been moved by his own colleagues on this matter.I listened to the contribution of Senator Spindler, and I acknowledge and thank him for the role he played in the debate and in the formulation of the pledge of allegiance and the various requirements for it when read out. Unlike Senator MacGibbon, I did not hear Senator Spindler say words to the effect that Australia had been held back by our history. Senator MacGibbon said that it was through the individual that this nation was built. I suppose it depends on an individuals perspective at a particular time. Aboriginals are certainly individuals in this nation, but I do not think they were particularly part of it when it was being built.Individuals who were transported from Europe, often for no good reason, certainly contributed to this countrys future. When talking about individuals, we should reflect upon those individuals who contributed in a way which has not been given due recognition in the past.This year I attended two Australia Day ceremonies where I watched the reaction of the audience and the participants when the new oath and affirmation of allegiance were read out as required for new citizens. The particular area of Tasmania where I live is regarded as having a conservative approach to these sorts of issues. The council official who read out the oath of allegiance was a particularly conservative gentleman, and I do not criticise him for that—that is his view and that of the community in which I was present on that day.I was very pleased that the fine preamble was read out—Senator Spindler has commented on this—because it did cause everyone in the audience to sit and reflect on it and the oath that followed. After the ceremony, I spoke to members of the audience and to the new Australians who had taken the oath of allegiance. They were particularly pleased because they saw the new oath and affirmation as being more relevant to modern-day Australia than the old oath of allegiance which, for those of us who have forgotten it—I certainly have—I am glad to say has been confined to the dustbin of history. The old oath states:I swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian Citizen.I am particularly pleased that the new oath of allegiance has been updated to bear much more relevance to modern-day circumstances in Australia. In the words of one of the speakers at the Australia Day ceremony, it makes us think a great deal more about not what we can do simply for ourselves, but what we can do for our country. During the Australia Day ceremony, I was particularly pleased and moved when I first heard the new oath given in public.Interestingly, whenever this government tackles what can be described as difficult issues, the opposition alleges the government is divisive. Whenever the government tackles the big issues that need to be tackled, the opposition uses the throwaway line that the government is divisive. We could make the same accusation of the opposition in respect of Fightback. The opposition might argue that Fightback had substantial community support, and it did—it did not have majority community support as it turned out—but it was certainly divisive. But we did not advance that argument against Fightback. We fought Fightback on what we saw as the merits of the argument. The opposition certainly disagreed with our views and the Australian public cast its decision at the last election.We do not go around with this trite nonsense about things being divisive. Really, the opposition will have to grow up because elections are determined by 50 per cent plus one. Elections are determined by governments being seen to tackle issues in a genuine and honest way—not by this nonsense about being divisive. If those opposite want to continue to kid themselves by branding the governments determination to tackle issues as divisive, it will not help them when it comes to the next election—it did not help them in the last one.The new oath and affirmation of allegiance was referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The committee received 20 submissions and held a number of public hearings.","N/A","CITIZENSHIP","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

Four councils have expressed some concerns about the legality of the new pledge and that matter has been taken up with the Attorney-Generals Department.Since the new pledge has been introduced there has been no decrease in the number of new applicants for citizenship. It is clearly not an impediment to potential new citizens taking out citizenship in Australia.

All sorts of throwaway phrases like that were used in the debate.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator SHORT","DJ4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A","737","—Senator Sherry can read it in Hansard . It will make good reading. Senator Sherry might learn something from it. He made a fundamental error, I hope not deliberately. He was highly misleading in saying that there had been just an updating of the oath of allegiance. That is not the case. The fact is that the oath of allegiance to the head of state, and through the head of state to our basic institutions—and in particular to the cornerstone of our federal and parliamentary system, namely, the constitution—has been completely abolished. It has been replaced with a wishy-washy, so-called pledge. Those opposite should have been up front and stated that there would not be any oath or statement of allegiance; there is just going to be a thing called a pledge—whatever a pledge means—which deletes all reference to the head of state in our nation.The simple reason that why it was done last year by the government is that it is its agenda to institute a republic in this country. Our objection to the abolition of the oath of allegiance is that so long as the Queen remains the head of state of Australia, new citizens ought to be swearing allegiance to that head of state—the Queen. Until such time as our arrangements may change—one day we may become a republic; I hope we do not, but we may—we should not look at making changes to the fundamental oath and allegiance stated by new citizens.The net result of what the government has done has been to create yet another major division within Australian communities and society. The reason the coalition has moved its motion—we are about to end the debate on it—is that whether or not the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his government like it, a nations symbols and institutions are of fundamental importance to its stability, good government and sovereign independence; and the well-being of its people.To make changes to the basic institutions and symbols requires very careful, evolutionary, fully consultative, inclusive consideration. This government, time and again, has pursued policies of exclusion. A small group of people basically within the cabal of government is making decisions and foisting them on the Australian people, hoping it will be able to prevent division. It runs the risk of rendering asunder the stability and good order of this government.The approach of the coalition is not, as Senator Sherry and other honourable senators opposite would have us believe, reactionary. It is a very positive and progressive approach. It is saying that at the end of the day we will get a better result; a more inclusive result. We will bring the Australian people with us if we consult them and follow the proper processes of consideration of changes.Our symbols and institutions are of fundamental importance to our society, to good governance and to the independence of our nation. It is absolutely hypocritical for the government and the Prime Minister in particular to be running around talking about a lack of independence on Australias part, when at the same time they are instituting economic and social policies that strike very much at the core of that independence.So for those reasons—and I will not reiterate all the additional reasons—we have been prompted to move this motion. Senator Kemp spoke so eloquently on it today. Senator MacGibbon stretched his licence a bit, but he raised some very important issues. I congratulate him on his initiative and creativity in bringing them in as part of the debate.We should all ponder and consider very closely Senator Kemps contribution in relation to the prayers that were offered at the service for remembrance of the unknown soldier last year because our society is still fundamentally and overwhelmingly Christian; we are a Judaeo-Christian nation. To delete all reference to the Judaeo-Christian concept that underpins so much of our nation, despite the changes that are occurring, is a very, corrosive element and runs some very severe risks in the way it is done.I hope very much that the Australian Democrats and the Greens will also support the motion before the chair. I do not hold my breath on that, but I do urge those who think very seriously about Australias national symbols and institutions to look very carefully, when they vote, at what this motion is seeking to do. I have high hopes that, if they think about that carefully and sensibly, the motion will be passed.Question put:That the motion ( Senator Shorts ) be agreed to.","N/A","CITIZENSHIP","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/speech[5]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator ELLISON","9X5","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A","739","—On behalf of Senator Campbell, I move:That the Senate—(a)condemns the disgraceful intervention in land management decisions by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) when, on 4 February 1994, he issued an order that will halt the development of a crocodile farm at Broome in Western Australia, that development having undergone no less than 4 years of environmental, local government and aboriginal heritage approval processes and having the support of local aboriginal groups who would specifically benefit from the employment opportunities;(b)calls on the Minister to immediately withdraw his order and leave land use decisions to State and local authorities and the communities they serve; and(c)expresses its fear that the Ministers actions are but a first taste of the Federal Governments intentions to use their national land rights scheme to destroy economic development in Western Australia at the cost of the living standards and opportunities for aborigines living in remote areas.I think at the outset it is worthwhile to look at the history of this matter, which is quite involved. In July 1987, a gentleman by the name of Malcolm Douglas expressed an interest in the lease for a crocodile farm in Broome. The venture was to process the crocodile meat and skins for export as well as to provide a tourist attraction. Furthermore, there was also to be a facility for research into crocodiles and a facility to accommodate any rogue animals.In that area and in the northern parts generally of Australia from time to time there has been trouble with crocodiles that have attacked human beings—in fact killed them on the odd occasions. The policy is not to shoot them but to find some sort of refuge for them. This venture was to provide such a refuge for crocodiles.At that time, the Yawuru Aboriginal Corporation had not been formed. Notwithstanding this, Malcolm Douglas made contact with local Aborigines, whom he knew. I think it is worthwhile to note that Mr Douglas himself has spent a good deal of time in the north of Australia and has been involved with the crocodile industry for the last 10 years. Mr Douglas has spent most of his life living with Aboriginal people and one of his best friends is a tribal elder. In fact, Mr Douglas has made films about Aboriginal culture, which are now in the national archives in Canberra. He is a gentleman who is well versed in living in the north of this country and well associated with Aboriginal people.In any event, in 1987 Mr Douglas expressed an interest in the lease and, during the ensuing two years, there were extended negotiations with local government and local Aborigines. At that stage the Yawuru Aboriginal Corporation had not been formed.In 1990, discussions were engaged with the Environmental Protection Authority and a site inspection took place with shire councillors and tribal elders. In fact, Paddy Roe, a spokesman for the local Aboriginal group, attended the inspection and went around the property with Mr Douglas. He indicated that at that time he could not see any problems at all in relation to sacred sites. Discussions and negotiations continued.In 1991 a consultative environmental review took place. At that stage, the chairman of the Yawuru Aboriginal Corporation gave his consent to the proposed venture. The corporation had in the meantime been formed and his consent was given to the venture on the basis that the Yawuru people be consulted from time to time.In June 1992 an agreement was signed between the chairperson of the Yawuru Aboriginal Corporation and Mr Douglas for the development of a crocodile farm. At the time, the Labor government gave its consent to the development on the basis that there be consent forthcoming from the corporation. At that time, the minister responsible for museum sites issued a section 18 certificate under the appropriate legislation. In 1992, the consultative environmental report was released and the matter proceeded.At that stage, Mr Douglas could be forgiven for thinking that the development of his crocodile farm was well on its way and there was no impediment to its development. At that stage he could well be forgiven for thinking that there was no opposition to it in an environmental sense or from local Aborigines. But in December 1992 the Kimberley Land Council commissioned a report from a Canadian to assess the matter. He maintained that there was a sacred site involved and there was a reconsideration of the matter. As a result of that, the consent of the minister was revoked. That was just prior to the state election early last year.After further negotiations and consultations with the various departments, in July 1993 the consent was granted by the new Liberal government of Western Australia. That consent was granted on the basis that a certain area be excised from the lease, because at that stage there was a track for initiates to go to another area where certain secret ceremonies would take place.During the last six months various actions have been brought in the Federal Court and Supreme Court respectively by the Yawuru corporation. In fact, the Kimberley Land Council has become involved, and it was at the request of the Kimberley Land Council that the federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) intervened and used his power under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act.Before I get to that matter, it is worthwhile to note that four attempts were made in the courts to seek injunctions against the development of this property and they all failed. In the latest decision in the Supreme Court of Western Australia, Mr Justice Owen stated:For these reasons I do not believe that the plaintiffs native title (assuming it to exist) is seriously at risk of irreparable injury. If an injunction is not granted and the defendants proceed to develop the area they do so with full knowledge of the plaintiffs claim and, I would assume, an understanding of the consequences should the plaintiffs succeed in obtaining final relief.What then is the real risk to the plaintiffs? As I have said, and with one possible exception, I am not convinced that the spiritual and cultural integrity of Yawuru is seriously at risk by an interference with what is a relatively small and discrete portion of the total area claimed.What he was saying there was that there was, as he saw it, no serious risk of irreparable injury or harm as such. He went on to discuss the initiates track that went alongside the leased area. He stated:One of the other difficulties alluded to by the plaintiffs was the need for secrecy in these ceremonies. It was submitted that the element of secrecy would be compromised by the initiates having to pass in close proximity to a crocodile park. There are three things to be said about this. The Lease abuts a major road and a minor road and is in an area that already has various forms of development. Secondly, I was told from the bar table without objection that the plans for the crocodile park require the construction of levy banks on the side facing the mangroves. These banks are to be vegetated. This will preserve some measure of privacy for persons passing along the fringes of the mangroves. Thirdly, p12 of the Mardiros Report—which is the Kimberley Land Council report that I mentioned—suggests that the rite of passage is carried out under the cover of darkness. For all these reasons I do not think that the issue of secrecy is sufficient to tip the balance.What Mr Justice Owen said was that, on the balance of interests, he found in favour of not granting the injunction against the development. Mr Justice Owen, a most erudite judge of the Supreme Court of Western Australia, readily acknowledged:I believe that there would be overwhelming support from the population generally for the proposition that Aboriginal culture should not be allowed to disappear. It is generally recognised that the ancient culture incorporates a spiritual closeness to the land.What I am saying to the Senate is that this was a very carefully considered judgment by a judge of the Supreme Court of Western Australia who was well seized of the issues which were before him. He approached it with a sensitivity and aforethought which I believe make his reasons compelling reading. Nonetheless, despite that injunction having been rejected by Mr Justice Owen, the federal minister chose to intervene. He intervened so that we now have a development placed at great risk.It is worth while remembering the purposes that are mentioned for which the land is required. They are enumerated by Mr Douglas as: first, for a commercial crocodile farm and research facility; second, for a tourism and education display; third, for an area where problem or rogue crocodiles from the wild can be relocated for breeding and display, which is in accordance with the CALM policy—the land management department; and, fourth, for a training facility for Aborigines who wish to develop their own crocodile farms, for example, the Pandanus community. It is a fact that a large percentage of the Kimberley Aborigines want the new crocodile farm for this purpose and for a place to relocate animals that threaten their communities.Mr Douglas has advised me personally that this venture entails the full-time employment of eight people and the employment of some 20-odd part-timers. It would be his intention to provide a training facility for local Aborigines. I put it to the Senate that he has approached this matter with a great deal of caution and aforethought. He could provide to the local community an income of some $500,000 per annum by way of export and he has told me personally that, in an effort to avoid such confrontation, he has tried to seek alternative venues.The availability of land in Broome is not great. In fact, for what he requires there is really only this particular lot. This block is important because it has brackish water which he can use; it has power; it is well positioned for tourism; and there are also banks sloping down to mangroves and to a marsh area, which are ideal for his farming. The minister has really overstepped the mark in his intervention and declaration which have held up this development for the next 30 days.Mr Douglas indicated to me that he was not consulted, that such a halt on his development could well place this development in financial jeopardy, and that he might have to find himself relocating the crocodile farm to the Northern Territory. That would be a great shame for the people of Broome—for both the Aboriginal community and the wider community. It would be a great shame for the reasons that I have pointed out in relation to the financial aspects and the other more community-minded aspects of this development.I do not believe the minister has acted in the best interests of the local Aboriginal community. I believe this is a blatant interference with the local land management by a local council and the state government concerned. It is an intervention which has no basis in merit. I put to the Senate that the recent Native Title Act in itself allowed for past acts, such as the grant of this lease, to stand. It allowed those acts to stand, but also allowed for the question of compensation to be sorted out. I put to the Senate that the federal minister has acted in contravention of the spirit of the very act which he fought so hard to introduce in December last year.This motion was framed with careful thought and I believe has great merit. In this instance the federal minister has behaved in an entirely inappropriate fashion and has abused his power under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. I commend the motion to the Senate.","N/A","CROCODILE FARM, BROOME","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator REYNOLDS","XI4","(Queensland)","ALP","N/A","742","—Before arguing the case on behalf of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), I take this opportunity to compliment Senator Ellison on his presentation. We have seen in this place, and indeed in other parliaments, that issues relating to Aboriginal land rights sometimes bring forth a style of confrontation and aggression in such a way that the arguments are lost because of the presentational style. As I found, when I served with Senator Ellison on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee that considered the Native Title Bill, his arguments are always clearly presented in a totally unemotional style. We need to see more of that style of presentation, not just in this place but also throughout parliaments in this country and in the community.We are debating Senator Campbells motion in relation to the Broome crocodile farm. I have some material to present on behalf of Minister Tickner, to whose activities this motion refers. Minister Tickner advises that he first received an application from the Kimberley Land Council, acting on behalf of the Aerie community, seeking protection under sections 9 and 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, with respect to a proposed crocodile farm in Broome in June 1993. Any argument or proposition that the minister could have been acting without due powers is clearly not the case.On 31 January 1994 this application was followed with an application for urgent protection of the area under section 9, together with an application under section 10. The applicant was concerned that the development of the farm would impact upon an area of land significant for the preservation of Aboriginal tradition and culture. The area of land concerned is vacant crown land over which the Western Australian government has purported to issue a lease and over which the local Aboriginal custodians have asserted a claim to native title.As a result of a breakdown in discussions with the Western Australian government and the Kimberley Land Council, acting on behalf of the Aboriginal custodians, and because construction activity commenced earlier in the week, on Friday, 4 December, Minister Tickner made a declaration, under section 9 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, to provide emergency protection to the area. In addition to issuing that declaration, he issued an invitation to the parties to seek a mediated resolution of the issue.As the honourable senator will be aware, in the native title legislation we focused on the importance of the mediation—reconciliation, if you like—of negotiated regional agreements. Although I have not been directly involved, I hope honourable senators who will be speaking in this debate can ensure that their parties take up Minister Tickners invitation for a round table mediation process.The minister can justify issuing the declaration on the basis of section 9 because it allows for declarations to be made which protect sites in the short term until there can be a mediation process to resolve the issues of obvious concern to all parties. In this case, the minister was satisfied that the site is significant to Aboriginal people and that it was under serious and immediate danger of injury or desecration. Such a declaration does not in any way interfere or prejudge any application that Aboriginal people may have made claiming native title to this area.The Native Title Act 1993 does not cover the protection of sacred or significant sites. This is a matter left to the existing laws, such as the Heritage Protection Act. This declaration does not cut across the jurisdiction of the Western Australian courts to determine issues of native title. The Heritage Protection Act is an act of last resort to be used when state and territory laws are not followed or are inadequate. The minister was satisfied that this was the case in this area. This declaration allows for Aboriginal interests in the development to be properly considered before any major interference with the site takes place.I come to the very specific areas of Senator Campbells motion. In response to paragraph (a), the minister advises that, although Mr Douglas has talked about his proposal for an extension to the present Broome crocodile park for some years, he did not pursue environmental approval under the processes established by the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority until 1992. He sought clearance under the processes of the Western Australian Aboriginal Heritage Act in 1991. However, because he ignored the advice of the Western Australian Aboriginal sites department—acting on a determination of the Aboriginal Cultural Materials Committee established under that act—as to the proper procedures for obtaining that clearance, the process was delayed for a considerable time.In December 1992 the Aboriginal Cultural Materials Committee determined that no development should proceed on the area without the consent of the Yawuru, the Aboriginal custodians for this area. The minister further advises that the local Aboriginal group is constituted by the Yawuru Aboriginal Corporation, acting on behalf of the Aboriginal custodians, and this group has consistently opposed development of this kind in this area. There is no evidence to suggest that there is any other group which represents custodians for this area. After considerable anthropological investigation of land ownership in the area, there is no suggestion that the Yawuru Aboriginal Corporation does not properly represent the custodians. There is certainly no evidence of any other group supporting this development as suggested in this section of the motion.In regard to paragraph (b), the declaration issued by the minister is an emergency declaration which expires in 30 days, giving time for the parties to attempt to resolve the matter by a process of mediation. From the way Senator Ellison addressed this debate, perhaps he could use his good offices, together with other Western Australian senators, to see if this mediation process cannot resolve the current impasse. The federal act is an act of last resort, and it is important.","N/A","CROCODILE FARM, BROOME","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/speech[2]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

We do not need to always assume that these issues can only be resolved in courts or tribunals. If people could only learn to sit down and talk to each other face to face, I am sure we would get a lot further.Finally, in relation to paragraph (c) of Senator Campbells motion, the minister advises that he has taken this action under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. This act has been in place for almost a decade. Action was taken only upon a proper consideration of the issues involved in protecting an Aboriginal area of significance. It is not an action taken under the provisions of the Native Title Act; nor has it any relevance to that act. However, if the Western Australian government, which issued a special purpose lease to Mr Douglas, had observed the procedures of the Native Title Act, this dispute may well have been avoided.","N/A","CROCODILE FARM, BROOME","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/speech[2]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

To forestall any question of relevance, I wish to indicate how the situation mentioned in paragraph (b) of the motion could be applied to Victoria.We can learn a great deal from this situation when we look at it from the national point of view. The usefulness of the Murray Island title has a limited application. It has not been proved valid, and it will be interesting to see what happens. In Victoria, Aboriginal traditions have been largely extinguished. There are no songs, no ceremonies and no continuous oral links within Aboriginal traditions to tie many of the Victorian tribes to the land. Indeed, the most modern or contemporary basis for looking at the way in which Aboriginal tribes in Victoria can be linked to the land is a map constructed of language groups by Ian Clark. This map was used by the Victorian government until 1992. It has been used to consult with Aboriginal groups on a contemporary basis.When we look at this particular map in conjunction with the Auslig map, it would be permissible to gather from it that all land inVictoria is now freehold. I seek leave to incorporate an Auslig Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land map which shows the actual proportion of freehold land in Victoria to be only 62.4 per cent.Leave granted.A summary of details of the map is as follows—SUMMARY OF AUSLIGS PUBLIC LAND.

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator TROETH","GX5","(Victoria)","LP","N/A","743","—The only land not claimable is freehold. On my calculations, this would leave something like 38 per cent of land able to be acted on by native title.Because there have been no test cases and the validity of this act has yet to be proved, this simply serves to underline the fact that there are many grey areas in this whole question. I feel that many of the questions that Senator Ellison has raised in respect to the area at Broome could equally be applied to many areas of Victoria. All the land is shown in the Auslig map as freehold. Some small parcels of land which will be subject to native title simply do not show up on a map of this scale.In rural and regional Victoria many areas which have been targeted as suitable for future development under the Kelty report can be, and no doubt will be, subject to native title claims. This will lead to economic uncertainty. Senator Reynolds pointed out that the perspective being given by the minister was a short-term one. When many businesses are choosing where they are going to locate they have to choose a short-term perspective because, if they cannot do anything in the medium to short term, they will simply move away and locate elsewhere—either elsewhere in Australia or offshore.Claimants to native title will have the right to exclude other persons from their land. I feel very strongly that this will work in a very negative manner when businesses are looking to locate their industries. Many of the small businesses in Victoria are on small parcels of land. Industries such as tourism and food technology are going to be located in regional areas such as the Latrobe Valley and the Goulburn Valley which the Kelty report nominated as suitable for development.The validity of the Native Title Act has yet to be determined by the High Court and until then uncertainty, delay and expense similar to that undergone by Mr Douglas will be undergone by many small businesses. It would be regrettable to see this situation repeated in thousands of small businesses across Australia. Yet, with the implications of this particular case as outlined by my colleague Senator Ellison, I fear that it will be so.","N/A","CROCODILE FARM, BROOME","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/speech[3]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not hold the view that states have got rights, but I strongly hold the view that people have got rights. The intervention by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, on this matter is an exercise in the protection of peoples rights. A group of people in Broome, Western Australia, have sought the assistance of the minister as a last resort to protect what they see as their rights. The minister has, quite properly, having regard to his right and obligation as a minister of the crown, exercised the powers conferred on him through legislation to put a stay of execution on that particular development in north-west Western Australia—a quite proper course of action.My colleague from Queensland Senator Reynolds earlier in the debate addressed some of the technical and legal points attached to the ministers decision in using the powers conferred on him under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act to stop, for the moment, if not for a longer period of time, the proposed development of a crocodile farm in Broome, Western Australia.I do not, unfortunately, have the full text of Senator Campbells motion in front of me. Rather than addressing the matter of whether this particular commercial development should or should not be allowed to go ahead, I would rather address the more important question—not that I am dismissive of the development application—of peoples rights in a democracy such as Australia.Reference has been made so far in the debate to the Native Title Bill which was exhaustively debated in this chamber at the end of last year, which was the International Year of Indigenous People.","N/A","CROCODILE FARM, BROOME","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/speech[4]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

He knows, I know and, more importantly, the community of Australia knows, there was a very well managed filibustering debate on that most important piece of legislation that went through the Senate. Those who were in this chamber witnessed the rotation of opposition senators as they came in to make their contributions to the debate. If we only scratched the surface in doing that, that was not the fault of those on this side of the chamber. Although it was filibustering, I agree there was quite a deal of very good debate that went on during the extended committee stage of that bill.That bill is important, not only for Aboriginal people but also for people in all parts of Australia, even though some people in some of the more remote states like Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory have been dismissive of it. It is an important bill, and further action will flow from it this year. I realise, Mr Acting Deputy President, I am perhaps straying from the essence and direct words contained in Senator Campbells motion that is before the chamber, but I have given the explanation that I want to address the wider question of the rights of people.Here we have a group of people—Aboriginal people, as it turns out—who are living in a distant part of Senator Panizzas and my home state. They have a view that the area in which this proposed development is going to take place is an area of importance to them—historic and, more importantly, cultural importance. They have sought, through the measures available to them within the legislation governing such things in Western Australia, to protect that area and they have not been successful.Despite the fact that we are a federation of states, which can be cumbersome from time to time, we are a nation. As citizens of the nation of Australia, they have every right to approach the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to ask him to exercise the powers conferred on him under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act to stop that proposal. It is not a permanent stop imposed by Mr Tickner. I understand it will last for 30 days. It is an interim measure which will be reviewed within the 30-day period. As with other applications and interim decisions made by previous ministers in this portfolio, it can be overturned down the line.What springs to my mind very quickly on this matter is the matter of the redevelopment of the Swan Brewery site, on the banks of the Swan River in Perth. Similar actions by a previous minister holding this portfolio put a stay on the development for a period of time. We all know that the redevelopment of the old Swan Brewery building has gone ahead and that resolution was reached as to whether or not it was a site of great importance to Aboriginal people. Not everybody in our community accepted that.","N/A","CROCODILE FARM, BROOME","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/speech[4]/talk.start[3]/para","N/A","N/A"

The reference made in the interjection was that the government in Western Australia, and perhaps even the government at the Commonwealth level, took action at the time to protect a Labor mate. I am not certain where the Labor mate fits in. I recall one demonstration that took place on that site which was extensively reported live on radio stations—I was in my electorate office at the time—by television stations that night and in the print media the next day. It was a counter demonstration in support of the development organised by my colleague the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Graeme Campbell. He assisted in bringing some Aboriginal people down to Perth to press the then Labor government in Western Australia to continue with the redevelopment of the site. Where the `Labor mate fits in, I am not entirely certain. Whether or not Mr Roberts is a Labor mate, I really cannot tell. If he is, fine, and if he is not, that is empty rhetoric on behalf of those opposite in this debate.The redevelopment did proceed. The outside of the building has now been completed; the refurbishment inside the building was due to start last Monday. I believe that redevelopment is continuing to go ahead with the support of the present Western Australian state government, which is not, of course, a Labor government.

That was later overturned in a very important development for the people of Perth and Western Australia. I use that as an example for what is currently happening in Broome in Western Australia to show that, whilst an exercise of ministerial power has been made, it does not necessarily mean that is the end of the story. Other measures are available to all parties involved in the current dispute in Broome. I was merely using that as an example rather than straying from the debate itself. As I said in my opening remarks, the important issue is peoples rights, and Minister Tickner would say he is exercising his powers to protect those rights.I will now finish my saga about the Swan Brewery redevelopment. I have made the point that the interior refurbishment of that building is going ahead with the support of the current Western Australian government, which is not a Labor government. Unfortunately for those on our side of the chamber, the Western Australian government is now under the stewardship of Premier Court. It is supportive of what is happening at the Swan building. I understand that Mr Roberts is still involved in its redevelopment. Is one to imply from that that Mr Roberts is now a Liberal mate? I will not do that because I do not engage in the empty rhetoric that sometimes emanates from the opposition benches.It is useful that matters such as this are addressed in this chamber. The issue itself is obviously of very great importance to the Aboriginal people in Broome and to the developer there. It is also of importance to the Western Australian state government. Of course, from our position as legislators at the Commonwealth level, it is important to us. It is good that the debate as been so measured and controlled so far. Senator Reynolds complimented Senator Ellison on his measured and thoughtful remarks and on the fact that he did not seek to generate any heat in this debate. I have tried to contain my remarks and reflect the tone of debate adopted by Senator Ellison.The only point I make in conclusion is that the exercise of ministerial power in this instance is not the end of the story. There are many other measures contained in the legislation which the developer, the Aboriginal people, the state government and the federal government can exercise in order to protect all interests in this matter. It has also given those concerned time in which to do so.","N/A","CROCODILE FARM, BROOME","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/speech[4]/talk.start[8]/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator PANIZZA","JI4","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A","748","—I listened carefully to what both Senator Reynolds and Senator McKiernan had to say on this matter. They gave some very good arguments in support of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and his actions. Unfortunately, I believe Minister Tickner was sold a pup and Senator Reynolds and Senator McKiernan have gone along with it. If the land concerned was the peoples traditional land, I would have listened to their argument. But the facts are that the claim on the crocodile farm near Broome in Western Australia is being brought by the Kimberley Land Council on behalf of the Yawuru group. However, according to Aboriginal traditions the crocodile farm lies within the territory attributed to the Djugun people and not the group that is making the application.The Djugun group is now deceased, but one senior Aboriginal lawman remains and he married a Djugun woman. In fact, this Djugun group died out over the years, but one woman, for the want of a better description, took off with a fellow from another tribe and moved away. But eventually they came back to take their punishment and that having happened, this fellow who married the Djugun woman was taught the traditions, songs, sites knowledge and ceremonies by the Djugun people. He has primary custodial responsibility for the Djugun territory, which includes the proposed crocodile farm. So the Yawuru group is certainly out of order in trying to lay a claim or in asking Minister Tickner to put things on hold for 28 days.This senior lawman was consulted by the relevant Western Australian government department five years ago and made it clear that there were no sacred sites in the area in question. Both Senator Reynolds and Senator McKiernan mentioned sacred sites, but the only one of the Djugun people who can speak for that piece of ground said that there were no sacred sites five years ago. And a Labor government, not a Liberal government, was in power at that time.In 1984, the Kimberley Land Council—KLC—commissioned and received a report by Maria Mann and Ian Kirkby which stated that the area in question was not Yawuru territory whatsoever. The report is a public document and a copy of it is held with the Crown Law Department of Western Australia. It is as simple as that.The area in question lies on what is locally known as the Broome marsh. Those who have not been to Broome will know that the area is surrounded by a lot of marsh country. In the 1950s and 1960s there existed a curfew under which Aboriginal people were not permitted within the Broome town site after 6.00 p.m. The Aboriginal people therefore used the marsh as a fringe camp. The proposed crocodile farm lies adjacent to the old fringe camp. A survey of the locality revealed no archaeological material. This is an area of only contemporary interest. Incidentally, that Broome marsh holds other things, such as the relic of a Catalina which was involved in the evacuation of people from Singapore. The aircraft crash-landed in the area and was never able to get out of the mud.A ceremonial site has been documented at One Mile Creek, or, to use the local name, Nillirr Ibanjin. Another site of some significance lies at Fishermans Bend at Broome. The Yawuru—in other words, the KLC in this case—contends that a dreaming track extends between these two localities. The alleged track crosses a tidal creek on the crocodile farm. The Western Australian government has sought to excise the alleged track, but this action would not suit the purpose of those supporting the Yawuru claim.In response, the Yawuru allege that the track moves with the tide. We are getting into a bit of fantasy land when it is said that the track moves with the tide, but that is what they say. The crocodile farm was originally an environmental issue with regard to the Broome marsh. Aboriginals put forward the concern that such an accumulation of crocodiles may lead to a situation where an escaping reptile may pose a threat to Aboriginal children. I say that it would pose a threat to more than Aboriginal children. However, in response the proponent of the crocodile farm then offered to construct substantial fencing to negate any such possible threat.Two years ago, there was a push by the Yawuru people for recognition. However, they needed a platform to do that. They did not have one, so they made this crocodile farm their platform to gain respectability. The crocodile farm became that platform despite Yawurus lack of Aboriginal proof, such as songs, ceremonies and sites knowledge. As I told honourable senators at the outset of my remarks, that land belonged to the Djugun people and the one lawman left there said that there is no-one else except him who can speak for it and that there is no sacred sites, and that lawman has full custodianship.The contemporary political clout of the Yawuru—in other words, the KLC—has overwhelmed the traditional custodial responsibilities of the Djugun territory. Of course, with the KLC backed by this government at every turn, it has been able to override the wishes of the people to whom, traditionally, the ground belongs. Why are the Yawuru people able to bring such pressure? For the benefit of you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and other Tasmanians, and the rest of the Senate, I will explain.To answer this question we must not forget that the head of the Kimberley Land Council is Peter Yu, a man of Yawuru descent, coincidentally. Another man claiming Yawuru descent is Pat Dodson, formerly director of the Central Land Council and more recently chairman of Mr Keatings reconciliation committee. So we can see where it all ties together. Where is the reconciliation in this case? One group has been pushed out and taken over by the KLC. But the KLC does not represent everyone in the Kimberley; it represents only half the people—about 2,000 out of 4,000. So we can see how these things are going down the track.In this case Mr Tickner simply overrode the state laws. Why? In my view, it was to repay some of the favours that the KLC delivered to Mr Tickner and this government so that they could say there was consensus on the Mabo legislation. Remember that the KLC represents only half the people. Yesterday I had at least three phone calls from the Utemurrah crowd emphasising that the KLC speaks for only half the people. The best message I can send to Mr Tickner is that he should do his homework before he jumps in with these 28-day reprieves. He should make sure that he knows what he is talking about and who owns the ground in question. Then he can come to a decision. I am afraid all he has done is interfere in state land management, and the best advice I can give him is to get his nose out of it.","N/A","CROCODILE FARM, BROOME","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/speech[5]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator CAMPBELL","H15","(Western Australia)","LP","N/A","749","—I would like to rebut a couple of the points made earlier in the debate by Senator Reynolds and by my West Australian colleague Senator McKiernan. Senator Reynolds, I think in a very genuine spirit of trying to solve the problem and reconcile the differences between the people who have lobbied the federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) to intervene in this, and the developer and the other Aboriginals in Broome, said that we should use our good offices to try to create mediation.I am afraid that Senator Reynolds does not understand the process that has been gone through, certainly for the last four years. Malcolm Douglas, the developer, has very actively pursued a constructive approach to dealing with the local Aboriginal communities. Indeed, it is the sort of cooperation on the ground, the sort of community involvement and the sort of community reconciliation and discussion that all of us would like to see take place through the reconciliation process that is being pursued nationally at the moment.The other point Senator Reynolds made was that Mr Douglas had not pursued the environmental approvals process until 1992. To begin with I remind Senator Reynolds that we are now two years down the track from 1992 anyway, and that is an enormously long time. This government is saying that the 14-month procedure under the national land rights legislation we recently put through is a relatively quick approval process—and that is a 14-month approval process when there was no confusion over who the claimants were and when everything went fairly smoothly. Here we are, two years down the track, and Senator Reynolds is saying that Mr Douglas has been a bit lax because he only started the approvals process in 1992. I wonder how long she expects an environmental approval process should take.The reality is that back in 1990—which is much longer ago than Senator Reynolds would have the Senate believe—Mr Douglas instigated his discussions with the Environmental Protection Authority in Western Australia. In fact, the preliminary discussions for the whole project took place in 1987, so we are talking about an extremely long lead time. Mr Douglas started preparing his environmental assessments and all the other parts of the process as early as 1991.Senator Ellison has already gone through the detailed process that Mr Malcolm Douglas went through to get to this stage. I will not retread that ground, except to rebut what Senator Reynolds said about the environmental process and the mediation. The mediation that has taken place on the ground—the discussions and the consultations—has been taking place since 1987 to the extent, as Senator Panizza said, that the elder lawman, the traditional custodians of the Broome area, have not only said they have no objections to the development, but also have cooperated through all the Aboriginal heritage processes. They are very keen to see this project go ahead to get rid of the crocodile risk to young children and, particularly, to see genuine job opportunities for young Aboriginals.We are witnessing a process in Broome where the minister has moved in and used his ministerial discretion to stop the project after Mr Douglas has spent years and years going through all the approvals processes. The scary parallel is that the national land rights legislation that we passed here in December has exactly the same problem built into it.Under the national land rights scheme that was put through this chamber late in December, the approvals process starts off basically with the state minister forming an intention to allow a development to go ahead. That can take a couple of months or a few weeks—the quickest is about 70 days for a mine, and probably longer for things like tourism developments. The whole process kicks off with a state minister forming an intention to approve a development, be it mining, tourism or anything else. We then go into what is called the notification period—a period of two months during which all the people in the area are given notification that it is intended to proceed with a development. That allows all who are interested in the area to register as negotiating parties before the tribunal.There is then a two-month period of submissions and negotiations and a further four to six months when there are applications to the tribunal, and the tribunal makes a determination. The determination is either approved or not approved—there is an appeal process to the minister—and the proposal either goes ahead or it does not go ahead. That whole process takes a minimum of about 10 months and a maximum of about 14 months if all goes smoothly. That is the national land rights process that was established with the support of this Senate only a few weeks ago. At the very end of that process there is power in the act for the minister to override it. So there can actually be the whole process of consultations with Aboriginal groups, the determination as to who the native title claimants are and all the environmental and heritage approvals, but at the end of it the Commonwealth minister again has that power to overrule the decision made by the tribunal.Even if, at the end of all those deliberations and considerations, the minister, in some sort of good faith, says `I dont intend to exercise that power, that is irrelevant because, if there is an aggrieved party, it can lobby the minister in exactly the way that occurred with Mr Tickner when this notice was lodged on Friday, and create political pressure. Even if the minister said on the first day after the approval had been granted, `I am not going to exercise my right to overrule the decision of the tribunal, he can change his mind up to two months after the tribunal has made its decision. The minister can do exactly as Mr Tickner did on Friday and say, `No, it is not going ahead.Basically, his word is the end of it; the development is finished and the people have wasted the entire process. In all good faith, we can have developers, state governments, local governments and Aboriginal communities go through this tedious process of approvals, on top of the existing approvals processes of the state governments. And we should not kid ourselves about this land rights scheme; it is said that a lot of these approvals processes can be done concurrently, but many of them cannot. The very sad thing is that, after all that, we can get to the stage where the federal minister says no, and it is all over.The Aboriginal people, particularly, can benefit in terms of employment and opportunities in the tourism, eco-tourism, mining and pastoral industries, and the construction of pipelines and other infrastructure that can develop in the north of the state—although, as Senator Troth has said, this can also happen in Victoria and, indeed, all other parts of Australia. The scary thing for Aboriginals is that these sorts of developments in remote areas are an essential ingredient in trying to reconcile Australians and create the opportunities for Aboriginals that all of us would like to see so that they can develop to their full potential.What is so very sad about this is that when developers and entrepreneurs see this sort of action by the federal minister, which will occur under the national land rights scheme, they will not bother. These are people such as Malcolm Douglas, who are great Australians, who have these dreams to build these sorts of projects—he started in 1987 with this idea and has pursued it all the way. Not only will mining companies such as CRA, Western Mining and BHP not bother to explore for minerals in Australia, but also small entrepreneurs and tourist operators—people who come up with ideas and want to go through the development process—will not even wonder. They will stick to what they are doing—they will stick to their knitting—and will not develop these great ideas that have made Australia the great country it is. Entrepreneurs like Keith Williams, who developed Sea World and Hamilton Island—people who have ideas, vision, enthusiasm and who make these projects come together. They develop Australia and, therefore, jobs and, particularly in the remote areas, help the Aboriginal people who this minister seeks to pretend he is helping.There is another example in Australia of a serious reflection on the Minister, Mr Tickner. We have seen in the case which I have just outlined, which is the subject of my motion today, that Mr Tickner will, under the political pressure of the Aboriginal industry—which in many parts of Australia does not represent the grassroots traditional Aboriginals—act to stop a development that has the support of many of the traditional Aboriginals in the Broome area.Mr Tickner went to Western Australia and appeared on the Sattler File , Howard Sattlers talkback, and said, `Dont worry. Western Australia has got nothing to worry about. We are not going to stop development. But the first chance he got he went to Western Australia, in his laconic sort of way, with his big friendly smile that he wears, and stopped this development. He wants Western Australians to believe that with the extra power he now has of management over land in Western Australia with his national land rights scheme, he will not stop development. How many days was it after the National Land Rights Act was proclaimed that Robert Tickner went across to Western Australia—","N/A","CROCODILE FARM, BROOME","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/speech[6]/talk.start[1]/para","N/A","N/A"

He is over there stopping development that has the agreement of all the local communities and the support of many local Aboriginals.It reminds me of the song that I hear when I am at home playing with my little son Edward which says, `Never smile at a crocodile. Tilt your hat and stop to talk awhile. Dont be taken in by his cheery grin— remember that Mr Tickner has this lovely, cheery grin. He is a happy man because he is just imagining `how good youll feel beneath his skin. So when Mr Tickner says, `We are not going to stop development. Trust me, Im a good bloke. Im from Canberra. Im from the government. Im here to help you, do not be taken in by his cheery grin because he is there to overrule—not states rights, as Senator McKiernan is talking about—peoples rights. When one is trying to make decisions balancing the interests of development against Aboriginal rights, and development against the environment, the best people to make the decisions are those who are on the ground.People in Broome regard the southerners such as Senator Panizza and me as being too far away, out of contact and out of touch with the local community; that is very true. We are not as good at making decisions for Broome as the people in Broome are. The local councils and the local Aboriginals made a decision which was supported by the state government, but this minister, who lives 3000 miles away—I think it is a four and a half hour direct flight in a Falcon jet, going at thunderbolt speed to get there—knows better because he has been lobbied by the Kimberley Land Council, and he rolled over.It was very different when it came to being lobbied by Aboriginal people in Perth over the brewery site. The person who was developing the site had donated $800,000-odd in one year to the Australian Labor Party, so Mr Tickner did not stop him.I said I would refer to one more case. It is a very sad case where the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs did not stick up for the rights of the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land. It is the Amadeus claim near Ayres Rock—near Lake Amadeus. I think it was in 1988—I do not have the documents in front of me—that the Federal Court found in favour of the traditional lawmen and custodians of that Amadeus claim area and made a finding against the Central Lands Council, which was a competing claimant.Since then the minister has failed to grant that land to the successful claimants. He has ignored the Federal Court ruling on who are the traditional owners of the land. The common law sits there and he has ignored it because it does not suit him politically—he would rather have the Central Land Council in control of that land. After this ruling was made, and after Mr Tickner has ignored the Federal Court and the local traditional Aboriginals, we now have the Central Land Council building dwellings on this land that the Federal Court found to be owned by the traditional lawmen of that district. This shows the bona fides of this minister who cries crocodile tears for traditional Aboriginal owners, passes rapacious national rights legislation which will override peoples rights in remote areas, but will not even grant the land to the traditional owners of the Amadeus area.Western Australians are very worried about having decisions over land shifted 3000 miles away to Canberra. We in Western Australia have a very deep interest in ensuring that Aboriginal Australians have great opportunities and that they have their health, housing and educational problems addressed with a very good balance between development and assistance; and we want to ensure that that takes place with reconciliation at a local community level. But these interventions from afar are one sure way of ensuring that reconciliation does not take place. There will be suspicion of the federal government and suspicion of the Kimberley Land Council and its motivations. We will have division between Aboriginals and white Australians. That will tear Australia apart not put it together.I urge the Senate, particularly those on the cross-benches, to support this motion. Honourable senators who are interested in reconciliation and in providing employment opportunities for young Aboriginals, and ensuring that Australia progresses into the next century as a unified nation and not one divided on the ground of race, should be appalled by this action of the minister who says one thing one day and does another the next.Question put:That the motion ( Senator Campbells ) be agreed to.","N/A","CROCODILE FARM, BROOME","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[20]/speech[6]/talk.start[2]/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator KEMP","WW4","(Victoria)","LP","N/A","754","—We have had quite a vigorous debate in this chamber and in the other place over the very generous treatment afforded to Mr Kelly, the Comptroller-General of Customs. The issue I wish to raise relates to a similar problem but it has been treated in a very dissimilar manner. I refer to the two housekeepers at the Lodge who, as I said in this chamber the other day, received a phone call one Sunday night and were told not to report for duty the following morning.Basically they have been treated in a shabby way. Accusations have been made publicly against their character. The other day I tabled in this chamber the certificates of service that were given to these two housekeepers. It is important to note that the certificates of service said that the two housekeepers—and there is a similar sentence in each certificate of service—had provided competent housekeeping services during the term of their employment.The certificates of service went on to explain that because of the need for changes in staffing arrangements at the residence, the services of these housekeepers were no longer required. In other words, the certificates of service show that they provided competent service and that because of changes in the staffing arrangements they were no longer required.That, to the individuals involved, would be disappointing, but I recognise that Mr and Mrs Keating have the right to choose whom they want to have working with them at the Lodge. My only complaint is that people who are employees have to be treated with fairness and decency. I believe this whole affair involving the two housekeepers is an example of two people being treated in a harsh and unjust manner.I have provided the certificates of service to the Senate. This evening I want to provide other references for these two housekeepers and for the work that they did at the Lodge. One of the housekeepers has a note provided by Mr and Mrs Keating as recently as August last year—just some months before the dismissal took place. It is on a card to one of thethem. The name of the housekeeper is mentioned. The note says, `With warmest best wishes on your birthday, and with great appreciation for your care and attention to us all. It is signed: Paul and Annita Keating.To the other housekeeper there was, on a Christmas card at the end of 1992, a note written by Mr and Mrs Keating. It says to the housekeeper, who is named:With appreciation for your support through 1992, particularly with the children. It has made the Lodge a much more livable family environment. Best wishes for Christmas and for 1993. Paul and Annitta Keating.These were nice personal notes from the Prime Minister and his wife to two people who had served them loyally. In each of those two personal notes they recognised the competence and attention to duty of these two housekeepers. How different is the sentiment in those two comments from the statements made by an official from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and Senator Gareth Evans, at the estimates hearings at the end of October. I think it is a fair reading of the evidence given that the Senate committee was told in a variety of ways that the housekeepers had not performed their duty, they had not followed instructions in relation to the use of credit cards, and there were difficulties at the Lodge.Bringing us up to date, we have documentary evidence from the department about the competence of these people. We have personal references and personal notes from the Prime Minister and his wife expressing their gratitude for the kindness of these two people; and we contrast this with the evidence that was given at the Senate committee.Madam Acting Deputy President, I am glad that you are in the chair because I know of your great concern for women and your sense of justice and fairness. It is possible that you may be able to do something to help support these two women who are still without employment, as one would expect after having those very harsh things said about them before a Senate committee.I have brought this to the attention of the Senate. I still think the facts of this case are very confusing and that the department has simply not produced the documentary evidence to support its assertions. It is my hope that this matter will be resolved quickly and decently. I hope the Prime Minister and his wife will intervene in this matter and make sure that justice is done to these people who, I believe, have served the Prime Minister and his wife in a very loyal fashion.If Mr Keating does not decide to take that course—I think it will be a pity and it is sad that two people who have served the Prime Minister loyally should be treated in this fashion—then it is important that an independent investigation be established. Madam Acting Deputy President, you will be aware that the Ombudsman is considering this matter. I hope that the Ombudsman will move to quickly establish an independent investigation into this matter if it cannot be resolved in any other way.I have brought to the attention of the Senate this evening further evidence which I think establishes the competence and the decency of these two women. In the absence of any other contrary evidence I think it is fair to assume that justice has not been done in this case.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[1]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","Senator BELL","7U4","(Tasmania)","AD","N/A","755","—A couple of nights ago I raised a matter of interest that I thought was important for the Senate to consider. That is the matter of forests near Deloraine in Tasmania. I was followed in my contribution by Senator Gibson who said:To actually suggest we should take interest in compartment X or compartment Y here or there in a particular part of Australia—that the Commonwealth government has a right to consider and should know all the details of that—I find absolutely unbelievable.It is my opinion—and I believe many other honourable senators would share my opinion—that this chamber should be interested in such matters. We have heard from Senator Kemp, who thinks we should be interested in the kitchen at Yarralumla. I do not disagree with that. Senator Campbell recently made the case for the Senate being interested in the crocodile farm at Broome. These matters add to the sorts of things that are considered important by various honourable senators. I do not disagree with them one iota. In fact, I would like to return to the matter of the forests near Deloraine and other forests in Tasmania.Nothing is more vital to our survival than the maintenance of this planets biodiversity. When a forest is destroyed, so also are its dependent flora and fauna, and so in turn our collective vitality is diminished.Recently, in Hobart, the Australian network for plant conservation considered the plight of some 3,500 Australian plant types that are threatened with extinction. Some are reduced to a mere handful of plants surviving in a few square metres. Others are differently threatened. The conference attended by many experts from around the world emphasised that any threat to biodiversity must be viewed very seriously indeed. That threat is merely part of the broader threat to the existence of all living things.In this realisation the Reedy Marsh forest conservation group calls for the conservation of all natural public forests of the Reedy Marsh area and asserts its right to see public land remain intact, with all its natural values, both for future Australians and all other life forms that live in the forest. But the group goes further. It rightly calls upon the state government of Tasmania to implement a moratorium to save all remaining natural dry forests on the island. Under terms of the national forest strategy, the federal government must support the Reedy Marsh forest conservation group in its call for such a moratorium.Until the emergence of the woodchip industry in Tasmania in 1971, the dry forests were used for low intensity, selective logging and grazing. The amount of sawlog declined because the selective logging of these forests for sawlogs was unsustainable, even at that time. Current clear-felling practices emerged later. Those practices are grossly destructive and widespread throughout the state. Public consultation concerning these practices has been minimal and criticism is suppressed and continues to be suppressed. There is little political will to solve the problem in Tasmania and proper land use planning mechanisms do not exist.Although the Tasmanian state government was granted federal funds in 1990 to resolve the conflict over Tasmanias forests, it has patently failed to do so. Mr Field, in his letter to the then Prime Minister Hawke on 10 November 1989, stated:Unless we are able to secure your agreement for funding as requested, the conflict about Tasmanias forests will resume and will inevitably involve the Federal Government.Federal funds were granted to resolve the problem, yet state forests still in conflict include the Great Western Tiers, the Southern Forests, Lorinna, the Gog Range, Ellendale, the Tarkine and now Reedy Marsh. Conflict over dry forests in Tasmania will undoubtedly grow. It is apparent, therefore, that the so-called forests and forest industry strategy has neither solved nor diminished the conflict over those forests. It is not even an agreed strategy. Its credibility is sadly in question.The Forestry Commission of Tasmania asserts that this is a sawlog driven strategy. I would suggest that is a lot of rubbish because the figures obtained from the Forestry Commission show that at Parrot Creek coupe, for instance, only approximately six per cent taken were potential sawlogs. Ninety-four percent was designated waste, conveniently diverted to chipping and pulp. In some forest coupes the waste which goes overseas, mainly to Japan, as woodchips may be as high as 98 per cent. So much for a strategy which is sawlog driven. This is all the more offensive when it is remembered that in a poll taken in December 1991 in Tasmania 76 per cent of Tasmanians rejected export woodchipping.By the Forestry Commissions own estimates, in the next five to eight years as little as 5,000 tonnes of sawlogs will come from the Reedy Marsh forest, but in the process some 75,000 tonnes of waste logs will be produced by clear-filling for export woodchips. That is a wastage rate of 95 per cent. I doubt that any other industry would dare attempt to justify such wastage. The assertion that this is a sawlog driven industry is blatantly and intentionally dishonest.Clearly, the public is unaware of the extent of this and is deceived by this gross misrepresentation. Until now the public has accepted an industrial practice that is either extraordinarily wasteful on the one hand or extraordinarily dishonest on the other, and in doing so ravages vulnerable forests.In short, the present policies of the state government, its Forestry Commission and present practices of the industry are openly dishonest. They are also ecologically irresponsible and they clearly reflect the failure of the forests and forest industry strategy. Further roading and logging of natural forests will merely entrench this failure.It was because of all this that the Tasmanian Forestry Commissions application for membership of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, comprising 100 governments and 600 non-government organisations, was rejected in 1990 by its central assembly in Perth. I doubt that anyone would have been surprised by that.Officers of the Forestry Commission have advised the Reedy Marsh forest conservation group that many of those dry forests being considered here regenerate very slowly, well in excess of the commissions stated 80 to 85 years sustainable rotation for sawlog. It can be asserted that these forests are clearly conditional by the commissions own definition, as is seen in the Forestry Commission Technical Bulletin No. 3 of 1991 where these are described as low land dry eucalypt forests.Conditional forests are those whose regeneration is conditional upon a series of determining factors being favourable; for example, absence of prolonged drought, presence of acceptable soil types, absence of serious fire damage, et cetera. When the probability of those occurring simultaneously is low, the forests are described as conditional. The commissions policy is that such forests should not be logged. Arguably, most of the dry forests are conditional. The Reedy Marsh fo-rest most certainly is, as is evidenced by the extraordinarily slow regeneration of portions of the forest that had been clear-felled 15 years ago.The Forestry Commission itself estimates that these areas may take up to 150 years or six generations to regenerate. Although there are at present four small recommended areas for protection, in the Reedy Marsh forest extensive areas between these areas of protection are being clear-felled. As much as 75 per cent of the forests could ultimately be logged in a checkerboard fashion.In short, in conditional forests the environmental cost of logging is high and economic return poor. The recovery time will be substantially longer, at least 50 per cent, than estimates previously quoted by the commission and deceptively promoted under the forests and forest industry strategy as sustainable strategy. Logging dry forests is clearly not economically sustainable and to do so is grossly irresponsible and negligent. I intend to bring to the Senate further information about such practices.Question resolved in the affirmative.Senate adjourned at 7.35 p.m.","N/A","ADJOURNMENT","/html/body/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[23]/debate.sub1[2]/speech/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

"0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","Senator Bolkus","XE4","VIC","ALP","N/A","759","—I am advised that the answer to the honourable senators question is as follows:(1) It is expected that the processing of applications affected by the Governments 1 November 1993 decision will be funded principally by the application fees received. The staff resources and costs will be dependent upon the number of applications received. Any additional costs to the organisation (eg the processing of fee-exempt applications in cases of hardship) will be borne by the Department out of its existing funding base. The organisations providing penal and health clearances will fund their activities from the fees charged by that organisation.(2) Yes(3) Yes(4) Foreign Nationals whose applications for refugee status were refused and were in Australia on 1 November 1993, or who had a valid re-entry visa, will be eligible to apply under the special entry permit category announced on 1 November 1993.(5) Advice on allegations that some PRC nationals have maintained close links with the Chinese Communist Party or are associated with illegal activities is properly the province of other agencies.I can confirm that some PRC nationals have been involved in scams involving the use of fraudulent documentation to support applications for visas to Australia. In 1991 and 1992 fraudulent documentation was a recurring feature of the visitor caseload in the PRC and the student dependent caseload which was handled in Beijing. Officers at the overseas posts became familiar with the characteristics of falsified applications and were able to readily recognise and reject such applications. Following the exposure of these scams, procedures were modified where necessary and relevant areas of the Department and other relevant agencies were alerted. One of the individuals centrally involved in these and other forms of immigration malpractice was successfully prosecuted.Where a person has been involved in criminal or other conduct prejudicial to the public interest, and those activities are found to have substance, each case will be considered on its merits under the Public Interest criteria of the Regulations and on the basis of the advice of any other agency. Where a person has been subject to a criminal conviction due to immigration malpractice, the conviction will be taken into account in considering his or her application.(6) Character checks will not be undertaken in the home countries. This is consistent with the practice for persons applying for refugee status and the subsequent application for residence. The special provisions apply to those who fear return to their home countries. It would be inconsistent to seek character clearances from the authorities from which they have fled or to which they fear return. There is no precedence with these procedures for other residence categories. Usual onshore clearances will be undertaken.(7)(a) Yes(7)(b) No. But where a person has been subject to criminal convictions due to immigration malpractice, the conviction will be taken into account.(8)(a) If they entered legally before 1 November 1993 on a visa issued prior to 12 March 1992 and applied for refugee status prior to 1 November 1993, yes.(8)(b) No. But where a person has been subject to criminal convictions due to immigration malpractice, the conviction will be taken into account.(9) The Australian Embassy in Beijing and Australian Consulate in Shanghai monitor, as resources permit, the situation of persons previously applicants for refugee status who have returned to the Peoples Republic of China. Where specific allegations of mistreatment have been made inquiries are made. To date no information has been received to indicate that returnees who, after being determined not to be a refugee under the DORS process in Australia, have returned to China have suffered persecution in terms of the 1951 United Nations Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees. Information received from other reliable sources concurs with this view.(10) A definition is provided in Regulations to reflect the November 1 decision. The applicant is to have the ability to communicate in English in a mix of social and work situations. The ways in which this can be demonstrated are contained in the Regulations. The definition is not to be confused with that currently being used for off-shore English language testing.(11) No.There will be a number of options whereby applicants can demonstrate that they have the standard of English required to meet the criteria under the 1 November 1993 provisions. One option will be to undertake the Special Entry Permit Category English Test which is currently being developed by the same organisation responsible for the development of the Australian Assessment of Communicative English Skills test (ACCESS). This test is being specifically designed to cater to the level of proficiency required for this particular group and assessment time-frames allowed for implementing the decision. The ACCESS test does not meet this specific need and as such requires some modification, hence the need to identify it as a separate test and avoid confusion with off-shore `vocational testing. It is expected that the newly designed test will be compatible with the ACCESS test.(12) No.The pre 20 June 1989 group have already been in Australia for four years, and have undertaken study in Australian institutions. The spouses and dependents of this group have had access to English language training in the schools or through the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP).Applicants on the basis of applying for Refugee Status or the persons from the former Republic of Yugoslavia and Sri Lanka who applied for the concessional humanitarian entry permits prior to 1 November 1993 are required to demonstrate that they have a level of English sufficient for the mix of social and work situations. They will not require English language training. Dependents of this group may require English language training.(13)(i) Visitor visas applied 1 July 1989—31 October 1993Post Applications ApprovedBeijing 42,941 33,235Shanghai 13,356 7,458(source: IRIS reports from posts)(13)(ii) As indicated at Question 5, an analysis of a large sample of suspect visitor visa applications was undertaken in 1991-1992. Some 400 suspect applications were examined.There is no exact figure of how many suspect applications were received. As an indication, however, in early 1992 the Principal Migration Officer in Shanghai reported that since September 1991, 60% of all visitor applications had characteristics that suggested they were suspect.(13)(iii) All of the documentation lodged with suspect applications was notarised. The certifications of 28 notaries public appeared with varying degrees of frequency in those applications.(13)(iv) The names of migration agents or agencies rarely appeared in the documentation which accompanied the suspect visitor applications. Names of agencies were more often openly associated with student dependant applications. Both scams pre-dated the commencement of the Migration Agents Registration legislation.(13)(v) Under the visitor visa scam many of the spouses of the visitor visa applicants were said to be in China but on investigation were shown to be in Australia. This was a common feature of the scam and may have been a reason for its inception, although the formula was later used to try to achieve the entry of all types of individuals, not necessarily the spouses of PRC nationals temporarily or illegally in Australia.(13)(vi) Over the period of investigation of the visitor visa scam around 200 different names appeared as sponsors. Of those, 28 names appeared more than three times.(14) Detailed statistics of the province that applicants reside in are not available.(15) The Department is aware that packages of bogus information and documents were furnished to applicants to form part of an application to the Department.(16) My Department is not aware of any registered migration agents providing false documentation.(17) Statistics relating to numbers of applicants assisted by individual migration agents are not kept. Applicants are not requested to provide the name of the agent, if any, that may have assisted them.(18) No(19) There have been some cases where similar claims or documents have been submitted by individual applicants but the incidence of such practice appears to be decreasing. Applicants whose claims or documents are similar to those of other asylum seekers are asked at interview to explain the similarity.(20) The Department is aware of PRC nationals overstaying their student visas and have not re-enrolled. Precise details are not readily available. Some may not yet have finalised their plans for the coming year and others are applicants for Refugee status.(21) Allegations have been made. Many of these are the subject of ongoing investigation. It would be inappropriate to provide details at this time. As part of the criteria for students to extend their stay in Australia, they are required to satisfy officers of the Department that they are genuine students.(22) Where fraudulent documentation was found in support of an application for a class 783 visa, the application was refused.(23) Spouses of 437 holders are not eligible to sponsor other relatives to Australia, with the exception of dependent children.(24) There are 12 cases under investigation involving Justices of the Peace and notaries, 2 involving solicitors, and 7 involving Migration agents. Briefs awaiting consideration by the Director for Public Prosecution for possible litigation involve 4 Justices of the Peace and notaries, 2 Solicitors, and 16 Migration Agents.(25) To be registered as a migration agent an applicant must, inter alia, be an Australian citizen or permanent resident. The registration process does not require an applicant to inform my Department of their immigration status prior to acquisition of citizenship or permanent residence.(26) Some employees of English language schools are under investigation for possible offences against Commonwealth legislation. As investigations are incomplete and litigation may result, it is not possible to provide further information at this time.(27) The replies will be provided as soon as the information is available.","N/A","N/A","/html/body/hansard/answers.to.questions/answer.to.qon[3]/answer/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
