3,0,0,0,1,1,"OBrien, Llew, MP",265991,"Wide Bay","LNP","N/A",3757," I present the fourth report of the Petitions Committee for the 46th Parliament.I draw the attention of the House to an e-petition currently open for signatures until later this week. This petition relates to the issue of climate in Australia and has so far gathered over 300,000 signatures. This is the highest number of signatures for an e-petition in the House. The second largest e-petition was presented in 2018, with over 104,000 signatures, which requested the removal of the GST from sanitary products. The two largest recorded petitions to the House remain paper petitions. The largest, with 1,200,000 signatures, was presented in February 2014 and concerned funding support for community pharmacies. The second largest, with over 792,000 signatures, concerned taxation and beer prices, and was presented in December 2000.Its clear that people power comes in both paper and online form. The committee continues to support both ways of petitioning the House. Some people choose to start a paper petition because they want to engage a small community about a local issue or because their targeted audience prefer to sign their names on paper, rather than on a smartphone. On the other hand, national issues may gain more traction through an online petition, which is more easily shared via social media or email. The House continues to receive paper petitions from a broad cross-section of the community, including schoolchildren. This tells us that the paper petition is still as relevant today as it was at Federation.I look forward to further updating the House on the work of the Petitions Committee.","Petitions Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1/subdebate.2/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LLEW OBRIEN (Wide Bay) ","(10:01):"

6,0,0,0,1,1,"Bandt, Adam, MP","M3C","Melbourne","AG","N/A",3770," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.Let me read you a quote:There is growing agreement between economists and scientists that … risk of catastrophic and irreversible disaster is rising, implying potentially infinite costs of unmitigated climate change, including, in the extreme, human extinction.Who was it who said that? Was it the many thousands of people who took to the streets over the weekend to protest about climate change and the governments inaction? Was it members of political parties here in this place, urging the government to take action? It was the IMF. It was the IMF who said this, barely weeks ago. There is now growing consensus, and not just across everyday Australian citizens, who at the moment are petitioning this government to declare a climate emergency. It is not just coming from our leading scientists, who are saying, Time is running out. It is coming from some of the most senior economists in the global financial system.It is time to tell it like it is. We are in a climate emergency and we are facing a mass extinction, including human civilisation. Had the Prime Minister gone to the global climate crisis summit barely a few weeks ago, he wouldve heard the stark warning from the worlds scientists that the current commitments under the Paris agreement are not good enough. We need to do at least three to five times as much as countries like Australia are currently pledging if we are to have a chance of avoiding catastrophic global warming. Thats three to five times as much as what we are doing at the moment.The worlds scientists also told us last year that, because coal—especially in Australia—is the single-biggest contributor to climate change, we cannot continue our reliance on coal. In fact, they told us that, to have a chance of staying below a dangerous 1½ degrees, the world needs to be at least two-thirds out of coal for energy by 2030. That is why the time for coal is over, and that is why Australia needs a plan to quit coal. Thats why today Im introducing the Coal Prohibition (Quit Coal) Bill 2019. Were talking here about thermal coal—the coal that is burnt for electricity. Australia exports about 80 per cent of its thermal coal. About four times as much as we use domestically, burning it for power, we send overseas. It doesnt matter where its burnt, because global warming impacts us all. Until we stop exporting coal, we will not be able to halt the climate crisis.It is clear to everyday Australians that global warming is not under control. From the record drought that we are experiencing and that our farmers and communities are suffering through, and from the fact that towns are being told they might have to go without water, to the unprecedented numbers of fish kills and the numbers of people who are dying from heatwaves and bushfires, it is clear that the climate crisis is hitting, and its hitting us hard. If Australia does not have a plan to exit from coal in an orderly way, we are going to make global warming worse, and that is a death sentence for people working on the land. It will mean more people will die from the heatwaves and bushfires that will hit, it will mean water will run out at a quicker rate and it will mean more extreme weather events.This bill puts in place a plan that says thank you to all of those workers in coal communities, who have helped power our country. But we now know things about coal that we didnt know before. We now know that its a toxic product, and when you use it as intended it kills. We need to do what Germany has done: reach an agreement in this parliament for a plan for the orderly phase-out of coal, one that will look after the affected communities. That means phasing it out at home. It means phasing out our exports. This bill puts in place a plan to do that over the next 10 years in a way that is achievable and in a way that the science requires. In my remaining time, I would invite the seconder for this bill, the member for Clark, to make a few comments. Is the motion seconded?","Coal Prohibition (Quit Coal) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BANDT (Melbourne) ","(10:04):"

8,0,0,0,1,1,"Wilkie, Andrew, MP","C2T","Clark","IND","N/A",3771," I second the motion and offer a few additional comments. Its self-evident that Australia must do everything in its power to combat climate change and to do so urgently, and any sensible strategy surely must include Australia banning any new coalmines and winding down existing coalmines.The significance of this must not be underestimated. We need to understand that something like 29 per cent of coal thats traded globally comes from Australia. When we export coal, we export emissions. When you include our exported emissions with our domestic emissions, you understand that we are a very, very significant producer of greenhouse gases. In fact, if you include our exported emissions, Australia produces more emissions than Russia, a country of 146 million people, hardly an exemplar of responsible climate action. We create more carbon emissions than Russia. In fact, when you include our exported emissions, our total gross emissions are not much less than those of India, a country of 1.3 billion people. In other words, we must do everything we can to get out of the global coal trade, and that must include no more coalmines and winding down existing coalmines.This is especially relevant to me as a Tasmanian at the moment because we had the remarkable revelations just in recent weeks that, when the country is talking about shutting down coalmines, were actually looking to create a new coalmine. In fact, we had the remarkable revelation just recently that Midland Energy has been granted $50,000 by the Tasmanian government to establish mines in the Midlands of Tasmania, around Woodbury and Jericho, that would produce three million tonnes of coal a year for export to Asian markets. How the Tasmanian government can think that that is sensible absolutely beggars belief. Tasmania has a reputation as a relatively clean and green place. Why would we put our food exports and our tourism industries at risk by becoming just another global climate pariah? It beggars belief, and its some of the most irresponsible behaviour I could contemplate by a Tasmanian government.So Im very happy to back the member for Melbourne in this motion for the second reading of the Coal Prohibition (Quit Coal) Bill 2019, which would ban coalmines and wind down existing coalmines. It would be entirely consistent with what should be this countrys strategy—a strategy to, within a reasonable period of time, achieve zero net carbon emissions and, indeed, 100 per cent reliance on renewable energy. Thats the way to deal with the future. Its not to be opening new coalmines in the Midlands of Tasmania, North Queensland, the Hunter Valley or who knows where else. Thats why this is an eminently sensible bill introduced by the member for Melbourne.I would add that until now the philosophy has been progress at any cost. Whenever theres talk of a new coalmine, politicians are quick to talk about the jobs. Well, its time to draw a line in the sand and to understand that progress at any cost is the strategy that has created the climate mess we now have. So weve got to draw a line in the sand, or perhaps scratch a line in the coal, and say that from now on there will be no more new coalmines, we will have plans in place to shut down existing coalmines and we will have plans in place to shut down existing coal-fired power stations in this country, because only by doing that will we genuinely be putting our country on a pathway to zero net carbon emissions. Thats what the community expects of us. Whenever you go out to the community across the whole of the country and you do polling, the evidence is unambiguous that the community wants strong action on climate change. But regrettably, until now, this place has been completely out of step with what the community wants—another case where we in this place are not representing our community. So I second the motion, I applaud the member for Melbourne and I think that the crossbench—or most of the crossbench at least—speaks genuinely on behalf of the majority of Australians, who want us to get out of the coal industry and to get out of it quickly. The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.","Coal Prohibition (Quit Coal) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr WILKIE (Clark) ","(10:10):"

10,0,0,0,1,1,"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",265980,"Mayo","CA","N/A",3772," I move:That this bill be now read a second time.The minimum age of criminal responsibility is the minimum age below which the law determines that children do not have the capacity to form criminal intent.The median age of criminal responsibility in the international community is 14. In most European countries it is between 14 and 16. Countries such as China, Russia, and Sierra Leone have a minimum age of 14, while Canada and Scotland are both set at age 12.In Australia the minimum age of criminal responsibility across Commonwealth, state and territory legislation is 10. Our laws permit the arrest and detention of a child in year 4 and taking them away, often far away, from their family, prior to a finding of guilt.Australia is universally condemned by the international community for this.The bill I am introducing today increases the age of criminal responsibility for Commonwealth offences from 10 to 14 years of age.Amnesty Internationals report entitled The sky is the limit demonstrates that youth detention is not a place where children will grow into mature and healthy young adults.Detention is not rehabilitating young offenders; it is only increasing the risk of reoffending.The report notes that children who are arrested before the age of 14 are three times more likely to reoffend as adults, compared to those arrested after the age of 14.In part this is because children under the age of 14 are making decisions using the part of the brain that is connected to emotions and aggression, and are unlikely to comprehend the consequences of their actions.That is why we do not let 10-year-old children drive cars, drink alcohol, have a Facebook account or vote.We imposed these limits because we as a society decided that young children are not capable of making rational decisions. We accept the medical evidence that says the brain development of young children limits their capacity.And yet, as the law currently stands, we can hold a 10-year-old child criminally responsible for their actions. We can, and, sadly, we do.According to data released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, in 2017-18 there were 600 children aged between 10 and 13 in detention.In addition to the usual limitations placed on the developmental progress of young children, both trauma and prolonged stress will also have a negative impact on brain development. Trauma can include neglect, poverty, removal from family structures and exposure to violence or abuse.It is a sad reality that Indigenous children are more likely to experience trauma than non-Indigenous children.Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are also more likely to suffer from fetal alcohol syndrome disorder, which results in abnormalities in cognitive, behavioural and social functioning, thus increasing the risk of coming into contact with the justice system.Over a third of all children in WA detention were diagnosed with FASD, while in the Northern Territory the recent royal commission sought to address the issue by recommending that all children be screened for the disorder upon entering out-of-home care and that police receive specialist training on the effects of FASD.The age of criminal responsibility is an issue that disproportionately affects children from Aboriginal communities. They are 23 times more likely to be in detention than their non-Aboriginal peers.While only five per cent of children aged between 10 and 17 are Indigenous, more than half of all children in detention on an average day in 2017-18 were Indigenous.Children should be in classrooms; they should not be in custody.But the Just Reinvest program operating in Bourke, NSW has proven that prison need not be a rite of passage for children.For those who remain unconvinced, I urge you to consider the economic arguments against youth detention. Earlier this year the Productivity Commission considered youth justice in the context of their Report on government services 2019.The commission found that the average cost of community based supervision across the states and territories in 2017-2018 was $164 per day, per young person.The average cost of detention based supervision per young person, per day was $1,455.An average cost of holding one child in detention for one year is over half a million dollars.If we multiply that by 600, being the number of 10- to 13-year-olds detained, it comes in at $318 million.Modelling undertaken by PIC, the Indigenous consultancy branch of PwC, predicts that the cost of Indigenous incarceration will grow to $19.8 billion by 2040.But, if we replace youth detention with holistic case management, cognitive behavioural therapy and other appropriate supports, modelling shows that recidivism rates will decline and deliver a saving of $10.6 billion by 2040.Next month the Council of Attorneys-General will hand down their recommendation on whether to raise the age of criminal responsibility.The increase I propose in the bill is consistent with the position of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child and was specifically recommended to Australia by the UN committee in their concluding observations released in late September this year.Finally, Id like to thank the Change the Record coalition, Amnesty International, the Human Rights Law Centre, the Justice Reinvestment Project, the Law Council of Australia, the AMA and the many other campaigners who are working to draw attention to this matter and the way we approach young people—children—in detention in this country.The UN has spoken. We were all aghast when we saw the footage from Don Dale. Children as young as 10 were in that situation. One of the recommendations was to lift the age of criminal responsibility. Two years on, we have done nothing in this place. It is time for this place to lead the nation; it is time for this place to act.Mr Speaker, I would like to give my remaining time to the member for Warringah.

12,0,0,0,1,1,"Steggall, Zali, MP",175696,"Warringah","IND","N/A",3774," I second the motion. I rise to speak in support of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Age of Criminal Responsibility) Bill 2019, and I commend the member for Mayo for introducing this very important bill and attempting to address an important issue.On 20 November this year, we will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Australia is a proud signatory to. Article 37 of the convention states that children who break the law should not be treated cruelly, should not be put in a prison with adults and should be able to keep in contact with their family. Article 40 states that prison sentences for children should only be only used for the most serious offences. The minimum age of criminal responsibility should be raised to 14. Its not surprising that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has called on Australia to do so.Ten is too young. Think of a child in year 4. Think of the children who visit Parliament House. Generally, they come and visit their members when they are in year 5 or year 6 in primary school. We are talking about children younger than those children. In the family law system, a childs view, whilst taken into account, is generally not given significant weight until around 13 or 14 years of age. Yet we are holding them criminally responsible at 10. The medical science is clear: their brains are still developing. Their ability to reason and think through the consequences of their actions is seriously impaired and impacted. As a mother of teenagers, like many in this place, I have seen firsthand the changes our children go through between starting school and adolescence. It beggars belief that we are holding them criminally responsible at 10.Criminalising children disproportionately harms those who are already the most disadvantaged, especially Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. When children are treated as criminals and jailed or detained, it traps them in a cycle of disadvantage from which many never escape. Once detained, young children are more likely to reoffend, and less likely to complete their education or find employment. Our system is failing our most vulnerable and disadvantaged children. We should be fixing the system and supporting these children, not punishing them for that failure.Australia is out of step with international standards. The median minimum age of criminal responsibility across the world is 14. Around 600 children below the age of 14 are imprisoned in youth detention centres each year. Seventy per cent are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. This reinforces the systemic disadvantage already faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, and must end. Instead of criminalising and jailing young children, we should be addressing the underlying causes of crime, intervening early and diverting children from pathways leading to crime.There are many wonderful examples throughout Australia of charitable organisations working with communities and governments to do just that. We have the Out-Teach Mobile Education program run by Save the Children, who are doing fantastic work. As parliamentarians, we need to support their work, and the best way for us to do so is to pass the member for Mayos bill. I thank the House. The time allotted for this debate has expired.

14,0,0,0,1,1,"Giles, Andrew, MP",243609,"Scullin","ALP","N/A",3775," I move:That this House:(1) notes that:(a) the Government plans to privatise Australias visa processing system;(b) under the Governments plan, a private tenderer will be given licence to run Australias visa processing system as a for-profit business; and(c) the Government will decide the winning tenderer in October 2019;(2) acknowledges that:(a) visa and citizenship processing times have blown out under this Government;(b) more than 230,000 people are on bridging visas;(c) more than 220,000 people are on waiting lists for their citizenship; and(d) the Government has failed to preserve and enhance the integrity of Australias visa processing system; and(3) calls on the Government to stop its privatisation of Australias visa processing system.Time is running out to stop the Morrison government from privatising Australias visa system. Later this month, the Morrison government will decide who will run our visa processing system. Will it be the Australian government, accountable to the Australian people through this place, the Australian parliament? Or will it be big companies, accountable only to their shareholders and the profit motive? If the Prime Minister gets his way, hell outsource $1 billion of visa processing off to the highest bidder. Today we see the same Prime Minister railing against profiteering banks by setting up an ACCC inquiry. I say this to him and to members opposite: if you were so worried about profiteering, you would not be privatising Australias visa-processing system, especially when one of the consortiums is one of those big banks.Labor believes that there is a genuine need for an ACCC study into visa privatisation so that we can see what the anticompetitive consequences of outsourcing our visa system will be. Labor is very concerned that the market power associated with the establishment of the private visa system, and associated monopoly power, may have major anticompetitive impacts both for visa applicants and for businesses. And lets be clear here: outsourcing our visa system will lead to significant job losses, increased visa costs, greater risks of worker exploitation, and data security issues, and will make protecting our national security more difficult. Do we really want our visa system to be outsourced? Do we really want our visa system to be outsourced to a monopoly provider? Isnt this a core responsibility of our national government? We in Labor believe it is, and we will be fighting for it.There are 2,000 jobs around the country that are at risk if the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs sell off our visa system without the right supervision. In New South Wales, 800 jobs are at risk. In Queensland, 250 jobs are at risk—and I look forward to hearing from the member for Ryan in this regard. I note that he wont be assisted by the governments talking points for today, which dont seem to acknowledge that this is a major issue for the government. In Western Australia, 150 jobs could go. In Hobart, 100 visa-processing jobs are set to be lost. And what do we know? LNP backroom dealer Scott Briggs, a close friend of the Prime Minister and a former colleague of the immigration minister, is a major investor in one of the bids to win the contract. What a coincidence! And this is why the Prime Minister and the immigration minister havent spoken about this—theyve recused themselves. But this doesnt explain, much less justify, the vow of silence taken by the Minister for Home Affairs. He should be talking about this. He should be explaining why this crazy proposal is, in fact, in the national interest. Whats the context? We have massive blowouts at the moment in wait times for people applying to be Australian citizens, with over 220,000 people waiting. At the same time, this third-term government is embarking upon a dangerous folly to outsource visa processing. But Australians dont want this system sold off, they want to see it fixed. And they especially dont want to see it flogged off to one of the PMs mates.Over in the UK, we see where visa privatisation is already well advanced. Its like seeing a preview of what we will soon encounter if this is not stopped as it should be. Reports have shown that visa applicants can attend one of just six core centres around the country which offer a free service, or they can go to others which charge a fee starting from 60 pounds, forcing people to travel hundreds of miles or pay high fees in order to submit their applications. Weve seen reports of refugees being forced to pay 780 pounds just to have their application processed. Weve seen reports of residency being granted in exchange for a two-million-pound investment. A privatised system will inevitably lead to people paying for access to our visa system, because that is what happens when you introduce the profit motive in place of the national interest. Is that what we want here in Australia? I think the answer is and has to be a resounding no. Australians want their government to take responsibility for this core government responsibility, not contract it out.We are almost out of time to stop this. A decision is due to be made one way or the other this month. Im aware that more than 10,000 people have already signed our online petition to stop this. Theyve made clear their concerns. And what have they got from members opposite up to this point? Theyve got silence. They havent got any response at all. But what they are entitled to is a response, a clear answer. It is now up to the Morrison government, and in particular the Minister for Home Affairs, to stop privatising Australias visa system immediately. They wont justify this billion-dollar sell-off, because they cant, but they must bring this privatisation experiment to an end now in the national interest and on behalf of 2,000 Australian workers who deserve to keep their jobs.","Migration, Citizenship","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GILES (Scullin) ","(10:26):"

19,0,0,0,1,1,"Simmonds, Julian, MP",282983,"Ryan","LNP","N/A",3777," Its a pleasure to rise in the House today to speak against this motion, and its an inauspicious start for Labor in this sitting fortnight already. It didnt take the Labor members opposite very long to throw off the edict of the member for Grayndler that they were going to be a positive opposition. They have reverted to the messages from the May election, back to opposition for oppositions sake. The member for Scullins speech was a bit like going back in time to a couple of months ago—a bit of business bashing. I was surprised that the words the big end of town didnt pass his lips. He was so close. You could almost see him straining to get it out as they reverted to their messages of old. Its back to the shabby politics that we see from Labor in this space. They have no credibility at all when it comes to immigration and home affairs, a policy area that under Labor was a total shambles. When it comes to immigration and home affairs, we know that it is only this side of the chamber that can be trusted to keep our nation safe and our borders secure and that can run a fair, equitable and budgeted—thats the key—immigration system.Lets start with the facts about this private members motion, an attempt by the member for Scullin to throw stones and wilfully distort what the government is actually doing. The government is not privatising visa decision-making. Again, we are not privatising visa decision-making. The member for Scullin knows it, which is why hes sitting there with a big smile on his face. The Department of Home Affairs is conducting a tender process for a new workflow tool that will support digital visa applications and decision-making. We are doing this as we continue to improve and modernise systems and processes that assist in reducing visa decision-making times. The provider of the workflow tool will have no role whatsoever in visa decision-making. The reform will, in fact, allow the departments skilled and experienced officers to refocus their efforts on higher value, more complex decision-making that will enhance our border integrity. It is not driven by a desire to reduce departmental staffing levels, as those opposite have claimed.So we have a government on this side of the chamber with a stable and consistent approach when it comes to home affairs and immigration: strong borders and responsible economic management to fund them. In contrast to that consistent policy approach, Labor are wildly inconsistent when it comes to home affairs and immigration. They dismantled the Howard government era policies while they were in government, allowing 1,300 people to die at sea, and then they claim to be the compassionate party. In the lead-up to the May election, they claimed that there wasnt a wafer of difference between them and the government in this particular policy area; yet they went on a unity ticket with the Greens to introduce the medevac legislation. They are simply all over the place.While we are improving and modernising our immigration and visa processing—that is what Australians expect from their government—there is no doubt that it is a foreign concept to the Labor members opposite. They dont understand efficiency and integrity in this process. They dont understand what it is to hold the same policy position in this particular area over a period of time.Lets remember what Labor did with this: 50,000 arrivals on 800 boats. Their 457 visa program spiralled out of control with an additional 40,000 workers coming in under Labors dodgy skills list, which blew out to 650 occupations, and there was a budget blowout of $60 billion to fund it all. How did they pay for this? We know that they dont do responsible economic management very well. So, to make up for the $16 billion shortfall, they took a razor to Australias enforcement agencies to prop up their program. They cut $128 million from the AFP between the 2010-11 and 2013-14 financial years. They cut $735 million and 700 staff from customs.So, when the member for Scullin comes in here and claims that the government is trying to reduce staff, we know its a nonsense. We also know that, in their time in government, they reduced 700 staff from the customs department alone to save $735 million so that they could fund a $16 billion blowout, because they couldnt control Australias border or immigration systems. So lets be clear: we will not be lectured to by the opposition when it comes to this.

Its mission was nation-building, administrating Australias migration program, attracting the best and brightest to make Australia a competitive global powerhouse—not only numerically but also economically and socially—and it oversaw the successful settlement of many of our seven million postwar migrants. Sadly, the departments most recent history has seen it battered by the core, destructive elements of Liberal ideology.

23,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation","HVP","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr PERRETT: The road to demise started back in 2013 when Mr Morrison became the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and approved the integration of immigration with customs and the creation of the Australian Border Force. Who could forget the brute from Brontes on-water matters press conferences? This is where he mastered the art of saying nothing loudly. Although immigration staff referred to the integration as the takeover, the complete takeover occurred under Minister Duttons control at the end of 2014. At the time, The Canberra Times wrote that the adoption of the customs culture and militarisation of the organisation was so alarming that it prompted the public services greatest executive brain drain since the 1980s.In 2017, after 72 years, the word immigration was dropped from the departments title, and the department was sucked into the vortex of home affairs. Have things improved? The results of a staff survey conducted in May this year showed that thousands of public servants want to quit home affairs. Staff experience low morale, poor engagement and high levels of bullying and harassment. Across all of the 97 APS agencies that were surveyed, home affairs ranked last for engagement, 94th for wellbeing and 91st for innovation. Before you think that the results of this survey are a one-off, theyre not. Ever since the takeover, the morale of our professional immigration officers has been consistently low.How does a global organisation that was once tasked with the mission of nation-building and whose employees had been found to be some of the most resilient in the public sector get to this low point? Surely morale that is so consistently low must affect productivity. But the staff turn up each and every day. They may not love their environment, but theyre dedicated to their work and to this nation.How has this ungrateful government shown their appreciation for the hard work the department does in implementing their policies? The first thing they did was refuse to give staff a wage increase for six years. They also shut down visa processing functions at approximately six overseas offices. They outsourced contact centres in Australia and overseas. They centralised the parliamentary liaison units, diminishing the service to parliamentarians. They gutted client services in each state. In Queensland, they moved their Cairns office to the airport, where the department conduct border force activities.The visa processing function in Cairns has gone. It was once a vibrant service that processed working holiday maker visas and citizenship applications and provided services to international tourists and humanitarian entrants who were settled in Cairns. You cant get a face-to-face immigration service in Queensland anywhere north of Brisbane apart from the internet—and you can imagine how friendly that is! Today, the department has nearly half the visa-processing staff it had prior to the takeover and yet the number of applications to be lodged and processed has not decreased. In fact, the government claim the projected number of visa applications they expect to receive is an argument for privatisation. So now they have virtually decimated the immigration component of Home Affairs the government want to hand over control of one of our most vital services to the highest bidder, to their Liberal mates, perhaps. They want to privatise Australias visa processing system. It is disgraceful. Theyve made the staff miserable and overworked and now they want to actually sell off their jobs. How low can this coalition government go under Prime Minister Morrison?Under Minister Duttons scheme, private providers will be given licence to run Australias visa system as a for-profit business. This will lead to more cuts to services, increased visa fraud and more data security risks, as mentioned in the member for Scullins speech. Visa processing is an essential part of keeping Australia safe. Visa processing should be owned, managed and operated by the Australian government. It should be run by professional Commonwealth staff who are well resourced. These Commonwealth public servants should be given all of the necessary resources to operate effectively and make Australia safe. Australia has come a long way since the immigration department kicked off in 1945, but sadly we are at a point where we have a coalition government with a Liberal ideology that wants to sell off and compromise our border security. It is also why weve seen 90,000-odd people arriving at airports under this government and under this hopeless minister.","Migration, Citizenship","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

25,0,0,0,1,1,"Alexander, John, MP","M3M","Bennelong","LP","N/A",3780," I thank the member for Scullin for raising the issue. As a multicultural nation, our visa system is central to our migration system and must work well in order to keep families together and communities united. My electorate is one of the most multicultural in the country. Communities from across the globe have come to Bennelong and made a permanent home, combining the great benefits of our various cultures. We have large communities of Italians, Armenians, Koreans, Indians and, of course, Cantonese Chinese. Each of these communities now live in a hybrid cultural space. They are proud Australians, but they are still closely connected with the cultures of their ancestors. As a result, our community is regularly home to celebrations from across the world. It is the merging of these many rich cultures that creates the dynamic and unique flavour that pervades the suburbs of Bennelong. As I regularly say, our diversity is our strength and our greatest asset.But these great local communities are only able to be here because of our visa system. Locally, I get a number of visa issues through my office, and I have been delighted to be able to help many people reunite with their families and attend critical events, such as weddings, christenings and funerals, and spend time with their loved ones at times that really matter. I have helped people stuck in Syria in the aftermath of civil war there make it out to Australia, where they had families and friends to support them and help them join the broader community. Ive successfully represented a person who came to my office desperate to get relatives out from India to Australia so they could be beside him when he married the love of his life. I have helped someone seeking visas so family members could make it to the hospital and have a final conversation with their dying mother before she passed away, providing comfort for the whole family. This is what we must always remember. Visas look bureaucratic, made up of paperwork and file numbers, but behind each one is a personal story of hope, aspiration and a new start or an old connection.Our visa system has been working well for the last few decades and continues to work well under this government. The reforms we are enacting will not hamper this growth and will ensure the system can handle the huge number of applications it receives. Let me be clear: this government is not privatising visa decision-making. The Australian government will always remain responsible and accountable, as it is today, for all visa decision-making. It will determine visa rules and how decisions are made. The Department of Home Affairs is conducting a tender process for a new workflow tool that will support digital visa application and decision-making. This modernisation process will reduce processing times to ensure visa decision-making continues to support key export industries such as tourism and education and help keep us all safe.To be clear, throughout these changes well remain responsible for national security and community protection by maintaining control of visa decision-making. The provider of the workflow tool will have no role whatsoever in visa decision-making. This reform will allow skilled and experienced officers to refocus their efforts on higher-value, more complex decision-making. This will enhance border integrity.This process is not being driven by a desire to reduce departmental staffing or to cut costs. Claims that this process will lead to wholesale job losses and office closures are simply false. Our visa system is working and, with these reforms, it will only work better.","Migration, Citizenship","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ALEXANDER (Bennelong) ","(10:41):"
26,0,0,0,1,1,"Owens, Julie, MP","E09","Parramatta","ALP","N/A",3781," Mr Deputy Speaker, did I actually hear members opposite say they are committed to improving the visa system for Australia, when the reality of what has happened under this government in the last six years is completely the opposite? I have people in my electorate whove come to my office with terrible stories of waiting over two years for their 10-year-old sons visa to be approved—of not seeing their 10-year-old son for two years. There are people whove come to my office whose baby was born after they left their country of birth and who have never seen that baby in the first three years of that childs life.These are shocking stories. Quite frankly, I worry about my staff, who have to handle these stories and every day have to deal with people who are living through extraordinary pain, whose hearts are broken because our visa system is broken.Under this government it has got worse. There are 220,000 people still waiting to have their citizenship applications processed as future citizens, and they wait 13 months to pledge allegiance to Australia under this government. Once theyre approved, they wait. They wait and they wait. Ive had people whove been phoned the week before their citizenship ceremony to be told it was cancelled and theyd have to come back later. Ive had people come to my office to prove their Australianness, desperate for citizenship; they come to my office and try to prove to me how worthy they are by telling me that theyve paid for their education—that theyve paid for their degree—because theyre waiting for their citizenship ceremony, and telling me that theyve worked every day for the last three years, and that theyve paid their taxes. They come to me to prove their Australianness in a way that I dont have to. My heart breaks for them. I just ask those opposite who were telling us today that the system is working, and theyre trying to make it better by privatising it, to have a bit of a rethink about this. It is not working, and privatising it will not make it better.Look at the history of privatisation. Im actually going to look at all levels of government and both sides of politics here. We tend to privatise things just at the wrong time, and its the wrong time to privatise the visa system because the world is becoming smaller. There are more mobile work opportunities. People are moving. Families are more dispersed across the globe. People move more often. They marry across borders. Its a different world now, from 10 or 15 years ago—or 40 years ago, which is where this government belongs. Its a different world. And now is the time to keep the brain—which is your public sector—intact, to keep the knowledge of people who have worked in this sector for decades intact so that they can help us work through the changes were going to need to make to make sure that Australia can properly participate in a global economy, with a mobile workforce and families moving across borders.But look at privatisation. Recently, my local council privatised rubbish collection—just at a time when we need less rubbish. So now, the rubbish collectors get paid for more rubbish. The more rubbish they collect, the more they get paid. Its designed to fail what we need now.We see the privatising of hospitals when, actually, we know that over 60 per cent of people in hospitals shouldnt even be there. So, now, hospitals get paid to have people in hospitals, when actually our health system should be about keeping them out. Its designed to fail.We privatised the electricity grid just when we shouldve been trading on the grid and finding ways to pull more power off it. That was a stupid decision, to privatise the grid. Weve privatised roads when we should have fewer cars on them. These are stupid decisions. I wont even go into the privatising of the serum laboratories and the transmission towers, or of the Snowy hydro scheme, for that matter.We also see appalling examples of privatisation, where businesses are paid for their inputs, when usually in the private sector you get rewarded for your outcome. Its not that you train a person for work; its that they get a job and the company is happy, and, therefore, other people come to your college because your outcome was good. In the privatisation of the voc ed system, you got paid for enrolling a person. If you enrolled a person and they didnt turn up, you got more money than you would if they graduated. It was designed to fail. It was designed to bring in shonks and it was designed to fail.This will be the same. You can imagine the wonderful rorts that will go along with this, such as relationships with airline companies: You want a visa? Would you like flights with that? This is what happens when the private sector moves into an area where the outcome is so difficult to manage. Are they going to be rewarded for the number of visas they process, which means theyll process them too fast? Are they going to be rewarded for the quality of people? This is ridiculous. On what basis do you reward a commercial business for processing visas? It is designed to fail from the start and it will follow the failure of all the other privatisations that have happened over the last decade.

27,0,0,0,1,1,"McVeigh, John, MP",125865,"Groom","LNP","N/A",3782," I rise to express extreme disappointment with this motion from the opposition suggesting that the government is planning to privatise the entire visa-processing system. Nothing could be further from the truth. This government is not privatising the visa decision-making process, simply conducting a tender process for a new workflow tool that will support the visa application process. In raising this motion, those opposite are running diversionary tactics and again proving that they ignore the basis of good government and, certainly, are not interested in real outcomes.Seeking input into visa-processing issues at present is considered necessary by the government, because we all know processing times that feed into visa decision-making conducted by government are too long. They are taking too long. We recognise the importance of a process that will in fact support key export industries such as tourism and education by bringing in skilled people with the appropriate visas. That is certainly the case in my electorate of Groom in terms of tourism and education, but most particularly agriculture.Lets look at real outcomes, as Ive suggested. The Minister for Immigration has advised that, in the first three months of this year, under the permanent skilled migrant program, there has been a 124 per cent increase in the number of regional visas compared to the same period last year. Now, that is important in regional Australia, particularly for agriculture. The government is interested in real outcomes. That is why the government will remain responsible for national security and community protection by maintaining control of the visa decision-making process and, as I said, by making sure that we are assisting our country in terms of those industries, particularly in regional Australia, as the minister has outlined in the program for migrants to go into regional areas.The government is very much focused on proper process and prioritising the decision-making process, as I have said, To have skilled and experienced officers, for example, bogged down in processing issues in terms of the handling of visas, is certainly not the best use of our resources. The government intends to outsource part of that process to reduce the time it takes up of experienced officers, so that they can refocus on higher priority decision-making in relation to visas. Those opposite would suggest that this move is all about wholesale job losses—offices being closed, for example. Those claims are false, they are misleading, and those who are making those claims know that that is the case.This is about good government, applying our resources to the highest priority areas for consideration. That is about visa decisions and its about real outcomes—making sure that we have our processes flowing such that we can have, for example, as Ive mentioned, skilled migrants going into regional areas. What does that do? It achieves a number of objectives. It certainly supports regional industries such as in my electorate of Groom. But at the same time it spreads the load across our country. It helps feed into the management of population pressures, for example, in our metropolitan areas. And we know that infrastructure spending being committed by the federal government is certainly focused on that priority.This is a big-picture approach. Its the government focused on where the real decisions need to be made by senior officials, and thats certainly what theyll be freed up to do more of, by simply outsourcing some of these visa processing issues with a workflow tool that improves the process and achieves the outcomes that I have mentioned.","Migration, Citizenship","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr McVEIGH (Groom) ","(10:51):"

But, as a result of this visa privatisation plan, private firms will decide who comes to Australia and private firms will decide the circumstances in which they come. Indeed, Mr Howard noted recently the link between trust and confidence in the visa system and the way in which it is operated. He said:If they feel that control is slipping they will turn against it.By they he meant the Australian people. He continued:I think that would apply to just about any country in the world. Its basic common sense.Its not just John Howard whos saying this. The submission to the Senate committee from Migration Council Australias Carla Wilshire noted:Maintaining public trust and confidence in the immigration program is critical to affording policymakers the political and administrative space to manoeuvre the complex and shifting context …As the mover of the motion, the member for Scullin, has noted, there is a serious issue in our migration system right now—more than 230,000 people on bridging visas, more than 220,000 people on waiting lists for their citizenships, and a significant backlog at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. So, yes, there are significant problems to be addressed in our visa system.But the government has not explained in any way how privatisation would solve those problems. As the CPSU noted:Visa applications should only be assessed on their merits, as is the case now, not based on how much profit they can generate for a private company.Thats been a strong campaign run by Nadine Flood and her successor, Melissa Donnelly, who I acknowledge today. The CPSU noted:This is not an open tender, as only two shortlisted companies are in line to be handed our visa processing system.Some of the most biting remarks about this proposal have come from Abul Rizvi, formerly the deputy secretary of the Department of Immigration, responsible for the design and delivery of Australias visa and citizenship program. This is a man who was awarded both the Public Service Medal and the Centenary Medal for his contribution to the development of Australias immigration arrangements. Mr Rizvi noted there has been no business case with risk plan and key performance indicators put forward by the government and that the privatisation seems to have been driven by the artificial constraints imposed by the public service staffing cap. We know that the public service staffing cap is lowering the quality of public services that are delivered. It is increasing spending on consultants and contractors, and it is hurting the institutional knowledge of the public service. Mr Rizvi said:It is not clear how privatisation will address the massive visa and citizenship backlogs Home Affairs has allowed to be built up …Those words are key: allowed to be built up. To a large extent, this has been a policy choice by the coalition to ensure that the backlog of people awaiting citizenship is now almost equivalent to one per cent of the Australian population. Mr Rizvi notes:There is no question the IT platform for visa processing requires regular upgrading and possibly even major re-development. But no explanation has been provided for why this is best done via a privatisation model …The Migration Institute of Australia and Migration Council Australia have warned of systematic risks. The Migration Institute of Australia said:It is difficult to reconcile the complexity of the current migration program with attempts to automate 90 percent of processing or to automate subjective decision making.The government that brought you robo-debt now wants to extend the automation of visa processing. Would you really trust the Morrison government, after the robo-debt scandals, to now engage in a process that will lead to more automation of visa processing? I think not.There is significant concern among recruiters, who are looking for overseas talent to fill skill shortages, that poorly configured automated systems would make Australia an unappealing destination. Skilled migrants often look at a choice across a range of different countries, and waiting times are already causing a headache. Problems that arise through the privatisation of the visa system could further damage Australias reputation as a great tourist destination and could further damage Australias ability to attract skilled migrants.","Migration, Citizenship","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr LEIGH (Fenner) ","(10:55):"
29,0,0,0,1,1,"Leeser, Julian, MP",109556,"Berowra","LP","N/A",3784," It is interesting to have another motion today from the Labor Party on immigration. This motion indicates Labor has nothing of substance when it comes to migration. Indeed, what we have heard this morning is more spin than a ferris wheel. Australia cant trust Labor on immigration, and this motion proves it. Visa decision-making—let us be very clear—is not being privatised. This is Mediscare redux. Labors motto when the facts don’t suit is to accuse their opponents of doing something theyre not actually doing. Whats next? They will accuse us of faking the moon landing or putting fluoride in the water for mind control. If you believe the Labor Party, youd believe Harold Holt was taken by a Chinese sub and that the US government is reverse engineering alien technology at Area 51. Back in the real world, we like to deal with facts.If Labor were interested in finding out the facts, theyd discover that the Department of Home Affairs is conducting a tender process for a new workflow tool, a software interface that will support digital visa applications and enable officials to have more time to spend on the parts of the visa process which actually require assessment and decision-making. This modernisation process is necessary to reduce processing times and to ensure visa decision-making continues to support key export industries, like tourism and education, as well as helping ensure the integrity of the visa system. Let me be clear: the government remains responsible for all visa decision-making. We will determine the visa rules and how decisions are made. We will remain responsible for national security and community protection by maintaining control of visa decision-making.Since Labor dont seem to know anything about the tender process, it might be worth me laying out a little bit more about what this is actually all about. Firstly, the provider of the workflow tool will have no role whatsoever in visa decision-making. The purpose of the tender is to implement technology to take away some of the inefficiencies that currently exist in the visa application process. Secondly, the reform will allow the department to refocus its efforts on higher value, more complex decision-making. Thirdly, the reform will enforce border integrity.Id like to correct some other claims that seem to have arisen from Labors participation in debates on visa processing. My friend the member for Fenner outlined, with the CPSU talking points this morning, some of the issues Labor have been running. Let me be clear: this process is not being driven by a desire to reduce departmental staffing costs. Claims that this process will lead to wholesale job losses and office closures are simply false, and those making the claims know that. There has been no overall funding cut in the Department of Home Affairs since Minister Dutton took over in December 2014. In fact, the overall total departmental funding has actually increased.When they get their facts so wrong, why would anyone trust the Labor Party with immigration policy in this country? When you look at their record, no-one should take any lessons from Labor at all on migration policy. This is the party who, when they were last in office, gave us the failed immigration policies that saw 50,000 people turn up on our doorsteps on 800 boats with 8,000 children in detention, with 17 detention centres opened. The cost of this failure in dollar terms was $17 billion. That doesnt compare with the human cost of the failure, which is the fact that, under Labor, 1,200 people drowned at sea. Those 1,200 people might just be a statistic to the Labor Party but we will never let them forget those people, because those lives were needlessly lost while Labor was in office.Labor like to claim to be the great humanitarians and to be concerned about the poor and the downtrodden, but they arent. Instead of 5,000 people per year being granted a special humanitarian visa, that number dropped to 500 in Labors last year in government. This is because available places were taken by people who had arrived by boat. People who were waiting and most in need of asylum were prevented from obtaining protection in Australia because Labor were sloppy about their border policy. Just six years ago Australias humanitarian program was not in order; it was a catastrophe. Since regaining government we have restored the program. In 2018-19 we granted more than 7½ thousand special humanitarian visas.Then there is medevac. Labor took control of this House for one day with their mates on the crossbench and the Greens and gave us medevac, where any two doctors could cause a detainee to leave Nauru and Manus and come to Australia—a major weakening of our border protection system, and an example of what Labor would do if they ever came to government again. Medevac doesnt apply the character test to migrants, as is the case with other visas. Its a law made contrary to the advice of officials, yet its an example of what Labor would do to our borders.Because of the Morrison government, Australia now has one of the most respected migration systems in the world. This is because of the orderly system we have put in place over the last six years. We are not privatising decision-making. I say to those opposite: when you stop telling lies about the privatisation of visa processing, we will stop telling the truth about your failed border protection policy.

30,0,0,0,1,1,"Khalil, Peter, MP",101351,"Wills","ALP","N/A",3786," I rise to speak in support of the member for Scullins motion calling on the government to stop this plan to privatise our visa processing system. Lets start with the governments track record, particularly on visa processing, and how it negatively impacts ordinary people every day. People in my electorate of Wills, down in Melbourne, speak to me about delays in just about every single visa category; its a common refrain. Almost every day at my electorate office in Coburg, someone calls or comes into the office because they are directly impacted by this governments visa processing failures. They come into the office desperate for answers, asking: Why is it taking so long? Why is there such delay? We have to tell them that, even though they might have put in their application 18 months ago, this is actually within the departments listed normal processing times.We see this widespread—Im sure it occurs in electorates around the country—and it has real impact on peoples lives. A teenager who is in high school, wanting to go to university, is trying to get their citizenship locked in and finalised, and, unfortunately, the delay on their citizenship means they cant go to study what they want unless they are ready to sign up to pay tens of thousands of additional dollars, because they are still classified as a international student—not a local or domestic student. These delays have a real impact on peoples lives. Theyre holding people back from contributing to this country and to their communities in ways that will benefit all.Lets look at some of the processing times that the department lists on its website. A partner visa takes 24 months—two years! A citizenship application takes 22 months—not much better. What about a parent visa? Sorry, says the department, the official line is, Processing times are not available for this visa. People who want to become Australians, people who want to be part of our country, part of Australia, not just as visitors but as citizens contributing to their community, are being delayed. As the member for Scullin has noted, there are more than 222,000 people on the waitlist for citizenship. That number is not just a statistic; its a number that represents peoples lives and thousands of people being impacted in ways that really have a detrimental effect on what they can do in their contribution to this country.What is the difference between someone on permanent residency and someone who is a citizen? The people who are on permanent residency pay their taxes, and they work and live in their community. Theyve probably lived here for many years. Theyre part of our communities. Yet, because they dont have citizenship, there is one thing they dont have—that is, the right to vote. Being welcomed into the Australian democracy with that really important right, the right to vote and participate in our democratic process—they pay their taxes but wont be given the right to vote because all of their applications have been delayed.Whats the cause of these delays? In 2017 the government tried to change the rules for people on permanent residency applying for citizenship. They wanted new rules that, instead of a year, would have extended the wait time to four years. They also wanted to add an English language test. I had a couple, two doctors, from India come into my office during that period. One of them fell on one side of the arbitrary date for this new rule and one of them fell on the other side. The wife could go straight to her citizenship ceremony, but her husband, whose application went in a couple of months later, had to wait another four years. It was absolutely ridiculous. This couple are not unique. Theyre making a contribution to this country. Theyve raised their kids here. Theyve paid their taxes. They wanted to become fully-fledged citizens of this country. We opposed that bill. The community rallied—we had 38,000 signatures on a petition—and the bill, thankfully, didnt pass the Senate.Then there were more delays. Were they deliberate? I dont know. Was it the ministers way of trying to go slow? There might be another explanation. I dont want to be too conspiratorial about it. Maybe its just mismanagement. Maybe the delays with the Department of Home Affairs have more to do with the fact that theyve cut $150 million off their budget. Maybe it has got to do with that. Maybe its got to do with the fact that the staff in the department play a critical role in building our nation and yet the department is being denied the resources and personnel to do that core responsibility. Thats probably whats happening.Its about time that this ends. We cant allow this government to privatise the process, to outsource their core responsibility in the Public Service. Were talking about 2,000 Australians losing their jobs and jeopardising data security. This is too important to allow it to happen with the Department of Home Affairs. We oppose this.

31,0,0,0,1,1,"Conaghan, Patrick, MP",279991,"Cowper","Nats","N/A",3787," Im somewhat surprised that the member for Scullin moved this motion, bearing in mind his background in law prior to coming to this place. I assume that with that background he would have experienced, as I did over a period of seven years as a registered migration agent and lawyer, the difficulties with the processing system over the past 10 years. I would have thought that, with that experience, people on the other side of this room, including the member for Scullin, would embrace the changes proposed by the coalition government.Lets take out the hysteria, the rhetoric and the lies that this is privatisation and that jobs will go and lets look at the facts. I will give you an example of a client of mine—a plumber from the UK. He had been a plumber for 20 years. Plumbing was on the skilled occupation list; Australia required plumbers to come here by way of a skilled visa. He came to me and made an application. We put the application in. It took 13 months for that application to be processed. It took 13 months because it was a paper application, it had to be done in triplicate and it was sent to DIMIA, as it was back then, and assigned a case agent. That person had multiple cases at any one time. This proposal seeks to outsource and streamline the process for people like that professional person, who wanted to come to Australia to enrich not only Australia but his own life. They suggest that this is an attempt to privatise. Labor knows that that is untrue. They suggest that people are going to lose jobs. That is untrue. Its a furphy and a ruse—we might as well call it a Labor.Lets look at some more statistics. In the current year to 28 February the refusal rate across these programs was tracking at 3.8 per cent. This has involved a significant and commensurate increase in work effort and time for the department to appropriately assess and decide applications, including spouse applications, contributory parent applications and 457 applications. Despite this growth, the department has achieved greater levels of productivity, finalising more applications than it has received, by encouraging the uptake of online lodgement and enabling data entry through the department, by continually improving systems and processes and by consolidating visas into hubs.The delay was way too long and happening way too often. This move by the coalition should be applauded, and those who are saying it is privatisation and will end in job losses should be condemned.While the increasing movement of people globally brings with it many benefits to Australia, it also brings new threats to our security. This is not just about border protection. In fact, its more about the ability for people to lodge their visas, whether they be humanitarian visas or a spouse visa, and to have those looked at and assessed in a timely fashion. Thats exactly what this government is attempting to do. What Labor is attempting to do is turn it around, clutching at straws and making it into an issue that does not exist. So I welcome this governments policy to bring in a streamlining of the process and I look forward to seeing the numbers of people waiting for those visas reduced significantly.","Migration, Citizenship","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CONAGHAN (Cowper) ","(11:11):"

34,0,0,0,1,1,"Martin, Fiona, MP",282982,"Reid","LP","N/A",3788," I move:That this House:(1) notes that Tuesday, 10 September 2019 was World Suicide Prevention Day;(2) confirms the Governments commitment to work with local communities to reduce the number of deaths by suicide in Australia;(3) further notes the record level of funding of $736 million provided in the 2019-20 budget for mental health including $503.1 million for the Youth Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan to support coordination of Government activities and services including:(a) the largest single expansion of the national Headspace network through the establishment of 36 new sites; and(b) provision of support to farmers and communities that have been affected by drought to deal with the anxiety, stress and uncertainty of drought conditions; and(4) welcomes the establishment of the Office of the National Suicide Prevention Adviser in 2019 to support a whole-of-government approach to suicide prevention, to ensure coordination of delivery of suicide prevention activities that reach Australians in the right way at the right time.I have spoken in this place about the significance of holistic mental health care, an area of specific interest to me due to my experience as a clinician, as a psychologist and also as a researcher in the mental health sphere. It is a tragedy that so many people lose their lives to suicide in this country. World Suicide Prevention Day, which recently took place on 10 September, shone a global spotlight on this issue and has renewed our sense of commitment as a government to take real and effective action. We, the Morrison government, are doing more than any other previous government to safeguard the mental health of Australians, with funding expected to reach $5.3 billion this year alone.Mental illness is the leading cause of both disability and premature death in Australia, costing the Australian economy an estimated four per cent of our GDP or approximately $68 billion per year. It is not the economic cost that is of greatest concern but the cost to our communities and to our families. Investing in mental health and suicide prevention is not a choice; it is a must. The $736 million provided in the 2019-20 budget for mental health will fund the development of an accessible, equitable and integrated mental health system through various targeted strategies. Through an integrated approach, the government plans to expand the capacity to provide targeted assistance to priority populations, directing focused care towards those most vulnerable to poor mental health or suicide due to complex cultural, social and environmental factors.The positive impact of the Youth Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan is already being felt across Australia. While suicide remains the leading cause of death among people aged 15 to 24, this is why $503.1 million has been dedicated to practical steps to expand resources and prevention strategies to young people of vulnerable mental health. This is apparent through the strengthening of the headspace network and by dedicating $11.8 million to a range of initiatives to help parents recognise when their children are struggling, to improve mental health skills training in schools, to enhance peer support networks and to boost counselling services for young people. Often times, young people feel most comfortable initially speaking to and seeking out help from their peers. Providing the resources to enable resilience through peer support is an important part of empowering young Australians in the mental health space. We are providing $2.9 million to batyr to boost the role of peers to encourage others to seek help, $400,000 for the Banksia Project to expand the innovative community program and $600,000 for a trial of peer workers in Beyond Blues Way Back suicide aftercare service. Earlier this year, I joined the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, and Minister Hunt in my electorate of Reid at Burwood Girls High School, where we saw batyr conduct a workshop and watched students respond to their stories of recovery from peers their age. That was incredibly powerful.It is important that we acknowledge that certain communities are at greater risk of serious mental illness or suicide. For this reason, the Morrison government is providing further funding to improve mental health support for our farmers and communities in rural and regional areas that have been impacted by drought: we recognise that drought conditions can cause anxiety, stress and uncertainty for those directly affected. This is also why $15 million is being set aside for Indigenous suicide prevention. We are empowering young Indigenous leaders to create a national plan for culturally appropriate care, services and programs.Within all of these initiatives, the government is working to close the evidence policy gap in this area of mental health by drawing on innovative research and expert knowledge. I commend the establishment of the office of, which will guide and uphold a whole-of-government approach to suicide prevention. The National Suicide Prevention Adviser, Ms Morgan, is working across federal departments and states and territories to ensure that all services are coordinated and reach Australians who need them. This is the first step in bringing a whole-of-government approach to suicide prevention and to addressing the psychosocial factors involved.","World Suicide Prevention Day","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr MARTIN (Reid) ","(11:16):"

37,0,0,0,1,1,"Claydon, Sharon, MP",248181,"Newcastle","ALP","N/A",3789," I second the motion, and I thank the member for Reid for bringing the motion before the House today. Its very fitting that last Thursday was World Mental Health Day and that the theme was working together to prevent suicide. Theres not a single community that hasnt been impacted by suicide. Indeed, there are precious few Australians who dont have direct personal experience of someone close to them taking their own lives. One life lost to suicide is one too many. But the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics numbers show that 3,046 intentional self-harm deaths occurred last year in 2018. Suicide is now the 14th highest cause of death in Australia. As shocking as these figures are, they dont come close to describing the enormity of the crisis facing our country. For every death by suicide, as many as 30 more people attempt to end their lives. There are too many people in profound pain.We also need to recognise that there are some groups of people who are overrepresented in mental health statistics including suicide rates. Three-quarters of deaths by suicide are men and the rate of male suicide is growing. Men in regional and remote communities are particularly vulnerable, especially where there is a lack of service and support to help them through those challenges. But, even where the services are available, men are less likely to reach out for help. In fact, roughly one man engages with a mental health service when they need it for every three women who do.Young people are another vulnerable group who are overrepresented in the suicide statistics. Tragically, it is the leading cause of death for people aged 15 to 24. I welcome the governments commitment to establish new headspace centres. The waiting times that young people are facing to access headspaces services are way too long. The government must now deliver on its important commitment as a matter of urgency.Our First Nations communities are another deeply vulnerable community disproportionately impacted by suicide. In fact, the death rate from suicide for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is double the national rate. Almost half of Australias child suicides have been First Nations children. This is an unspeakable tragedy that rests on all our shoulders. We have failed to protect these precious children. We need to work on finding solutions in partnerships with communities and increase our investment in Aboriginal-led mental health services.More broadly, the government also needs to act on the recommendations of the National Mental Health Commissions 2019 report on mental health and suicide prevention. This includes the collection of high-quality data on high-risk community groups including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; undertaking a national mental health services gaps analysis; implementing a national mental health workforce strategy; and addressing the broader social and economic factors contributing to mental ill health and suicide.Id like to commend the government for creating a new role of National Suicide Prevention Adviser to the Prime Minister, which is ably filled by Christine Morgan, CEO of the National Mental Health Commission. Ms Morgan is supported by Jaelea Skehan, herself an internationally respected expert in the field. Jaelea was formerly the director of Everymind, a mental health and suicide prevention organisation in my electorate of Newcastle. I have known Jaelea and her extraordinary work for many years now. She is a compassionate and fiercely committed champion for mental health and suicide prevention. I know she will be an asset, helping the government to work towards its very worthy goal of reducing suicide to zero.Id also like to recognise all the incredible community organisations who work on the front line every day providing support and assistance to people when they need it most. Of course, this includes mental health services and those directly focused on suicide reduction, but its also the womens shelters, the financial counsellors, the community legal centres, the drug and alcohol services, the domestic violence support programs and so many more that are fulfilling the vital role of supporting people when problems seem too much to bear. But, sadly, while more and more people are struggling to keep their heads above water, our community sector has been stretched to breaking point. We need to recognise that, without a strong and properly funded community sector, we simply wont be able to turn this crisis around. I urge the government to invest properly in frontline services that will be absolutely critical to addressing the crisis.","World Suicide Prevention Day","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CLAYDON (Newcastle) ","(11:21):"
38,0,0,0,1,1,"Falinski, Jason, MP","G86","Mackellar","LP","N/A",3791," I rise today to speak about an issue I wish we did not have to speak about. Suicide is the leading cause of death for Australians aged between 15 and 44. This simply is not good enough. On 10 September, it was World Suicide Prevention Day, a day aimed at eradicating that awful statistic. We cannot stay silent on an issue such as this. Suicide accounts for more deaths among our youth than car accidents. We lose eight Australians every single day—one person every three hours—to this horrendous epidemic. Even one life lost is one life too many.The coalition government has made mental health a priority, with a record level of funding in the 2019-20 budget: $503 million for the Youth Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Plan, the largest suicide prevention strategy in Australias history. This funding was, and always will be, about saving lives. The Morrison government is committed to working towards zero suicides. This government is committed to working with local communities to reduce the number of deaths by suicide.In the Mackellar community, Man Anchor is a local organisation that is dedicated to the enlightenment of the modern man on a range of subjects through advocating for mens mental health. Through Man Anchor, Im a proud #letstalk ambassador, encouraging men to talk about mental health struggles. Gotcha4Life is another excellent organisation in Mackellar that was established to reverse the tide of declining mental health and reduce suicide in men and boys. Gotcha4Life believes in healthy masculinity, giving men and boys the tools to start meaningful conversations by developing better social and emotional connections with their mates, families and community.In 2019 alone, tragically, there have been seven youth suicides in my electorate of Mackellar—seven that I am aware of, seven young lives with the world at their feet, seven families that will never be the same again. We cannot allow this to happen any longer. Investing in suicide prevention is a must.Throughout this year, suicide has hit very close to home on the northern beaches. Avalon Youth Hub is an organisation that walks the walk. It provides on the ground support for friends, peers and families that have lost a loved one to suicide. In the hours, days and months after these awful events, communities struggle. Im proud to represent a community that fights for each other and that comes together in times of need. Thank you to the community groups of Mackellar, many of which I have not had time to mention today, that provide support for those who need it most.The government is providing $375 million to fund an additional 30 headspaces nationwide. Headspace is doing an excellent job of providing youth-friendly services for our young Australians. I will continue to advocate for a headspace on the upper northern beaches, where it is much needed, to ensure that adolescents in Mackellar have accessible and relatable mental health services.The government has committed $33.8 million over four years to enhance and increase the responsiveness of Lifelines telephone crisis support line. Im honoured to have John Brogden and his wife, Lucy Brogden, as constituents of mine. All the efforts that they have made to ensuring that this service is world leading has helped so many avoid the scourge of suicide. Lifeline is a service that has proved to work and to save lives.We are committed to real solutions that will work to prevent suicide. A further $12 million for the National Suicide Prevention Research Fund, managed by Suicide Prevention Australia, will support targeted research. There has been $15 million invested in the creation of a real-time suicide and self-harm monitoring system, giving communities data needed to provide rapid assistance when and where it is needed.","World Suicide Prevention Day","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FALINSKI (Mackellar) ","(11:26):"
39,0,0,0,1,1,"McBride, Emma, MP",248353,"Dobell","ALP","N/A",3792," I would like to thank the member for Reid for raising the important issue of suicide prevention, and I acknowledge the members experience as a clinician and researcher in mental health. As the member for Reid noted, last Thursday was World Mental Health Day. The theme of the day was Working together to prevent suicide. Tragically, as others in this House have noted, in 2018, 3,046 Australians died by suicide; eight Australians die by suicide each day; men are three times more likely to die by suicide than women; and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are more likely to die by suicide than the overall population.The governments goal of reducing suicide to zero, along with the appointment of Christine Morgan as National Suicide Prevention Adviser to the Prime Minister, is commendable. Labor also welcomed the governments election commitments to expand and improve headspace services and other child and youth mental health services across Australia. However, as Suicide Prevention Australia noted when releasing its recent report, Turning Points:Imagine a World Without Suicide:Suicide prevention is complex and it needs to be addressed as a whole-of-government issue because its more than a health issue… a fragmented and mental illness-specific approach alone doesnt work.Suicide Prevention Australia is:…focused on an integrated approach to suicide prevention encompassing mental health, social, economic and community factors.In September, the National Mental Health Commission released its National Report 2019 on Australias mental health and suicide prevention system, which included a number of recommendations to improve outcomes. Like Suicide Prevention Australia, the National Mental Health Commission recommends a whole-of-government approach to mental health and suicide prevention. This broad approach ensures factors which impact individuals mental health and wellbeing, such as housing, employment, education and social justice, are addressed alongside the delivery of mental health care.I particularly want to focus today on the importance of addressing the social and economic factors that contribute to poor mental health and to increased rates of suicide. As its known, suicide is an individual act—but the rate of suicide is the property of a community. I note that this week is Anti-Poverty Week. As Sir Michael Marmot, Professor of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London, saysin The Health Gap: The Challenge of an Unequal Worldthat what goes on in the mind is profoundly influenced by the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age and by the inequities in power, money and resources that influence these conditions of daily life. If we want a well society with a diminishing suicide rate, we must address the social factors that contribute to suicidality. Affordable housing, access to quality education and access to affordable health care are all social determinants that contribute to an individuals sense of self-worth and overall wellbeing.The pursuit of economic policies which further marginalise disadvantaged groups will undermine any attempts to reduce the rates of suicide, however well intentioned they may be. In The Health Gap, Sir Michael Marmot cites research by a group from Oxford University across a number of European countries which showed that rises in unemployment rates were correlated with rises in suicide rates, and, importantly, that the size of this effect was inversely related to the countries level of spending on social protections, including unemployment benefits, active labour market programs, family support and health care.I say again, as I said on World Mental Health Day: its time for genuine bipartisan action on suicide prevention. In this spirit, I call on the government to look to the recommendations of the National Mental Health Commission 2019 report and: commit to the collection of high-quality data, particularly on the scope of disorders and high-risk community groups, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders; undertake a national mental health service gaps analysis and implement a national mental health workforce strategy; address the broader social and economic factors that contribute to mental ill-health and suicide; fix the NDIS so that the streamlined access for people with psychosocial disability is working, and keep delivering support for those who are ineligible for the NDIS; make sure all relevant government departments—health, education, justice, social services and housing—are responsible for the design and implementation of all future national suicide prevention strategies.In closing: I spent 10 years of my life working in mental health inpatient units. Ive seen the circumstances of peoples lives—the crises and the tragedies that bring them in to mental health services. But what we must remember—and, in closing, I will again use the words of Sir Michael Marmot—is this: why treat people and send them back to the conditions that made them sick?","World Suicide Prevention Day","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms McBRIDE (Dobell) ","(11:31):"
40,0,0,0,1,1,"Thompson, Phillip, MP",281826,"Herbert","LNP","N/A",3793," Id like to start by acknowledging the people here today and around the country who have a lived experience both of mental illness and of suicide, and I especially acknowledge the people who have been bereaved by suicide. This is something that is very close to my heart.I would also like to start by saying that there shouldnt be a divide. We should all be working together on this important issue. There is not one side and another. We are, and need to be, the fire in the middle that brings everyone together so that were working and going in the one direction. I think we owe it to the people of Australia to all be working together on suicide prevention.This is something that, as a former Defence Force member and a veteran, has impacted on my life quite regularly. Only recently, the day after Anzac Day, I was notified via a phone call that a friend of mine, Brad Carr, had died by suicide. I was with the Prime Minister at the time, and we were walking up to do a press conference. I took a minute. I had the PM throw his support around me and say, You dont have to go on if you dont want to. You dont have to go to the press pack. I thought the best way to honour my friends who have died is to go on, and it is to push into being uncomfortable, because I truly believe that we should all be working together, and I truly believe that, if we dont talk about suicide and if we dont talk about mental illness, we will only go backwards. I did the press conference. They didnt know. I then spoke with the Prime Minister further about it, and then with the mother of Brad Carr.Its so distressing that our community in the north has these high suicide rates and that the Defence Force and the veteran community have high suicide rates. But I want to be very clear: its not a veteran issue or a defence issue—its a societal problem. Thats the only way we should be and need to be looking at it. This isnt about a time where we just wear a pin or a badge, or say, Are you okay? on one day, or talk about suicide on a specific day. Its about how we do it every day. How do we work together every day to ensure that everyone is okay? We only have one life, and its extremely important.There are so many services in Townsville, but I want to highlight just one today, and that is the Townsville Suicide Prevention Network. The TSPN website says:The Townsville Suicide Prevention Network (TSPN) plays a key role in coordination, collaboration and resource exchange within the Townsville area to build our community’s capacity as a foundation for the development of effective suicide prevention initiatives.TSPN is an unincorporated association auspiced by selectability.TSPN was established in 2015 in response to continuing high rates of suicide in our city.The broad-based membership of TSPN includes people with lived experience, government and non-government organisations, community groups, sporting clubs, students, academics, mental health professionals, small and large businesses, and any concerned individuals. TSPN have facilitated the development of a community action plan to prevent suicide in Townsville. The website continues:TSPN adheres to the LIFE Framework (Living is for Everyone) – Australia’s national framework for suicide prevention which provides a national strategy for action based on the best available evidence to guide activities aimed at reducing the rate at which people take their own lives.The LIFE Framework is based on the understanding that: • suicide prevention activities will do no harm • that there will be community ownership and responsibility for action to prevent suicide • that service delivery will be client-centred The work of the TSPN has been guided by the Queensland Suicide Prevention Action Plan 2015 – 2017 (currently in review) – a plan that aims to reduce suicide and its impact on Queenslanders, and is a step towards achieving a 50 per cent reduction in suicides in Queensland within a decade.The Queensland Suicide Prevention Action Plan outlines priorities that include stronger community awareness, improved service system responses, focused support, and a stronger and more accessible evidence base to drive continuous improvements.I want to highlight that suicide prevention is everyones responsibility. I feel that sometimes we forget that. I also feel that we need to be working together. This is all of our responsibility. Every life matters.","World Suicide Prevention Day","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr THOMPSON (Herbert) ","(11:36):"
41,0,0,0,1,1,"Haines, Helen, MP",282335,"Indi","IND","N/A",3794," I thank the member for Reid for moving this important motion today. Well hear about the shocking rates of suicide and mental illness in our society many times today. For me, and for so many other Australians, World Suicide Prevention Day is deeply personal, and I acknowledge the collective grief of our nation. My husbands brother, Pete, a young doctor with a wife and two little children, died by suicide one Saturday morning 17 years ago. He had the whole medical profession at his disposal, yet he could not be saved. Mental illness is complex. For every death by suicide it is estimated that as many as 30 people attempt to end their lives. That is approximately 65,000 suicide attempts each year across our nation.I acknowledge the record spend by this government, but the reality remains that mental health receives around 5.25 per cent of the overall health budget, while representing 12 per cent of the total burden of disease. We need to do much more. And, mostly, we need to do much more in regional Australia. Rural Australians experience a higher suicide rate than those living in cities, despite their comparable prevalence of psychological distress. At any given time, rates of suicide increase with increasing rurality. The most recent AIHW mortality report shows that 15- to 24-year-old males in regional areas are 1.8 times more likely to end their life by suicide than their urban counterparts, and the incidence is up to six times higher in very remote areas. Structural factors including unemployment, isolation and barriers to mental health care all contribute to this outcome.In my electorate of Indi, where the suicide rate is 40 per cent higher than the state average, towns like Benalla have more than double the state average number of registered mental health patients. Our services are stretched to breaking point. When I visited Corryong recently, Dominic Sandilands, the CEO of Corryong Health—previously known as Upper Murray Health and Community Services—told me that they have one mental health nurse and she is past retirement age. She continues to work because they cannot find a replacement.In the few short months since I was elected, Ive been inundated with stories like this about how the mental health system is failing my constituents. I heard recently from a man called Jeremy—Ill call him Jeremy, but thats not his real name. Jeremys son was one such young person. On a Tuesday evening in July, Jeremys son attempted to take his life. Jeremy and his wife found him and took him immediately to the local hospital. That hospital did not have the facilities to care for him, so he was sent to the larger hospital 90 minutes away. But it could not admit him for care, because he was outside the catchment zone. He was sent home. In desperation, Jeremy called the next-biggest regional health service north of his town and was told that they were not in his zone either; it stopped 20 kays short of their house. They were instructed to drive two hours to the health service west of them where, mistakenly, they were again told they were in the wrong zone. They drove another hour to the next town where the mistake was realised and, unbelievably, they turned their car around and returned to the last place, where, finally, he was admitted.My office alerted the state government minister to this terrible merry-go-round and I am happy to say that those boundaries have now been relaxed and the respective health services have been alerted. I congratulate the Victorian minister for such speedy intervention, but there are countless other barriers that go unreported. The mental health care system is failing people in country Australia. I truly commend the governments focus on mental health and I also want to work with the government—work together, collaboratively, across this nation—but, when people in regional Australia are still without critical services, I want to say we need to do more.","World Suicide Prevention Day","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr HAINES (Indi) ","(11:42):"
42,0,0,0,1,1,"van Manen, Bert, MP",188315,"Forde","LNP","N/A",3796," I wish to firstly thank the member for Reid for bringing this motion to the House. Im sure that many of my colleagues who have contributed to this debate, and others in this place, know somebody who at some stage in their life has been affected by mental illness or have lived with somebody with mental illness—or, worse still, been affected by suicide.Last week we marked mental health awareness week and it was a timely reminder to all of us of the important roles communities play in suicide prevention and, more broadly, in mental health. In my travels across my electorate Im constantly reminded of the lifesaving work of individuals, organisations and support services in my community. Whether it is a mental health service provider, or headspace, or the work done in our schools, particularly with our chaplaincy services, many groups play a crucial role in suicide prevention and assisting with mental health. Importantly, our sporting clubs also provide a lot of support, and that support is sometimes unrecognised.On World Suicide Prevention Day, we as communities come together across the world to unite, not only to create greater awareness of suicide and suicide prevention, but also to change the way it is understood and discussed in the community and to connect people to support services. Of great concern to me as a father of two young men is that one in four young Australians aged 16 to 24 experience mental illness in any given year. Sadly, Ive seen that much closer to home than I would wish. One in four is a distressing and heartbreaking statistic and one I certainly hope we can change in this term of parliament.As I mentioned earlier, there are a number of support organisations across my electorate of Forde. One of them is Canefields Clubhouse at Meadowbrook, which provides valuable membership based services to adults living with mental illness. Canefields Clubhouse follows the international clubhouse model, which is person-centred and focused on providing meaningful work and socialisation for individuals living with mental health issues. It was a humbling and rewarding experience to join the Prime Minister and visit Canefields to get a real idea of how they are not only changing lives but also saving lives each and every day.Another terrific service in our local community is Brook RED in Beenleigh. The centre offers a number of recovery orientated group activities and one-on-one peer support. The peer support at Brook RED is based on a foundation of having a shared experience of working towards recovery with a mental health focus. This shared experience of recovering is what brings people together as a community and is crucial in the fight to save lives. I am pleased to say that the government is delivering $1.6 million to Canefields Clubhouse and $2.8 million to Brook RED to ensure these organisations can continue to provide essential mental health support services over the coming years.Equally, headspace at Meadowbrook is helping young people to overcome their mental health challenges and it is building stronger and more resilient youth in my community. In 2018-19, headspace Meadowbrook provided services to over 1,400 young people and provided some 5,600 or more occasions of service. Last week I had the privilege of visiting to see the terrific work theyre doing and to speak with some of their amazing staff and volunteers.Im also pleased to say that, as a result of the continued growth in the northern Gold Coast part of my electorate, we made a commitment during the election to fund a new headspace in Upper Coomera to the tune of $750,000 over three years from 2019-20 and $1 million over four years from 2020-21.Lastly, I want to recognise one of my sporting clubs, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks. Eagleby Giants junior rugby league club hold the annual Ky Boss suicide awareness game in recognition of a young man who committed suicide five or so years ago. The important part of that day is the message that its not weak to speak and share your concerns.

43,0,0,0,1,1,"Freelander, Mike, MP",265979,"Macarthur","ALP","N/A",3797," I wish to thank the member for Reid, Dr Martin, for raising this very important issue. I want to commend all the other speakers who have spoken on this issue, including my friend and colleague the member for Dobell, who had long-term experience working in a mental health unit at her local hospital as a pharmacist. I have dealt with suicide on a professional basis since I started my paediatric career, and I indeed remember some of the kids that I looked after who ultimately suicided. I know that their suicides have had a huge effect on their families and on our wider community. On a personal level, Ive also had involvement with a family member who suicided and I know how deeply and profoundly its affected my family.I do agree that this is an issue for bipartisanship. And I do agree that the government should be congratulated on its focus on mental health. However, I dont think that at the present time we have the right answer. For example, my view is that suicide, whilst it is a complex issue, is often due to a lack of connection. We can see that in the way that the incidents of suicide have slowly increased in the last few years. We can see that in the defence forces. The risk of suicide is not so much when people are a member of the defence forces; its when they leave. Their feelings of isolation, I feel sure, have a significant impact on the risk of suicide for people who leave the defence forces. I think there is much to be done to try to address that.I think we can see it also in the young people who suicide, particularly young males, and in the difficulties they face in this current society in education, in getting a job and even in things like getting stable housing. These difficulties all increase, I think, the risk of suicide. The answer is not necessarily putting a headspace in every suburb. Its rather in how we increase peoples connection to society in general.I think desperately of a boy who I looked after, Liam. I looked after him when he was born and during the subsequent difficulties that he faced. He surmounted some incredible difficulties and did very well. But it was when he left school and had difficulty getting a tertiary education and difficulty getting into the workforce that his troubles really reached a peak and he ultimately suicided. But, prior to his suicide, hed had 17 admissions to our local hospitals mental health unit. In those 17 admissions, the people who cared for him did not care for him once he was discharged, and there was no adequate discharge plan in place when he left hospital. I think thats something that were missing a lot. There is often a lack of connection between the mental health services provided in our hospitals and mental health units and the mental health services provided in the community. There is much to be done in terms of improving our communication networks for those that have mental illness. I think desperately of the things that perhaps I couldve done to change that outcome.I know that many people who are admitted to hospital with severe mental illness lose the ability to be followed up once they go back into the community. They often face enormous troubles getting into the education system, enormous difficulties getting stable housing and enormous difficulties getting mental health treatment that provides for them in an ongoing, meaningful way. Im talking about things like help with continuing to take their medications, for example. Its very common for people with severe mental illness to be discharged on medication and then have difficulty following on with that after discharge.Theres much more to be done. Whilst I congratulate the government for its efforts, we need to do much more to improve communication between our services.","World Suicide Prevention Day","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[5]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr FREELANDER (Macarthur) ","(11:51):"

This bill makes changes that are designed to keep Australians safe. It implements a COAG agreement to ensure a presumption that neither bail nor parole will be granted to those persons who have demonstrated support for, or who have links to, terrorist activity. This decision followed the terrorist attack in Brighton, Victoria in June 2017. The perpetrator of that attack was on parole for state offences and had previously been charged with conspiracy to commit a terrorist attack.The bill amends the existing presumption against bail in section 15AA of the Crimes Act so that it covers persons charged with or convicted of a terrorism offence. In addition, the bill introduces a presumption against parole for a broader group of offenders, including persons charged with or convicted of a terrorism offence; persons who are the subject of a control order; and persons who have made statements or carried out activities supporting, or advocating support for, terrorist acts. This will further protect the wider community and ensure that individuals are not prematurely released on parole.The bill also amends section 19AG of the Crimes Act to require a court, when sentencing a terrorist offender who is under the age of 18, to fix a non-parole period of three-quarters of the head sentence unless the court is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist to justify a shorter non-parole period. In determining whether exceptional circumstances exist, the court must have regard to the protection of the community as the paramount consideration and the best interests of the child as a primary consideration.Many submitters expressed concerns about this amendment, noting Australias responsibilities under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, or the CRC, and the recommendation by the INSLM that section 19AG should not apply to children. With respect to those arguments, coalition members of the committee were of the view that the paramount duty of the parliament is to keep its citizens as safe as possible from external and internal threats.While international treaties are persuasive in developing public policy, they should not be simply adopted where their application could prejudice the parliaments duty to its citizens and thus undermine Australias sovereignty. Furthermore, the CRC was ratified some 29 years ago, and, whilst child terrorism was not unknown at that time, counterterrorism was not a policy imperative at that time.This echoes the comments of Prime Minister Scott Morrison in his Lowy speech on 3 October 2019, which I quote now:We should avoid any reflex towards a negative globalism that coercively seeks to impose a mandate from an often ill defined borderless global community. And worse still, an unaccountable internationalist bureaucracy.Globalism must facilitate, align and engage, rather than direct and centralise. As such an approach can corrode support for joint international action.Only a national government, especially one accountable through the ballot box and the rule of law, can define its national interests. We can never answer to a higher authority than the people of Australia.I and coalition members of the committee affirm and support this sentiment from the Prime Minister.Schedule 2 of the bill provides that exculpatory material does not need to be included in a continuing detention order application where the material would be the subject of a claim for public interest immunity. The committee has recommended amendments so that the onus is on the Australian federal police minister to satisfy the court that any excluded exculpatory information is protected by public interest immunity. This addresses the concerns raised by submitters whilst ensuring that the intended aim of the amendment is achieved.Following the implementation of this recommendation, the committee strongly recommends that the bill be passed. I commend the report to the House.","Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (2019 Measures No. 1) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"
51,0,0,0,1,1,"Dreyfus, Mark, MP","HWG","Isaacs","ALP","N/A",3800," by leave—There was one area of disagreement between the Labor and Liberal members of the committee. On that issue, the additional comment from Labor members which is annexed to the committee report speaks for itself. I would stress that it is an additional comment. It is not a dissenting report. Its an additional comment which notes the different position that was reached in respect of an aspect of the bill. Otherwise, Labors view is that the bill should be supported. I will elaborate on the comments that are made by Labor members in their additional comment when the time comes to debate the bill.Rather than speaking about the bill today, Id like to use this time to talk about the conduct of the Department of Home Affairs during the committees inquiry. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security heard that 52 offenders are currently serving periods of imprisonment for terrorism offences. As recounted in the committees report, the committee repeatedly sought further information on these offenders from the Department of Home Affairs and asked that, to the extent possible, the information be provided in the form of a public submission. In response, the Department of Home Affairs provided the committee with a classified supplementary submission that set out the requested information. As this report tabled today notes, it is the strong preference of the committee that it be able to report in as public and as transparent a manner as possible. The department chose to adopt an approach that made the committees job harder than it needed to be by refusing to provide it with the information it requested in the form in which it was requested. Weve seen similar examples of this sort of behaviour from the same department in other inquiries that are currently being conducted by the intelligence committee.This is not a partisan criticism. Liberal members of the committee have also expressed their concern about the departments conduct during this inquiry. The bipartisan report that we are tabling today notes, The committee was disappointed by the lack of support the Department of Home Affairs showed the committee and the parliament in its repeated refusal to provide any of the requested information in a public submission. The departments refusal to provide the requested information in the form of a public submission was not only obstructionist and unacceptable; it was also absurd. All of the information the committee requested is available on public databases and most of it is readily available, in a consolidated form, on the website of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, an agency that forms part of the Attorney-Generals Department.I raised my and the committees concerns about the departments unhelpfulness with the Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs during a public hearing on 20 September 2019 in the context of the committees inquiry into the impact of law enforcement and intelligence powers on the freedom of the press. I noted that, during the press freedom inquiry, the department had emphasised that it did not inappropriately classify information. I asked the secretary how such a claim could be regarded as credible if the department was not even prepared to provide the committee in a public submission with information that other government agencies have made available on their websites. In response, the secretary agreed to look into the matter personally. The committee subsequently received a further submission from the Department of Home Affairs to this inquiry. That submission annexed the document from the CDPPs website. The committee resolved to accept this as a public submission. The departments supplementary submission was still not good enough but it is a lot better than its initial refusal to provide any information at all on the public record. For the benefit of members of the public, the media and the parliament, and in the interests of encouraging an informed public debate on counterterrorism issues, the committee has included the departments supplementary submission in appendix C of this report.The Department of Home Affairs is now the primary Commonwealth department responsible for the legislation that the Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is required to review and for the agencies that the committee is required to oversee. It is vital for the smooth and effective working of the committee that the department provides adequate support for all of the committees activities. The only alternative would be for the committees staffing and resources to be dramatically increased. Historically, the committee has been able to rely on the department, which was formerly responsible for most of the legislation and agencies relevant to the intelligence and security committee, namely, the Attorney-Generals Department. My hope is that, from now on, the Department of Home Affairs will accept and properly fulfil the supportive role previously played by the Attorney-Generals Department. The committee should not be required to, in effect, publicly shame the secretary of the Department of Home Affairs in order for the department to provide basic assistance to the parliament, nor should the Minister for Home Affairs allow the secretary to be placed in such a position. Clearly the Minister for Home Affairs has failed to make it clear to his department that officials who appear before parliamentary inquiries are there to assist the parliament, not to obstruct it. The Minister for Home Affairs should make this very basic point clear to his department so that we do not see a repeat of what we saw during this inquiry.I commend the report to the House.","Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (2019 Measures No. 1) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DREYFUS (Isaacs) ","(12:02):"
52,0,0,0,1,1,"Giles, Andrew, MP",243609,"Scullin","ALP","N/A",3802," I rise to speak on the New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019. I note that the Morrison government claims that the aim of this legislation, and matters already dealt with, is to change the geographic make-up of visa holders by increasing the number of people settling outside of major cities in regional Australia.Labor supports this bill. However, we do have some serious concerns that this legislation and the matters connected to it have not all been properly thought through and that there are elements which have been poorly drafted and which could have serious, presumably unintended, consequences.We are also seriously concerned that this once again demonstrates that this is a government of tactics and not strategy, and of marketing over substance—in the very image of its leader. We see this today on this very issue, with stories across the papers about increases in regional visas granted—and accompanying self-congratulation. But these reports dont withstand close scrutiny. As experts have noted, these figures, in significant part, reflect wider underresourcing and incompetence, leading to processing delays. These processing delays are something that we on this side are all too well aware of; they go right across the visa system and into cruel delays in the granting of citizenship.It would also be helpful if this debate was rather more informed by evidence. We understand, on this side of the House, that the granting of the visa begins the journey to settlement and full contribution and participation. It doesnt resolve all those questions; it doesnt resolve them at all. It should be resolved—as just one example—by reviews undertaken by Peter Shergold into integration, employment and settlement outcomes for refugees and humanitarian entrants. But, of course, despite having had the report since February, the government still hasnt released its findings. These findings would be critically important for the particular challenges of ensuring that settlement works in regional communities. So I move now an amendment to the motion for the second reading of this bill:That all words after That be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:the House notes the Governments failure to:(1) adequately fund settlement services; and(2) explain what extra services will be made available to support regional communities and the settlement of migrants under this scheme.The Morrison government has failed to produce a real plan for settlement and has failed to deliver infrastructure to meet the needs of our economy and our society. There has been no response to the very important report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport and Cities—a unanimous report—Building up & moving out. This shows six years of neglect in this third-term government.This bill picks up on a definition of regional Australia that is: Not to be residing in Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane or the Gold Coast or Perth. Obviously, thats a lot of Australia, and I will return to that in my comments. Obviously, this definition is not a creature of the bill but it is fundamental to its operation and to the operation of the visa categories that it relates specifically to. These are: subclass 491, skilled work regional (provisional) visa, for skilled people nominated by a state or territory government or sponsored by an eligible family member to live and work in regional Australia—as defined; and subclass 494, skilled employer sponsored regional (provisional) visas, enabling an Australian business to sponsor skilled workers to work in their business in regional Australia. Holders of these visas will be required to live in regional areas for three years; after which, they will become eligible for a permanent visa.These visas are a new concept in Australian immigration law, as you would be well aware, Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou—a provisional permanent visa. This is an important event for this parliament to give due consideration to. I will return to that. These visas will account for 23,000 places out of the 160,000 permanent places available each year. It is important on this point to remember that the Morrison government, to much fanfare earlier this year, announced, as part of its plan for Australias future population, a reduction in the permanent visa migration ceiling, from 190,000 to 160,000—I will return to this figure later—because this government wants Australians to believe that its cutting immigration, but this is simply not the case. The truth is that the Morrison government has no real plan for population policy in Australia.The government claims these new visas and requirements will encourage visa holders to remain in regional Australia which, in turn, will support local communities and enhance the economies of regional parts of the nation, which is a laudable objective and one which is shared, I think, by all of us in this place. The bill directly gives effect to the government policy that holders of provisional skilled regional visas, which will come into effect on 16 November, will have access to social security payments and other government services as if they were holders of permanent visas in line with the current arrangements applicable to permanent resident visas. The following legislation picks up on this and is amended by this bill: A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999, Disability Services Act 1986, Fair Entitlements Guarantee Act 2012, Higher Education Support Act 2003, National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013, Paid Parental Leave Act 2010 and, most significantly, Social Security Act 1991.The key amendment thats been made here is to the definition of Australian resident in section 7(2) of the Social Security Act. Proposed subparagraph 7(2)(b)(iia) would have the effect of including holders of provisional skilled regional visas in this definition, which would make them eligible for payments under the Social Security act and also for family payments, paid parental leave and farm household support. It would also make it possible that other non-permanent visa holders may in the future be so eligible. This concept—that people on a temporary visa should have entitlements such as those generally associated with permanent visa holders—is a significant one. It marks a significant departure from past practice and is worth emphasising here, especially in the context of Australias drift away from a migration framework which is predicated on paths to permanency. This is a debate that has been too little recognised in this place, and it is my hope that this debate here on this legislation will encourage all lawmakers and citizens to reflect on what is happening in Australias immigration story more broadly.The bill would also amend the Social Security Act to provide that provisional skilled regional visa holders be subject to waiting periods in qualifying for eligibility for certain benefits, such as Newstart and carers allowance, on the same terms as permanent visa holders—that is, on the day the provisional visa is granted, not a subsequent permanent visa date.The government has touted that these new visas and, indeed, the population package will bust congestion, but the government has failed to outline in any great detail how it intends to provide support to the 23,000 visa holders who would be living in regional Australia—not a shred of detail. Given this governments track record and the Minister for Home Affairss general mismanagement of his department, we wonder how and if these visas will ever be implemented properly.The Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure has been out trumpeting his new population centre located in the Treasury, and then there was a meeting with all the state treasurers with lots of talk about bottom-up approaches and data sharing, buzzwords all designed to give the impression that the government actually has a plan. But the government still needs to outline what social support networks and services will be made available to support regional communities with an increase in migrant populations and to support long-term and effective settlement and contribution, aspirations which again are shared across this place. But, on this side, we recognise and say directly that youve got to have a decent system of support in places where you want to settle new migrants, even skilled migrants. This is especially important in the present context, because we know all about the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments record of cutting support to settlement services.Of course, nothing in this bill addresses those issues which face regional universities. In 2018, there were more than 869,000 international student enrolments in Australia, of which only three per cent were in regional Australia. The international education market contributed $36 billion to the Australian economy in 2018, but Australias regional universities have been struggling to increase their offerings to international students. The Morrison government has said very, very little about this big economic challenge, neglecting this very significant economic opportunity. So there are very legitimate concerns about the impact of all of this on the international education sector.I draw members attention to the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee on this bill. Again, while Labor supports the bill, a number of concerns were highlighted here and should be addressed, including the threat to Australias international education reputation—specifically, that the government seems to fail to understand the complexity of the issues that must be considered when we make even minor changes to visas that affect Australias international education system. These issues are sufficiently complex such that there can be no quick fix, but the reputation and high standards of the Australian higher education market are a matter of great importance and should be treated as such by this government.We also note that the committee has drawn our attention to an overreliance through this scheme on delegated legislation, which raises not insignificant democratic concerns. There are issues which go back to the importation of the definition of regional Australia into this bill. No plans were put forward to maintain and develop a regional workforce, and questions go to the transfer of existing exemptions for Australian universities. I mentioned earlier that Australias regional universities have been struggling to increase their offerings to the important international student market, and the governments own consultation paper Growing international education in regional Australia has acknowledged the perception that regional institutions have limited offerings and other related matters. We have been paying very careful attention to this and are conscious that they be supported to develop this offer whilst not putting the reputation of standards of international education here at risk.Since the coalition governments funding freeze ended the demand-driven system, Australian universities have of course been forced to turn to the international market to balance their budgets. Its been reported that RMIT University generates 40 per cent of its total revenue from international student fees, and that some of the elite, research intensive Group of Eight universities generate about 35 per cent of their total revenue by the same means. However, some sector experts believe these figures to be understated. With China, India and Nepal making up close to 50 per cent of the market, any change in geopolitical circumstances could place Australian universities in dire straits.In their dissenting report to the Senate inquiry, Labor senators rightly expressed their concern that there had been no advice from the Department of Home Affairs about resourcing compliance of these two new visa subclasses. This is raised in the context of the growth of student numbers from the subcontinent and media reports that the department has raised the student visa risk status of India, Nepal and Pakistan from medium to high on the basis of a number of concerns. Labor senators have asserted, properly, that there is a risk if international students decisions on where to study are driven by visa issues rather than education choices. This is an important point.Australia saw the consequence of these imbalanced incentives previously in 2009, which prompted the focus on quality assurance. As I raised previously, Labor is concerned more broadly by an over reliance on delegated authority. Substantive provisions should generally be enacted by primary and not delegated legislation, but this bill once again highlights the governments reliance on delegated legislation. We note that neither the establishment of the visas themselves nor the locations to which they will apply are part of the legislation but may be subject to change by the minister.Concerns have also been raised by members of the higher education community about the inconsistency in how the minister has defined the designated regional area. I believe that there are concerns that this change may not be driven by the needs of students or with the aim of improving the quality of education in our regional areas, but rather by the prospect of directing funding for political reasons. These concerns have been raised by Griffith University and by the Australian Technology Network of Universities. I quote from them:The Australian Technology Network notes that the regional/rural classification creates some inequalities in relation to Perth being excluded from the definition, while areas such as Canberra, Adelaide and Wollongong would be included. Perth is considered one of the most isolated cities in Australia and as a consequence would be at considerable disadvantage in relation to attracting international students to the state. A reconsideration of this classification would assist in resolving this matter.Griffith University stated:Three state capital cities, Adelaide, Darwin and Hobart as well as the national capital, Canberra, are considered regional for the purposes of Skilled Regional Visas that include International Students. It is particularly difficult to comprehend why Adelaide, with a population of 1.3 million, more than twice that of the Gold Coasts 663,321 according to 2018 data, is considered Regional over the Gold Coast.The seemingly ad hoc manner in which the definition has been applied is of concern and is something that should be carefully looked at, particularly in the context of past actions by this government which have seen university campuses in suburban areas defined as regional and eligible for additional Commonwealth funding. One example of this is Federation University Australias Berwick Campus, just 40 kilometres south-east of Melbourne city centre, which received over $40 million in a program that was designed to support more students at five regionally focused universities over four years.The NTEU has expressed their concerns about issues of rorting and perhaps worker exploitation if left unchecked. The NTEU submission stated:The two provisional skilled visas referred to in this Bill—that is, the Skilled Work Regional (Provisional) (Subclass 491) visa and the Skilled Employer Sponsored Regional (Provisional) (Subclass 494) are specifically created for regional and rural areas, where evidence has been shown the risk of exploitation to be particularly high. This is of significant concern because, as noted, the current provisions to deal with exploitation of temporary workers have proven to be ineffective.This doesnt go to the terms of the bill but to the context within which this bill is being debated and the circumstances of these regional communities. These are matters the government should have paid closer attention to before now and should be addressing now.The Senate inquiry also had concerns raised by the ATN and Rural Councils Victoria that the government has not presented a plan or long-term strategy on how to encourage visa holders to remain in regional communities after a required three-year waiting period is over. This is a fundamental point. Rural Councils Victoria noted specifically that:… changes made at the Federal level to the migrant intake need to work in tandem with State and Local Government programs and initiatives that provide essential support services to new migrants and their communities.It is encouraging that dialogue has begun across Australian governments on this point. But, as has too often been the case, this is simply too late for too many people and too many communities.Sufficient funding, from state and federal governments, needs to be provided for housing support, education and training services and community assistance programs. Without these supports, and without sufficient job opportunities, long-term retention of these workers in regional areas is unlikely—a point that has been made also by Peter McDonald, the governments own population adviser. I say again: while Labor is very supportive of the policy aims and design behind these bills, we are concerned about some of these issues, and, unless the government address those concerns—particularly those raised by the education sector—they should be prepared for unintended consequences. These are matters which should be addressed in advance, not after the fact.I raise, also, some concerns in relation to the existing exemptions for Australian universities. My colleagues Senate minority report to the Senate bill inquiry said:Labor Senators note the recommendation in the Joint University Submission which calls for the existing exemptions that apply to the Employer Nomination Scheme (Subclass 186) and the expansion to the existing exemptions in relation to Age, Skills Assessment and Work experience requirements for Australian University sponsors for professional and managerial positions be made available to the two new visa sub classes.Labor also notes the advice given by Universities Australia to the Senate committee, which advised caution in finalising the settings to ensure that the conditions associated with the new skilled regional visas are not so restrictive as to act as a deterrent to potential visa applicants. This is yet another concern which should have been addressed earlier.I want to also speak about the Morrison governments recent foray into population policy. Just a few weeks ago, the population minister launched a new population centre—within Treasury, oddly enough. Labor of course welcomes a mature debate about population, one that is informed by evidence. Understanding how migrants and international students decide where they settle in Australia and what the government can do to incentivise them into regional areas is an important and worthy aim. Having a population strategy—a proper population strategy—is a must for any government today. Over the next 30 years, our nations population is projected to increase by 50 per cent, and most of this growth will be in our large cities. This reflects economic growth and opportunity and poses policymakers with a big challenge and one that Labor has been grappling with: how do we continue to realise the benefits of agglomeration and maintain livability? This is critical to boosting productivity and also peoples wellbeing.In Melbourne and Sydney, we know that populations will grow from around five million today to eight million by mid-century. We also know that, in the past, the vast majority of migrants settling in Australia have chosen to stay in our big cities. In those cities, we know, the congestion is getting worse. Commuters in Sydney are experiencing a massive 71-minute average journey to and from work each day, and Melburnians spend an average of 65 minutes on their commute. We know that Infrastructure Australia has predicted that road congestion costs in our major cities will more than double by 2031. We know that the Reserve Bank governor has called for infrastructure investment to be brought forward seven times since the election. We know that, despite this, the Morrison government failed to spend a cent from the Urban Congestion Fund in all of 2018-19, even though money was forecast to have been spent in this years budget. All we get from this government are calls for the states and territories to do more. The truth is that this government is using population and migration to cover up for its failures to invest in productive infrastructure. They are trying to hide their failure to bust congestion in our cities by blaming migration.Just last week I was at the FECCA conference, and I heard about a young girl of South Sudanese background who explained that she always stood up on the bus to school because shes anxious that she and, as it was reported, people like her are blamed for crowded public transport and congested roads. How utterly awful! Government members should think about this in terms of how they speak about congestion in our cities and what causes it. People like this girl arent to be blamed for going to school or going to work, so they shouldnt feel blamed. Instead, we need to see from this government some responsibility taken for failures to plan and deliver infrastructure that is fit for purpose.This bill seeks to facilitate measures that are all about the distribution of population. But tinkering around the edges of our visa system wont make a huge difference, especially without a wider plan for resettlement and development to ensure that these changes are lasting. It wont count for much if we fail to increase the attractiveness of our regional areas through greater supports and more economic opportunities. We see no mention from the government of the great challenges of socio-economic inequality posed by some of these questions here, which are huge issues at the moment. I encourage members to look at some of the reporting in the Nine newspapers last week, which really demonstrated the extent of geographic inequality in Australia. There is also no mention of the skills and workforce challenges posed by these questions, or of the health and wellbeing challenges, or of the environment and climate change challenges, and no mention of the failures to adequately invest in infrastructure—created by the governments ineptitude. The reality is, despite its rhetoric on population, the governments policy response has been found wanting time and time again.Returning to an earlier point, the Morrison government claims it is cutting migration. The government clearly likes the political optics of this. It says it has cut permanent migration from 190,000 to 160,000 places. That much is true, but it doesnt reveal the full story. It doesnt show that the temporary migration program, which has been around the order of 700,000 for the last decade or so, is driven by the demand for international student places, the number of working-holiday visa holders and temporary skilled migrants, amongst others.For its COAG processes the government hand-picked an expert, Peter McDonald from the University of Melbourne, who did not offer support for this approach. A study by his school, the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, said of the governments plan to introduce new visas to create incentives for new migrants to settle outside of the major capitals:This is flawed logic … If labour demand remains very strong, at least in the large cities, firms unable to fill that demand from international migration will draw instead upon the rest of Australia …This is a matter that government members should think seriously about. It doesnt go to the worthy aspiration that underpins the measures referred to in this bill but to some of the underlying facts, which have not been addressed.Like most things with this government, the rhetoric simply doesnt meet the reality. The Morrison government has talked a big game when it comes to development in our regions. When an election campaign is on, with media releases to drop and votes to win, we hear about big plans and grand ambition. But when the hard reality of governing comes along, what do we get? Not very much. Proposals to relocate government departments to regional towns dont cut it.Labor understands that both improving regional services and investing in community infrastructure will enable regional cities and towns to grow, and attract and retain the workers needed to power regional economic development that is sustainable. An effective decentralisation strategy requires investment in communities and their infrastructure, including settlement services. While regional cities are developing rapidly as economic and service hubs, like major capitals, they are facing the need for supporting investment in enabling infrastructure. Labor has been a great proponent of creating an office for regional development to provide high-level advice and assessment of regional plans. Thats why, at the last election, we committed to a comprehensive $795 million plan for regional development, to ensure the strength of our regions over time. This government has failed on regional development, and that goes to the heart of meeting the aspirations that are the subject of this bill.Labor will be supporting this bill. We support it because of its aims, not because of the great change, we believe, it will of itself effect in terms of regional settlement. But something is better than nothing. We do think that this bill could be greatly improved if it were connected to a plan to invest in settlement services for our regional areas. We think, in combination with the measures referred to in this bill, that that could better attract and retain migrants in our regional areas, to enable them to build great lives in those communities and to make a great contribution to the future of those regional communities.","New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GILES (Scullin) ","(12:09):"

57,0,0,0,1,1,"Stevens, James, MP",176304,"Sturt","LP","N/A",3809," Its my pleasure to address the House on the New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019, which is fundamental to the governments population policy agenda that we announced back in March, before the election. We are, of course, honouring the commitments from that campaign. This is part of implementing what is a fundamental principle of our approach to population policy in this country, which, first and foremost, is that we simply cannot continue to have a one-size-fits-all approach to population growth and immigration in Australia. We are a big country, an entire continent, and it is not the reality that we have a consistent population growth occurring across the major cities and through to the small towns of this country—far from it. As a South Australian, which Ill touch on a little later in my remarks, I think theres a very stark difference between the challenges of population growth in somewhere like South Australia versus other parts of the country. Clearly, in our major cities, particularly Melbourne but also Sydney and the south-east corner of Queensland, population growth has been very, very strong over recent years and for quite some time. A lot of pressure has been created around that, frankly, because the sorts of investments that needed to occur around infrastructure in particular, simply werent keeping up with the growth rate.In a state such as Victoria, I reflect on the fact that, unfortunately, for most of the last 20 years theres been a Labor government. Theyve had this high rate of population growth, and an enormous pressure created around that, because they havent been investing in the kind of infrastructure thats needed to support and sustain that growth rate. Thankfully, in New South Wales the Liberal Party were elected in 2011 and then in 2015 took a very aggressive infrastructure investment package to subsequent elections. But they are playing catch-up, frankly, and it is very difficult when it comes to population pressures and the infrastructure required when youre not planning ahead—not around electoral cycles, not around pet projects in key seats—but actually around the kind of fundamental infrastructure we need to be planning ahead for many, many, many decades into the future.Thats why, of course, weve got the congestion-busting agenda that we took to the election. This involves investing in some of the major choke points across the country. In my own seat of Sturt, we are lucky to have three very significant projects that are going towards busting congestion and helping relieve the kinds of pressures that we could see coming from increased migration into Adelaide, were it not for us planning ahead and identifying the kinds of choke points that need to be invested in. Ive got the Magill and Portrush roads intersection, the Glen Osmond and Fullarton roads intersection and the Fullarton Road and Cross Road intersection. Those are all being funded by the Morrison and Marshall governments working together to make sure that, as we grow the population in South Australia—which we absolutely support and intend to do—were not being left with infrastructure bottlenecks of the kind that would have occurred if we werent making these decisions with foresight. Through an independent process, were identifying the kinds of choke points in our cities and towns and across our state that we need to be investing in.South Australia has very poor population growth and has had for a very long time, and there is a great amount of risk if we dont seriously address this—not just in South Australia but across a whole range of communities across our country that are seeing low rates of growth. The purpose of this new approach to increasing regional migration is to address the fact that there are parts of the country that have very low population growth rates. The impact of that is going to become very significant in the years and decades to come if we dont do all we can to address that. As a government, thats exactly why were undertaking policy prescriptions like this: to put an emphasis on growing the population in the parts of the country that need it, whilst undertaking an overall reduction to reduce the pressure in other parts of the country, particularly the major cities, that have not been able to match the high levels of population growth with the kinds of investment in social infrastructure, in particular, thats been required.There are two new visas being created. This legislation consequentially addresses both of these visas, which give people a pathway to permanent residency in this country via living in a regional area for a minimum of three years and satisfying some other requirements.We hope, of course, that by undertaking a policy like this and creating these two new categories well see people taking up the opportunity to live in regional parts of Australia, including Adelaide, which is absolutely considered, within the government policy framework, part of this regional classification because its one of the parts of the country that desperately need population growth. These two visa categories, we hope, will see large numbers of people—up to 23,000 people a year—being accepted into this program and living in those areas for three years, and then, through their pathway to permanent residency, we hope, of course, that they will have developed deep ties to the community and stable employment outcomes and theyll continue to live in regional areas well beyond that period of time.South Australia, like many other areas that are classified as regional, has had a very poor population performance for a long, long time. Were growing, on recent figures, at about 0.9 per cent now. Its been 0.8 per cent for a very long period of time, compared to the national average over the last 10 years, which has been 1.6 per cent. So weve been growing at half the national population growth average for an extended period of time. Weve tended to be about seventh out of the eight jurisdictions—the six states and the two territories—for more than 10 years now. Interestingly, whilst other jurisdictions have at times moved quite significantly from different categories within that league table, weve sat consistently at No. 7 for the whole period of time. The Northern Territory at the moment is eighth, but a few years ago it was first. So we have had a very long period of low population growth.The risk to our economy in South Australia if we dont address this is that were going to have an ever-diminishing percentage of our population thats in the workforce and therefore paying taxes, not just nationally but at state level and other taxes, to support—quite rightly, as we should be doing—people, particularly in their retirement, who need government services and need the ratios to be strong so that we can provide the highest standard of living in the world to our citizens. If we dont make sure that weve got a strong percentage of our population in the workforce earning an income and paying the taxes that support those services, were going to be in a lot of trouble in South Australia.Having said that, I note that there is some scope for hope that things are changing in South Australia, and there have been some recent developments that are quite exciting when it comes to being positive about South Australias future not only from a population growth point of view but generally. If were going to grow our population and increase the migrant intake to South Australia, weve got to make sure that were growing the economy and creating jobs for not only migrants coming to South Australia but also our young people who are going through school and other qualifications now and who also need a bright future in South Australia.Before I get to that, I think its also very important to understand that South Australia finally has a proper, robust policy and structure for planning infrastructure investments in our state. This had not been the case for an extended period of time, until the election of a Liberal government last year with a key policy objective to establish Infrastructure South Australia, much modelled on Infrastructure Australia, which weve got at the Commonwealth level. That puts us in a position to do the kind of long-range planning for productive infrastructure for economic growth but also for population growth. If were going to be undertaking initiatives like this legislation that will hopefully see an increase in migration into the state of South Australia, weve got to be planning effectively for that.So Infrastructure South Australia has been formed. It has a very impressive board. It is independent, and its undertaking a long-range 20-year infrastructure plan for the state of South Australia that will ensure that were planning for the kind of infrastructure that we need as we hopefully are growing and increasing our population while also growing our economy. This 20-year forward infrastructure plan, which will be announced early next year, will have five-year increments, again overseen by Infrastructure SA, so that we are always in a position to invest in the kind of infrastructure that South Australia needs to support an increase in our population and growth in our economy.The federal government have made some very important decisions in recent times that are going to see a significant increase, we hope, in demand for people to move to South Australia because the economy is growing and we are creating jobs. The obvious one, of course, is the defence decision around the capital procurement of surface and subsurface vessels. The $90 billion naval shipbuilding program, based at the Osborne Shipyards in South Australia, is for 12 Attack class submarines to replace the Collins class submarines, going from six to 12; and nine future frigates built by British Aerospace, based on the type 26 anti-submarine warfare frigates, to slowly but surely replace the Anzac class. The scale of this means thousands upon thousands of jobs—thousands of direct jobs and even thousands more indirect jobs around supply chain, and then, of course, all the other multiplier effects of that kind of expenditure in the South Australian economy. It is really, really exciting. We need to make sure that we are planning for the growth and maximising the growth from those opportunities, particularly through the supply chain, and part of that is going to be the workforce—making sure that where we have skills gaps, one of the options for us is to bring people into our economy who have got the ability to contribute to that program and make sure its a success.The Australian Space Agency is another example of something that is going to see jobs growth in our state and why having the ability to increase skilled migration into South Australia is going to be so important—because the Morrison government has made the decision to base the space agency in Adelaide, in the state of South Australia. This gives us an opportunity to have an ecosystem around that space agency from an industry point of view so that the space sector that will definitely grow across the planet, in all countries around the world, is equally going to grow in Australia. Weve made the decision to base the space agency in Adelaide, and, as firms in the space sector, in the space industries—lots of which, I might add, come from the defence sector, which goes to show the sort of synergy around that decision—there is going to be enormous opportunity to grow a workforce around space and space related industries. So we need to make sure that we are fostering that. Weve made a decision that gives an enormous opportunity to the state of South Australia, but again weve got to make sure were addressing the workforce requirements that that announcement brings.There are other things that were doing that are going to grow jobs and potentially require skilled migration into the state. In horticulture, the Northern Adelaide Irrigation Scheme is an opportunity to massively grow an industry that already exists, as we increase the amount of water we can take out of the Bolivar treatment plant and open up opportunities for further investment in horticulture. There are an enormous number of jobs in horticulture, and the simple reality is that, at times, a lot of those require support through a migration program that brings workers with particular skills, or to address skill gaps, into the South Australian economy. The Adelaide Casino expansion is going to require, by its very nature, skilled migration into the state of South Australia. Whilst thats exciting and whilst there are many new jobs coming from that investment, equally, we need to ensure that weve got a migration policy in place that can provide the skill requirements—in particular, where there are skill gaps—so that the state of South Australia and my home city of Adelaide are not missing out on any opportunity that is coming our way in the near future to grow our economy.This scheme can increase our population growth rate, and Im confident it will. As Ive said, that rate being traditionally at 0.8 per cent—0.9 per cent now—and seventh in the nation has just not been acceptable. This government wants to grow the population in areas like South Australia, to balance out the opportunity for economic growth, where for too long weve had low population growth and the poor economic outcome associated with that.","New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr STEVENS (Sturt) ","(12:34):"
58,0,0,0,1,1,"Falinski, Jason, MP","G86","Mackellar","LP","N/A",3813," Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon, its nice to see you again. I hope youve been well. I thank the members for Scullin and Sturt for their contributions to this debate on the New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019. The member for Nicholls has not spoken yet. We always look forward to his contribution to any debate. Member for Makin, I see that Ive jumped the gun. It is unfortunate, but, if you dont mind, Ill keep going.A diverse and vibrant Australia is a great Australia. A great Australia is one that promises prosperity, economic growth and opportunity. Thats why Im speaking in favour of this bill today. Australia is a land of opportunity. This place we call home is a land of wealth and prosperity. It is truly a great place. It is this parliaments responsibility to create opportunities, not to enforce them, so that those who show a genuine want to take advantage of the Australian way of life get a go. This bill promises prosperity, and it is for this reason that Im happy to speak in favour of it.I think of my own family and how we came to be Australians. My father was the son of a Polish migrant, who initially fled Nazi invasion and then fled communist oppression in 1957. When my father arrived in this country he was a young man and learnt English by selling encyclopedias door to door. I will not repeat some of the words he learnt while selling encyclopedias door to door. His mother, my grandmother, helped sustain her family by spending her nights screwing caps onto toothpaste tubes at the Colgate factory in Sydney. Many nights she came home with bleeding fingers.These new visas being introduced today represent opportunity and potential. The new visas proposed by this bill today show our governments commitment to generating jobs and helping communities. These new visas being introduced today show that this government is serious about bringing economic growth and prosperity into the hearts of regional towns and smaller cities. Most importantly, these new visas being introduced into the House today give people a go.This bill is a testament to the attractiveness of Australia on an international stage. We should be proud that there is such demand for a life in Australia. This bill shows how lucky we are to have a country where there is free speech, functioning democracy, and economic hope and opportunity for all. Australia has one of the greatest immigration systems in the world, and this bill only strengthens our rural communities. It is imperative that our primary industries be supported. Primary industries are one of the most important parts of the Australian economy, and this bill will only strengthen our rural workforce in keeping Australias key industries vibrant and lively with strength in numbers. We need to help our primary industries and we need to support our regional towns with skilled workers.These new visas promise greater prosperity and will rejuvenate the towns and cities that need assistance. The bill is part of the governments current population policy, which aims to reduce the migration cap by 15 per cent and provide incentives for migrants to settle in the regional hubs and small towns of Australias vast working landscape. Along with strengthening regional jobs and workforces, the Australian governments population policy aims to ease the pressures on our larger cities, better match migration to regional needs and, most importantly, ensure that Australia remains an attractive destination for skilled and talented workers to live in and to enjoy. This approach will provide consistency across skilled visa programs. The regional migration programs will allow more regional businesses to access skills in short supply.Australia prides itself on being free, fair and open-minded. This bill is centred on a new definition of regional Australia, which is simplified to be all of Australia except for the metropolitan areas of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, the Gold Coast and Perth—areas that have suffered the strain of rapid population growth. The new definition will form single continuous borders, as defined by postcodes, around these metropolitan areas. The bill provides employers with access to a wider range of occupations as well as to priority processing. This approach will provide consistency across skilled visa programs and allow more regional businesses to access through regional migration programs the skills that are in short supply.These new visas mean that if you have a go you get a go. The visas proposed by the House today highlight innovation, hard work and willingness to participate as the skills that Australia wants its citizens to have. The bill reinforces the idea that you should keep more of what you have earned. Economic freedom in Australia is something that this government is very proud of and it is also something that people around the world are desirous of. Australia is the most successful immigration nation in the world. It is our job, as leaders of this great nation, to ensure we appropriately plan for Australias future generations.The New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019 provides this government with the opportunity to diversify our regional workforce and help brand Australia as the greatest country in the world to live. The key focus of this policy is to secure greater economic growth for small cities and regional towns and to better target the key public services they rely on. The key benefit of the bill is that it provides motivated individuals and families with a place to call home. Australia is a very friendly country. As a very attractive place to work and live, Australia must always act in a way that incentivises hard work and rewards the individual, which is exactly what this bill aims to do. These new visas being proposed today symbolise a ticket into Australia and represent an opportunity for those who are motivated enough and want to give it a go.The real benefits of this bill are the numerous economic and cultural benefits for regional Australia. An important outcome of these new visas is that they will refresh the regional workforce. The bill allows regional employers, as well as state and territory governments, greater access to more occupations than the equivalent non-regional visas. The bill promises that the skilled employer-sponsored regional provisional visa will have access to over 450 more occupations than the closest non-regional equivalent visa, and the skilled work regional provisional visa will have over 70 more occupations than other visas. This means that we are diversifying our workforce and increasing the range of individuals that can be sponsored in our regional areas. This is not only a great thing for regional Australia; it is also a big step for Australias workforce in its entirety. The abundant opportunities that present themselves in these towns and cities promise long-term work and hence a potential long-term solution to the need to strengthen rural towns and cities.In addition, the bill also promises that priority process arrangements will be expanded to include all visa applicants sponsored by regional employers as well as other visa applicants who will live and work in regional Australia. This streamlined visa process makes the two new visas more attractive to those seeking work in Australia and hence incentivises applying for the new visas over equivalent non-regional visas.The new skilled regional visas bill not only helps our smaller and more isolated communities; it also aims to ease pressure off the big cities in terms of population growth. This bill even provides extra incentives to potential migrants considering moving to regional Australia. For example, the bill offers five additional points for regional nomination or sponsorship. And for those who think that there is no potential in rural towns—in late 2018 Jack Archer, the former CEO of the Regional Australia Institute, even stated, The notion that there are limited available jobs in rural Australia is a fallacy, alluding to the fact that, at the time, there were over 47,000 job vacancies in rural Australia. Our regional towns and suburbs will benefit exponentially from these new visas, and it is our obligation to strengthen the rural workforce in a way that helps all Australians and Australian businesses.This bill ultimately means that skilled migrants will stay in the regional centres of Australia for longer, and in this long-term arrangement they will develop and create ties and bonds to their respective communities. Such ties to local communities are made through participation and community involvement. Community involvement is what Australian suburbs are all about. The Australian difference is that feeling of belonging and that sense of identity. Tight-knit communities and strong social capital are what make Australia feel like home to so many of us. Whether it be the local footy team, the Lions club or even your local RSL on a Friday night, this country has something for everyone. By strengthening our regional workforces, this bill will ease the pressure off our congested major cities over time. We have been forced to play catch-up when it comes to introducing skilled migrant visas, due to the failure of other governments in planning for the impact of record migration into Australia.Separate from these outlined benefits, these new visas also provide extra options for international graduates from regional institutions. The bill states that, for any international student who graduates from a regional campus of a registered university or institution with a higher education or postgraduate qualification and maintains ongoing residence in a regional area while holding their first temporary graduate visa, an additional temporary graduate visa, with an extra year of post-study work rights for international students, will be available. By allowing international students to gain a temporary visa, whilst then working for a minimum of two years in regional Australia, we are expanding regional tertiary education and leveraging the populations of Australias towns and cities. This policy will create an influx in population and, therefore, will also provide jobs to those Australians who wish to educate incoming students. From here, other services and sectors will grow as population demands will increase all around the country, not just in cities.Therefore, I strongly support this bill whilst also supporting the Morrison governments policy on population distribution and immigration. Our great nation deserves to be shared with motivated individuals who wish to contribute to local communities and live productive lives. It is only right that we provide opportunities to those who wish to take them.","New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FALINSKI (Mackellar) ","(12:49):"
59,0,0,0,1,1,"Zappia, Tony, MP","HWB","Makin","ALP","N/A",3815," I speak in support of the amendment moved by the member for Scullin to this legislation, the New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019. The purpose of this bill is to establish two new provisional skilled regional visa classes which, after three years of living and working in a regional area, will allow these provisional visa holders to apply for permanent residency. That in itself is quite an attractive incentive to someone who wants to migrate to Australia from overseas. Additionally, the new provisional skilled regional visa holders will have access to government services, such as social security payments, similar to permanent residents. That was previously not the case, and so this is also a new additional incentive for people wanting to come and work within Australia in a regional area.The policy intent of this bill is twofold: firstly, to overcome a skills shortage in regional Australia and, secondly, to ease the growth pressure on big cities by providing incentives for new migrants to settle in regional Australia. The government proposes to reduce Australias annual migration intake from 190,000 to 160,000. Of those 160,000 places, 23,000 places will be allocated to the two new skilled regional visa subclasses—491 and 494.This legislation was referred to the Senate Standing Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, and their report was handed to parliament only a couple of days ago. In their minority report, Labor senators—whilst supporting the aim of the new skilled regional visas—noted that the new visas had not been fully thought through, that details were unclear and that there could be serious unintended consequences. In particular, the higher education community raised issues with what they see as inconsistencies in the definitions of regional Australia, which seem to have been made in an arbitrary way. For example, it has been pointed out that Perth, one of the most isolated cities in Australia, is excluded from the definition of a regional location, despite it being at a disadvantage in attracting international students. Previously, this government has directed additional funding to university campuses in suburban areas, under programs intended to support more students at regionally focused universities. Definitions are important and they should not be used as a cover to pork-barrel money into marginal seats.The need for this legislation highlights two serious failings of government. Firstly, there is the failure of the government to support Australian vocational education. We know that today there are about 150,000 fewer apprenticeships than there were when this government came to office. We also know that about $3 billion has been cut from TAFE funding over the past six years by this government. We know that billions of dollars were wasted on shonky VET providers under the watch of the government. And we know this government continues to pursue a privatisation ideology of selling off state or federal government utilities and assets that, in the past, would provide tens of thousands of apprenticeship opportunities. All of those opportunities are also being lost. It is short-term, foolish policy, because the apprenticeships that those government entities were providing in the past are not being provided by the operators of those very services that have been privatised. Secondly, as the member for Scullin quite rightly pointed out in his comments, there is the failure of this government to support regions with government services, while infrastructure funding fails to keep pace with growth in big cities. On both of these matters, the government has failed.Poor planning by all governments in our cities has resulted in cities outgrowing the pace of infrastructure investment that is being provided. That is partly a responsibility of this government—contrary to what other members have said, that it is simply a responsibility of the states. If better infrastructure had been provided, those big cities would not be bursting at the seams in the way that they are. Simultaneously, if regional Australia had better services, more people would very likely be living there today. As the member for Scullin also quite rightly pointed out, it is those services that are particularly important for new migrants as they transition to Australian life. Yet this legislation says and does nothing about additional resettlement services for the very people that it says will be located in regional Australia. The government makes no commitment about that whatsoever.With respect to one particular profession, the medical profession, we know that many of the health services provided in regional Australia are provided by overseas trained doctors. One of the biggest shortfalls or one of the biggest areas of concern was that, for many of those doctors who relocate to regional Australia, there were no support settlement services once they went out there, and that was becoming one of the serious barriers that they faced.It would be my expectation that skilled people in a developing country would jump at the opportunity to come to Australia with a pathway to permanent residency. The three years of working in a regional location, in my view, would not be a barrier whatsoever. Indeed, it is not much of an impost when you consider there are people trying to get to this country, asylum seekers, who have now spent years in detention centres. But more importantly, it is not much of an impost when it is something that many other professionals already do in this country. There are a number of vocations where people, once they graduate, are expected to work in a regional area for one, two or three years. Its not uncommon in several professions. It is also a pathway, within those professions, to advancing a career. So working in a country or regional part of Australia is not unusual, nor is it a great impost.But the reality is that even graduates from within our own country who have done that dont often return to the regional location where they perhaps did part of their work once they graduated. So I have serious doubts that this program will be effective. After the new migrants have spent three years in the regional areas, I doubt very much whether all of them will remain in those locations. I suspect that, like all other Australians, they will seek work where they get the most benefit—and, indeed, not only work where they get the most benefit but work which offers the most benefits to their family members as well. So, whilst this might be legislation that initially provides some benefit to the regional areas, Im not convinced that, in the long term, it is going to overcome the skills shortages that we see in those areas.There are other concerns with respect to this legislation that I want to talk about, and these are concerns that were also raised in the Senate committees report. One of my serious concerns with this scheme is the likelihood of widespread exploitation of migrant workers. Only on Saturday, in the South Australian Advertiser, there was a story written by Tory Shepherd on this very matter. I want to quote the first three paragraphs of that story:DOZENS of Adelaide businesses have been busted exploiting workers or cheating the visa system since a public register began in 2015.Australian Border Force figures show 82 firms have been sanctioned for breaching their obligations as visa sponsors.And immigration agent Mark Glazbrook … said those who were caught were just the tip of the iceberg.Those comments are consistent with my own observations and stories that have been brought to me during my time in this place—stories of sponsors exploiting workers and of workers who have little understanding of their rights, who do not know who to turn to if they are being exploited, who often come from countries where labour abuse is common and who dont want to jeopardise their opportunity of permanent residency within Australia. These are vulnerable people.Both of the two new visa subclasses proposed by this legislation will require a sponsor, which could be a family member or an Australian business. I hope that this legislation is not used as another form of access to cheap labour by employers who would do that ahead of doing the right thing by the employees they will ultimately employ. But its a real concern that I have, and again I wonder: what is the government going to do to ensure that worker exploitation does not continue as a result of people going out to country areas, where, again, their access to support services is even less than for those who go to the cities?In the couple of minutes I have left, I want to highlight a matter separate to all this. We have unemployment in Australia at 5.3 per cent—roughly 716,000 Australians unemployed. We have 8.5 per cent of people underemployed, which is perhaps another million people or so who are underemployed. Simultaneously, we are told that we have a shortage of skills in this country. We also know that some of the highest unemployment occurs in regional Australia, the very parts of Australia that this bill seeks to address. Indeed, we know that, under this legislation, South Australia—and, in fact, the Northern Territory and Tasmania—will be designated regional Australia for the purpose of this legislation.In South Australia we now have the highest unemployment rate in the country, at 7.3 per cent. We know that, if we were to train people who are unemployed or underemployed, we should be able to meet those skills shortages through our own people who are looking for more work. When I look at the 7.3 per cent unemployment rate we have in South Australia, I look at the skills shortages we have, and I look at the cuts to education and TAFE in particular. Not only has the federal government made cuts, but the Marshall Liberal government in South Australia has closed TAFEs at Tea Tree Gully, Port Adelaide and Parafield since coming to office just over a year ago. The Marshall government and the federal coalition government are not only not investing in training Australians who are looking for more work and who are in the very regions that this legislation seeks to address but also, at the same time, are simply saying, Lets bring those people in from overseas.The member for Mackellar talked about the 47,000 job vacancies that appear outside of capital cities. Im not in a position to dispute that figure—and I am not prepared to dispute it, because it may well be correct—but why are we not training Australians who are looking for work, rather than bringing in people from overseas? Shouldnt that be our first priority? Indeed it should. But this government is not prepared to do that. It would rather simply say, Lets bring in skilled workers from overseas, instead of investing in training our own people. We have seen cuts right across the board in education, but we have particularly seen them in vocational education and training. I suspect that we can train people here rather than bring people in. The other matter, of course, is the integrity of the whole system. As we have seen in the past time and time again, not only are people who are brought in being exploited; one has to question how legitimate their qualifications are.The intent of this legislation is one that Labor supports. But there is no question that there are unintended consequences, and there are a lot of other things we could have done as a country to meet the skills shortages that this legislation seeks to overcome.","New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ZAPPIA (Makin) ","(13:02):"
60,0,0,0,1,1,"Drum, Damian, MP",56430,"Nicholls","Nats","N/A",3818," When you listen to the Labor Party talk on labour and regional skilled visas, it is incredibly scary. There are a whole raft of underlying tones that are perpetrated in the speeches of the Labor Party where they refuse to acknowledge the fact that in regional Australia around five per cent equals full employment, when you see the range and the types of employment that are available and how hard our businesses, our Australian businesses, in regional Australia have to advertise for their workers and how hard it is to get workers into many of our areas of trade, agriculture and also hospitality. To see the Labor Party continually focus on the exploitation of workers as a reason why they want to semi-oppose this—theyll probably end up supporting the bill, but theyll raise a whole range of issues. If there are issues of worker exploitation, those labour firms need to have the book thrown at them. They have got unions out there keeping an eye on things. They have got the Ombudsman and the Fair Work Commission. There are a whole raft of policemen out there who are prepared to act very quickly and diligently if there are areas of worker exploitation.The fact is, these so-called cuts are to higher education and to the TAFE system—the TAFE system is run by the state government. If you want to start criticising the Daniel Andrews Labor government in Victoria, knock yourself out. But dont throw that criticism at the federal government. All we are trying to do here, with the New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019, is ensure that these Australian businesses bracing themselves for a very busy time ahead in the harvest season have an adequate workforce that will enable them to get the crops sorted and packed in the packing sheds and shipped off to market. Having the workers and the legal labour force to do that is the most crucial thing. The Victorian, New South Wales and South Australian governments have recently moved legislation to actually increase the penalties of labour hire firms that are not registered. This, in itself, is seen as a way of making it even harder for our farmers to be able to access the labour that they need.The coalition is delivering on its commitment to support rural and regional Australia. In my electorate of Nicholls we regularly meet with farmers, food processors, manufacturers, health providers and small business owners—and all of them are struggling to find both skilled and unskilled workers. Only last week I met with Richard Buchner, Managing Director at MATelec Australia—a high-technology switchboard manufacturer based in Shepparton that employs around 50 people. Its a dynamic business looking to grow, but its biggest challenge is finding skilled workers. These shortages are holding back his business, and similar skills shortages are holding back other like businesses throughout the Goulburn Valley—holding back our whole economy.These arent fictional facts that we are bringing up; these are the facts that we see by going out on the street and meeting with our businesses and asking them, How are you going sourcing the skilled workers that you need? I continually stand in this place and talk about the struggle with finding fitters and turners, mechanics, diesel mechanics, sheet metal workers, food processors and even food technicians, who need a university degree, and how its very difficult for all the food manufacturers in the Goulburn Valley to be able to access the food technicians they need to run their businesses.More than seven million people have migrated to Australia since the Second World War, and they have added incredibly to our nation. They have stimulated stronger growth and they have created more jobs for our economy. The immigration system has historically had a strong view on how many people should come to Australia in any given year, but we have never actually determined where they should go; weve always left it up to them. We know that Sydney and Melbourne experienced strong population growth, of 18 per cent and 25 per cent respectively, between 2006 and 2016. A disproportionate amount of migrants have tended to settle in two major cities, leading to congestion and pressures on infrastructure. Elsewhere in Australia, like in my electorate of Nicholls and also out to the west of Victoria and up to the north of Victoria, we are crying out for skilled migration. There are around 60,000 job opportunities in regional Australia where locals are not available or willing to fill the roles. Workforce attraction and retention are the key challenges for our regional employers. Of course, our first priority is always to try and fill these jobs with Australian workers. When that isnt possible, migrants present an opportunity that doesnt otherwise exist.This bill will give effect to government policy whereby holders of the new provisional skilled regional visas, which come into effect on 16 November, will have access to government services consistent with skilled permanent visa holders. The new provisional skilled regional visas are the subclass 491 skilled work regional provisional visa, for skilled workers who are nominated by a state or territory government and sponsored by an eligible family member to live and work in regional Australia; and the subclass 494 skilled employer-sponsored regional provisional visa, which will enable an Australian business to sponsor skilled workers to work in their business in regional Australia. These new visas are part of the coalitions plan for Australias future population to ease the pressure on the big capitals while supporting the growth in smaller regional cities.The plan includes reducing the annual migration ceiling from 190,000 down to 160,000 and setting aside 23,000 places for these new regional visas. Its a new feature of visa requirements for regional migrants to live and work in regional areas for up to three years before being eligible for permanent residency. This will encourage visa holders to remain in regional Australia, which will in turn support the local communities and enhance the economies of regional parts of Australia. The amendments in the bill will ensure that holders of the new visas have access to government services in line with current arrangements for permanent visa holders.Since the Howard era, our immigration has emphasised skilled migration. In the 1997-98 program year, skilled migration represented more than 50 per cent of the migration program for the first time in our history. This figure has now risen to 70 per cent under the coalition government. Our skilled migration, which has generally very high participation rates in the workforce, increases the number of people paying taxes. Migration offsets the impact of an ageing population and helps enable us to pay for the essential services that we all need.There have also been some changes to the working holiday-maker program. This is an essential part of Australias agriculture and tourism industries. Its a crucial part of our labour force in the Goulburn Valley, the GMID and certainly the entire electorate of Nicholls. The GMID, the Goulburn Murray Irrigation District, is arguably the most productive fruit-growing region in Australia, with apples, pears and stone fruits for domestic and export markets. Without the working holiday-maker program, it would be impossible to bring that harvest from the trees and into our economy each and every year. Working holiday-makers are critical to filling the short-term workforce shortage that we have in rural and regional Australia, and they also inject over $3 billion into our national economy.A range of new working holiday-maker arrangements come into effect on 1 July this year. This will include an increase in the number of places available to Malaysian nationals but also to nationals of some other countries as well. We are also going to see an extension in the working holiday-maker program that will enable visas for those that work for the same employer to be extended up to 12 months. There will be an increase in the number of places available in the 462 program for travellers from Malaysia from 100 up to 1,100, for Argentina from 1,500 up to 2,450, for Singapore from 500 up to 2,500, and for Portugal from 200 up to 500. For Greece we have 500 places available for their young working holiday-makers, and for Ecuador there are 100. It was interesting that only last week I shared the opportunity to go to Greece with some of the members in the chamber. We talked to the Hellenic Parliament, and they were very excited about the fact that many of their young workers are going to be heading to Australia. Many of them are looking forward to working on orchards owned by Greek families that have been here for three generations. So its great that we are able to be part of this incredible program, a program thats going to help not only young Greek working holiday-makers but also many of our families and our farmers.I build on the work from the previous speakers who have spoken about the Regional Australia Institute, which has been a very strong promoter of smaller communities that have been able to get behind skilled migrants and even unskilled migrants with a view to housing them, putting services around them and giving them the employment they need in many of these places such as Nhill, Pyramid Hill and a whole range of other small communities that have worked very hard to make themselves attractive to workers from overseas countries who are looking for a better way of life. Rupanyup also comes to mind. There are lots of programs that are going to make their economies much, much stronger because of this bill. Those 23,000 places we have set aside for regional skilled migrants from 2019-20 are going to direct migrants who are going to help these communities that are crying out for more people.In the short time I have available, I need to acknowledge the Shepparton City Council, the Campaspe shire and the Moira shire, who are combining together to work with the government and its departments to introduce a DAMA. We have DAMAs currently working across other parts of Australia, making it easier for these regions to bring in skilled migrants to assist with businesses that are very heavily in need of new migrants.","New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[8]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DRUM (Nicholls—Chief Nationals Whip) ","(13:17):"

This year I am participating in the program for the second time as mentor to Caitlin Liddle, who joins me here in the chamber today. She is a young Indigenous woman from the Bundjalung nation. Caitlin is a university student who has a passion for policy, politics and Indigenous rights. Caitlin has shared with me her aspirations to one day work in this parliament and to hold my position. It is programs such as these that allow young women such as Caitlin to gain the confidence and networking essential for a career in politics. I wish Caitlin well and thank her for writing this speech.","Girls Takeover Parliament Program","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[9]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms BURNEY (Barton) ","(13:42):"

We need to work together to tackle these challenges in a way that will make a positive impact across all aspects of our community.Thats why Ive established the Lindsay Healthy Active Living Network, launched by the Minister for Health and bringing together our local health, community, sporting and lifestyle organisations to collaborate on ways that we can ensure the people of Lindsay are living healthier, more active lives. It is my aim, as part of the Lindsay Healthy Active Living Network, to address important health and wellbeing issues and deliver actionable plans that lead to better health outcomes for our community. This includes campaigning for Lindsays very own City to Lakes.

Yet, despite all the outrage and the subsequent promises of action, the fact is we continue to see bad employers stealing from working people. Just recently The Age newspaper revealed that the owners of a recycling company had stolen $1 million a year from some of the most vulnerable people in our community. These were Tamil refugees who were working seven days a week for a recycling outfit, Polytrade, and were deprived of more than $40,000 each, on average. The theft was discovered by the Migrant Workers Centre and the Australian Workers Union. In addition to the wage theft, the workers were exposed to unsafe work conditions. One man described air thick with the powder from crushed glass. He would bleed from the nose and the mouth as a result. Another fell four metres and broke his leg because of unsafe work practices.Im sure we would all agree that its despicable to steal wages. This particular case involves people whove come to our country seeking safety, security and prosperity for themselves and their families. The workers were mistreated, endangered and stolen from when they came to Australia asking for our help. I commend the bravery of these workers for standing up for their rights in our country, rights that are already hard won for Australians. I commend the Australian Workers Union and the Migrant Workers Centre for bringing these injustices out into the open. On this side, the Labor Party is committed to eradicating wage theft. For the sake of those who work for them, employers who steal wages and place profits before wellbeing must face every available measure of justice.","Workplace Relations","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[11]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KHALIL (Wills) ","(13:45):"

This service is vital for Australians with blindness or low vision to fully enjoy television and not be left guessing what is happening during breaks in dialogue. This issue was raised with me by my constituent John Shawcross of Gwandalan and his granddaughter Layla Stennett. Layla wrote to me:Having access to audio would mean that my Pop does not miss out on visual aspects of television and perhaps more importantly he has equal access to news and information. Music, sci-fi films and the arts have always been a big part of my Pops life and it is very important to me that he is able to continue to experience the things that give him joy.Thats important to me as well, and it is important to Labor. But this third-term Liberal government has been dragging its feet on introducing audio description in Australia for six years. Throughout that time, Labor has kept focus and attention on the issue and has been advocating in parliament, in the media and in the broader community on behalf of the vision impaired. It is galling that our popular television programs, such as Neighbours and Home and Away, are sent to audiences overseas with audio description, but that service is not available in Australia. Australians who are living with blindness and low vision, like my constituent John Shawcross, deserve equal enjoyment of free-to-air television.

It is a valuable resource for our schools, for our RSLs and for our researchers, but there is so much more that needs to be done. We have 2,100 detailed, individual stories of veterans on the memorial, but ultimately we have 650,000 potential stories there.

The program has introduced 260 young women to politicians across Australia, Tonga and Fiji, and there are 60 young women and girls participating in todays program.ANU student Brianna Partington has joined my office. She grew up in Ceduna, South Australia, and her interest in politics came at a young age, when she realised that it wasnt always replicated among her female peers. Brianna believes there is a significant lack of interest in politics among young women in her area, and she wants to work to change that.We need to do more to attain gender equality in Australia. In todays parliament, on the Labor side, the share of women is just under half, but among the Liberals it is less than a quarter. In the Australian workplace, half of all workers are women, but, among CEOs, just one in six are women, according to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. Thirty-five per cent of boards and governing bodies have no female directors.Its clear we must actively encourage young women to pursue leadership roles in politics and in broader society. Today has been extraordinarily insightful, and I thank Brianna and her colleagues for all they have done through the day.","Girls Takeover Parliament Program","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[9]/subdebate.1[17]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr LEIGH (Fenner) ","(13:54):"

The drought summit I convened last year brought together Australians from right across our country—premiers, chief ministers, farmers, those involved in the charitable sector, scientists and others involved in the Bureau of Meteorology. All of these organisations came together and we fashioned a plan, together with the National Farmers Federation, to respond to one of the worst droughts this country has ever seen. In some particular areas, it is the most severe drought we have ever seen in this country. That comprehensive drought fund and that response, which is now some $7 billion and more over the next decade, has been designed not as a set-and-forget policy but as one that requires us to constantly listen and constantly respond to the ongoing pressures that we are seeing as this drought rolls on, which, in some areas, particularly in Queensland, has been running for more than seven years.Most recently, since we were last in this place, the government made three important announcements. The first was to further streamline how the farm household allowance was working at a cost of some $60 million to make it more accessible for people and, particularly, to take into account the off-farm income they were earning and their capital off-farm, which enabled them to continue to be supported. For four years, that will mean more than a hundred thousand dollars being paid into each of these farm households to ensure that theyre getting that support. Secondly, there was also additional support for additional shires and additional council areas, which is making a big difference in those communities.Thirdly, yesterday, with the Deputy Prime Minister, the member for New England and the Premier and the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, we committed our half to a billion dollar investment in two important dam infrastructure projects in New South Wales in both the members electorate in New England and in central west New South Wales. These are important infrastructure projects, and were able to get on with them with the additional investment that were putting in because of the cooperation we have from the New South Wales government which is prepared not only to put the money in but to blast away the congestion-busting bureaucracy that stops the projects from proceeding. I commend the New South Wales Premier for doing that.Our plan for dealing with drought is to ensure were providing that assistance to farming communities where they need it right now: on their properties. Secondly, were supporting those drought affected communities with our payments to councils to ensure their economies continue to move on and ensure were building that long-term resilience, whether its through investing in big dam infrastructure or the on-farm infrastructure that they need that theyre investing in themselves.

He was there yesterday at Dungowan Dam, and 3½ kilometres downstream on the Dungowan Creek from where we stood yesterday with the Prime Minister; with the Premier, Gladys Berejiklian; and with the Deputy Premier of New South Wales and the New South Wales Nationals leader, John Barilaro. We stood there and we announced the $480 million for the 22½-gigalitre Dungowan Dam. As the member for New England knows and talked about yesterday, in 1958 the Dungowan Dam was built, and we are now going to replace it. The Mayor of Tamworth, Col Murray, was absolutely delighted, and he said that this is going to help drought-proof the Peel Valley for the future.My fellow dam-builder knows how important this announcement is. He knows that were putting $1.1 billion towards additional water infrastructure in this nation. He knows that weve also announced $650 million for the Wyangala Dam. It was first begun in 1928 and completed in 1935—an 85-metre wall. Were going to extend it by 10 metres. That 10 metres is going to provide an additional 650 gigalitres of water storage capacity. Between them, thats equivalent to about 1.2 Sydney Harbours, in inland New South Wales, in the central west and in the dry north-west of New South Wales. Thats delivery. Thats what the Morrison-McCormack government is getting on and doing. But not only that: were also providing $12 million for a business case for the Mole River project of 100 gigalitres. So thats a lot of water storage capacity. Were getting on with the job.If there is one thing I know, its that when mayors come out and say that these are good projects then we should back them. Bill West, the Mayor of Cowra, was effusive in his praise for the fact that the Wyangala Dam project is going to not only mitigate against flood but also value-add jobs in the construction sector and also in the productivity that its going to enhance. The Forbes Mayor, Phyllis Miller, also spoke glowingly. She said: Its fantastic news. They understand. And she, of all people, understands the 42 days of closure of the Newell Highway between Forbes and West Wyalong in 2016 and what that meant. But if those opposite could do one thing, its to pick up the phone to their Queensland and Victorian colleagues and tell them to get on board with the Liberal-Nationals government and build more dams!","Dams","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[11]/subdebate.1[4]/answer/talk.text/body/p[10]","N/A","N/A"

Household debt and the pressure it places on families continue to trouble the government. That is one of the reasons that we provided tax relief through this parliament when we were re-elected on 18 May—to ensure that we could take the pressure off families, particularly those on low and middle incomes, so that they could meet the increasing challenges on their household budgets, and of course a big part of that is what they owe. The good thing in Australia is that the assets coverage when it comes to household debt—the Treasurer, Im sure, will correct me if I get this wrong—is about five times the debt coverage, and it is predominantly all within the housing sector.If the shadow Treasurer thinks that there is a significant issue in terms of the creditworthiness of the Australian housing market, which underpins the credit position of Australians in this country, then he should say so. He should say that but he wont say that, because he knows its not true. The shadow Treasurer, once again, is seeking to talk down the Australian economy and create anxiety about issues which are being well managed and conscientiously managed by Australians.

Let me make clear that we do have a drought strategy that is in action as we speak. It comes in three phases. It comes in the support we are providing in the here and now in keeping people in business. Thats through the farm household allowance and through the concessional loans that are saving farmers tens of thousands of dollars because of the Regional Investment Corporation and the competitive interest rate we are providing.The second phase is about community, because it is not just farmers that hurt during drought; it is also small businesses. Thats why we have worked with local government, through the Drought Communities Program, to provide a million dollars to stimulate those economies, to get tradies going, to procure local materials from local hardware stores and to leave a lasting legacy of a project that the community can all enjoy. The third phase is about the future and preparing us for future droughts, in making sure we prepare not only farmers but also communities. We are proudly going to create the Future Drought Fund, a $5 billion fund that will give a $100 million dividend in the good and bad times, to make sure we can support these communities and put in place the measures that will support these communities. We have been quite clear.Out of respect to the NFF, who we asked as the peak agricultural representative body to have input, we are saying that, as we continue to be agile with this drought, we will take parts if they can be constructive and implemented, and we will work with them. Thats what a good government does; it listens, and it understands. We will continue to act as we need to act.Our strategy is in action, with over $2 billion in the here and now keeping people going and keeping those communities going—many of which are in my own electorate. My whole electorate has been in this, some of it for up to eight years. I see those people. I know them by name and by face. It is important that the support that we provide is in the here and now, but that we also protect them for the future because, invariably, there will be droughts in the future. If we equip them with the tools to adapt and to attack the drought, then we, as regional Australia, will be stronger for it.","Drought","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[1]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LITTLEPROUD (Maranoa—Minister for Water Resources, Drought, Rural Finance, Natural Disaster and Emergency Management) ","(14:17):"

He comes from the great state of Queensland, where two-thirds of the state is impacted by drought. In New South Wales, 95 per cent of the state is impacted by drought. Weve had droughts before. We had the Federation drought, we had a significant drought during the Second World War and we had the millennium drought in the 2000s. But I had the privilege to go with the member for Maranoa to Inverell, in the member for New Englands seat, as well as to Stanthorpe and Warwick, in the member for Maranoas seat, and, when we met with the farmers and the families who are affected by this drought, they told us that this is the worst drought in living memory. That is why this government is standing by them. We met Dino in Stanthorpe, who is an apple orchardist who has to truck in 100 loads of water each week, at a cost of around $40,000, and has had to pull 10,000 trees out of the ground just to keep the sustainability of his orchard.The support that we are providing to the drought-stricken areas is in three parts, as the Prime Minister outlined. Firstly, its the direct income support, the farm household allowance, which we have lifted and for which we have reduced significantly the red-tape burden. Secondly, its the support for the communities, the support that we are giving the local government areas through the Drought Communities Program. This money is able to be spent with local tradies who are updating the stables at the rodeo areas or upgrading the cricketing pavilion—and we heard one story where they put up a fence to prevent the kangaroos coming onto the airport. All of this is just creating jobs in an area which is doing it really tough.Weve also put more money into financial counsellors, to provide the support to people who need it, as well as mental health support, which is critical at this time. Theres also the water infrastructure. We are going to have a $5 billion Future Drought Fund which will be providing $100 million a year from mid-next year. Most recently, there was the announcement by the Prime Minister, with the Premier of New South Wales, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the National Party in New South Wales, of a joint commitment to $1 billion for water infrastructure, to help ensure the future viability of these communities.Dorothea Mackellar spoke about a sunburnt country of droughts and flooding rains.

He brings great experience to this place not only in business but as a diplomat representing our country abroad. Its the Australian dream to own your own home, but many of us cannot do it without the help of a bank. But we expect our banks to do the right thing by their customers. But what we have seen in recent times is the banks not passing on in full the rate cuts that have been announced by the RBA. The Australian people are sick of this merry dance where the RBA reduces rates, political leaders and the RBA themselves call on the banks to pass them on in full, and the banks ignore that advice. So now we are getting under the hood of the operations of these banks by giving the ACCC the ability to conduct this inquiry with its particular powers to compel important information from the banks; to understand the pricing arrangements, the difference between the back book and the front book, between the advertised rate and the actual rate paid by customers; to see what the costs of funds are for the banks, particularly given the RBA says that they are now at historic lows; and also to see if there are any other barriers to customers switching between banks where they can get a better deal. That is the purpose of this ACCC inquiry.Getting a better deal from the banks for customers is part of our economic plan to create a stronger economy, including providing the most significant tax cuts that this country has seen in more than two decades—tax cuts which those opposite oppose. There are a 10-year, $100 billion pipeline of infrastructure; 80,000 new apprenticeships; cutting red tape and improving the ease of business, particularly for small businesses across the economy; and opening up new markets for our exporters given that one in five Australian jobs are connected to trade. We as a government have been able to enter into new free trade agreements with Indonesia, with the 11-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, with South Korea, with Japan and with China, creating enormous opportunities for new jobs right across the economy. Our economic plan has helped create more than 1.4 million new jobs since weve come to government.

The House may not know that there is a three-year coverage in advance and people have been able to build offsets against their mortgages. Theyve been doing that in a very prudential way. One of the big differences between Australias household debt and household debt in other places around the world is this: 30 per cent of Australias entire housing market is owned by mums and dads who invest in investment properties. If those mums and dads didnt invest in those investment properties, we would not have the rental stock that is available to people to rent today.What was Labors policy when it came to rent at the last election? It was to whack a big, fat housing tax on mums and dads who were simply investing in the rental stock of Australians who are renting to put a roof over their heads.

I know hes very passionate about this area, because in the construction and building industry in particular there are lots of jobs which are required to be filled in the Longman electorate. So I thank him for his passion for this area.The member for Longman will be very pleased to know that we are modernising the vocational education and training sector—$585 million in our skills package is now rolling out. Thats all thanks to our strong economy. Australian businesses will create over 1.25 million jobs over the next five years and we are rolling out a $100 billion infrastructure investment pipeline, and we need the skills to fill these jobs.Last week, the Prime Minister and the minister announced that Scott Cam will be our first national careers ambassador. I know all on this side are very pleased with this announcement. As an ambassador, he will inspire the next generation of tradies by highlighting how technical training can lead to high-paying and fulfilling jobs. He is proof that a trade can be incredibly valuable, rewarding and successful and that it can be a very, very good career choice. Scott will help Australians of all ages and all stages to make informed decisions about learning, training and work pathways. He will be the public face of our National Careers Institute, which will lead the delivery of high-quality, evidence based career development for Australians so they can make informed decisions about their learning, training and work pathways.In addition to this, our $585 million skills package includes incentives for up to 80,000 new apprentices and expanded apprentice wage subsidy trials in rural and regional areas. The Morrison government is spending $3 billion in vocational education annually. We know that, in the next four years, over 90 per cent of jobs that will be created will require a tertiary qualification. Thats why were working to ensure that, no matter where in Australia you come from, or what type of career choice you make, youll get a quality education, especially when it comes to vocational education.","Vocational Education and Training","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[6]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TEHAN (Wannon—Minister for Education) ","(14:32):"

160,0,1,0,0,1,"Andrews, Karen, MP",230886,"McPherson","LNP","N/A",3840," I thank the member for her question. It was just recently that we both had the opportunity to attend the space science and space industry conference in Adelaide. There were about 1,000 participants at that conference, and that indicates quite clearly the momentum that is gathering in Australia for the Australian space industry and the space sector.Space is about making sure that we are improving life here on earth, and its especially important—crucial, in fact—for our farmers and those in regional and rural Australia. Our investment in space technology is a perfect example of our multipronged approach to helping and supporting our farmers. Were providing the direct support they need now to assist them during the drought, while making sure that were also putting in place the technology theyre going to need for the future. So were making our economy stronger now, as well as making sure we are building a resilient economy for the future.Space technology is being used on a daily basis by our farmers; in fact, space technology has been used for quite some time by our farmers. We have remote sensing satellites. They provide some pretty key data thats used by our farmers to monitor soil, drought and crop development. From our satellites we have rainfall assessments that help farmers plan the timing and the amount of irrigation theyre going to need for their crops. Accurate information and analysis are so critical in being able to predict what a regions agricultural output is going to be, and to be able to do that well in advance. Much of that information is now coming from the space technologies that we have in place. Importantly, our space technologies are improving our remote communications. Theyre improving our health care and theyre improving mining and oil and gas exploration. These are all critically important.Recently, the Prime Minister announced there would be $150 million to support Australian businesses as they assist NASA in the Moon to Mars mission and, potentially, beyond. That is $150 million to grow the space sector here in Australia that will go to Australian businesses. That sector currently is worth $4 billion and employs 10,000 people, and we are growing that sector to make sure that by 2030 it has tripled in size, to $12 billion, and employs an extra 20,000 people. That $150 million is a smart investment.","Space Industry","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[8]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ANDREWS (McPherson—Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) ","(14:39):"

He is very strongly committed to getting more Australians off welfare and into work, as is the entirety of this side of the House.We have, of course, very comprehensive arrangements to support vulnerable Australians. Indeed, for social services and welfare, theres $180 billion in this years budget, more than one-third of the entire budget and around 75 per cent of total personal income tax collected. So that is a very substantial commitment to vulnerable Australians. But the best way to support vulnerable Australians is to get them off welfare and into work. Everybody—every Australian—who moves from welfare into work secures a personal victory: a victory in terms of self-esteem, in terms of a sense of contribution and, of course, in terms of an improved financial position for themselves and their families. But its also a victory for our national budgetary position, because everybody who moves from welfare into work is no longer being supported by their fellow taxpayers. Indeed, they are now contributing to the support of others through paying tax.Our commitment to moving people from welfare to work is not simply rhetoric; it is being delivered. Between June 2014 and June 2018, the number of working-age people on welfare fell by 230,000. What happened when Labor was in government? That number went up by 140,000. Under Labor, the cost of social services and welfare was growing at twice the rate of tax revenue. Weve now got it to be sustainable. And, of course, the percentage of those of working age on income support is 14.3 per cent. And you know what? The Leader of the Opposition thinks thats funny. He thinks that is a clever thing to laugh at. What its about is delivering for the Australian people. You may think, Leader of the Opposition, its something to laugh at, that people are moving from welfare to work. We think that is something to celebrate. Ill tell you what, mate, were delivering it.

The member is quite right to link in that question the issue of union lawlessness with productivity and with the economy, because the two are one and the same issue.It was literally only today that there was yet another decision in the Federal Court where the CFMEU was fined a single maximum penalty of $63,000 and an individual was fined $6,000. This is what the judge in that matter said:The Union is a serial offender that has, over a long period, exhibited a willingness to contravene workplace laws in the service of its industrial objectives; and one that appears to treat the imposition of financial penalties in respect of those contraventions as little more than the cost of its preferred business model.And that preferred business model is the single greatest source of totally avoidable costs in the construction sector in Australia. The construction sector is a massive employer, the fourth-largest employer in Australia, and 99 per cent of all the businesses operating within the construction sector are small businesses, so this is the most major avoidable cost impacting small businesses in Australia. The MBA estimates that militant union activity increases the costs of vital infrastructure like schools and roads and hospitals by 30 per cent—cost increases which are totally avoidable. Its the business model that causes those cost increases.What is the business model? Again, this is what the courts have said about the business model: Its creating an environment in which the CFMEU are making threats of delay and disruption and engaging in coercive conduct. In terms of increasing the costs to construction and small business, it is, sadly, a very effective business model, because when the threats are carried through it increases the costs, and, when credible threats are merely made, that also increases the costs. There are two examples from April this year: the CFMEU were penalised by the courts for the coercion of a crane company which caused an estimated loss of six weeks worth of work on a construction site; and, in the same month of April, the CFMEU in Queensland shut down nine different worksites to force employment of only contractors who had EBAs with the union. So when they make the threat it causes unsustainable financial decisions to be made, and when they keep the threat and disrupt workplaces it increases costs.

Its a very important question because all of us want to make sure that we keep Australians safe. We know that since 12 September 2014, when the national terrorism threat level was raised, there have been seven attacks targeting people in Australia and 16 major counterterrorism disruptions.I can inform the House that, since 2012, around 230 Australians have travelled to Syria or Iraq to fight with or support groups involved in the conflict. The government has put forward to the parliament a number of bills designed to keep Australians safe and to keep these people from coming back to our country wherever that is possible because we know, on all of the advice available to us, that many of these people can pose a very significant threat. Weve seen very major disruptions in European countries, across America and in South-East Asia, in our own region, where foreign fighters have returned to their country of origin and caused significant loss of life. We dont want that in our country.We have done everything we can to keep Australians safe, but the position of the Labor Party remains completely confused. It is clear from a train wreck interview on Insiders on the weekend that Senator Keneally, the opposition minister for home affairs, had absolutely no idea what she was proposing. There have been media reports about Labor urging—or at least Senator Keneally, because I think other members of the front bench have distanced themselves from her. Senator Keneally has by her own admission received advice from my department that people do pose a certain risk—that is, they are terrorists who pose a very definite risk if they return to our country, and yet Senator Keneally is out there calling for them to come back to our country. I dont think that reflects the view of the majority of the Australian public.The public support this government—they did at the last election—because they know that national security is a significant issue, and they know only the Australian government has the ability to keep Australians safe. We know from the Labor Party that theyve given up on border protection. We know that, in relation to national security, they have sought to water down every bill that has come before this parliament. Senator Keneallys latest foray into the media on this topic just demonstrates that the Labor Party has no idea what they are doing when it comes to national security.","National Security","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[14]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DUTTON (Dickson—Minister for Home Affairs) ","(14:57):"

Tragically, we have seen two lives lost in the recent fires last week. Its a community that has been tormented by fires for some time now, and, with two lives taken, 61 homes destroyed and another 19 damaged, we will have to work with that community in the healing process.Yesterday, the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and I, along with the Premier and the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, visited that community. We put our arms around those brave men and women—those first responders who were there to protect lives and to protect properties and, sadly, the ones who found the fatalities. We need to make sure that those brave Australians heal with us. We will work with the New South Wales government in making sure that our response to the recovery is done as quickly as we possibly can. Weve already undertaken initial measures, and, as the fires abate, the New South Wales fire authorities will get additional staff in to make further assessments around what recovery measures we need to make.The federal governments already taken steps, particularly around the fact that a sawmill was lost. Thirty to 50 people are now out of a job, because that sawmill was totally destroyed. We immediately put a disaster recovery allowance in place for 13 weeks, but well continue to be agile with respect to the response of that community and that business in making sure that their income, their livelihood, is protected for the coming future, until that business is able to recover.Its important to understand that we all have a responsibility to play in this as Australians—at a local level, at a community level and at a national level. Its important we all have a plan around bushfires. No-one is safe from this, particularly those in regional Australia who live in the bush. Out of respect for those brave men and women who are prepared to put their lives on the line for us, its important that you have an exit for them. You owe it to those brave men and women, many of whom are volunteers, who are prepared to put their lives on the line. Many of those men and women we met yesterday, who we put our arms around yesterday, are shattered not only because of the loss of infrastructure but also because of the loss of life.

Since the drought summit last year, as I referred to in an earlier answer today, we have made some very significant changes to the farm household allowance, and we didnt make those changes unilaterally. The Minister for Water Resources, Drought, Rural Finance, Natural Disaster and Emergency Management, then minister for agriculture, commissioned a review of the farm household allowance and went out and spoke directly to all those affected in the sector through that independent review process. That independent review process recommended that we go from three years to four years, and for that four years to be four in every 10—four in every 10. I remind the member that, when the Labor Party was in power, it was three years only, for life—three years, for life! We increased that to four years in 10 and now, in this year most recently completed, weve provided $114.2 million to support those families and eased up on the compliance requirements and the assessment requirements, which has enabled more of those families, numbering some 6,000 now—which, when Labor was in, numbered only around 300 or thereabouts. I heard before that the drought has just started. We learnt in Queensland today, in the minister for droughts electorate, that its been going for eight years. So in all of that period of time what weve done, and what we have most recently done through the National Drought Summit, has been to increase access to that payment, and we will continue to consult closely with the community when it comes to making any further changes if they are considered necessary. But were acting in accordance with the advice, and the head of the farmers peak body in Queensland has been very clear about the need to maintain those arrangements as theyve been set. Thats what AgForce has said.And so were going to listen to the farmers and were going to listen to the rural communities. Thats why in just the last few weeks since we sat in this place, together with the New South Wales government weve put over a billion dollars into new dams and upgraded dams. Weve put over $60 million into additional farm household assistance just since we have come back to this parliament. On top of that weve put an additional $14 million into drought-affected local government areas to ensure that we can keep those local economies moving. We will continue to respond to the drought as and when we need to each and every day, and that will go on into the future with our full support.","Drought","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[17]/answer/talk.text/body/p[4]","N/A","N/A"

She also managed her own private business, her own practice, and one of the things that she realised was that, in order for a business to be sustainable, it had to be successful and a budget had to be managed. So she saw in 2011 the consequences for patients when the then government ran out of money and delayed the listing of medicines such as Invega for schizophrenia, with the impact on patients around Australia. Fortunately, we have a strong budget and we have a strong economy. Because of that, we are able to make the commitment to list the medicines that the medical experts recommend.Two weeks ago today I was privileged to join the Prime Minister at the Northern Cancer Institute in St Leonards. Whilst we were there we were able to list a series of new medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. One of those medicines is a combination therapy of Avastin and Tecentriq, and this is for lung cancer. It is for 755 patients who have stage 4 metastatic lung cancer. One of those patients who is benefiting from a medicine which would otherwise cost $189,000 and is now available for $40.30 or $6.50 was Pernilla. Pernilla was with us, and she had that stage 4 lung cancer diagnosed after pain emerged not in her lungs but in her hips. She was given a very short future, but she was given access to this medicine and, as a result of that, she saw the shrinking of the tumour and she is with us, we hope, for a very long time.In addition to that, a medicine—Besponsa and Blincyto—was listed for people with Philadelphia-chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. There are only a small number of patients—16 patients—but it would otherwise cost them $122,000. By chance, that week I met a patient in my own electorate who benefited from this medicine. As a consequence of that listing, what we see is that there are patients around Australia, including those with nausea following from chemotherapy and another 500,000 patients, who are benefiting from lower-cost medicines that were listed from 1 October. We do these things because we can, because we have the economy that allows it. We do these things because its the right thing to do. We do these things because, at the end of the day, when you have an economy and a commitment which come together, were able to save lives and protect lives.","Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme","QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[13]/subdebate.1[18]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HUNT (Flinders—Minister for Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Cabinet) ","(15:11):"

228,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation",274506,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr SHARMA: by leave—Report 186 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties covers the committees review of two separate trade agreements: the comprehensive economic partnership agreement between the government of Australia and the government of Indonesia, also known as IA-CEPA, and the free trade agreement between Australia and Hong Kong and the investment agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the Hong Kong special administrative region.At this time of growing global economic uncertainty and mounting trade tensions, countries like Australia need to stand up for the principle of free trade and shore up the foundations of the global trading system. Australia has been a huge beneficiary from the liberalisation of the global economy. The ability to trade freely around the world on the basis of transparent and predictable rules has delivered us improved living standards, better jobs, higher wages and greater choice. This is why it is important for Australia to stand up for the global trading system and play our part to maintain and improve its liberal and open character. Its especially important given that one in five Australian jobs is linked to trade.The agreement with Indonesia has the potential to transform our economic relationship and lift it to a level that better reflects the strategic importance of our two countries to one another. Australian grain and citrus growers, cattle producers, mining equipment providers and vocational education suppliers all stand to benefit from the improved access to the Indonesian market which the agreement provides.But beyond this, and as the name implies, the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement goes on to lay the foundations for a comprehensive economic partnership with our largest northern neighbour. It will support Indonesias own economic growth by supporting Indonesian capacity in key areas and position Australia as a partner of choice. It will improve the business and investment environment. It will provide a vehicle to tackle emerging issues in trade such as non-tariff barriers, the digital economy, connectivity, competition policy and regulatory transparency. Indonesia is one of Australias highest priority relationships, and this agreement will help grow our ties in a part of the relationship that has been historically underdone. This is why the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has recommended that we take action to implement the agreement as soon as possible.Our economic and trading relationship with Hong Kong, one of Asias largest and most open economies, is already well established. The Australia-Hong Kong Free Trade Agreement largely codifies existing trade and market access arrangements, providing certainty into the future. It also modernises the treatment regime for foreign investors, making investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms more transparent and more constrained and improving safeguards for governments wishing to adopt legitimate public policy measures in areas such as tobacco control.It would not be realistic to consider the agreement in isolation from the political protests that have been underway in Hong Kong for several months. In considering this agreement, the committee heard from witnesses about the ongoing civil disturbances and political instability in Hong Kong. The committee supports a peaceful resolution of these issues within the one country, two systems framework and Hong Kongs own institutions. We also recognise that the preservation of Hong Kongs unique status under the basic law, under which it enjoys a high measure of autonomy, is in Australias national interests, and we view ratification of the agreement, negotiated as it was with Hong Kongs own government, as a means of supporting this unique status. Whilst the committee recommends that we take steps to implement the free trade agreement, the timing of the agreements entry into force, once necessary legislative amendments and regulations are passed, will necessarily take into account the political situation in Hong Kong at that time, as it should.On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House.","Treaties Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"
229,0,0,0,1,1,"Khalil, Peter, MP",101351,"Wills","ALP","N/A",3852," by leave—I too rise to speak on the presentation of report 186 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. I just want to comment on the two free trade agreements: the Australia-Hong Kong Free Trade Agreement and the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. As deputy chair of JSCOT—a new role for me post the election—I want to sincerely thank the JSCOT secretariat staff for all their hard work and the support that they provided to us through this process. I also acknowledge and thank the JSCOT chair, the member for Wentworth, for his work in leading the committee through this process, as much as can be done in this place, with less partisanship and more coordination and partnership in working towards the national interest. I thank the chair, the member for Wentworth, for all his work in preparing this report. I also thank all of the members of the JSCOT for their efforts, but particularly the Labor members for their invaluable contributions to the report.I think the chair, the member for Wentworth, has covered many of the issues that I would have covered. I think it would probably be useful to just reflect on some of the Labor principles on free and fair trade that are highlighted in this particular report. First and foremost, in the additional comments of the report, the Labor members sought to include commitments to labour market testing. In them, we noted that Australia has not made any commitments in relation to labour market testing around contract service supplies, as we had not yet entered into negotiations on an agreement.For this reason, during this JSCOT review process, the Labor members of the committee argued that any future agreement that Australia may negotiate with Indonesia for the entry of temporary foreign workers as contractual service suppliers should (1) be negotiated as a treaty-level agreement so it would come back to JSCOT for further consideration and (2) include a commitment to labour market testing to preference Australian jobs and also skill tests to ensure that any temporary foreign workers meet the same standards as Australian workers. The Labor members of the committee believe that report 186 should have included this as a recommendation, with the language that Ive described. Unfortunately, the whole of the committee did not come to agreement on that. To have that in there did not receive support, but it has been included in the additional notes.I also highlight two critical recommendations that from our perspective were very important to be included in this report. Recommendation 4 was in respect of the Australian government pursuing the termination of the old agreement between the government of Australia and the Republic of Indonesia concerning the promotion and protection of investments, and terminating the survival clause of that older agreement—the BIT, the bilateral investment treaty. There is acknowledgement there that provisions in the new agreement, which we have just reported on, replace the outdated previous bilateral agreements between the two nations. This measure reduces Australias potential exposure to claims under the superseded agreement. This is a very important development.It should also be further noted that the achievement of a comprehensive agreement with one of our largest and closest neighbours, as the member for Wentworth has outlined, is of utmost importance at a time of global trade uncertainty. We all know that in a decade Indonesia will be the worlds fourth-largest economy. It is a market of 260 million people literally on our northern doorstep, yet—and some people might be surprised by this—it currently accounts for only two per cent of our exports. That is a remarkable statistic. The Labor Party has always been a party of trade on fair terms. Were hopeful that this agreement will lead to greater exports and a closer trading relationship with our most important northern neighbour.I also want to draw attention to recommendation 5. The committee recommended that the Australian government give due consideration to implementing a process through which independent modelling and analysis of proposed trade agreements is undertaken in the future by the Productivity Commission or an equivalent organisation and provided to the committee, alongside the national interest analysis, which is part of the normal process, to improve the assessment of agreements. Its very important that we have this independent economic analysis to ensure that trade deals work for all Australians.I am pleased we were able to include in the body of the report some language around the importance of consultation mechanisms and, going into the future, how they can be improved so that our agreements are better, particularly looking at them from the perspective of being a more inclusive civil society with the union movement as well as the business community. That has been achieved with some of the language in the report.In conclusion, I echo what the member for Wentworth raised in respect of the Hong Kong free trade agreement. There is a valid argument that the ratification of this agreement with Hong Kong does in and of itself focus attention on the unique status of Hong Kong and its one-country two-systems framework. The characteristics that make Hong Kong unique under this system are recognised in a sense by the very act of engaging with them and signing a separate agreement with the autonomous territory. It emphasises the fact that they have a separate system to an extent with the rule of law, freedom of expression and the limited democratic rights that are afforded to the citizens of Hong Kong under the basic law and that are held dear by the people of Hong Kong and those outside of Hong Kong. They are in line with many democratic values of many other countries, such as our own.Given the ongoing political instability and civil disturbance in Hong Kong, any risk to those unique elements of the Hong Kong system is very concerning to us. As long as the signing and ratification of the agreement with Hong Kong strengthens those unique elements it is obviously worthwhile that we support this. I do note for the record that any diminution of those unique elements in the Hong Kong system would be very concerning and probably lead us to have another look or reconsider the time line for ratification. It is important that that is noted. I have in public and in the media spoken up for the right to peacefully protest in Hong Kong. If we as democratic leaders and members of parliament in a democracy dont actually support them and their right to peacefully protest, who will?Its important that the report also contained some language with respect to the ongoing civil disturbances and political instability, and urged for a peaceful resolution of these issues and for the preservation of that unique status that is enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong. Im pleased to have worked with the chair to make sure that that kind of language was also included.In conclusion, I wish to thank all of the groups, the associations, the organisations and the individuals that participated in the committees inquiry by putting in written submissions, attending public hearings and answering our many, many questions. I thank them for all the hard work they put in and for their input. I also thank all the members of the committee. It is, as I mentioned, important that trade agreement processes should be more open and consultative, and we hope that will continue into the future. JSCOT is one of the few avenues for ordinary people—individuals, as well as other stakeholders—to provide input and feedback, so their input into the JSCOT report is of critical importance. I want to give my personal thanks to all of the different civil society groups, the union movement, business groups, researchers, academics and individual citizens who took the time and made the effort to speak to the committee during this process.","Treaties Committee","COMMITTEES","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[17]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr KHALIL (Wills) ","(15:22):"

234,0,0,0,1,1,"Dreyfus, Mark, MP","HWG","Isaacs","ALP","N/A",3855," I rise to speak on the New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019. This bill, I fear, is more of a plan to get a headline than a plan to get migrants into the regional areas of Australia. Of course all of us would support the idea of getting migrants into regional Australia, and of course the government claims that the aim of this legislation is to, together with the new visas that have been created, change the geographic make-up of visa holders by increasing the number of people settling outside major cities in regional Australia. But, like so much else that this government does, we have here yet another marketing strategy rather than an actual strategy that might be directed at achieving a worthy aim.Labor supports the broad intent of this bill, and the members of the Labor Party who have spoken previously on the bill have, I hope, made that clear. And, as with previous Labor speakers, I join in expressing some very serious concerns that this legislation and the two new visas that the legislation supports have not been properly thought through; are not supported by additional resources; are not supported by any program; and are not supported by additional services, particularly settlement services, that might be thought to be necessary if new skilled visa holders are to be settled in regional Australia. None of that has been explained by the government, and nor has the government put forward any evidence to suggest that this new arrangement that it has with the two new skilled regional visas is, in fact, going to achieve the aim that the government has said that it will.I want to first comment on a curious aspect of this legislation. The two new visas that the government has announced are the subclass 491 visa, the skilled work regional provisional visa for skilled people who are nominated by a state or territory government or sponsored by an eligible family member to live and work in regional Australia; and the subclass 494 visa, the skilled employer-sponsored regional provisional visa, enabling an Australian business to sponsor skilled workers to work in their business in regional Australia. Its said by the government that these two visas are going to account for some 23,000 places out of the 160,000 permanent places that are to be available each year according to the governments current target. But the curious aspect of this bill is that the bill itself does not create these two new visas, nor does the bill do anything to specify what regional Australia is for the purposes of these two visas.Instead, this bill makes consequential amendments to a whole range of other legislation that is administered by the Department of Social Services, the Department of Education and the Attorney-Generals Department. Specifically, the bill amends these acts: the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999, the Disability Services Act 1986, the Fair Entitlements Guarantee Act 2012, the Higher Education Support Act 2003, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013, the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010 and the Social Security Act 1991. Thats a curious position for what is said to be a very important new measure that the government is bringing forward.What has in fact occurred here is that the government has put all the operative parts of this new measure in delegated legislation, which is a favoured device of this government. Rather than bringing before this House substantive matters as part of legislation, we get an overreliance on delegated authority. Something that should very much have been the subject of the primary legislation so that it could have been properly examined and properly debated here has been left to delegated legislation. The establishment of the visas themselves and the locations to which theyll apply are not part of this proposed legislation thats before the House today. Instead, they are subject to ongoing change by the minister, through regulation. Its not a particularly desirable legislative practice. Its something that the government has done a great deal in its more than six years in office. Its something that the government should reconsider.To return to the substance of the scheme that this bill goes part-way towards implementing, the first proposition I wish to advance is that, despite multiple speakers and the minister having suggested that somehow this is going to form part of the governments congestion-busting program, at most it would amount to a drop in the bucket. Lets put this in a bit of context. Over the last 30 years, the population of Australia has increased by around 50 per cent. Over the next 30 years, the population of Australia is projected to increase by another 50 per cent. Youve only got to look at the city that I come from to see the huge rise in population from around just over three million in 1989 to around five million today. Thats more than 50 per cent growth in that 30-year period, and thats consistent with the projections for growth in Australia. Most of the growth will be in our larger cities. It reflects economic growth and economic opportunity. Of course, it poses a huge challenge to policymakers. Its one that Labor has been grappling with, its one that Labor grappled with in government and its one that all Australian governments will need to grapple with: that huge increase in Australias population and particularly the huge increases that we are seeing in our big cities.What we know is that road congestion is getting worse. We know that commuters in Sydney are experiencing a huge average journey of 71 minutes to and from work, Melburnians are experiencing an average journey of 65 minutes to and from work, and very many of our fellow Australians are experiencing much worse congestion and much longer journeys to work. Our road congestion costs are predicted to more than double by 2031. And what do we have by way of response from this government? We have them suggesting that the creation of two new subclasses of visa, which are going to commence in November this year, is somehow a congestion-busting measure. It is laughable! It is laughable as soon as one hears it stated.What we actually know is that the Reserve Bank governor has called for infrastructure investment to be brought forward. Hes made that call seven times since the election alone. He is making that call, of course, to try to ensure that our sluggish economy is kick-started but he is also making that call because he understands the economic imperative of doing something about the absence of public transport and roads in our big cities. Thats what infrastructure spending needs to be directed to. What we know is that this same Morrison government thats putting forward a boast about the way in which these visa classes are to be something thats going to bust congestion has failed to spend a cent from its Urban Congestion Fund in the whole of 2018-19, even though $40 million was forecast to be spent in the budget that was handed down by this government in April of this year. All we are getting from the Morrison government is a feeble call for the states to do more—not actual infrastructure spending from the government, but a feeble call. It was most recently made by the Treasurer, who asked the states to identify some projects on infrastructure that they might perhaps start to do something about. What weve got is a government thats trying to use its pretend population policy and these new visa classes to cover up its utter failure to invest in infrastructure.There is so much more that could be said, not about the actual proposition of this bill—which is a proposition that says its a good idea if we can get migrants to go to regional Australia—but about the complete absence of policy, the complete absence of programs and the complete absence of any attention paid to services that would in any way be thought necessary to support migrants who might end up in regional areas.","New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DREYFUS (Isaacs) ","(15:32):"

236,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation","HWG","N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Mr DREYFUS: As the member for Scullin reminds me, it is extraordinary, particularly given that we had a report commissioned by the government last year—done by Peter Shergold, a very eminent former senior Australian public servant—into integration, employment and settlement outcomes for refugees and humanitarian entrants. It is suggested in this report—which the government has not released—that, in line with the very many submissions that were made to Professor Shergold, the government needs to do a great deal more in relation to settlement services. Thats got obvious relevance to whether or not skilled migrants are going to end up in the regions. Its got obvious relevance as well to where refugees and humanitarian entrants are going to go in Australia.We have had a decline in settlement services spending under the six years of this government. We have no attention being paid to and certainly no publication of the findings of the Shergold review, nor any response to the findings of the Shergold review. That is emblematic of the failure of this government to bring in policy designed not for getting a headline but to actually support the outcome that is claimed. The outcome thats desired here is getting migrants into regional Australia. What we want to see is attention paid by the government to what support services there are going to be if there are to be migrants in regional Australia. That will include whether or not there are going to be the kinds of settlement services that the recent but as yet unreleased Shergold report deals with.There is another whole area of interaction with another area of policy that this government has completely failed to explain. It is something that has been drawn to the governments attention repeatedly—that is, how these two new visa classes are going to interact with the very large industry that Australia has in international education. It is quite apparent that the government has completely failed to understand the complexity of the issues that have to be considered when making even minor changes to visas that affect Australias very important export earner—the international education system. These interactions are very complex. There cant be a quick fix. But we would suggest that the reputation of Australias international education services, and the high standards that Australia provides in international education, are much too important to rush into, as the government appears to be doing here, without analysing what the full effects are going to be.One small matter—or perhaps not a small matter; it is potentially a large matter, depending on how its administered in the future—is the definition of what is a designated regional area. The government has made regulations that define being in regional Australia as not residing in Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane or the Gold Coast or Perth. Griffith University, in a submission to the Senate committee that looked at this bill, made this point. They said that:… three State Capital Cities, Adelaide, Darwin and Hobart as well as the national capital, Canberra, are considered regional for the purposes of Skilled Regional Visas that include International Students. It is particularly difficult to comprehend why Adelaide, with a population of 1,315,346, more than twice that of the Gold Coasts 663,321 according to 2018 data, is considered Regional over the Gold Coast.The Australian Technology Network of Universities also raised concerns with the ministers definition. The ATN submission says it notes that:… the regional/rural classification creates some inequalities in relation to Perth being excluded from the definition, while areas such as Canberra, Adelaide and Wollongong would be included. Perth is considered one of the most isolated cities in Australia and as a consequence has been at a considerable disadvantage in relation to attracting international students to the state. A reconsideration of this classification would assist in addressing this matter.The ad hoc and arbitrary manner in which the minister has drafted this definition, which he has not attempted to support, is of concern. It is certainly something that needs to be looked at, and there are real concerns, particularly as have already been expressed by Queensland members of parliament, about the way in which this has been approached.","New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[11]","N/A","N/A"

238,0,0,0,1,1,"Hayes, Chris, MP","ECV","Fowler","ALP","N/A",3858," In March this year, the Morrison government announced a reduction in the permanent visa migration ceiling from 190,000 to 160,000. Part of that announcement was the introduction of two new skilled visa classes for skilled regional visas. Labor supports the objectives of the new skilled regional visas. That certainly is a change to the geographic distribution of visa holders by increasing the number who reside outside the major cities. Significantly, its not as if the bill is going to define regional Australia for the purposes of these two new visa classes. The minister, through regulation, will define living in regional Australia as not residing in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane or the Gold Coast. So it takes a pretty broad brush to regional Australia.Whilst I say that Labor is supportive of the objectives of the bill, I would particularly like to address, as I go on, the amendments moved by the member for Scullin. But, before that, Ill say that the bill introduces two new classes of visas. The first is subclass 491, which is the skilled work regional provisional visa, for skilled people who are nominated by the state or territory government, or sponsored by an eligible family member, to live and work in a regional area. The second one is subclass 494, the skilled employer-sponsored regional provisional visa, enabling an Australian business to sponsor skilled workers to work in their business in regional Australia. Clearly, either of those classes of people will be required, if the bill is passed, to live for at least three years in a regional area before theyll become eligible for a permanent visa. It is predicated on moving people—certainly with these visa classes—out of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and the Gold Coast. The purpose of that, according to the government, is to decrease the level of congestion which occurs in those main cities. But what the government has failed to outline, quite frankly, is how they intend to provide support for the almost 23,000 visa holders living in regional Australia.I dont represent an electorate in regional Australia. However, I do represent an electorate in outer metropolitan Sydney. I do represent an electorate that does receive the vast majority of refugees and many new immigrants to this country. One of the things I have complained often about—not only in this place but to the minister directly—is the fact that, while my electorate receives the vast majority of refugees and new arrivals in this country, it certainly doesnt get the majority of finance going to settlement services to help people properly settle into this country and to help them make a valued contribution to the nation. This is what the member for Scullins amendment goes to: he notes the governments failure, firstly, to adequately fund settlement services and, secondly, to explain the extra services that will be made available to support regional communities and the settlement of migrants under this scheme.I can tell you that electorates like mine did have many issues associated with improper settlement in the past. The centre of my electorate is a place called Cabramatta. Those people who have been around long enough will recall that it was only about 10 to 15 years ago that Cabramatta was the centre of the heroin trade for the country. As a matter of fact, it was also the firearms exchange centre for the nation. Much of that came about because authorities at that stage did not effectively understand the value of settlement services. It is one thing to accept immigrants into this country and to work through various agencies, such as St Vincent de Paul and Mission Australia, to ensure people have clothes on their back and somewhere to live, but the idea of being able to properly settle people in this country would have had a significant impact on not developing various crime patterns which emerged as a consequence of that.I think we have learnt a lot about settlement over the years, particularly from the time of the fall of Saigon, when the Vietnamese came to this country and then the issues that occurred in the Balkans, where we played a significant role helping people settle, to what we see now in the Middle East. You will recall that former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, to his credit, decided to accept 12,000 people out of the Middle East—Syrian refugees. We supported that. We think he did a decent and compassionate thing for people in need.By the way, my community received 7,000 of those 12,000 people that came to this country. I would not have minded and I wouldnt have complained so much if we had got seven-12ths of the money that was allocated for the settlement of those people. But that was not the case. The shortfall in those areas had to be made up by the various charitable agencies out there—once again, St Vincent de Paul and other agencies—who tried to ensure that people were properly settled. They are not getting paid for it. By the way, I give credit to the various churches that operate in that space and try to help people settle.With these regional settlement visas, again, there is a void. Nothing in this bill says how resources are going to be allocated to help people settle as a consequence of that. I note that theres been concern expressed by the chief executive of the Australian Local Government Association, Adrian Beresford-Wylie. He says the bill must ensure adequate support for visa holders and thus take some of the potential pressure off councils, which often have to fill service gaps when these services are not otherwise available to members of the community.Hes quite correct in that. I know that for a fact, because the mayor of the City of Fairfield in my electorate, Mr Frank Carbone, has often made the very same point to the minister and to this government. When my area receives, and continues to receive, many of the refugees coming to this country, the resources are not adequate to ensure their proper settlement. In saying that I am trying to make a constructive criticism for the government. Were not opposing the object of this bill: the object of getting more people who come on temporary employment visas into regional areas. But what I am clearly saying to the government is that, when you do that, you cant take your eye off the fact that you need to provide the services to assist that settlement there. It is absolutely critical to do that. Otherwise the consequences can be diabolical.So were not opposed to the intention of the bill: to ensure that people coming on these employment related visas can live outside Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and the Gold Coast and will be there for a period of three years. But make the financial investment. Make sure that the community is protected. It is one thing to simply say that we need to have a settlement service to help people so they and their families integrate within the mainstream community. But, where that falls down or where it doesnt occur, there are consequences that flow to the community itself. I think weve been around long enough to make sure we get this right. I think by and large Australia is very much an immigrant based country. People come to this country from all quarters of the globe and, in the main, they come for two reasons: a better life for themselves and a better life for their families. Clearly, people can bring their skills and talents to bear to help progress further in this nation. What Im saying is that we should never take for granted that, coming to a country like Australia, someone simply moves out of Mascot or moves out of their point of introduction to this country and their settlement is just taken for granted.As the Prime Minister has said on many, many occasions, and I agree with him—as a matter of fact, Tony Abbott used to say it regularly—we are the most successful multicultural country in the world. We are successful, not because were Australia or because he was in government or anything like that. We are successful as a multicultural country because we work at it. We are conscious of doing what is necessary to make our multiculturalism work. Part of that is affording those who arrive in this country access to proper settlement services. Thats been one of the things that we have learnt over many, many years now, and which has contributed to us being a most successful multicultural country.As I say, Im trying to be constructive about this, because, regrettably, none of this is actually in the bill. But for all those people who are going to be invited to go to regional Australia, whether by family members or by businesses, governments or academic institutions, I think we owe it to those regional communities where people are going to go to make sure that they have the appropriate resourcing and the appropriate ability to properly settle people, peacefully and successfully, in their respective communities. I think weve got a vested interest, and we want to make this work. We want to make it work for those who are coming in on the visas. We want to make it work for those who are going to be employing these people. But, above all that, we want to make sure it works successfully for those regions where people are going to be living.So I just think this cant be what weve seen elsewhere with the issue about settlement, where the government has gone on its way in cutting funding for critical services so that they can no longer provide adequate services in particular areas. By the way, the area where I live is one of those. What Im saying is that if the government is right in what it wants to do here—getting people out of Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and the Gold Coast as the points of destination for these work visas—youve got to properly resource those organisations and not be in this realm of continual cutbacks and simply thinking that everything is going to work because people have come in on these temporary visas. We need to make sure that it works for them, it works for their sponsors and, as I say, it works for the local community theyre going to be going to.So my request of the House is that it think seriously about this. Whilst we wont stand in the way of the passage of these bills, because I understand and support the intent of them, I would ask the House to look seriously at the amendment moved by the member for Scullin:… the House notes the Governments failure to:(1) adequately fund settlement services; and(2) explain what extra services will be made available to support regional communities and the settlement of migrants under this scheme.","New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HAYES (Fowler—Chief Opposition Whip) ","(15:47):"
239,0,0,0,1,1,"Perrett, Graham, MP","HVP","Moreton","ALP","N/A",3861," I rise to speak on the New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019 and the amendment put forward by the member for Scullin. I thank the member for Fowler for his contribution. I want to make a few particular points about Griffith University and the Gold Coast, but Ill come to that later.I just have some general comments about immigration policy as contained in this piece of legislation. Basically, whats happening here is that the Morrison government has announced a reduction in the permanent visa migration ceiling from 190,000 down to 160,000. This bit of information has been put out by the government in a number of ways. I want to particularly bell the cat and suggest that this reduction in numbers reflects one thing that is troubling, and that is that the best and brightest in the world, the people that used to line up to come to Australia, are no longer choosing Australia. Theyre going to Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom or other countries rather than Australia. The fumbling, bumbling minister responsible for this, Minister Dutton, has then tried to window-dress the fact that the Morrison government has seen a reduction in demand for Australia.You might say: Well, whats that about? If they dont want to come here, thats no loss to Australia. Well, it is. It is a great loss to Australia. The jobs of the future, the jobs that my children and my grandchildren will have, will come from expertise. Obviously agriculture—growing stuff and exporting two-thirds of it around the world—will always have a role in Australia. Were great farmers; we know that. We will be affected more and more by drought, and that will have impacts on our agricultural output. We are also some of the best miners in the world. We will always have a role in exporting products we dig out of the ground. Well do that. I understand that. But the high-end jobs, the jobs that show a skilled nation, the jobs of the future, will come from expertise.If we are unable to attract those top brains of the world, if that decrease from 190,000 to 160,000 is indicative of the fact that we are no longer attractive when it comes to the best and brightest in the world coming here, that is a problem. It actually, I would suggest, goes to the heart of the productivity that has been delivered by the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments—that is, we have not seen an improvement in productivity under this government at all. Thats the first one. Im happy to put a spotlight on that. The legislation before the chamber, as part of the announcement, includes this decrease from 190,000 to 160,000.Accompanying that has been two new regional visas. You might be misled by some of the information from the government. We heard it in question time today. They said that this is—what did they call it?—congestion busting. They said, We are sending people to the bush and that is congestion busting. That is a classic ploy from the advertising man who is now in the Lodge—to actually send more people to the bush and say that, because those people are not settling in the city, that is congestion busting. The ACCC would go after them for passing off if they were in the business world. This is typical. They have a slogan and an advertising campaign but not a policy. This is the CV of the Prime Minister. Where the bloody hell is he when it comes to actually rolling out infrastructure? Where the hell is he when it comes to actually having a national vision, whether it be on droughts or on infrastructure in cities? Hes missing. But he will come up with a glib line and some cheap visuals that hell send out to people and say: Look, were doing something. We appear to be doing something.Im all for having more people reside in the bush. I would say that upfront. I particularly say that to the minister at the table, the member for Parkes. I do recognise that the bush has challenges associated with drought and also just the basics of mechanisation. Where you used to have 10 shearing gangs in a region, you might be flat out having one nowadays. Where you would have had two or three families on a property, now youd be flat out having one because of mechanisation. That has challenges for the bush. I think Australia is a better nation when we have as much employment in the regions as possible. So I do recognise that side of it.The governments aim is to change the geographic make-up of visa holders by increasing the number of people settling outside the major cities, perhaps to make up for the fact that theyre not going to invest money now in shovel-ready projects like the Cross River Rail and the Coopers Plains rail crossing in my electorate. That will have extra congestion now because of Cross River Rail that the Queensland government is rolling out. Theyre not actually investing in infrastructure. Theyve got a big-ticket item in the budget, but itll be two, three or four years before they actually start putting a shovel in the ground and a few years after that before they cut a ribbon and we get the benefits of such infrastructure.For the purpose of these visas, regional Australia is defined as not residing in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and—this is the interesting one—the Gold Coast. As I flagged earlier, I wanted to particularly come to the Gold Coast because the only university in my electorate, Griffith University, has a campus on the Gold Coast. This will have significant implications for Griffith University. Griffith University has a campus in the electorate of Griffith, the electorate of Bonner, the electorate of Moreton, the electorate of Rankin and also on the Gold Coast. The Gold Coast will be significantly impacted by this change saying that the Gold Coast is no longer in regional Australia.These two new types of visas, subclass 491 and subclass 494, are all about putting people into regional Australia. Thats the plan. In the future, of the 160,000 places—theres been a reduction from 190,000 to 160,000—23,000 will go to regional Australia. But I dont think those opposite have actually done the hard work. Despite being in their seventh year of government, they have not done the hard work when it comes to these visas.Lets have a look at whats happening. Weve already seen that Minister Dutton is not processing people who have a right to reside in Australia, people who are living amongst us and are keen to be Australian. These are people who are keen to take the oath and affirm that commitment to Australia and become a part of that great Australian story, like the seven million who have arrived here since World War II and who call Australia home, but they are just unable to be processed. Its policy by bottleneck. Those opposite couldnt get their policies through the parliament, so Minister Dutton sneakily sacks people, cuts back on services and then has a bottleneck on desks, with people who want to become Australian citizens, people who are keen.Every MP would see this: on Harmony Day, Australia Day or any day where you normally have citizenship ceremonies—guess what?—there have been fewer and fewer people becoming Australians. These are people who are keen to become Australian citizens since Minister Dutton has taken office as the immigration minister. But obviously Minister Dutton has to speak to those extreme right-wing nut jobs—not just the ones in his caucus room, in his party room, but that part of the electorate that they used to dog whistle to but they now pull out the dog trumpet to speak to. These are the ones that say, No, no, there are fewer and fewer people coming to Australia, particularly in the last few years.For the last 230-odd years, the No. 1 source of people coming to Australia has been the United Kingdom. But in the last couple of years, as soon as we had an increase in people coming from China and India and those countries became the No. 1 and No. 2 sources of new Australians, suddenly Minister Dutton had to recalibrate. How did he do it? By cutting the number of staff in immigration, by jamming immigration into this Home Affairs monster and by cutting back on the number of people who are being processed to become Australian citizens.As weve seen with many of this governments migration policies, what will actually flow from this visa decision remains unclear. I do want to point out again that Im happy for people in the bush to receive some of that labour. I do worry that this wont actually deliver it, and I want to call out the suggestion that somehow increasing the number of people in Australia is going to bust congestion. That term should not be connected in any way with these visas. If youve got more people coming and you do not build the infrastructure to support them, that is a problem. If there are fewer jobs available in the country, either because of drought or because of mechanisation, then guess what: people coming on those visas and going to country areas will then displace people, who will then move to the city, and there will be more congestion in the cities.The government still needs to support people in regional areas. Whether it be the subclass 494, where the skilled employer sponsors the person coming on the visa, or the subclass 491, where skilled people are nominated by state or territory governments or sponsored by an eligible family member, I know it can work. There are plenty of opportunities. There are plenty of places Ive seen in Queensland. Toowoomba does it well. Up near Cairns theyve done it well. They bring in people, like the Hmong people up near Innisfail, to various communities. If you bring in the support, perhaps have the schools, the language and the religious establishments that provide support to people, you can then enliven an area.I want to go to part of my shadow portfolio area, which involves looking at education and at higher ed students in particular. Lets look at whats going on in regional universities. Regional universities have struggled to increase their offerings to international students, unlike universities such as Melbourne University, where, perhaps problematically, nearly 49 per cent of the student body are international students—full-fee-paying students, if we want to call them that. The regional universities have nowhere near those numbers. I met recently with the University of Southern Queensland up in Toowoomba; they dont have anywhere near those numbers. With the nature of the visa process, I guess if someone in Brazil, India or China is shopping around for where to go to university, they dont necessarily think of Bathurst or Toowoomba or even Darwin or Rockhampton as places where they want to go to university. So these regional universities need a bit of a helping hand. They dont have the same pulling power, obviously, as a Melbourne, a Sydney or even a Brisbane.I think you need to look at that mix. Obviously, if youve got 49 per cent of your students from overseas, with a significant chunk of that, a significant percentage, coming from one nation in particular, that could be problematic—especially if that nation is able to turn off the tap for international students with one decision. We know that even with students from democratic nations there can be issues, as we saw back in the late noughties when there was an incident down in Melbourne that had implications for the Indian community. The number of students coming from India diminished significantly overnight, just through the actions of one evil person. So, with things like this, you want to have a good mix of countries from around the world supplying your international students.Regional universities in particular need some help here, and I dont think the government has done the consultation. Of the nearly 900,000 international students last year, only three per cent of them actually went to the bush—to regional Australia. Its our third-biggest export, with $36 billion coming into the Australian economy, and some of the great jobs of the future will involve our ability to retail education to, perhaps, our ASEAN neighbours, to Indonesia and the like. With all that money coming into Australia, we do have to get that balance right.Labor will support this legislation, but were concerned that the government has failed to understand the complexity of the issues that must be considered when making even minor changes to visas that affect Australias international education system. I ask the government to have another look at what theyre doing as it applies to Griffith University and the Gold Coast. I know that the mayor of Gold Coast, Tom Tate, has raised this, and I hope the education minister and the immigration minister will listen.","New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PERRETT (Moreton) ","(16:02):"
240,0,0,0,1,1,"Chesters, Lisa, MP",249710,"Bendigo","ALP","N/A",3864," When were talking about permanent visa migration, I think we should take a step back and have a look at how things have changed, particularly over the past two decades, compared to the rich history of permanent migration that weve had in this country. The government has made a big song and dance about cuts to permanent migration. Its definitely where they tried to win a few votes in a couple of areas which may not have been much in favour of migration, and there was that dog-whistle politics that we saw during the election. But its also a distraction from what has actually happened under this government. You cannot talk about permanent visa migration without talking about the explosion in the temporary skilled or temporary work visa migration. Whilst the figure sounds like its a drop of 30,000—from 190,000 to 160,000—in the permanent visa migration ceiling, there are over 1.4 million people currently in this country on a temporary arrangement who have work rights.Ill speak on the governments failures in this area in a moment, but I also want to touch on the pathway that people now take to become permanent residents in this country and to become Australian citizens. Its a tough journey these days. Its a complicated journey. Gone are the days post the Second World War where people came out, whether they be ten-pound Poms or whether they be people migrating from Italy or Greece post the Second World War, and we welcomed them and said: We have jobs. We have regional communities. We want you to move to and be part of our community. Fast-forward to what we have in this bill: we have a complex, complicated skilled employer sponsored regional visa where we have no real detail, no outline of the costs, no outline of the employers, of how they apply or of whether theyll prioritise big employers over little employers, no suggestion of labour market testing and no outline of the skills, the preferred occupations or the types of occupations. Will they go to the areas where theyre most in need? This is the kind of chaotic approach this government now takes to visa migration.I am one of many people in this place whos the first in my family to be born in Australia. My mum, a ten-pound Pom, came over on a boat like the former Prime Minister, Tony Abbott—maybe even in the same boat. A number of people came over on boats back in those days. My father came over as a skilled permanent migrant. He was a mechanic and came over here after he had finished his apprenticeship in England. Its a common story for so many in this country. We have a proud, rich history of encouraging invited people to come here when we have skill and labour shortages in this country, not on a temporary arrangement but on a permanent arrangement, and to bring their families with them, to settle up, to integrate and to be part of our communities.Back then, we helped people with housing. We helped them find a home. We helped them find a job. In my fathers case, it was subsidised and he would have actually had to pay back the Australian government if he left before hed done his time. So, in the past 50 to 60 years, weve seen a radical removal from that common Australian story where we encouraged people to apply to move to Australia, to bring their families and to establish themselves as permanent residents in this country. Now what we see is a lot of dog whistling about that notion, a big hoo-ha about how theyre cutting numbers and no talk of addressing of the 1.4 million temporary visa workers that are here in this country. Granted, a huge chunk of those are international students. As we heard from the previous speaker, theres just under a million—about 900,000—international students across our country. Most of them arent in regional areas.But lets also be truthful about those international students. Many of them are on a pathway to permanent residency. Many of them see coming here as a student as the first step to settling in this country. We in this place have the privilege to meet people whove made that journey. It takes about 10 years for some of them. They might end up studying two or three degrees. They might end up then getting sponsored for a skilled visa. They might, if theyre young enough, also apply for a backpacking visa—work rights to stay here—eventually, hoping to get enough points to stay in our country. They see themselves as Australians already, particularly if theyve been here for 10 years and if their children have been here. But its a very different process and its a very different experience to the one that many others have enjoyed throughout our history.These international students, too, are quite often exploited. It could be their first experience when they arrive in this country. Theyre not just here to study. Many of them, desperate to pay their study costs, are exploited by terrible employers and labour hire companies. They work in industries like cleaning and hospitality. Report after report has told this government of this worker exploitation yet theyve done nothing. They set up a taskforce, but theyve not yet implemented the recommendations of their own taskforce.Our international students are not being treated well in this country by some universities, but more so by employers—people who do the wrong thing by these workers. Its not just the big high-profile cases that we have seen, like whats happening with Dominos or whats happening in our service stations; we have also seen smaller operators exploit international students who have work rights.The government has also failed temporary workers who fall into the backpacker category. It appears their only solution to one of the labour crises that we have in horticulture is to increase backpacker numbers. Lets just remember for a moment that backpackers arent required to work in agriculture unless they want to stay for a second year. Then they do the 88 days. This program has been so successful—I say sarcastically—that #88daysofslavery is the hashtag for this program. That is because so many people here as backpackers—working holidaymakers—experience that 88 days as slavery. This is the governments record on helping people into the regions to help with labour shortages. Some of these backpackers speak out bravely about their experience. The smart ones, the ones who have a good grasp of English, tend to find the really good employers. Unfortunately, they are literally taking jobs away from people in those regions who might work.You will find Irish backpackers working at Parmalat, when there are local workers wanting those jobs. You will find Irish, English and other European backpackers working in Shepparton in the fruit-packing business which runs for 52 weeks of the year—a full-time job. Then you will find backpackers who come from countries where they might not be aware of our rights and obligations in this country, who are being ripped off and exploited by horrible labour hire companies, and quite often the farmer is also ripped off. In one case we heard about last week, temporary workers, working for a labour hire company, were told that the first three bins that they picked—they are on a piece rate—go back to the farmer. The farmer says: I dont see that money. Ive paid for those bins. The labour hire person in the middle just takes off with the money—phoenix—and comes back the next day.These are some of the challenges we have in the regions when it comes to visas and this government and their inaction to do anything about it. I also need to mention their failure to really explore, expand and fix up the problems with the seasonal worker visa. Granted, they have bounced a few dodgy labour hire companies. But I put this challenge to the government: employers in the bush, the regional ones, have the choice between a backpacker, who they can hire, fire and turn over through labour hire, and a seasonal worker, where they have to pay award wages, find them accommodation, help fly them over here, and provide the pastoral care. Fewer and fewer of our regional employers are going for the seasonal workers through the seasonal worker program, because they see it as too expensive; there is a cheaper option. This is some of the cynicism that occurs in the bush. This is what this government has not cleaned up.I should say it is not everyone in the bush, because I know that there is a real skills shortage in the regions. I have met with many councils, including many in my own electorate, and there are many employers desperately calling out for workers. But I highlight the challenges that we have because the bush has become a place thats not attractive to work. Because of this governments failure to crack down on exploitation, a lot of migrant workers are fearful to move to the bush. They dont think the jobs are going to be there and they dont think that theyre good jobs because they hear of the exploitation that occurs in some workplaces that this government has failed to crack down on.One of the other reasons people arent moving to the regions, and why they end up in the cities—and its really basic—is the lack of services. They come to Australia and they start working but theres a lack of services in the bush. There is this idea that you can just force people to live in the regions without services. There are people who grow up in the regions and then move to the cities because of the lack of services. Im quite fortunate. In the Bendigo electorate, we have a big regional town, Bendigo. Bendigo is able to service our region—our south and our north. But in many other parts of regional Australia you have to drive beyond an hour to get support. So simply forcing people out to the regions isnt necessarily going to solve the long-term regional people drain that is occurring.In their own visa here, the government are saying that people will stay for three years. Theres no evidence that those people will stay longer than three years if you dont fix the services problem that we have in the regions. Take the township of Nhill, where Luv-a-Duck recruited a number of Karen humanitarian visa workers to come and live in the community. They loved the work. They enjoyed working for the employer, but the council and the community didnt have the services available for so many new young families. There were no maternal health services and no childcare services. So, a few years on, despite this great example of an employer working to hire recently arrived workers, a lot of the workers disappeared because there were no services. The government have not set out in this bill how theyre going to have those services established in the regions to support new migrant workers. This is the real failure of the government. They put a lot of policy and a lot of ideas out there that are based on soundbites and what they think will win them votes, not actual policy that will deliver long-term change.I am in this for the long haul, with a lot of the people in my community, and Im desperately looking for a policy process so that, when people arrive in this country, they are encouraged to move to the regions and there are services there. We know that there are jobs there, but highlight the good jobs. Lets kick out the dodgy employers who are giving our regions a bad name. Crack down on that exploitation. Lets give people a real opportunity to develop roots so that they can stay. But, if the government think that what they are proposing, simply offering a three-year visa, is enough for people to stay, bring their families and settle down, they are wrong. We will have people doing the commute, taking a job in the regions and establishing a home, but their real roots and family will be back in the cities. That is not enough. We have to be genuine and serious about making sure that we grow the opportunities.Whilst Labor support this bill, we have a number of questions that weve raised. I have in this contribution highlighted to the government that they really genuinely have to work with regions on this long-term solution, not just for migrants but for all Australians. There are great opportunities in the regions if we work together. People leave the regions because of a lack of services and a lack of support, regardless of their visa status.","New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CHESTERS (Bendigo) ","(16:18):"
241,0,0,0,1,1,"Owens, Julie, MP","E09","Parramatta","ALP","N/A",3867," Im really pleased to follow the member for Bendigo, because I know that in her community she has worked incredibly hard to bring the diversity in her community into the mainstream workforce, and Ive heard stories of the wonderful work shes done with local businesses and particularly some of our newer Australian migrant communities in Bendigo. I want to do three things today. I want to just very briefly outline what this bill, the New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019, is about and why we reserve our final judgement until after the Senate committee has conducted its inquiry. Then I want to talk about the model that the government has used in putting this together. Its an extremely industrial model, and I want to explain what I mean by that. Then I want to talk about my community and why the approach the government is taking underestimates the needs of my community in Parramatta and the contribution that many of them could make to regional centres if those centres had the services that they need to do well.Firstly, the bill is essentially about reducing the permanent migration ceiling from 190,000 to 160,000. Theyve done that already, and as part of that announcement theyre announcing two new regional visas. Their purpose is to change the geographic make-up of visa holders by increasing the number of people who settle outside of major cities, in regional Australia. Regional in this context means not Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, the Gold Coast or Perth. It means not the five big economies. The two new visas are subclass 491, which is the skilled work regional provisional visa for skilled people who are nominated by a state or territory government or sponsored by an eligible family member to live and work in regional Australia; and the subclass 494 visa, the skilled employer-sponsored regional provisional visa, enabling an Australian business to sponsor skilled workers to work in their business in regional Australia. These two visas will account for 23,000 places out of the 160,000 permanent places available. But there are many aspects of this approach which are unclear. They are of course provisional visas; people wont receive permanent visas until theyve spent three years there. But, again, theres very little information on whether theres going to be market testing, whether its going to be big business or small business, and how its going to work. The detail really isnt here.It risks the same sort of failure that weve seen many times with programs which, with some sort of incentive, encourage people to move into a regional area for a short period of time, but as soon as that period is over they move back to the city. I have known people in my community where, for example, one partner is a doctor and needs to work in a regional centre for a period of time but their partner remains in Sydney, and they literally join each other on weekends. They are only there for as long as they need to be, because the services simply arent there, their community isnt there and the opportunities for their family arent there.Secondly, I want to talk about the model that the government is taking here, which I call an industrial model, and Im going to tell a very brief story that explains that. When I worked at the Australia Council many, many years ago, we had 35 grant programs. This was because the Australia Council and the government would decide what the answer was to a particular problem and then they would put out a grant program which specifically solved that problem, according to the solutions theyd found. So, if you fitted into their solution, you could apply for funding. I came to the conclusion that that was an extremely industrial model and that the whole sector would work better if the government decided what the outcome should be and gave people the opportunity to put together their own projects that would meet that outcome.Now, this particular model is saying, We can solve this problem by simply having these two visas, and, as long as people fit into those, the problem will be solved. It wont. The problem is really complex and needs a far more nuanced approach—probably a range of approaches, because each community is different. As the member for Bendigo said, there is the really big regional town of Bendigo. If youre further down the Murray, at Echuca or Rutherglen, theyre great little towns. But, if youre further up, the support services simply arent there. If youre Muslim or Hindu—in my community, we have probably 10 Hindu groups, and theyre all slightly different—there is no place for you to worship; there is no place for you to assemble. There are very complex matters when you move into regional areas, so we need a far more nuanced approach.I want to talk about my community, because my community is incredibly diverse. The majority of people in my community have parents who were both born overseas. We have a highly skilled population, but many of them are not working anywhere near the level that their skills would warrant. The banks tell me that the bank teller role is supposed to be for those straight out of high school. Well, in Parramatta, bank tellers have PhDs. In banks in Parramatta, people who couldnt get work elsewhere, who are far too qualified for that job, are occupying that entry-level job because thats the only job they can get. We have engineers who cant get their foot in the door. We have accountants that cant get their first work experience. We have an incredibly underutilised skill base in Parramatta of people who have come to Australia to build a better life and simply cannot get the kind of work they should be getting.We also have lots and lots of farmers, which is surprising because Parramatta, of course, is not a farming community. But we have many, many farmers, from the countries of Africa, from Nepal, from Burma—farmers by the thousands actually—living in units in Parramatta. They tell me that sometimes their need to touch dirt, their need to get their hands in the soil, is almost overwhelming, and they cant do it in Parramatta. Ive asked them, Why dont you move to northern Victoria, where there are huge hydroponics companies desperate for workers and theres lots of land? and they say to me, I might stand out, and my family is here and my temple is here and my children are still learning English. And thats before you get to really basic things like food.I spent the last two weeks down on the Murray. I took my first break in nearly two years and spent two weeks on the Murray. I learnt to cook in Parramatta, and I get really frustrated if I cant find tamarind or fresh coriander. I got really frustrated because even the basic things that I need to cook the meals that make me comfortable just arent there. I say sometimes that, if I lived there, Id have to go in to Sydney regularly to shop because even basic things like that arent there.The ability to have your child learn as they grow the language of their grandparents, if their first language is Bahasa, Vietnamese or Dinka, and the ability to share your cultural heritage with your children in places where you are a very small group is less if you live in regional centres. Many of them tell me that they think about it but feel uncomfortable. They are not quite certain theyd be accepted and they dont know where the services are. As Australia, we miss an extraordinary opportunity when we underuse the extraordinary capacity that we have in places like Parramatta which are incredibly diverse and where people have come from all over the world. When I use the word Australian in Parramatta, it means everybody. If they got their citizenship yesterday, they are Australian. We have Australians here that would welcome the opportunity to work in regional centres if they believed the services were there.If Australians who already live here wont move to a regional centre and stay there because the services arent there, why would people who come from overseas pick up their entire family and move there for three years if the services arent there? They would only do that, I would suggest, if they believed they could stay for three years and then move. Again, I would suggest to you that you will see exactly what you see when we require doctors to work for three years in regional centres before they can come back and work in the city—families will be split. The families will be split because quite often with your skilled migrant visas, in particular, both parties, both the husband and the wife, are skilled. Theyre both skilled. With the skilled workers that came in to work at Westmead Hospital, we found, whether they were male or female, their partner was also highly skilled. Thats the nature of this community and, unless both partners can work in the regional centre, one will move to the city.They will also move, quite frankly, in many cases to the best school zone. Quite often skilled migrants come to Australia for the future of their children as much as for their own. They come here because they believe they can make a better life for their children. You will find in various groupings within the Parramatta community that they choose one school or another. There are a couple of schools in Baulkham Hills and people try to buy in that particular school zone. Westmead Public School is an incredibly good school and you will find people move into Westmead in order to get their children enrolled at that school. They move later, but they enrol their children at that school. I notice even on realestate.com and domain.com now you can search by school zone as much as anything else. That is a real indication of how much emphasis is placed on that. Again, we have some very good schools in regional Australia, but they are going to be competing with Westmead and James Ruse Agricultural High School, which are some of the best in the country. They are recognised as the best in the country. You will find families are split because one parent will go where the children will get the best education they possibly can and where the wife can work.You are also going to get rorting or exploitation of people who feel they have no choice, people who have given up a life in their first country and moved to Australia on the understanding that they would work in regional areas for three years. Without a doubt, you will find exploitation, because weve seen it in every field where visa holders are compelled to work for a company or lose their visa rights. You will find people who are underpaid, are exploited and work too-long hours—all the things that we know happen already in our communities under these programs.So I would suggest to the government that, if it thinks this is a possible solution, it also widen its scope and consider people like those in my community, people who are farmers, people who have skills with new crops and people who are experts in African heritage vegetables. Ask my Kenyan farmers about kale—they think we are hilarious because they have been growing it for millennia. There are new products coming in from all around the world. We have coffee grinders in Parramatta who are desperately trying to find ways to do their work here. There are lots and lots of skills that we simply arent using in our cities and were not finding ways for those people to build homes in some of the great regional areas we have.I quite often talk to my communities about what they would require to pick up and move. Weve seen examples of it; weve seen large Sudanese communities go to some of the meatworks in Rockhampton and be wonderful workers in those communities. Weve seen it here and there. But we, as a country, can do much more to make sure that Australians of all backgrounds, with all of their skills and all the wonderful experiences and knowledge that they bring to this country, are used to the full before we find ways to bring in other people and keep them out of the workforce. Thats, unfortunately, what I think this particular program will do. It will deny my people an opportunity to find permanent and wonderful lifestyles in regional Australia. I travel out there enough to know how wonderful some of those regional towns are, how extraordinary they can be, how beautiful they are, and how interesting, kind and welcoming the people are. But weve got a long way to go before we find work paths to new lives for the Australians who are here already—who came to Australia to build a life and who are currently struggling to do that.We on the Labor side will wait until the Senate inquiry has concluded before we make a final decision. Theres a lot of detail thats simply not there. There are a lot of questions to be asked and a lot of safeguards to be put in place to prevent exploitation of people who feel that they have no choice—that they cant leave and they cant stay. People are being exploited. Weve seen some terrible examples in regional towns of exploitation of seasonal workers and of student backpackers. We know it takes place. We wouldnt want to see this program turned into that. There are a lot of questions to be asked and answered, and we will be asking them.","New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms OWENS (Parramatta) ","(16:33):"
242,0,0,0,1,1,"Coleman, David, MP",241067,"Banks","LP","N/A",3871," I would like to thank all members for their contributions to the debate on the New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019. I would also like to recognise that this bill is the result of successful collaboration across multiple different Commonwealth agencies, and I thank those agencies for their work.The bill makes consequential amendments to legislation administered by the Department of Social Services, the Department of Education and the Attorney-Generals Department to give effect to government policy that holders of new provisional skilled regional visas, which come into effect on 16 November this year, will have access to government services consistent with skilled permanent visa holders. The new provisional skilled regional visas are set out in the Migration Amendment (New Skilled Regional Visas) Regulations 2019. They are subclass 491, the skilled work regional provisional visa for skilled people who are nominated by a state or territory government or sponsored by an eligible family member to live and work in regional Australia, and subclass 494, the skilled employer sponsored regional provisional visa enabling an Australian business to sponsor skilled workers to work in their business in regional Australia.These new visas are part of the governments plan for Australias future population, to ease the pressure on the big capitals while supporting the growth of those smaller cities and regions that want more people. The plan includes reducing the annual migration ceiling from 190,000 to 160,000 places and setting aside 23,000 places for these new regional visas. The visas will support businesses in regional Australia to get the skills they need quickly.A key feature of the new visas will be a requirement for regional migrants to live and work in a regional area for three years before being eligible for permanent residence. This is a very important feature which will encourage visa holders to remain in regional Australia, which in turn will support local communities and economies, and enhance population growth in regional parts of the nation. These changes will have a low financial impact while ensuring that provisional skilled regional visa holders are not disadvantaged compared to holders of permanent skilled visas available for people to work in metropolitan areas. Holders of these new visas will support local businesses and economies and contribute to rural and regional communities throughout Australia. Its all a part of the governments focus on improving migration to regional Australia and providing skilled migration to those regional parts of Australia where it is most needed. In summary, this bill deserves the support of all members, and I commend it to the House. Order! The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Scullin has moved as an amendment that all words after That be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is that the amendment moved by the member for Scullin be agreed to.","New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr COLEMAN (Banks—Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs) ","(16:47):"

245,0,0,0,1,1,"Giles, Andrew, MP",243609,"Scullin","ALP","N/A",3873," Labor will be supporting the passage of this bill. I am disappointed, of course, that the government has not had regard to the second reading amendment nor to the contributions of Labor members in the course of this debate, which has been an important debate on an important issue. What this bill will do is facilitate some significant improvements to the establishment of a rebalancing of settlement and regional development. But the bill, as it stands, does not do nearly enough of the work that is required to be done. In particular, I asked the minister to consider the passionate contributions that have been made on this side of the House, drawing his attention and the attention of his government to the need to think more clearly about what is happening around these provisional skilled visas and settlement support.We know there are a range of reasons why a government strategy is required to direct skilled migration towards the regions. Thats obvious, and I would have thought a government of a party of the market would recognise that. But what were not seeing, in an appropriate and worthy endeavour to direct skilled migrants towards the regions, and to encourage them to settle there beyond the three years, is recognition of what appropriate settlement services are to be provided. It is deeply concerning to me that the government, having at the end of last year commissioned Peter Shergold—a very eminent public servant, a very eminent Australian—to look at the issues going to settlement services for humanitarian migrants, has not released this report, a report which was delivered to government in February. I know the minister at the table has, I believe, committed to releasing the report before the end of the year, but this is a report which could have and should have guided debate on the issues that are the subject of this legislation. We know that migrants of all types face particular challenges when settling in more regional communities rather than in established centres.Something like this consideration of settlement services is appropriate in this context for a number of reasons. The first is recognising that under this government we have seen cut after cut after cut to vital settlement services. I had the great privilege of spending a couple of days at the FECCA conference in Hobart last week. Among all the themes that were consistent across a conference that was engaging and inspiring was a concern that our very proud and bipartisan record of being a leading country when it comes to resettlement and settlement is under threat because of a series of cuts and, I think, also a failure to listen to the voices that speak for migrant Australians. We saw that in the contributions of submitters to the Shergold report in the media recently. These are comments which are very much applicable to the debate thats before us here in terms of better understanding what supports are required to enable people to settle effectively in the first instance, to make sure that they can make effective contributions and to make sure that their families, where appropriate, can also be integrated into communities, be economically productive and feel part of the community.I hope the minister has the opportunity to consider the contribution of the member for Bendigo, who touched upon some of the challenges that have more recently been experienced in the community of Nhill in my state of Victoria, where we have seen a great record of private sector engagement with humanitarian migrants around the viability of a very important business but we have seen, as the story has gone on, some significant challenges going to the provision of appropriate settlement services. Of course, this is something that all of us who want to see consistent policies around regional development would like to see. So I urge the minister, in relation to this bill but also more broadly in relation to his responsibilities and his role in working with other ministers and other departments within this government, to think hard about how we can wrap around a proper, responsive and adequately funded series of settlement arrangements to go with these new visa subcategories.In my contribution in the second reading debate, I touched, as did a number of my colleagues, on the issues raised by this legislation that are particular to higher education. In Labor, we accept that these are complex questions and there isnt a quick fix, but we are concerned in this area about unintended consequences. Again I urge the minister to consider the submissions made by Griffith University, by Universities Australia and by the Australian Technology Network of Universities, which raised some very significant issues which I dont think should be the subject of particular partisan contest in this place but are fundamentally important to the operation of one of Australias most significant industries—in particular, one of Australias most significant export industries. I imagine that in coming days well be talking quite a lot about the potential for higher education exports in the context of other legislation which is going to come before the parliament. Let us make sure that with these arrangements—worthy as they are in making sure that the consequences of the establishment of the provisional skilled visa scheme mean that people will have appropriate access to appropriate Commonwealth entitlements on the basis of being permanent migrants—we dont miss out on working through these challenging and critical issues that go to higher education.The introduction of these two new visas is obviously not a standalone policy for the government, as the government itself has made clear; its part of a population plan. But this plan, to be meaningful, has to have more substance to it to go with the soaring rhetoric, particularly that of the Minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure, because there are simply too many gaps and too many failures to properly consult and go through the processes one would expect when grappling with challenges as profound as the nature of our population growth and the distribution of that growth. In Labor we take these challenges very seriously: in particular, getting the balance right between ensuring that we continue to reap the great benefits of agglomeration in the knowledge-intensive economies of inner Melbourne and inner Sydney—and inner Canberra too, Im sure the member for Fenner would like me to say—and making sure that we prevent these economies from collapsing on themselves and that we maintain livability and do everything we can to ensure that we continue to have other clusters of productive economic activity.This is a big challenge for governments. Governments have been good at talking about this challenge for a long time, but have generally underdelivered. My fear is that government will continue to underdeliver if the challenge isnt grappled with more seriously on the basis of more evidence. In this regard, the critical report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport and Cities—chaired by the member for Bennelong in the last parliament—Building Up & Moving Out provided a really important overview of the challenges of Australian settlement, the linkages between communities and the possible transformation of communities. The issues it raised are absolutely central to the problem that this bill is part of the intended solution to. Yet two years after this report was handed to the minister, he is yet to respond. Id like to say that this is an isolated example, but it is not. We have a government which, in too many areas, appears allergic to evidence in—and here we need the evidence.I say again that we are sympathetic to the policy aims that are the subject of this piece of legislation. They are important aims. They are worthy aims, whether its about revitalising regional communities and seeking to develop and sustain those alternative centres of productive economic activity or whether its about changing the nature of our population distribution for our migrant communities by offering a broader range of options. But, again, this all seems rather half developed. If we had the benefit in this place of deeper thinking and more considered work on a population plan rather than just a series of talking points, we would have the basis to more easily come together as a parliament in confidence that we will provide a vision for the future.Its all well and good to talk about whats happening with the permanent migration intake, but the other point Id ask the minister to consider is temporary migration, particularly when we are talking about regional communities, particularly when we are talking about exploitative arrangements and particularly in the context of some of the other debates that are going on—in particular, proposals still on foot this month to privatise our visa processing services. Again, Labor will be supporting this bill, but we expect answers to all of these questions, and Australians are entitled to expect them too.Question agreed to.Bill read a third time.","New Skilled Regional Visas (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[1]/subdebate.2[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GILES (Scullin) ","(17:02):"
246,0,0,0,1,1,"McBride, Emma, MP",248353,"Dobell","ALP","N/A",3876," I rise to speak on the National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019. Labor will support this bill which will reduce the PBS safety net thresholds from 1 January 2020. Labor matched the governments commitment to do so during the election campaign. Thats what political parties should do—recognise and adopt good ideas from the other side. We urge the government to do the same with the health policies we took to the recent election.I first registered as a pharmacist in 1998, so I have a longstanding interest in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. At that time, the PBS co-payment for a concession patient was $3.20 and it was $20 for general patients. But Id like to go back a bit further and take a quick step back through the history of medicine access in Australia, because it matters. In 1919, with sick and wounded Australian service men and women returning from the Boer War and World War I, a program was necessary to provide veterans with access to life-saving medicines, and the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was established.In 1944, a High Court challenge struck down the first attempt made by a federal government to legislate for a scheme to expand access to approved prescription medicines, such as antibiotics, free of charge to all Australians. It wasnt until four years later, in 1948, under Labor Prime Minister Chifley, that a limited version of what we now know as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme began, offering free medicines for pensioners, and 139 life-saving and disease-preventing medicines free of charge for the general public. In 1986, the Hawke Labor government introduced a safety net threshold of 25 prescriptions in a calendar year for both concessional and general beneficiaries, which meant, for the chronically ill and other high-volume users of prescription medicines, that no individual or family would have to pay for more than 25 PBS prescription items in any calendar year. Fast-forward to 2019, and medicines are now the most common medical intervention in health care in Australia. In fact, over 80 per cent of Australians aged 65 and over, and 70 per cent of Australians aged 45 to 64, regularly use pharmaceuticals.While we support this bill, we know that this bill wont fix the crisis in medicines affordability that we see on this governments watch. The governments own figures show that many Australians dont fill prescriptions because they just cant afford them. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 961,000 people a year delay or avoid taking prescribed medicines due to cost. Alarmingly, the rate of people skipping prescriptions is twice as high in the most disadvantaged areas as in the least disadvantaged areas, meaning that the cost of medicines is contributing to healthcare inequality in Australia and to worse health outcomes for those in more disadvantaged communities.For many years, I was a specialist mental health pharmacist and chief pharmacist at Wyong hospital in my electorate on the New South Wales Central Coast, and I note that this month were marking Mental Health Month. The minister can spruik listing PBS drugs, but if people cant afford them then some will delay or avoid filling a prescription—particularly the most vulnerable in our communities, such as those living with major mental health conditions.Ive been there in an outpatient clinic when a patient living with a major mental health condition has said to me, Which medication can I do without? These are real people with major health concerns who need proper support, and they are having to make this decision which no-one should have to make: Which one can I skip? Which one can I delay? People are sometimes taking medications every second day, or they might get one prescription filled this month and an alternative prescription filled next month. And we know what happens when people skip their medications. They get worse, not better. They present at our emergency departments with worse symptoms and need urgent care and often lengthy inpatient stays, particularly patients living with chronic diseases and major mental health conditions.Last week, I visited the St Vincent de Paul in Wyong in my electorate, where my late father, Grant, was a volunteer. It was, for me, a chance to hear from them of the work that they do to assist many people in our community, particularly people in crisis. This year, to date, they have assisted 108 people with health care, including prescriptions. Whilst I am grateful, and its commendable that organisations like the St Vincent de Paul Society and other charities and not-for-profit groups provide assistance and sometimes vouchers for medication for people in crisis who cant afford to have their prescriptions filled, this should not happen in a wealthy country like Australia.And what has this third-term government done about this crisis? Its only made it worse. In the 2014 budget, the government proposed to increase the cost of PBS medicines by up to $5—even for concession patients; even for age pensioners—and to increase the threshold for the PBS Safety Net, which, as I mentioned earlier, was introduced to help people, particularly those living with chronic, complex conditions and families, to be able to afford medicines. This would have forced patients to pay $1.3 billion more for medicines and caused even more Australians to skip essential treatment. It was only Labors opposition in the parliament that stopped the government from implementing this cruel measure. But Australians shouldnt forget that this Prime Minister and this minister were part of a cabinet that wanted to make medicines more expensive for every Australian, including vulnerable Australians, such as age pensioners, and that measure was on top of the governments appalling record of delaying PBS listings.Last month, the PBAC made public their recommendations from the July meeting, which took the total number of drugs waiting to be listed by Minister Hunt to more than 60. These are drugs that have been recommended for listing by independent experts, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, because they stack up on both clinical and costs grounds. This includes medications like Symdeko, which was approved in March by PBAC.Symdeko is a life-changing cystic fibrosis drug which treats the most common cystic fibrosis mutation, extending life expectancy and improving quality of life. The minister made a promise to those with cystic fibrosis that they would have access to Symdeko on the PBS as soon as it was approved. Thankfully, it appears there is now some movement on this, with the government shamed into reaching out to the manufacturer following a Channel Nine news report. It shouldnt take a news report for the government to do the right thing and to do what the minister said they would do. I would like to quote from a letter from Nettie Burke, CEO of Cystic Fibrosis Australia. This is how she described the delay: Seven months of lung damage, seven months of mental stress and strain, seven months of a blame game, seven months of the best hopes and the worst fears exacerbated—years of hope dashed by seven months. Nobody should be put in that situation.We shouldnt be surprised, really. The government has form when it comes to delays like this. In a press conference in November last year, Minister Hunt confirmed that Flash technology would be available on the National Diabetes Services Scheme on 1 March 2019, stating:… as of the first of March 2019 the continuous glucose monitoring program will be expanded both in terms of the range of people but also in terms of the options for devices. The Flash glucose monitoring will now also be included alongside the Continuous Glucose Monitoring.Seven months later, there is still no word.This government has made 120,000 people living with diabetes type 1 wait seven months longer than he promised they would. Thats a significant amount of time for someone living with type 1 diabetes, because of the long-term consequences that can happen from poorly managed or mismanaged diabetes. The health minister likes to congratulate himself. He often likes to come into the chamber and appear in the media and pat himself on the back with every PBS listing. He is also accountable for every drug that he refuses to list, for those almost 60 drugs that we know that PBAC has recommended and that havent yet been listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.Australians who are sick deserve to have a medication which has been approved by the PBAC recommended as soon as possible. The governments recent budget updates show an underspend of $155 million on the PBS. We know there are people living with chronic complex diseases, we know there are people in crisis, and we know there are vulnerable people, particularly First Nations peoples or people living with major mental health problems, who cant access these medications. We know that there are people who are in crisis or who are in urgent situations and cant get the essential health care they need. We know this particularly affects people in regional and remote Australia. We know that people in regional and remote Australia have worse health outcomes than those living in major cities. This is something that the government either hasnt recognised or hasnt properly acted to fix.The government shouldnt be propping up its budget surplus by underspending on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. This government does like to pat itself on the back about having a budget surplus, but the reality is that the surplus is built on underspends like this one, and like the $1.6 billion underspend on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. These underspends are arising because of maladministration by this government, preventing Australians—particularly vulnerable Australians, many of whom live in rural and remote Australia—from accessing the essential services that they so desperately need and that a government should provide.The latest health spending data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare show that out-of-pocket costs are the highest they have ever been, with Australians spending a record $30 billion a year for their own out-of-pocket costs for health care. This is an increase of $920 million over the financial year—up three per cent. So while this government spends less on the PBS, Australians are spending more, particularly those who can least afford it. Out-of-pocket costs have never been higher and hospital waiting lists have never been longer than under the Morrison government. They need to stop the delays on PBS listings and start treating Australian patients with respect.I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks that I first registered as a pharmacist in 1998 and I worked for almost 10 years at my local hospital in Wyong, on the Central Coast of New South Wales, as a specialist mental health pharmacist and as a chief pharmacist. I have seen people in crisis, particularly families and those who are desperate, have to come to an emergency department because they cant get in to a GP or they cant afford the gap payment. All of that compounds. They might be able to get in to see a GP—and often with families its not just one child who is sick; there will be more than one child sick at the one time—and then they might end up with three prescriptions for antibiotics that they have to fill at the community pharmacy. It is very expensive for families to be able to get the essential health care they need. For this government to be propping up its budget surplus at the expense of Australians, particularly vulnerable Australians—many of whom are living in regional and remote Australia—is not fair. The government needs to act. It needs to properly acknowledge the crisis. It needs to act in the interests of all Australians.As I mentioned earlier, October is mental health month. Last week we marked headspace day and we also marked 10/10 World Mental Health Day. I want to speak to each of those as a former mental health worker. The governments appointment of Christine Morgan as a special adviser to the Prime Minister on suicide prevention is commendable. The governments commitments in the election to increasing funding, particularly to services for young people through headspace or other programs, is commendable. But what we really need to see is real action and genuine bipartisanship in the area of mental health.Before I conclude, I would just like to go back to the visit that I had with St Vincent de Paul last week. As grateful as people are for the support of charities and organisations like St Vincent de Paul, it shouldnt be their responsibility to provide support for people to access essential health care. Over 100 people in this calendar year have already needed to access help from the St Vincent de Paul service in Wyong, and those are just people seeking support with health care and pharmaceuticals. Ive worked in community pharmacies, particularly in pharmacies that are open out of normal business hours, where people have come in who have had a voucher in order to have a prescription filled. That shouldnt happen. We shouldnt see people having to get vouchers from charities to be able to get the essential medicines that they need. Its not fair and it should not happen in a wealthy country like Australia.Accordingly, I move:That all words after That be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House criticises the Government for:(1) delaying Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listings; and(2) trying to increase PBS co-payments for all Australians.","National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms McBRIDE (Dobell) ","(17:13):"

251,0,0,0,1,1,"Simmonds, Julian, MP",282983,"Ryan","LNP","N/A",3880," Its a great pleasure to speak in the chamber today on this bill, the National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019, without amendment, because this is why a strong economy is so important. This is why the government fights so hard to ensure that we have responsible economic management. A strong budget, a surplus or a strong financial framework are not ends in themselves; they deliver real on-the-ground outcomes to residents, to people who need them. And this bill certainly does that. In particular, it helps people and families, in a very important and coherent way, to tackle the cost-of-living pressures that they face. This bill will present significant savings, particularly for those on concession cards and those who have a chronic illness.I appreciated very much the history lesson from the member for Dobell, but I think its time that we as a chamber acknowledge that it is truly obvious that this government is the best friend that the PBS has ever had. This government is as committed as any government—or more committed—to make sure that the PBS remains a strong and important pillar of our healthcare system. The PBS may be over 60 years young, but it is currently supported like never before. The member for Dobells speech, while giving some initial support to the bill in front of us, was concerned about medicine affordability. But this is where I struggle to wrap my head around it. Those opposite say they are concerned about the affordability of medicine, yet its those opposite who stopped listing drugs on the PBS. That is such an important point to make, and we wont stop making it. The member for Dobell stood there at the dispatch box for her speech and talked about somebody who has waited seven months for a life-saving drug. Well, under Labor they simply would have kept waiting and waiting and waiting, until fiscal circumstances allow. If we know anything about a Labor government its that, given their management of the economy, fiscal circumstances would never allow them to restart listing drugs on the PBS.In contrast, this government has listed over 2,000 new and amended drugs on the PBS, because we can afford to do it. I take umbrage at the way that it was characterised by the member for Dobell, and I know that, if the Minister for Health were here, he would do the same and point out that this argument that Labor members make about there being delays—in fact, I think the words the member for Dobell used were that the minister was refusing to list some drugs that PBAC had recommended—is simply not true. We as a government have made a firm commitment to list those drugs on the PBS that have been recommended to us, and we have a track record of doing it. Over 2,000 have been listed. We have the strong economy, the strong budget and the strong record of economic management to show that we can do it.Whenever a drug is recommended for listing, there is a period where there have to be negotiations with the manufacturer to ensure there is adequate supply and that the price is locked in to protect the taxpayers of Australia. But that is it. There is no refusal to list it. There is, in fact, a commitment to make sure that those medicines are listed as soon as possible—as soon as the negotiations can be completed between the department and those manufacturers—once the recommendation has been made. Lets not buy into the argument of those Labor members opposite when they say that that is not what is occurring, because our records show that it is. The new PBS drugs are being listed at an average of one a day—over 30 a month—to help particularly those with chronic illnesses.Those opposite, including the member for Dobell in her speech, also want to scoff at the savings provided for in this bill. It just goes to show how out of touch they are with ordinary Australians who are struggling with the cost of living and for whom savings of between $80 and $100 provided for in this bill—because they can access the safety net sooner—are significant. Those savings will allow them to either better manage their cost of living or seek and purchase medication sooner. While the Labor members opposite scoff at those kinds of savings, they were quite happy to go to the recent election with a great, big, new retiree tax costing thousands of dollars for self-funded retirees, who were—exactly as the member for Dobell said—making sure that they were planning very carefully, when they purchased their medicines, to manage their cost of living. The Labor Party were very happy to go to the recent election with a great, big tax on retirees without a second thought, yet they stand in this place and scoff at the real savings that we are providing to help people with their cost-of-living pressures.I would hope that an affordable, accessible healthcare system is something we can both agree on. The government has certainly made that commitment to the Australian people, and Im certain its an important reason that the government was re-elected in May. Our plan is to strengthen our world-class health system and guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on. As I said, an important part of that is ensuring we have good economic management to deliver it.As part of our election commitment to the Australian people, we promised to reduce the safety net thresholds that apply to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Under this government, with that responsible economic management, we have the budget to do it. Its the people that matter. Ninety-one per cent of scripts dispensed every year—the equivalent of $186 million—are to concession card holders, including seniors. As the son of two pharmacists myself, having grown up working behind the counter in pharmacies, I know firsthand the difference that quality, cost-effective medicines can make, particularly to older Australians. I saw firsthand how older Australians and concession card holders who were grappling with the cost of living were careful to time their purchase of medications and how careful they were to monitor their access to the safety net. Under this bill, they will get there sooner. Throughout all stages of life, most of us require medicines. Certainly we will have a family member who will understand that their illness has a profound effect on their quality of life. Thats why Im proud to be part of a government that is delivering this bill.In some cases, medicines that Australians rely on would cost tens of thousands of dollars per year without the PBS. However, the PBS means that concession card holders pay a maximum of $6.50 per script and nonconcession patients pay a maximum of $40.30 per script. Patients receive free or reduced-cost scripts once they reach the safety net, which, under this bill, will be sooner. Twenty per cent of all scripts that are dispensed, the equivalent of $37 million, are free of charge because patients have reached a safety net—a safety net which they will get to sooner under this bill. That is because this government doesnt believe that financial circumstances should impact access to treatment.My electorate of Ryan is home to over 39,000 families. Health care, medicines and affordable access to them are a priority. Its important to me, as part of the Morrison government, that we do all we can to ease the financial impact that is placed on families with a sick family member. The Morrison government can do that, because of our strong economic management. For instance, under this government, the bulk-billing rate in Ryan last year was over 613,000 visits—some 171,000 more than Labors last year in government. That is because of our strong economic management. Unlike those opposite, who would increase the cost of living with their new taxes—which they certainly tried to do last May—we are helping Australians with their healthcare costs in a very real and tangible way.The bill will reduce the PBS safety net threshold amounts for both concessional and general patients and their families and will come into effect on 1 January 2020. The impact on everyday Australians and their families in my electorate of Ryan will be significant. The number of scripts needed to reach the safety net threshold will be reduced by 12 for concessional patients, down from 60 scripts to 48 scripts. Reaching the safety net sooner will mean that patients receive free scripts or scripts at significantly reduced costs and this will reduce their out-of-pocket costs. The safety net threshold for general patients will reduce from the 2019 level of $1,550.70 to $1,486.80. This is equivalent to saving $100. As I said, Labor scoffs at this amount. It just goes to show you how out of touch they are with ordinary Australians working to make sure that they reduce their costs of living. With this bill we are looking to benefit 1.6 million concessional patients and 129,000 general patients across Australia.Recently in this place I spoke about some of the recent PBS listings we have had. These have had a profound effect on those suffering from chronic illnesses, such as lung cancer, leukaemia, stroke and many more. Medications for well-known conditions that are suffered by many and that cause significant physical and mental pain as well—conditions like diabetes, cystic acne, high cholesterol, asthma and arthritis—have also recently been listed on the PBS under this government. I remind the House again that these listings simply stopped under Labor because they couldnt afford to do it. Since 2013 this government has listed more than 2,100 new or amended items—a total outlay of $10.6 billion. This is what good, strong economic management can achieve and the benefit it can have on peoples lives. When sufferers of these chronic conditions and many other conditions reach the safety net they will pay less for their scripts and have fewer out-of-pocket costs.This isnt just for people suffering from these well-known conditions; it is for many people and many Australian families, for example, when a couple is starting a family. Starting a family is incredibly emotionally and mentally challenging, particularly with the financial impact of treatments through an IVF cycle. Once the PBS safety net threshold is reached the co-payment rate for scripts for some costly medications associated with fertility treatment will be reduced. Allowing them to reach the safety net sooner is a way we can help families in one of the most stressful and challenging times in their lives.It is at all stages of life that we rely on medicine. In Ryan we have a large ageing population. These individuals have in many cases spent most of their life living locally and helping make our community what it is today. As part of our promises to Australians we have committed to making sure that seniors and retirees in particular get more support. Assisting in their physical and mental health is important to the Morrison government. Its important to me as their local member. Reducing the safety net threshold will make sure that we look after Australian seniors and concession card holders in particular. To help achieve this we have committed $100 million to deal with the fear and loneliness that can accompany age that affect far too many senior Australians. The weekly trip to the chemist to pick up the scripts for the week is important for many older Australians, but it hits the hip pocket. Again, with strong economic management we can continue to invest in the PBS and continue to list new medicines—which Labor werent capable of doing—to address the illnesses and conditions that are prevalent in older Australians, and we can continue to help them with their healthcare costs.Not only are we investing in the PBS; I remind the House that we have increased hospital funding by 60 per cent since Labor left office in 2013—and not through new taxes and not through ripping money out of peoples pockets, as Labor members opposite would have done if they had been successful at the last election. Through strong economic management we have invested more in our healthcare system than they were ever able to.That is why—to circle back around—Im confident to proclaim that this government is truly the best friend that the PBS has ever had. We are keeping it stronger than it has ever been to make sure that it remains a foundation pillar of our healthcare system, to ensure that people with chronic illnesses can access medications cheaper with less out-of-pocket costs and to make sure families are able to seek medical treatment thats ongoing, like IVF, in a way that is cost-effective for them. The Morrison government are ensuring that we are truly strengthening our world-class health system.","National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SIMMONDS (Ryan) ","(17:30):"
252,0,0,0,1,1,"Aly, Anne, MP",13050,"Cowan","ALP","N/A",3883," I think the member for Ryan mustnt be very proud of this policy, because he spent most of his time talking about Labor six years ago. But Labor is going to support this National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill, as the previous speakers from this side have said, because it will reduce the PBS safety net threshold as of 1 January 2020. Labor did match this commitment during the election campaign. On matters of health and medications, I think its important that we recognise good ideas and whats in the best interests of all Australians.But, while we support the bill, there are a couple of points that Id like to make. This bill, as much as it does and as much support as it has on both sides here, wont do much at all, quite frankly, to fix the affordability of medicines and the crisis that weve seen in the affordability of medicines under this governments watch, which, I might add, just to remind the member for Ryan, has been six years. To illustrate that point, I would like to relate a case to the chamber. In this case, I was doing a regular meet your member at one of the local shopping centres on a Saturday morning. There was an elderly lady named Sue who waited very patiently to see me. When I finally got the time to see her, I sat down with her and I asked, How can I help you? She started telling me about how she has suffered from chronic pain for the last decade. She was so emotional, so overcome with emotion, as she was talking to me that she broke down in tears. So I held her and I calmed her down and I said, Thats okay; thats okay.The issue that she wanted to raise with me was the cost of her medications. She had tried so many different medications but the one medication that gave her relief was Panadol Osteo and, in 2016, this government saw fit to delist Panadol Osteo from the PBS. Since that time, this woman who suffers so immensely from chronic pain and who has tried everything that she possibly can to manage her pain has had to find the money to buy the level of Panadol Osteo that she needs. Shes at a point where she simply cant afford it. She simply cannot afford to purchase the medication that she needs to give her the slightest bit of relief of her pain. Thats what brought her to tears.Osteoarthritis affects around 60 per cent of people over the age of 65, and people like Sue rely on good pain management to enjoy a quality of life that many people—and Im sure most of us here—take for granted. That old saying that you never miss your health until its gone rings really true. For her not to be able to afford the medication that she needs to give her that little bit of relief and to give her that quality of life that, as I said, we take for granted, I think, is a really sad state of affairs.By the governments own figures, many Australians dont fill prescriptions because they cant afford them. Panadol Osteo, of course, is an over-the-counter drug, but were looking at the number of Australians who cant even afford their prescription medicine. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 961,000 people a year delay or avoid taking prescribed medicines due to the cost of those medicines. The rate of people skipping prescriptions is twice as high in the most disadvantaged areas. Five per cent of people skip their prescriptions in some of the least disadvantaged areas. In the most disadvantaged areas, its around 10 per cent of people. What does that mean? It means that the cost of medication is prohibiting people from filling out their prescriptions and from getting the medications that they need for their health, for their wellbeing and for their quality of life is contributing to health inequality in Australia.Theres no other way to describe this other than as a crisis. This government is now in its third term, and rather than really look at this crisis for what it is—when you cannot afford medication, when youre choosing between food and medicine or between paying the rent and getting pain relief—in 2014, this government proposed to increase the cost of PBS medicines by up to $5, even for pensioners. My mums a pensioner, and I know how much medication she has to take just to enjoy a quality of life that we take for granted, to be able to get some sleep, to be able to walk without pain and to be able to look after herself and live independently as she is so vehemently insisting on doing. I know how much it costs her just to be able to afford her medications, even though she is on a pension and even though she has a concession card. Increasing the cost of medicines by $5, even for pensioners, and increasing the thresholds for the PBS safety net would have forced patients to pay $1.3 billion more for medicines over four years. It would have caused even more Australians—people like my mum—to skip their essential medicines.It was only Labors opposition in parliament that stopped this government from implementing that measure. It was only Labor that kept this government in line and opposed this measure that would have seen PBS medicines increase by up to $5, including for pensioners, and see an increase in the thresholds of the PBS safety net. It was only Labor that stopped this government from doing this. Australians shouldnt forget that this Prime Minister and the current minister are part of that cabinet that wanted to make medicines more expensive for all Australians.Last month, the PBAC made its recommendations public from the July meeting. That took the number of drugs waiting to be listed by Minister Hunt, the current Minister for Health, to more than 60. So there are more than 60 drugs at the moment waiting to be listed on the PBS. One of those drugs is Symdeko. Many members of parliament will know that I meet quite frequently with children suffering from cystic fibrosis and that Im an advocate and a huge supporter of the cystic fibrosis cause. Symdeko is a life-changing cystic fibrosis drug. It treats the most common cystic fibrosis mutations and can extend life expectancy and improve quality of life for sufferers of cystic fibrosis, many of them children.The minister made a promise to all of those with cystic fibrosis—to the children and to their parents—that they would have access to Symdeko on the PBS as soon as it was approved. It was approved six months ago. Six months may not seem long in our lifetime. Im like anybody else who comes to October and November: we think, Where did the year go? We say it every year: This year went so quickly. Where did the year go? Where did the week go? Six months doesnt seem like that long at all, but Ill tell you: six months in the life of a child with cystic fibrosis is everything. To the parents of that child, six months is everything. To people who suffer with chronic pain, six months is everything. To people with life-threatening illnesses, six months is everything. Its just not good enough when this minister tells children suffering from cystic fibrosis and their parents that once Symdeko is approved theyll have immediate access to it and yet six months later theyre still waiting.Before I finish, I note that I have spoken before about continuous glucose monitors and I note that the government has made them available. However, I will raise this issue once more: once young people reach the age of 21, they are no longer eligible for the continuous glucose monitors. Again, Im a big advocate for type 1 diabetes. What were seeing is that, once people are over the age of 21, they no longer qualify for continuous glucose monitors unless they have a serious hypoglycaemic event that requires hospitalisation. The reports that Im getting from the Diabetes Foundation and from advocates for type 1 diabetes is that young people are actually putting their lives at risk by purposely going into a hypoglycaemic event so that they can be transferred to the hospital and can qualify once again to get the continuous glucose monitors under the PBS, because they simply cannot afford them, particularly if they are studying or working part time and dont have wealthy parents who can pay for them. Young people are putting their lives at risk to get continued access to the continuous glucose monitors. I would urge the minister and this government, as a matter of urgency, to have a look at extending the regime and the access to continuous glucose monitors for people over the age of 21 so that we dont have young people putting their lives at risk.Just to conclude, as I said, Labor does support this bill. We support anything that is going to make medications more available to the people who need them. We do this with a history of continuing to hold this government to account as it wants to increase the costs of medicine and shows tardiness on putting drugs onto the PBS once they have been approved by the PBAC. I would urge this government and this minister to look at those 60 drugs that have been approved. I urge the minister to be able to look children with cystic fibrosis and their parents in the eye and say to them that he did all he possibly could and used his position as the Minister for Health to get Symdeko onto the PBS as soon as possible, because every day that goes by is a day that these children and their parents are suffering and a day that that suffering is continuing needlessly.","National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALY (Cowan) ","(17:45):"
253,0,0,0,1,1,"Allen, Katrina, MP",282986,"Higgins","LP","N/A",3885," I rise today to support the National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019 to lower the safety net threshold. I congratulate the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, and Im proud the Morrison government is delivering on yet another election commitment that will make a real difference to the lives of Australians and their families, in particular those living with chronic conditions like heart disease, asthma, arthritis and diabetes. These illnesses often mean patients are taking continual medication, sometimes dozens of pills a day for the rest of their lives. I know; I have many family members, and Im sure many members of this House do too. But, unfortunately, compounding the problem, many require treatment for multiple conditions at the same time, and that results in the requirement for long-term medication. Understandably, these long-term illnesses can have a devastating financial effect on individuals and families, not just because of the cost of the medication itself but often because a person cannot work as a result of their illness. Thats why Im proud to support this bill today. The bill amends the National Health Act to implement our election commitment to lower the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, or PBS, safety net threshold amount by 12 scripts for concessional patients and two scripts for general patients.So why is this bill important? This amendment aims to help those who are the most vulnerable in the health system. These patients are often the sickest and require the most doctors appointments. They are also the most at risk from financial pressures. I am proud that this amendment will help ease the burden on the most vulnerable patients in our health system. Currently 91 per cent of PBS scripts each year are for concession card holders, which shows just how important this amendment is and that we are supporting those who truly need it. By reducing the safety net threshold, pensioners and families will qualify to access free or further discounted medication much sooner. This will directly benefit around 1.6 million concessional patients—thats 1.6 million Australians—and a further 129,000 general patients who reach their PBS safety net each year. By allowing them to reach the PBS safety net sooner, patient out-of-pocket costs will be reduced, on average, by a further $80 each year.This amendment is certainly not the only thing we are doing in the area of health. Our healthcare system is one of the best in the world, and that excellence remains a top priority for our government. There is much to be proud of. Our public health system provides care for everyone who needs it, and our private healthcare system provides choice for the consumer. Our healthcare system is unique in the world. Our strong economy means that we can make extra investments in our hospitals, and we have provided record funding for that purpose. What Im really proud of is the fact that almost nine out of 10 Australians who visit a GP have no out-of-pocket expenses whatsoever, thanks to record Medicare bulk-billing.Another very important thing that we should be enormously proud of is that we are continually at the forefront of medical breakthroughs and innovation as a result of stable and consistent funding from the coalition government. Our multibillion dollar investment in the Medical Research Future Fund is the envy of the world. I should know, having been a medical researcher myself and travelled overseas, where people have had a lot of interest in our Medical Research Future Fund.The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which were discussing today, is yet another complementary arm that keeps our population healthy, and its not just for those who can afford it. The PBS already provides Australians with access to medications that would often cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Morrison government has already approved 2,000 new drugs on the PBS—thats 2,000 new drugs—which is something to be very proud of.I want to highlight two tangible examples within our overall commitment to putting new medicines on the PBS. The first is life-saving drugs for cystic fibrosis and the second is life-saving drugs for lung cancer sufferers. As a paediatrician, Ive seen the pressure that young families experience when a parent can no longer work and contribute to the household income, or, worse, if a child is sick and the parent needs to stop working to provide full-time care for their child. As a paediatrician, Ive cared for many with cystic fibrosis. Unfortunately, no cures for cystic fibrosis are known and, consequently, several treatment methods are used for patient management.While infants born with cystic fibrosis 70 years ago were unlikely to survive even past their first year, infants today are likely to live well into adulthood. Its one of the great success stories of medical research, and we are seeing people with cystic fibrosis now surviving into their fifth and sixth decade. Recent advances in the treatment of CF have resulted in patients living a fuller life, less encumbered by their condition, through proactive treatment airway infection and pulmonary rehabilitation. Im proud of the recent announcement that the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, has made to that end. However, families of patients still experience a massive burden of health costs with regard to disease management and its necessary treatments. This amendment is going to make changes to lower the PBS safety net threshold to ensure chronically ill patients, including those with cystic fibrosis, and their families, who also have other numerous medical burdens to consider in their day-to-day lives, are less encumbered by the financial burden that come to hand with such an illness.Similarly, lung cancer patients will also reap the benefits of this safety net amendment. My mother died of lung cancer 25 years ago last week. It was hard watching her suffer without any hope. One of the medications that has just been placed on the PBS by the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, would probably have saved my mothers life—she would still be with us today; she would have had the opportunity to meet her grandchildren. At the time, I remember we were so urgently wishing there was a treatment that was available. I remember the excitement when the treatment that is now available for people with metastatic lung cancer became available, but at the cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars for patients. I know that cancer sufferers are looking for that lifeline all the time, and to be able to have it listed on the PBS is something that we should all be proud of as Australian taxpayers.I also remember at the time speaking to other cancer sufferers and their families about the impact that the cancer had on keeping their head above water, especially those who were the primary breadwinners in their family. Fortunately, new medicines are being listed each and every day as they become available on the PBS, and Im proud to say that there are now cancer treatments that are available that are saving lives and protecting lives as we speak.Earlier this month I actually hosted a community roundtable in my electoral office in Higgins to raise awareness about the impact of lung cancer. Weve heard about the stigma that can be associated with lung cancer. A local patient, Jenny, told us how she often felt lonely and overwhelmed experiencing battling cancer. But she also told us about the stigma associated with lung cancer compared to the diagnosis of colon cancer that she had recently miraculously recovered from. She said the stigma associated with lung cancer was immense, because people assumed that she had smoked when she had not. She also reflected on the financial burden she felt during this challenging time. This amendment bill is a pragmatic approach to ensure that such patients are supported and eased of the financial burdens that exacerbate the challenges felt by facing either a life-threatening condition or a chronic illness. Such reforms are possible due to the governments strong financial management and will benefit countless Australians when they need it most.More than delivering affordable drugs, the Morrison government is committed to investing in research to deliver better outcomes for patients. The Morrison governments recent $33 million investment into healthcare practices and interventions, focusing on those with or at risk of developing chronic conditions, is one such complementary and pragmatic preventative approach being undertaken by the government. Certainly many illnesses, disabilities and deaths experienced by Australians are caused by chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, some cancers, lung disease, diabetes and, of course, mental health. The funding for this initiative was provided through the Medical Research Future Funds Rapid Applied Research Translation initiative.The Medical Research Future Fund, introduced by the coalition government in the 2014-15 budget, is yet another example of a complementary policy introduction. It seeks to help understand vulnerable Australians and to provide groundbreaking preventative medical treatment to those in need. We are so lucky to have a world-class medical research group that is out there, trying to fight diseases and make better outcomes for patients. In conclusion, the Morrison government is delivering on its commitments in health and getting on with the job of supporting Australian families. This amendment bill is a pragmatic step to ensure that patients, in particular those with chronic illness, receive the support that they need without the financial stress. That is why I move to support this bill.","National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALLEN (Higgins) ","(18:00):"
254,0,0,0,1,1,"Dreyfus, Mark, MP","HWG","Isaacs","ALP","N/A",3888," I rise to speak on the National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019. As has been made clear by speakers before me, Labor will support this bill, the purpose of which is to reduce PBS safety net thresholds from 1 January 2020.Labor made it clear—certainly since not later than the election, when we matched the governments commitment to reduce the PBS safety net thresholds from 1 January—that we will support, and would support, this legislation when it was brought to this House. Thats what responsible political parties should do. They should recognise good ideas when they are brought forward. They should recognise legislation that has beneficial effects for the Australian community and they should support legislation that has beneficial effects for the Australian community. It shouldnt be a matter of saying, Thats a Labor idea; therefore, we wont support it, which, regrettably, is something we hear constantly from those that are presently occupying the government benches.We saw it today in the talking points that were leaked. These are, of course, the written instructions that go out like holy writ from the Prime Ministers office to government ministers telling them what they must say on each and every topic that might arise in the politics of the day. Unsurprisingly—I say unsurprisingly because we hear it constantly inside this chamber—there were 34 references to Labor in the 14 or so pages of these talking points. That tells you a lot about this Liberal government. It tells you theyre practically bereft of ideas themselves and all they can think of to do is attack Labor at every opportunity, and thats what passes for their idea of political debate.But that is not enough for political debate. What we actually are looking for in this chamber, what the Australian community is looking for is engaged debate on policy, debate which actually weighs up the advantages to the Australian community of adopting particular policies, the costs to the Australian community of adopting particular policies and whether or not legislation thats proposed will, in fact, achieve the aims that it is stated to achieve. The idea that, when one side of politics comes up with a good idea, the other side of politics is prepared to adopt it, should not be regarded as an unusual idea. We would urge the government to adopt that approach to the health policies we took to the election on 18 May. But, of course, thats not what this Liberal government, which has now been in office for more than six years, wants to do. It actually, as its stock in trade, thinks that its sufficient simply to attack Labor.But lets return to this particular bill. Lets be clear: although this bill puts forward a desirable objective, it wont actually fix the crisis in medicines affordability that we have seen on this governments watch in the more than six years that they have fitfully governed. The governments own figures show that many Australians dont fill prescriptions because they cant afford to. Thats a deeply distressing statistic to have to put before this House. The Australian Bureau of Statistics, the governments own agency, says that some 961,000 Australians every year delay or avoid taking medicines that have been prescribed to them by their treating doctor, and the reason that they dont go and purchase those medicines, or put off taking those medicines, is cost. That is a very sad state of affairs, and it gets worse when you consider how localised or in what parts of Australia this delaying or avoidance of taking medicines that treating doctors have prescribed is occurring. The rate of people who are skipping prescriptions from their treating doctor is twice as high in the most disadvantaged areas, at 10 per cent, as in the least disadvantaged areas, where the rate is only five per cent. That, of course, means that the cost of medicines is contributing to health inequality in Australia.We want to see a health system that absolutely every Australian benefits from because they are holding a Medicare card, not because they are holding some particular kind of credit card. Its vital that health services, which include prescribed medicines, be affordable and available to every single Australian who needs those medicines. Unfortunately, when you look at what this third-term government has done about the crisis thats revealed by the statistics that Ive just referred to, you can see only that the government has basically tried to make it worse.You could start with what the government did in the 2014 budget right at the start of this governments period of more than six years in office. What happened in the 2014 budget was that the government proposed to increase the cost of PBS medicines by up to $5 even for pensioners and to increase the thresholds for the PBS safety net. The PBS safety net is vital for people who have chronic illnesses because, once you reach the threshold, which is already set at a fairly high level, you move to a lower rate of payment for prescribed medicines. What this uncaring Liberal government proposed to do in the 2014 budget was increase the threshold, which would have meant that more money would need to be spent by people with chronic illnesses before they were entitled to purchase their medicines at the reduced rate. It would have forced patients—and the PBS safety net, just to remind members of the House, is about people with chronic illnesses—to pay $1.3 billion more for medicines over four years. It would have caused even more Australians to skip essential medicines. It was only Labors opposition in this parliament that stopped the government from implementing the measure that was in the 2014 budget, and every time members of the Australian community hear the current Minister for Health boasting about his supposed excellent record in relation to the provision of medicines to Australians they need to remember that this current Prime Minister and this current Minister for Health were part of the cabinet in 2014 that wanted to make medicines more expensive for every Australian. This Prime Minister and this health minister were part of the cabinet which brought a budget to this parliament for approval in 2014 that would have had the effect of making medicines more expensive for every Australian. That measure was on top of this governments appalling record of delaying PBS listings.Lets pause for a moment to reflect on the fact that Labor introduced the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme under Ben Chifley. It was a great achievement. It has become, since then, a national institution which has benefited generations of Australians. The PBS is far too important to allow any side of politics, any political party, to seek the kind of cheap, temporary, partisan advantage that this grubby self-serving health minister seeks to engage in almost every time he stands up to answer a dorothy dixer in question time. Almost every time he does a press conference, we hear from him about how wonderful he is and how wonderful his government is now that he has been so generous as to list some further drug that has been recommended for listing by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. No previous minister for health has sought to engage in that kind of self-serving behaviour. No previous minister for health has sought to say that its because of his administration or because of his political partys orientation that these drugs, whatever they may be, are listed. This minister has taken it to a whole new level, because not only does he claim some personal credit for the government extending listings that are recommended by a committee which is intended to be non-partisan, bipartisan and disinterested in every sense and disconnected from drug companies—thats what PBAC is there for, to get separation from the drug companies, to get separation from vested interests and, particularly, to get some separation from political game playing—but this Minister for Health seeks constantly to engage in the seeking of partisan advantage by claiming that some special credit should reflect on him. And he engages in a nasty, untruthful comparison with his imagined version—because it is not a real version—of Labors record over six years in office.Lets just think about what has been the actual record of the government in delaying PBS listings. Lets look at last month when the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee having made public their recommendations from the July meeting, which took the total number of drugs waiting to be listed by the current Minister for Health to more than 60. These are drugs that have been recommended for listing by independent experts—thats what the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee is—and the reason the listings are recommended is that these are drugs that, finally, after clinical trials and after examination of their costs, stack up.An example might be a drug called Symdeko. I heard the member for Higgins talking about cystic fibrosis drugs before. Its a shame to hear someone as knowledgeable about the health system as the member for Higgins merely reciting talking points that have been written for her by the Minister for Healths office. Her knowledge of the health system is far greater than his, I am certain, after her many decades of work for the Australian community both as a treating professional and as an academic. In particular, I refer to her work at the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute. Ive got the utmost respect for the knowledge and competence of the member for Higgins, and it is disappointing that shes been forced to just recite talking points provided to her by the Minister for Health. If we go to cystic fibrosis drugs, we can look at Symdeko. Its a life-changing cystic fibrosis drug. It treats the most common cystic fibrosis mutation, and that extends life expectancy and improves quality of life. The minister made a promise to those with cystic fibrosis that theyd have access to Symdeko on the PBS as soon as it was approved. Its six months since that was recommended back in March, and there is no word on when or even if the government intends to list it. Speaking with Ray Hadley on 2GB, the minister was asked by a listener about the delay in listing drugs that can help people suffering with cystic fibrosis. He said:… I think it’s important that the cystic fibrosis community knows that, you actually wonder what keeps a minister up at night—this. It’s the new medicines and the new listings and getting them there …Clearly, hes recovered his ability to sleep through the night, because hes actually asleep at the wheel when it comes to listing approved drugs on the PBS.We have a minister who loves to pat himself on the back, a minister who loves to hold purpose-specific—drug-specific at that—press conferences, where he associates himself with a particular sufferer or the family of a sufferer and pats himself on the back every time the government finds the money through the Expenditure Review Committee or the budget processes to approve the listings that have been recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. If hes responsible for the listings, hes also responsible for every drug which he refuses to list—every drug which he sleeps through the night on and neglects to list. He needs to stop the delay on PBS listings and start treating Australian patients with respect. A good start would be to stop these grubby self-serving press conferences and claims for credit which he does not deserve.","National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr DREYFUS (Isaacs) ","(18:11):"

257,0,0,0,1,1,"MemberContinuation",72184,"N/A","N/A","N/A","N/A","Dr GILLESPIE: Were not arguing over who started it. We are talking about this bill and what we are doing. It is a good system. It wasnt brought in in the last six years, but it is a wonderful system.Thousands of people get drugs for complex or common conditions that would bankrupt whole families in other countries. In fact, people in some jurisdictions just cant afford their regular medicines, let alone the expensive ones. Under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, as we know, when people go to fill their script and a drug is on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, hundreds of thousands of people only pay $6.50 for their script if theyre a concession cardholder. Even though it might cost $80,000 or $300,000, they are paying $6.50. For non-concession cardholders, its $40.30. What a wonderful system. People with cancer, cystic fibrosis and with all sorts of rare genetic diseases can get drugs that improve their condition out of sight.There are 186 million scripts dispensed in the PBS every year. Thats a frighteningly large number, but we managed to pay for it because we have been wise with managing our money. Of these prescriptions, 91 per cent are dispensed to people who are on a concession card. This bill enacts a change to the safety net. The safety net is the financial threshold over which you dont even have to pay the $6.50 or the $40.30. Were reducing that from 60 scripts for a concession cardholder down to 48 scripts. That will deliver quite a considerable saving for the individual concerned. If youre a non-concession cardholder, we are reducing the number of prescriptions of PBS drugs that need to be dispensed before you reach that threshold from 38 scripts down to 36 scripts. Thats dropping from $1,550 to $1,486. If you were telling some friends of mine who live on the west coast of America that they only had to pay that amount of money for their prescriptions, they wouldnt believe the system that we have here.As you know, we have a good record. This government, since 2013, has listed over 2,100 new drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Were all very familiar with the wonderful new drugs for ovarian cancer, for all sorts of cancers like melanoma, the treatment for hepatitis C, the treatment for cystic fibrosis and the new cardiac drugs—all these wonderful pharmaceuticals are available. Theyre cutting-edge drugs. All the immunological, immune modulating drugs and all the drugs that target specific genetic abnormalities in cancers are available. Theyre incredibly expensive, but we can deliver them to people who need them for the price that they pay—either $6.50 or $40.30. Its a wonderful system.In the budget, we have, as the first cab off the rank, the Medicare guarantee. Everything that is really important in the health system can be boiled down to three tranches. We have the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme; we have the Medicare system; and we provide a co-contribution, or a rebate, for private health insurance, so that people can afford to hold insurance, take responsibility for themselves and not put a strain on the public hospital system. So we have a very good blended system here.Many would remember that this wasnt always the case. There was a period when the finances of the nation were in a runaway deficit situation. Its on the budget record—and many quotations have been delivered in this House, stating what we all remember very well—that a lot of PBS drugs were delayed in their listing until the budget position allowed. But it wasnt when we were in control of the Treasury benches and balancing the budget; it was, unfortunately, with the former, Labor-led government. Because they hadnt controlled their budget spending in so many other areas, they delayed treatments. I know if they look back they would admit it; its just a fact. But we have managed to balance our books. We have finally brought the budget back into the black. But, well before that, as I said, we brought in the Medicare guarantee and we brought in all these new wonderful drugs.There are many more coming through the pipeline, but we have a system. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee is a group of highly professional doctors, scientists, pharmacologists and medico-economists that look at the safety and the efficacy of the drug and how well it works against the current therapy. It goes through a rigorous analysis. If the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee makes a recommendation, the maker and the Australian government then negotiate a price. We are willing buyers of drugs and they are willing sellers, and general negotiation takes place. It is a sound system, because we have to deliver value for money and we are bulk purchasers of drugs. So not only is the science rigorous, but the financial side of the equation is also rigorous. We get a great deal for everyone in Australia who requires medication.I am just so pleased that I was, by the lottery of life, born and live in Australia, because there are plenty of people that dont get the system that we have in this nation. So I would like to thoroughly recommend this bill to the House. It is going to cost the budget a considerable amount of money. The taxpayer will be paying $328 million more because of this safety net reduction. But it was a coalition commitment during the election to make medicines more affordable. Weve delivered on our promises. Weve delivered the drugs. Weve delivered a balanced budget and we are delivering the best medicines for the people of Australia. I commend this bill to the House.","National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[3]","N/A","N/A"

259,0,0,0,1,1,"Freelander, Mike, MP",265979,"Macarthur","ALP","N/A",3893," At the beginning, I would just like to say that, in talking about health policy on the Labor side, I stand in the shadow of giants. Some of those giants were Ben Chifley and his government, who introduced in 1949 the PBS, which had been much talked about prior to the legislation being brought into the House—and the Curtin government, who during the war years, certainly recognised the need to help subsidise the cost of medications for all Australians. On the back of that legislation, we have been able to introduce fantastic health policies from then on, including our wonderful immunisation program, which has been the envy of the world. Following the Chifley government, we had many other great Labor leaders. The prime ministerships of Arthur Calwell, Gough Whitlam, Bill Hayden, Bob Hawke, Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd developed health reforms for all Australians.My career as a doctor started in 1972 as a medical student, and I well remember the talk of this new policy, Medibank, which actually revolutionised health care for Australians. Up until that point, medical costs had been a leading cause of bankruptcy in Australia. Medibank revolutionised health care in Australia, and I well remember when it came in and what a wonderful change it made for the ordinary Australians who, up until that time, had really struggled with health care. Of course, it was dismantled by the Fraser Liberal government, and then there were several iterations of partially-effective health insurance schemes by conservative governments. It wasnt until the onset of the Hawke-Keating government and the advent of Medicare that we in Australia really developed a universal healthcare policy that enabled all Australians to access fair and reasonable health care. It is important to note that part of that Medicare agreement led to a cooperative arrangement with the states, and also with private health insurance and the private health care industry, that enabled fair access to comprehensive health care for all Australians.I started my private practice in the week that Medicare first started in Australia, in February 1984. Medicare revolutionised health care for many families in my electorate of Macarthur. I can remember seeing families who had not been able to have access to a paediatrician before because they couldnt afford the cost. It really did revolutionise health care in the electorate of Macarthur.I am really pleased that my medical colleagues, the member for Lyne, David Gillespie, and the member for Higgins, Katie Allen, were able to speak in support of this bill, the National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019, and the amendment. But I do think it is a shame that they do not recognise that there has been a change in the last 10 years, and that health care for ordinary Australians is less and less affordable. That is one of the reasons why Im in parliament.Its fantastic to hear my very good friend and colleague the member for Dobell, who has worked in the public hospital system for a long time with some of the most disadvantaged members of our community. I know how much she recognises the way that health care in the last few years has really changed in Australia and that we are at great risk now of developing a two-tiered, American-style healthcare system where the poorest in our community get the poorest health care and have the most difficulty accessing it. We are seeing this already in the public hospital system with the collapse of the public hospital outpatient system, with longer and longer waiting lists and more and more difficulty accessing public hospital outpatient clinics for many people, and with greater gap costs for people accessing private practitioners, particularly specialists. The increasing gap costs are making visits to some specialists, such as ophthalmologists, ENT surgeons, cardiologists and neurologists, virtually unaffordable for many Australians. That is not to say that that is true for all Australians. Of course, people who have the financial ability can access specialists very quickly, and, through the private health system, can often access hospital waiting lists very quickly. But in the public hospital system were seeing increasing gap costs for private consultations, and longer and longer waiting lists for public outpatient clinics. In fact, many hospitals dont have public outpatient clinics. For the paediatric ENT surgeons in my electorate, there is no ENT public outpatient clinic. I know at the Sydney Childrens Hospital its virtually impossible for a child to access a public outpatient clinic, so people are forced to see private practitioners and pay increasing gap costs. It makes it very difficult for the very poorest in our society to access top-notch health care.I welcome any steps that address issues in affordability and access to health care. This bill in a small way does help people address medication costs. Through this legislation, once a patient reaches the safety net threshold their co-payments are reduced—for people not on concession cards they are reduced from $40.30 to $6.50 and for people on pension cards they are reduced from $6.50 to zero. I certainly welcome this reduction in the safety net thresholds for the PBS, but I must say that the government can and should be doing a great deal more to address the healthcare and medicines affordability crisis that we now know has occurred under their watch.Dont forget the horrendous 2014 budget. This Prime Minister and members of his cabinet were the ones who wanted to introduce the GP co-payment and they wanted to introduce increased costs for concession card holders when getting medication. That was a horrendous and shameful budget. It really did a lot towards giving the okay for increasing the gap costs for a whole range of medical treatments. It was very shameful.It really is a sad state of affairs when Australians are forgoing filling their prescriptions because they cant afford them. Thats the reality that we are presently faced with. The governments own data confirms that this is happening in Australia in 2019. As more eloquently stated by the member for Isaacs, the shadow Attorney-General, the difficulty in affording medications is worse in the most disadvantaged electorates, so rural, regional and outer metropolitan areas are where these difficulties are occurring. That to me is really a travesty. The universal health insurance scheme that we have in Australia is about trying to make access to health care and medication more affordable for the poorest in our community, because of course the poorest in our community tend to be the sickest. The government are turning their backs on it.I know that people have good access to health care at the North Shore Hospital, and they would certainly let you know if they didnt. In my electorate in outer metropolitan Sydney its more difficult for people to access health care. I have on a number of occasions had to ring some of my specialist colleagues and ask them to bulk-bill patients so that they can have access to care. I contacted a neurosurgeon for one lady and a cardiologist for another. For a man who was going blind I contacted an ophthalmologist so that he could have his cataracts done. Its the reverse of what should be the case.The government denies that there is a problem. Im pleased to hear that some of the member for Lynes colleagues who obviously are quite wealthy and live in the United States think that we have a good system, but I can tell you that a lot of people who live in outback New South Wales or even in outer metropolitan Sydney have real difficulty affording prescriptions and have real difficulty affording health care for their children. The government denies that that is the case and pretends that this very small move is going to make a difference to the everyday lives of many Australians.We know that some of the most disadvantaged and the most vulnerable people in our society are being hit the hardest with health costs and that in the most disadvantaged areas the rate of people who are skipping their prescriptions is twice as high as it is in the least disadvantaged areas. There is no disputing the fact that the cost of medicines is contributing to the growing inequality in health care that were seeing in Australia. When 10 per cent of patients are skipping their prescriptions in some of the most disadvantaged areas of our society we have a crisis on our hands. Im not normally a catastrophiser; Im generally an optimist. I think the majority of Australians do have access to pretty good health care. But we need to face the reality that many of the most disadvantaged are not accessing the quality of 21st-century health care that they should be in Australia. Its time we had a real look at our healthcare systems to see how we could better provide for the most disadvantaged. Many of those opposite do not share the same belief as me, and time and time again theyve sought to make it harder for ordinary Australians to access the care that they need.I have spoken in this chamber on a number of occasions about people being locked out of health care. We see that in public hospital waiting lists. For some of the surgical specialties—ophthalmology, ENT surgery, gastroenterology, endoscopies, et cetera—there are enormous waiting lists. And the waiting lists are worse in outer-metropolitan, rural and regional areas than they are in the inner-city areas. As I said at the beginning of this speech, we are at real risk of developing an American-style, two-tiered health system where those who can afford it have access to the very best of 21st-century care, and those who cant afford it are condemned to very poor health outcomes because they get very poor health care. Weve been heading further and further down this path since the coalition government has been in power. Instead of taking the necessary steps to address this, those opposite have actually sought to make matters worse. Once again, its the 2014 budget that comes to mind, with the increasing gap costs and the increasing out-of-pocket expenses for a whole range of health services. If theyd had their way, this government would have forced Australian patients to pay an extra $1.3 billion over four years to access the medicines they need. Thankfully, Labors opposition in the parliament prevented those measures from being enacted in 2014 and stopped the governments attack on some of the most vulnerable in our society. We support this bill, the National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019, and it does reduce some of those costs, but I would stress the fact that the most vulnerable are falling further and further behind in health care.I just want to say a little bit more about the PBS. The minister is very prone to crowing about his very special abilities to list drugs on the PBS. I know that the PBS for many, many years has been bipartisan. It acts on bipartisan advice. It separates the political arm from the enabling arm of the PBS through the PBAC. Thats very important, so that the specialists involved in assessing these medications are able to give evidence-based reasons why they should or should not be listed. We know that there will be an absolute tsunami of new drugs being considered for listing on the PBS in the next few years. We know that because medicine is changing dramatically. Its much more data driven and theres much more technology in developing genetically targeted drugs. For example, there are some very rare diseases that now have genetic treatments that costs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. Were all going to be faced with how to deal with this, no matter whos in power—and thats why the PBS is a very good, bipartisan system. It annoys me to see the minister crowing about his abilities when hes asked about this in question time on the floor of the House. The PBS is bipartisan. I will say that again: the PBS is bipartisan, and the minister should not be trying to politicise the PBS. It is absolutely shameful. Those on the other side who are involved in health care should know that and understand that, and Im sure they do. I will call the minister out every time he tries to politicise our bipartisan PBS. We support this bill and the amendment, and I thank the House for its indulgence.","National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr FREELANDER (Macarthur) ","(18:34):"
260,0,0,0,1,1,"Burns, Josh, MP",278522,"Macnamara","ALP","N/A",3896," I rise to speak on this bill, the National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019. I want to echo many of the comments made by the previous member, who has spent a lifetime dedicated to helping others in his previous profession, and I know he still practices even though he serves in this place. It stands as a reminder of how lucky we are to have people who live to serve others and who live to heal others. I know the member for Macarthur is an outstanding representative of the medical field. Its a tough thing to come after him. Also the member for Lyne, who I have gotten to know over the last few weeks because we are serving on a committee on another matter together, has dedicated his life to the medical profession. Its a worthy profession. I cant say that Ive had the same experience. My only job inside the healthcare profession was back when I was a pimply 18-year-old. I was a courier and I used to pick up blood samples from one hospital in Box Hill and deliver them to Peter MacCallum. It was just a small taste of getting to know and be a part of the health system. Even though I only did that job for a few months, there was certainly pride in working for our outstanding healthcare system.Today we are obviously here to speak about the National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill. As has been mentioned previously, the Labor Party will support this bill which reduces the safety net threshold from 1 January 2020. I think that we come to this debate with a basic premise that health care should be affordable and that the cost of medicines should not ever be a prohibitive factor for Australians. Ultimately, it comes down to the fact that the Labor Party have always believed that health care is a right and not a privilege and anything that we can do in this place to ensure that access to good-quality health care and good-quality medicines is absolutely essential.Growing up, I had doctors in my family. My auntie was the family doctor, as was my grandfather. He also served on the head of hospital boards. One of the things that I never appreciated growing up was that good-quality health care and medical advice was only ever a phone call away. While many other people would have to go and book an appointment and hopefully get in to see their GP but often face a lengthy waiting list, my family were fortunate enough to just call and seek advice about whether we needed to seek further attention. It was, I think, one of the luckiest parts of my life. Both my parents worked hard, but having access to medical care was a crucial thing. It was something that I always appreciate now, especially as Ive got a young daughter. Having to take her to the Monash one time at three in the morning was something that I certainly felt as a parent.As I mentioned, were here to support this bill. It is a bill that is, hopefully, going to make health care and medicines more affordable. On that premise, I think Australians are looking for more of that. Theyre looking for more of political parties saying: You know what? Its not about Labor; its not about Liberal. This is about a good idea when we see it. And were here to back it. Were here to back the government. They have put forward this bill, and we think that its worthy of support. But, by the same token, while we didnt get things right at the last election—and that hurts; no-ones here to say that the last election was where we wanted to be and, even though coming to this place is the privilege of my working life, obviously I would like to be sitting on the other side of the chamber talking about all the different reforms we are going to bring in—I do believe that the Labor Party brought to the last election some healthcare reforms that were going to make our country better, were going to make our country fairer and were going to reduce the cost of medicines and the cost of treatment, much like this bill sets out to do.Im just going to briefly touch on some of those reforms in the same spirit that we are treating this bill. The first one was, I think, the most significant piece of policy that the Labor Party brought to the last election and that we were proudest of and, if the government recognised it was a good idea and was willing to implement it, we would be the first to back it. That was our $2.3 billion cancer package, where $600 million was going to go to improving access and affordability of diagnostic imaging, with up to six million free cancer scans funded through Medicare; $500 million to cutting public hospital wait times for cancer treatment through a national partnership agreement with the states; $433 million to funding three million free consultations with oncologists and surgeons for cancer patients through the creation of a new bulk-billed Medicare item; and $125 million to cancer research. There would have been a guarantee that every drug recommended by the independent experts would be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Much like this bill, which seeks to ensure that medical treatment isnt a prohibitive factor for Australians, that, I think, is a policy that is worthy of support.While we didnt win the election, we did come up with a plan to make treating cancer more affordable and to make sure that, if you had cancer, your job would be to worry about getting better and not worry about the cost of your treatment, the cost of your specialists and the cost of the medicines that you needed in order to make a full recovery. While we come today in this debate welcoming some reforms around the safety net thresholds, we would absolutely come back here and celebrate and work with the government if they were willing to support our cancer policy that we brought to the last election.One of the other things I want to quickly mention is the proposed Better Hospitals Fund, where we had an extra $2.8 billion in funding for more beds and shorter surgery wait times over the six years. Hospitals in Victoria, my home state, would have been $635 million better off, including the Alfred Hospital in my electorate, which is one of our nations finest medical institutes. I had the privilege of spending a bit of time with the doctors, nurses and researchers in the Alfred. Its quite a big medical research precinct in and around the Alfred, looking at ways in which we can find the next drugs, the next research and the next public policy health-saving measures to better the health and lives of Australians.The other one is the Pensioner Dental Plan. The Prime Minister likes to talk about quiet Australians, but I think this policy would have made a huge impact on confidence and perhaps some of the neglect that many of our pensioners have felt simply by being hesitant when theyre about to smile. That, I think, is something that we should never have in Australia. It is absolutely a medical right that Australians should have the confidence to have the ability to smile, to show off and to have healthy dental care. Our dental plan would have given you $1,000 worth of free essential dental medical care covered by Medicare every two years if you had an age pension or a Commonwealth seniors card. Over 185,000 older Australians would have benefited. We see too many Australians skipping dental care as a result of this.These are just some of the measures that we brought to the last election. We say were here to work together. We lost, and it hurt. While there are lots of arguments about who did what well and who did what not so well, I dont think any Australian would say that we dont become a better country by making medicines more affordable and by making sure the safety net thresholds are reduced. But I also think that Australians would say that we become a better country if, when youve got cancer, the medicines that you need in order to get better are covered by your government. If you are sick, you should focus on getting better.While it is welcomed that the government has brought forward this bill to try and help alleviate some of the costs in health care, it hasnt always been a squeaky clean record when it comes to—","National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BURNS (Macnamara) ","(18:49):"

It hasnt always been a squeaky clean record when it comes to ensuring that Australians have affordable health care. You only have a look back at that famous budget in 2014 when the member for Dickson, the now Minister for Home Affairs, was the health minister. It was a different time. It was the budget where—while government members were celebrating over a cigar in the back lounge in the Senate—we found out that the GP co-payment was doing to be heaped upon Australian taxpayers and the Australian people, and that savings of over $1.7 billion would be brought about by pausing the indexation of the Medicare Benefits Schedule and the income threshold for the Medicare levy surcharge and the private health insurance rebate. Patients were expected to pay a $7 co-payment to visit the GP and to pay more for medication through changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme that were talking about today. There was $252 million of savings by raising the cost of certain medicines on the PBS—$252 million of savings by making medicines more expensive for Australians. So, while we welcome this bill, we do it with a sense of caution. We do it knowing that the government have form in this regard, that their instinct when they first came into government was not to make medicine more affordable but to make it more expensive and to bring in pretty harsh and cruel budget savings measures in order to bring down their cruel budget, which they celebrated over a big cigar.I think today is a good step. Its a good step that this is about making medicines more affordable and that we in this place can say to the Australian public that, when we look at the PBS, we recognise that medicines can be a prohibitive cost and that were here to fix this. But, on this side of the House, we also say that were here to work together, were here to make sure that medicine and health care are affordable for Australians and, if the government decides to recognise that this is not about politics but rather about good policy and wants to bring forward some of Labors measures, including cancer treatment and dental plans and dental care for pensioners, then we stand ready to work with them.I dont want to get too focused on the minister in my last minute in this contribution, but I would say that there have been instances where the minister has promised a big game on the PBS and hasnt delivered. The minister did make a promise to Australians living with cystic fibrosis that they would have access to Symdeko on the PBS as soon as it was approved and, unfortunately, were now six months on and we are none the wiser on when the government intends to list it or when the government intends to put it on the PBS. So, while we say today that this bill is worth supporting and that we in the Labor Party do support better healthcare measures, we stand ready to work with the government and we stand ready to put forward and to look at some of the things we brought to the last election. And the minister should get on with the job of listing much-needed medicines on the PBS.","National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[12]","N/A","N/A"

This bill will reduce the PBS safety net threshold amounts for concessional and general patients, and their families, from 1 January 2020. The changes to the safety net threshold amounts will enable PBS patients to reach the safety net earlier in the calendar year. The safety net threshold for concessional patients will be reduced by 20 scripts, from 60 PBS scripts to 48 PBS scripts, at the concessional co-payment level. This will reduce the concessional safety net threshold to an estimated $316.80 in 2020. Without this proposal, the 2020 concessional safety net threshold would have risen to an estimated $396. The safety net threshold for general patients will be reduced from the 2019 threshold of approximately 38 scripts to approximately 36 scripts. Without this proposal, the 2020 general safety net threshold would have risen.Lower PBS safety net thresholds will benefit up to around 1.6 million concessional patients and 129,000 general patients, allowing them to reach the PBS safety net sooner, reducing their out-of-pocket costs. It will, in particular, improve access to PBS medicines for patients whose treatment requires a larger number of PBS prescriptions each year, such as people with chronic conditions including asthma, diabetes and high cholesterol. Reaching the PBS safety net enables a patient to access PBS medicines either at no cost or at a cheaper price for the rest of the calendar year. The measure will reduce prescription costs, saving the majority of patients approximately $80 per year. Lowering the concessional safety net threshold will benefit the holders of pension concession cards, Australian senior health cards and healthcare cards. It will also provide a benefit for gold, white and orange card holders under the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.The measure to lower the safety net threshold was previously announced by the Prime Minister on 2 May 2019 as an election commitment and, at the time, was welcomed by stakeholders as a positive measure that would benefit patients. The safety net threshold amendment will cost $328.8 million over the current budget and forward estimates. Through the PBS, patients can access medicines that in some cases would cost tens of thousands of dollars per year for a maximum of just $6.50 per script for concession card holders or a maximum of $40.30 for non-concessional patients. Patients receive free or reduced-cost scripts once they reach the safety net. Ninety-one per cent of PBS scripts each year, or 186 million scripts, are dispensed to concession card holders, including pensioners and low-income earners, meaning they pay no more than $6.50 per script for medicines that without a subsidy would cost them much, much more than that. Twenty per cent of scripts for concession card holders, or 37 million scripts, are free of charge because patients have reached the safety net.Since coming to government in 2013, we have invested $10.6 billion to list over 2,100 new or amended medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. We are averaging 31 new or amended listings per month—approximately one per day. Many medicines would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per year and would be out of reach for many, but, through the PBS, general patients will pay $40.30 per script, or $6.50 per script with a concession card. Recent new PBS listings include medicines for lung cancer that were costing patients $88,000 per year; for cystic fibrosis, $300,000 per year; and for arthritis, over $16,000 per year. Recent new PBS listings costing $67 million include Botox, which will have its current PBS listing extended to include adults with lower-limb focal spasticity following a stroke. More than 2,800 patients per year are expected to benefit from this listing. Without the PBS subsidy, patients would pay more than $5,400 per year for this treatment. In August, another key listing was Avastin, for relapsed or refractory glioblastoma. Around 890 patients with relapsed or refractory glioblastoma will benefit each year. Without the PBS subsidy, the $31,200 per course of treatment would have been borne by the patients. Avastin treats brain tumours that are resistant to previous treatment and it is very important to patients with relapsed or refractory glioblastoma.Sprycel is for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The Morrison government is extending the current listing of Sprycel to newly diagnosed patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Without the PBS subsidy, around 88 patients might pay more than $51,000 each year for this medicine. Through the PBS, they will pay $40.30 or $6.50 per script.Another treatment listed on the PBS is Actemra. This listing will directly benefit patients who have an inflammatory disease affecting the large blood vessels of the scalp, neck and arms. This charge could benefit an average of 852 patients per year and, without this PBS listing, patients like Alistair would otherwise have paid more than $10,200 for each course of treatment.In Australia, one in 2,500 babies are born with cystic fibrosis each year. Thats one every four days. Sadly, there is currently no cure. Kalydeco has been extended and added to the PBS listing and is now available to patients aged 12 to 24 months with cystic fibrosis. Kalydeco lessens the viscosity of mucous in the lungs, helping patients to breathe more freely. Without the PBS subsidy, patients might pay up to $300,000 per year for this medicine.Labor stopped listing medicines in 2011 because they could not manage the economy. The 2011-12 portfolio budget statements explained that the listing of some medicines would be deferred until fiscal circumstances permit. This included medicines for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, endometriosis, IVF and asthma, among others. A strong economy ensures that the Morrison government is able to invest in essential health services. If you cant manage the economy, you cant manage health. The Morrison governments plan for strengthening Australias world-class health system is providing Australians with access to quality medical care, record hospital funding, affordable life-changing medicines and breakthrough research for new drugs and treatments.Medicare is funding at record levels. Almost nine out of 10 Australians who visit the doctor have no out-of-pocket costs with their GP. Bulk-billing is at a record rate of 86 per cent, up from 82 per cent under Labor. In my electorate of Reid, 93 per cent of GP visits were bulk-billed last year. Thats over a million visits to the doctor in my seat alone. Hospital funding is up 60 per cent since Labor left office in 2013, and the Morrison government is providing an additional $31 billion for hospitals from 2020-21 to 2024-25, to employ more nurses, doctors and specialists, delivering in partnership with the states and territories, and offering more surgeries and medical services. If you cant manage the economy, you cant manage health.","National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr MARTIN (Reid) ","(19:04):"
264,0,0,0,1,1,"Stanley, Anne, MP",265990,"Werriwa","ALP","N/A",3901," I rise to support the National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019. Labor champions fair access to health care for all Australians, including protecting our most vulnerable from excessive costs in medicines and health care. While Labor supports this bill, it wont fix the significant issues that many are facing in this country, with escalating costs of health care. That number is clear: 961,000 people a year delay or avoid taking their prescribed medicines due to cost. Recently, in my electorate office, the public face of these numbers came to meet with me. They are a pensioner couple, both over the age of 70, who regularly make decisions about which one of them needs the pain medication more, because they cant afford the cost every fortnight of both medications. How is this reasonable in a country like ours?We know that this is not the best way for them to manage their health. Being in constant pain will curtail the exercise which will ultimately keep them as healthy as possible. For our older Australians, this is just not fair. A first-world country where citizens cannot get the best care possible because the government refuses to support them—thats the path we are worryingly heading towards in Australia.How many drugs have been recommended for listing on the PBS by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and not listed? Unfortunately for people with cystic fibrosis, they can tell you that Symdeko still hasnt been listed. The health minister promised those patients and their families it would be listed as soon as it was recommended by PBAC. Well, Minister, its been six months since it was recommended by PBAC and it has still not been listed by this government—another group of patients waiting, and more broken promises by the health minister. Cystic fibrosis destroys the lungs and the nervous system. It cant be cured, but it can be treated with drugs like Symdeko. It affects one baby born every four days. For the six months that these babies and infants, and their families, have been waiting, another 45 babies have been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. Its time for the government to make good on their promise.I also note the election commitment from this government, for people with type 1 diabetes, that flash glucose monitoring—or FGM—would be added to the National Diabetes Services Scheme. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder, and it is not curable. Again, this typically affects children, and it is a lifelong disease. It is a leading cause of blindness, amputations and renal failure. Its time this government recognised the benefits of the flash and continuous glucose monitoring systems. Instead of pricking your finger upwards of 15 times a day, FGM and CGM machines place a small disposable sensor in the body and read blood glucose levels once every five minutes. Its like pricking your finger every five minutes for a blood sugar result without the pain, the calluses and the inconvenience.FGM and CGM are proven to drastically improve control for people with diabetes, and greatly assist preventing the additional complications that drain our healthcare system. Baker IDI calculates the annual cost to Medicare of a person with diabetes at $3,468. For people with complications, that increases to a staggering $16,698. This government would end up spending four times as much, or around $13,000 more per year. An investment of around $2,000 per patient could avoid those complications and costs, both financial and social, and allow those patients to continue to be part of our society and have great jobs.The health minister promised the listing of flash glucose monitoring on the NDSS as of 1 March this year. Has it been done? No, not yet. I hope this was not just an election promise. People with diabetes and their families are waiting for this promise to be kept. It is currently over seven months late, and it has been nearly a year since this promise was made. People under 21 with diabetes have access to that technology, but what about those who are over 21? In March, when the Minister for Health intended on listing flash glucose monitoring on the NDSS, 32 countries around the world had already subsidised flash glucose monitoring. Diabetes is a lifelong disease, and should be supported for all of that time. As Ive already pointed out, better management means healthier people and a better budget bottom line.As Maria Craig, a professor of paediatric endocrinology at the University of Sydney, wrote in the InSight + magazine from The Medical Journal of Australia:Type 1 diabetes is not a choice or a lifestyle disease. I cant see a reason why Australia wouldn’t follow other nations in subsidising technology that is proven to improve the lives of people with it.However, this government will only support people with diabetes to access constant glucose monitoring until they are 21. Even then, people with diabetes do not have a choice.However, there are exceptions. If you have a history of multiple episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, you may be eligible. But, distressingly, there have been anecdotal reports of people deliberately triggering hypoglycaemic episodes because they cant suffer the alternatives. By doing so, people with diabetes are deliberately risking permanent damage or worse, with the possibility of complications such as kidney failure, blindness, heart failure and perhaps death.The PBAC has recommended also more than 60 treatments to be listed on the PBS. I wonder why the government continues to stand in the way of patients accessing these much-needed treatments at costs which are more reasonable. And what is the result? Nine hundred and sixty-one thousand people skipping their treatments because they cant afford them—children, families, brothers, sisters, mums and dads skipping medication because they simply cant afford it. There are families who are dealing with chronic and potentially life-threatening illnesses, and they have to think about the costs associated with the treatment.And this just relates to the cost of prescription medicines; lets not forget if you have to go to a doctor to get that prescription. Look at the governments record on the cost of a GP visit. Since 2013, when the government was elected, the cost of visiting GPs has skyrocketed, on average, by 36 per cent. In New South Wales and Victoria, the average has actually increased by 39 per cent. This doesnt include the $7 GP tax the government considered in the 2014 budget, a proposal that was rejected by Labor. Instead, this government then continued with the Medicare freeze, another way to introduce the GP tax by stealth. The figures are even worse when you look at the cost of seeing a specialist. The cost of visiting a GP since 2013 has gone up, on average, 36 per cent, but for a specialist visit the increase has been, on average, 58 per cent. This government has overseen sharp increases in fees that Australians pay to visit a specialist. This is on top of the blowout over the same period in the time that it takes to see a specialist in my electorate.I am sure many of us in this place frequently see constituents who ask us how they can afford to see their doctors and treat their conditions. Recently I saw a gentleman who, due to a significant injury, is on Newstart. He needs regular specialist appointments to assist with his conditions but he cant afford them and pay bills and eat. What do you say to a proud man who breaks down in tears in front of you because he cant pay for the medicines or see his doctor? Australias sick and chronically ill are delaying and avoiding Medicare services due to cost. Thats the hard fact from the governments own experts, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. What do you say to a family whose young son, three years old, is diagnosed with cancer and who, to be able to support him and look after him, have to run a GoFundMe page so that those treatments can happen? It shouldnt happen in this country. Ours is a country that prides itself on its access to health services and medicines that are affordable. That needs to continue.I sum up by saying this government has not listed 60 drugs on the PBS despite PBAC recommendations, its introduced a GP tax by stealth, its allowed costs to see GPs to spiral out of control, its allowed specialist visit costs to spiral out of control, and its prevented people with type 1 diabetes having fair and equitable access to constant flash glucose-monitoring systems. When will this government consider health as a priority, as most Australians do, and support our health system for better outcomes? The government must stop further escalation in the cost of medicines, treatments, medical devices and the accessibility of health care. Australians deserve better for their health and for the health of our country.","National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STANLEY (Werriwa—Opposition Whip) ","(19:13):"
265,0,0,0,1,1,"Mulino, Daniel, MP",132880,"Fraser","ALP","N/A",3903," I rise to support the National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019. This is an uncontroversial bill that represents election commitments made by both major parties at the last election. It will reduce thresholds in 2020 from where they would have been. As earlier speakers on this side of the House have indicated, this is a welcome measure.But, as earlier speakers on this side of the House have indicated, when we discuss measures such as this which are uncontroversial and relatively narrow, in addition to noting support for the specific bill its also worth noting the broader context within which the bill is brought to the chamber. Its an honour to follow on from speakers such as the member for Werriwa, the member for Macnamara and the member for Macarthur who have so well laid out that broader context. In particular, theyve laid out the major contributions of earlier governments to health policy and health service delivery, such as the creation of Medicare and not just the creation of that framework but also over many years the funding of many services within that framework. Theyve also pointed out failings on the government side, such as the 2014 budget with its unannounced proposal that wasnt taken to an election for a co-payment and other proposals that were not acceptable to the community and which were blocked by the opposition and those on this side of the chamber.Those earlier speakers on this side have also pointed out how those failings have actually continued since that now infamous budget. I just want to put on the public record a few facts about where we in Australia find ourselves today in relation to the provision of health services. These are some basic facts which I think should be very concerning to everybody in this place and which should create an urgency for much more to be done. In 2017-18, Australians spent $9.4 billion on medicines and pharmacy products not listed on the PBS. Thats money coming out of the pockets of people who are already feeling that their household budgets are under strain.In addition to this, the governments own figures show that many Australians dont fill prescriptions because they cant afford them. What burden can there be on people, on peoples lifestyles, for them not to take drugs that doctors have recommended and that they need because they cant afford them? According to the ABS, 961,000 people a year delay or avoid taking prescribed medicines due to cost. I say again: these are drugs which doctors or specialists have indicated to people that they need and that people clearly want, but theyre delaying taking them or not taking them at all because of the fact that they cant afford the out-of-pocket expenses. Importantly, the rate of people skipping prescriptions is twice as high in disadvantaged areas as in less disadvantaged areas. This shouldnt come as a surprise, but those figures should be on the public record in this place because that inequality is something on which this parliament should be taking action. Its something which a bill like this, a worthwhile bill, an uncontroversial bill, but a very narrow bill, completely fails to address in any way whatsoever. So thats really the broad context within which we are debating this bill. This is a small, positive measure, but health policy is lacking.As earlier speakers on this side have said, we on this side acknowledge the result of the last election, but when you look at the offerings of the two sides in this area in particular the difference couldnt be starker. The difference couldnt be starker when it comes to the assistance that this side offered to those who cant afford needed drugs and the assistance for out-of-pocket expenses that would have been offered and the vision this government have and the very narrow vision thats being offered by those opposite.Lets look at mental health. Again, just to draw on one particular area of health policy, Allan Fels has put on the record that he sees mental health as an area which is particularly underdone. In Australia, the total mental health budget is itself only 6.5 per cent of the health budget when the burden of disease due to mental health suggests this should be closer to 14 per cent. So there are clear economic costs in this area. Again, if you are looking at the funding of drugs, mental health is an area where that failure is particularly stark. Allan Fels looked at the impact of that not just on income inequality but across the age spectrum. He knows that there are still serious questions about our investment in young minds, as he puts it. About 11 per cent of spending on specialised mental health services in 2010-11 was towards child and adolescent services, yet zero- to 17-year-olds constitute almost 23 per cent of the population. I want to put on the public record that there are a number of very serious—and I would say urgent—health issues that need to be addressed currently but that are—Debate interrupted.","National Health Amendment (Safety Net Thresholds) Bill 2019","BILLS","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[18]/subdebate.1[2]/subdebate.2/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr MULINO (Fraser) ","(19:24):"

267,0,0,0,1,1,"Shorten, Bill, MP","00ATG","Maribyrnong","ALP","N/A",3905," Australians listening tonight are probably aware that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is one of the most important social initiatives that this nation has undertaken. Currently there are 300,000 of our fellow Australians signed up to the scheme, and at full rollout it will cater for 460,000 of our fellow Australians who are profoundly and severely disabled. At full rollout the scheme will be allocating and responsible for $22 billion. This is an important scheme, and we should not underestimate how important it is.Like Medicare and the old age pension, its a nation-building scheme, a public service and a safety net. Yet the agency responsible for its rollout—the National Disability Insurance Agency—has no leader, has no CEO. It is literally leaderless. It has been without a leader for 167 days. The last CEO of the NDIA resigned on 30 April this year. The government is responsible for appointing a new chief executive officer, but it has failed to do so in the last 167 days. The government NDIS minister, Stuart Robert, has failed to do this for 167 days. Australians are rightly entitled to ask: is 167 days a reasonable time period to leave a multibillion dollar organisation without a leader? Is 167 days a reasonable period of time, when the peak public body for Australians with disability, not surprisingly, is acting like the proverbial headless chook?Perhaps appointing a good CEO is harder than it looks. Perhaps Minister Robert—welcome back from the Holy Land—has had other things on his plate. Perhaps there are complications which we mere mortals cannot understand. Do they say that this delay is reasonable rather than mindless government neglect? Perhaps we should compare the governments 167-day period of stage fright with other human accomplishments. In July we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission and moon landing. It was a complicated process. Interplanetary travel is quite complex. Its interesting to note that Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin blasted off on 16 July from the Kennedy Space Centre, Florida, and on 19 July Apollo 11 passed behind the moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit. On 20 July, Aldrin and Armstrong entered the lunar module. On 21 July, Armstrong was the first man to step on the moon. He planted the flag, collected the moon rocks, filmed and broadcast images from the moon, performed scientific experiments and spoke to Richard Nixon. On 24 July they splashed back down to earth. They spent three weeks in quarantine. On 13 August there were tickertape parades in New York and Chicago. Granted, many years went into the preparation, but it took the Americans from blast-off to tickertape parade 29 days. How long has it taken Stuart Robert to find a CEO for the NDIA? 167 days.But closer to home, Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and colourful entrepreneur, pledged to build a giant battery complex in South Australia and to do it within 100 days or forgo payment entirely. If only the government would do this. The worlds largest lithium-ion battery was shipped to Australia, set up, connected to the power grid, connected to a substation, connected to a wind farm, tested and made operational. Thirty thousand homes were powered in little over an hour. This feat was done in less than 100 days. How long has it taken Minister Stuart Robert to find a CEO for the National Disability Insurance Agency? 167 days and counting.In fact, it was 100 days between March and June of 1815 when the former first citizen of France Napoleon escaped from prison in Elba, assembled 600 troops, faced down and recruited a regiment by his personality alone, marched to Paris, recaptured the government, built his army to 280,000, invaded Belgium and, with half of his army, defeated the Prussians. Of course, within that time he lost the battle of Waterloo and was sent to St Helena. It did not end well for our comrade first citizen, but its a testament to how much you can do in 100 days if you put your mind to it. Then there was FDRs 1933 reconstruction: in less than 100 days there were 15 pieces of legislation passed.Perhaps it is not reasonable for those waiting for the NDIS and the 300,000 participants in the NDIS and their families to expect a new NDIA CEO to have been appointed. To pick a more familiar analogy: do you think the government would allow a ministerial vacancy to be unfilled by the ranks of ambitious backbenchers for 167 days? I think not. I dont expect this government to have the courage of Armstrong, the patriotic creativity of FDR or the passion of Napoleon, but it would be good if we could find a CEO for an $8 billion organisation in 167 days.","National Disability Insurance Agency","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SHORTEN (Maribyrnong) ","(19:30):"
268,0,0,0,1,1,"Thompson, Phillip, MP",281826,"Herbert","LNP","N/A",3906," On a recent visit to Thuringowa State High School in my electorate, I was absolutely blown away by the students incredible knowledge of, and enthusiasm for, science, technology, education and mathematics. STEM is an exciting and ever-developing field for young thriving minds. In the one short hour that I spent at the school, I have to admit that their excitement was starting to rub off on me.My visit was in the middle of my minister blitz. In the three weeks leading up to the sitting fortnight of parliament, I welcomed no fewer than six ministers and assistant ministers to the best electorate in the country, the electorate of Herbert. It was a great pleasure to welcome the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Karen Andrews, to Townsville for a visit to the Australian Institute of Marine Science and then to Thuringowa State High School. There we met three year-10 students—Brian Archer, Declan Lindsell and Luke OBrien—in the science labs. The trio had lined up crab pots for us to see. But this wasnt the average red twine and hoop set-up you find in waterways in North Queensland. This was an artificial intelligence fingerprint crab pot, an award winning one. It was among the eight finalists—out of 600 entries—in the Education Changemakers competition.This crab pot was invented by these 15-year-olds to solve two problems. The first problem is that, unfortunately, crab pots are often stolen or there is confusion about who owns them. This is because they are left alone for long periods of time to do their work—catching crabs. So the boys invented a system by which the pot would only open up if the rightful owner was in possession of it.But the second problem this crab pot solved was probably even more important. The boys told me it was crucial that only male crabs were taken because, if a lot of females are pulled out of the ecosystem, it can affect the population, making it harder for a species to reproduce. So they designed a crab pot that only lets males in. I was very impressed because, despite their relative youth, these boys saw a problem that was affecting them in their own lives, and they could see it was affecting other people in their lives, so they used their STEM knowledge to come up with a solution. While I always think its a good idea to keep your options open as young school students, it was clear to me that if they were to choose careers in the sector they would have a very bright future ahead of them.Next on our tour of Thuringowa State High School, we went to a room that could only be described as a TV studio. There were lights and cameras and plenty of action as a science teacher taught a live class over a video link to dozens of children in some of the most remote parts of Queensland and around Australia. What I was witnessing was the Global Tropics Future Young Scholars project, a joint initiative between Thuringowa State High School and James Cook University, led by Deputy Principal Wendy Bode.On the screen were five students who logged in with webcams and microphones to a virtual world where they could interact with their teacher and each other in real time. This offered them opportunities they would never be given where they lived. It was a new-age School of the Air, known as the Queensland Virtual STEM Academy. It was definitely a far cry from my own memories of school and I find myself quite jealous of the students. Im keen to return to the school and witness some more of their virtual classes. The topics they cover are fantastic and are directly relevant to living in the north. They let me know a few examples of the programs they have on offer: the Trop House Grand Challenge, the Disaster Resilience Grand Challenge and—a favourite of mine—the Mining Initiative Grand Challenge.Id like to take this opportunity to thank Thuringowa State High School for hosting us and congratulate them on their efforts in being a leader in science, technology, engineering and maths. Id also like to pay tribute to Minister Karen Andrews for the hard work that shes been doing to promote innovation in our schools. These schools are fantastic in the electorate and they really bring the community together. I was really amazed by how everyone in the room and from around Queensland all spoke so positively of STEM.","Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr THOMPSON (Herbert) ","(19:35):"

As its starting to play out in the community, again, as they should, theyre asking: whats in it for us? Free trade agreements have been used and have been created between our country and others for a few decades now. Im raising this question in this parliament at this point because, like all economic policy in this place, we have reached a point where the government no longer deliver what has been promised. If you think about interest rates, for example, there was common belief that cutting interest rates would be a great economic boost to an economy. Weve seen interest rates cut to a record low and no boost to our economy. So were at that point where we need to rethink and recalibrate our approach to that policy area. Is it time to do the same again when it comes to free trade?In the eighties and the nineties, trade liberalisation and tariff reduction did lead to growth in industries. There were also industry plans that went alongside an assistance to lessen the impact on those workers most affected by those trade agreements. However, recent trade agreements that have been negotiated since this government has come to power have not been accompanied with these plans.Im talking specifically about what happened to our automotive industry. Some could argue that when we signed the Korean, Japanese and Chinese free trade agreements, we lost our automotive industry at the same time as signing them. There were 200,000 workers displaced. A third of those have never worked again. Another third have worked in casual work or their own self-employment. Another third have found other work in manufacturing, but at nowhere near the skill or the class level they had previously. Theres been no plan or transition for these workers.We also know from the governments own modelling at the time that these deals that were put forward that they were only going to generate 5,434 additional jobs by 2035. Thats what they proposed. My questions to the government in 2019 are: Are we on track? Have those deals created the jobs that they say that they have done? Weve had a lot of rhetoric, weve had a lot of campaigning and weve had a lot of suggestion. But has it created the good, secure paying jobs? Theyre still well short of the 200,000 plus that weve lost.Im also concerned about the new trade deals that are being put forward and whether theyre actually going to deliver. The question I have for the government is: what are we actually going to get from it? This isnt just my question; this is a question that lots of people are asking. Were told that its going to deliver in agriculture. Well, is that really a priority for us right now when the country is in severe drought and were not producing the goods or the commodities that we would export under these agreements? Were told that these agreements will deliver great economic output. Well, wheres the independent modelling to prove that?What Im also concerned about is this government increasingly attaching the trade of people to free trade agreements. Back in the eighties and nineties, such agreements dealt specifically with tariffs and trade opportunities. Today, increasingly under this government, were seeing more negotiations and more trading of people. Im talking about the side deals where they allow more temporary workers into this country. The proposed Indonesian free trade deal, for example, looks to increase by about 4,000 the number of backpackers and holidaymakers each year—rising from 1,000 to 5,000—when this government has not yet fixed the system. The exploitation of backpackers is rife, and report after report talks about how they are victims of trafficking—of modern slavery—in some cases. Yet this government is proposing to bring more of them in. There are far too many questions being asked about our trade agreements, and the government has done very little. They have done very little to look at the non-tariff barriers since reaching agreements. The question needs to be asked: are free trade agreements worth it today?","Trade","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CHESTERS (Bendigo) ","(19:40):"

Although I intended to make a different contribution, I do always enjoy the opportunity to talk about free market capitalism and free markets, and the growth and prosperity they have led to in this nation and across the world.

Far from it: the opportunities that free trade has given this country in particular, and particularly since the Second World War, have been phenomenal.One point that I think is truly remarkable in our economic statistics at the moment is that we have a trade surplus in this country. Weve had a trade surplus for the last 14 months. When we first came into surplus, that was the first time since 1973. Free trade is working for our country. More importantly, its working for industries that we are very competitive in, particularly agriculture. I was shocked to hear the contribution from the previous member attacking the unlocking of markets for our agricultural sector because were currently in drought. To suggest that those industries shouldnt be given every opportunity possible, at the moment in particular, is absolutely outrageous. But its also unbelievable to see a complete breakdown in the bipartisanship that weve had for so long around supporting free trade.It wasnt that long ago, in the Hawke-Keating era, that, to be fair to Labor, they understood the importance of unlocking the protectionism of our economy, breaking down tariffs and allowing the industries that we have a very strong competitive advantage in to grow and flourish. That has led to unbelievable employment opportunities in the industries that were successful in. In my home state of South Australia, you can look at the wine industry and how that has grown over the decades since weve been able to increase our market access into so many different countries. Thats because we signed free trade agreements with those countries, and those companies have been able to go and compete without tariff barriers. When Australian businesses compete on a level playing field, it turns out that were usually the best; we usually produce the highest quality. Wine is one of many examples of that, and its because weve broken down trade barriers and given that market access to our businesses that theyve been able to grow.When youre a nation of 25 million people on a planet approaching seven billion, the biggest opportunity youre going to have for your industries is exporting. Theres a great saying from John Key, who was an excellent prime minister of New Zealand. He used to say, New Zealanders wont get wealthy selling lattes to each other. Thats the reality. When youre a nation of our size on a planet of our size, the opportunity is through export, and that opportunity comes by breaking down trade barriers and creating market access for your most successful businesses. It was terrible to see the car industry close down in this country. In my home state of South Australia, General Motors Holden were one of the businesses that made that commercial decision, and they pulled out of the plant in Elizabeth. Unless youre embracing free trade and growing other sectors, youll never be able to replace the jobs that go when a decision by a private company like that happens to be made. Whilst it was regrettable, at least we had industries like agriculture and wine: industries that are growing not because of protectionism—far from it—but because weve got a competitive advantage. When you break down those barriers, youll find that there are Australian businesses that are the best in the world at what they do. In my time in the wool industry, as we broke down barriers with nations in North Asia in particular, we saw a dramatic increase in our market access into places like Japan—because of the free trade agreements. The free trade agreements weve got with Japan, Korea, China, South-East Asia and the United States have been fundamentally excellent opportunities for Australian businesses to succeed.The member who spoke previously seems to have taken it upon herself to change Labor Party policy—to break down the bipartisanship. Thats fine by me, because Im more than happy, as a proud member of a government that is pro free trade, to keep prosecuting the benefits of free trade and to work with the businesses that benefit from it to make sure that the Labor Party never gets back into government in this country and apparently, from what weve just heard, wind back the clock and reintroduce protectionism, which is only going to cost jobs in our economy.","Trade","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[4]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr STEVENS (Sturt) ","(19:45):"
271,0,0,0,1,1,"Rishworth, Amanda, MP","HWA","Kingston","ALP","N/A",3909," Just recently I was very pleased to host an NDIS forum in my electorate of Kingston, along with the shadow federal minister and the shadow state minister. At this forum, we allowed community members to express the concerns they have with the operation of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We had over 100 participants, families, carers and advocates attend, to bravely share their concerns and experience—indeed, we had a waitlist, as the venue was not big enough to hold everyone.The NDIS came with such promise to those living with a disability, their families and carers, and it has been extremely difficult to watch this Liberal governments mismanagement of a scheme that was designed to improve the lives of people with a disability and their families. I have heard so many heartbreaking stories of people with a disability and their families being let down by the system. Ive had almost 550 people contact me about the NDIS in the last few years alone. Many of these people have been families with children with a disability or delay. They tell me that their kids are being left behind. Families are telling me that their children are unable to access adequate supports or the early intervention crucial to their development.Hayley and Chris from Aberfoyle Park have a son with a learning disability who is in the bottom two per cent of his class. They say that, even though he has a severe learning disability, theyve been told that it is not severe enough for him to receive support through the NDIS. Others are telling me that, when their children do receive support, their plans are inconsistent with their needs and, at times, the supports and therapies simply arent available.Sonia from Huntfield Heights has a 10-year-old son with level 3 autism. She says his plan included allocated funds where they were not needed. She said theyd been waiting 12 months to see a psychologist, leaving her son without proper access to the therapy he needs—because its psychological intervention that he actually needs. She said: As a single parent with a son who has major episodes which are hard to control, we need more services to fulfil the plan. I live in poverty, and my son is bullied at school. We need more support. We are missing crucial opportunities to improve the lives of children with these needs.Michelle from Hallett Cove has a three-year-old son with a global developmental delay. She is currently waiting to have a planning meeting to get him support and feels completely unsupported herself. She said: Ive never been given any information such as worksheets to help me navigate the process I need to go through. I feel totally unsupported. Im just trying to get my child the early intervention help so that he doesnt fall further behind.Sadly, the distress Michelle is experiencing with the long delays is not unique. This is devastating for families who watch their childs potential slip away between their fingers. Many parents waiting for access to early intervention express their anguish that their child has to wait for support. They miss important opportunities and milestones for therapies and support to have success in improving their conditions.My first contact with Kate from Sheidow Park was in early 2018, when she contacted my office out of desperation after waiting months and months for her son to get his first planning meeting under early intervention. The system is broken when a family with a toddler with a developmental delay has to come to their federal member of parliament to get access to the supports that he so desperately needs. Parents are telling me that they have to fight for their children to access services, even those which have been deemed necessary by medical professionals.For Kate, the story doesnt end there. Her son is now four, and he is non-verbal. Kate says the familys general practitioner said he needed a particular therapy. Despite this recommendation from the doctor, Kate says the decision on whether he can access the therapy through the NDIS sat with someone who did not have any relevant qualifications. This is at the same time we are hearing that the Morrison governments 2018-19 budget is banking $4.6 billion of underspend in the NDIS, with the argument being that need is being met. Well, I can tell you, from my experience and from listening to those in our community, that need is not being met. Families are being denied the supports they need. They are having to wait longer and longer and just cannot understand how to navigate this system. It is time the government fixes this system. The NDIS has the promise to support people with disability, and its time the government fulfilled this promise to families.","Kingston Electorate: National Disability Insurance Scheme","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) ","(19:50):"
272,0,0,0,1,1,"Simmonds, Julian, MP",282983,"Ryan","LNP","N/A",3911," I rise to speak in the House tonight about important health initiatives for families in the Ryan electorate. The first is water safety and the second is being sun smart.Summer is just around the corner, and no doubt many local families will be spending time in the pool, at the beach or putting the boat into the Brisbane River. With all the fun of summer, its important to take a moment to ensure the safety of our kids. I spoke a lot about families during my maiden speech, and making sure that our families are protected and looked after is deeply important to me. As a dad to a young son, it is something I am very conscious of. I take my son to swimming lessons every week, or as much as I can manage, at the same school where I learnt to swim as a boy, the John Carew Swim School in Chapel Hill. Teaching kids to switch is a very simple and important way that parents can prevent their kids from drowning. Even at a young age, simple skills of turning around and grabbing the wall behind them can be practised so that, if the worst happens and a child falls into a pool, they will have the habit of what to do already instilled in them.Tragically, 965 children aged from zero to four years drowned in Australia between 1 July 1993 and 30 June 2018. Accidental falls into water were recorded as the leading activity resulting in drowning, and swimming pools are the leading location where this happens to our kids. The Ryan electorate has many wonderful swim schools, so there is no excuse for Ryan parents. As well as teaching children to swim, the other important thing that parents can do this summer is to actively supervise their kids. Heartbreakingly, it only takes a moment of inattention for the very worst scenario to happen. In an age where we are constantly bombarded by distractions—by our phone, by social media and by friends and family—it is so important to make sure that we are always attentive if our kids are near bodies of water.The government is committed to helping more Australians learn to swim and enjoy the water as part of a fit and healthy lifestyle. Working in partnership with Swimming Australia, the Community Swimming Grants Program allows organisations the opportunity to apply for grants of up to $10,000 and has been delivered as part of the Morrison governments $28.9 million Move It AUS—Participation Grants Program. These grants have a particular focus on improving opportunities for people with disabilities and from diverse backgrounds.Just as important this summer is to be sun smart. Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world. More than 2,200 Australians a year die from this almost entirely preventable disease. Approximately two in three Australians will be diagnosed with skin cancer by the time they are 70. Childhood and adolescence are critical periods where UV radiation is more likely to cause skin cancer than later in life. Its estimated that 50 per cent of our total UV exposure occurs before even the age of 20. Therefore, sunscreen education and staying smart as a kid is so vital, and thats where kids and parents have an important role to play.It was a great pleasure to meet with a local resident, Benita, last Friday to talk about how she and I can combine in a new local campaign to encourage schools and students to be more dedicated to applying sunscreen during the school day. We know that sunscreen is meant to be applied every four hours to be most effective. So, even if parents are applying it to kids before they leave for school, its incumbent upon the schools and those kids to make sure theyre reapplying before they go out to play in the midday sun. Benita, who is a nurse, has seen what happens when people arent sun safe, and shes had to deal with those effects and the effects that they have on families and friends around them. I congratulate her for her dedication to the health of our local children and for putting forward the idea that we can put together a campaign to make sure that schools are more proactive in helping kids to be sun smart and apply sunscreen regularly. I look forward to working with her on that.I encourage all Ryan residents, including parents, to make sure that during the summer, while theyre having a lot of fun, be it in the water or out in the sun, theyre making sure their kids are safe, that they are looked after, that theyre supervised and that theyre being sun smart.House adjourned at 20:00","Ryan Electorate: Safety","ADJOURNMENT","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[19]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SIMMONDS (Ryan) ","(19:55):"

These people come from all walks of life; theyre different in background and have different ways to achieve the same outcome—a better community for all. These people are our volunteers.At the event I hosted on Thursday 3 October, 42 award winners were recognised for their outstanding contributions to our community in Werriwa. These winners are all tremendous people. Take George Najarian, for example. George came to Australia just two years ago. In that short space of time George has volunteered with eight different community groups, focusing on refugee advocacy, inclusion and engagement. He does this on top of looking after his family of two younger sisters, a younger brother and his mother.Another winner is the team from the Autism Advisory and Support Service 24-hour hotline volunteer team. The hotline is run by a dedicated team of volunteers who are parents of children with autism. Its the only one of its kind in the world. The team takes an average of 250 calls per month from parents, carers, service providers, first responders and individuals with autism spectrum disorder.I also recognise the Austral Bowling Club, and particularly Beverley Croucher. Beverleys been a member of the club for 20 years, and a board member for the past 16. Her leadership and support for the club has been endless—organising bingo and raffles, booking entertainment—to ensure the sustainability of the club and the enjoyment of its members.I congratulate all 42 winners of these awards, and I congratulate and support all the volunteers in Werriwa whose tireless and unpaid work makes our community ties even stronger. Australia is a country known for its selflessness and an extensive culture of volunteerism. That is shown nowhere stronger than in Werriwa, as these awards can attest.

Of course, one of the sad consequences of the service given by those in our ADF is the trauma they can experience after their service. Indeed, many military veterans experience PTSD. This federal government has committed more than $230 million a year to help military veterans deal with issues of mental health.Last Friday, I was delighted to join with Patricia McAlister of Smart Pups, together with Mr Ian Hall, who is the president of the Sunshine Coast & Regional District RSL, to mark the beginning of a new program where military veterans who are experiencing PTSD and other traumas can have an assistance dog. These arent your usual pets or best mates; these are psychiatric assistant dogs. These are dogs that are trained to assist our military veterans in ways that other human beings simply cannot, because we, as humans, lack the innate ability that dogs have.I will give you a couple of examples. Where a military veteran might be amidst a nightmare, an assistance dog has the ability to nudge and wake the veteran up from that nightmare. An assistance dog can sense when a veteran is distressed and it can get between the veteran and that which is distressing him or her. These arent just your usually trained dogs. This is where this new program has, after a tender process, chosen two organisations—one of them based on the Sunshine Coast, Smart Pups—to lead the way. Smart Pups was founded by Patricia McAlister nine years ago. They have been training these beautiful assistance dogs, mainly for children with disabilities. Now they extend their services to help veterans. As this program rolls out, research will be done with La Trobe University so the program can scale and assist more and more veterans. As we heard from Mr Hall from the RSL last Friday—who himself has experienced PTSD—these are more than just your best friend; they are an extension of your clinical service. Im delighted for the program.","Veterans","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[2]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TED OBRIEN (Fairfax) ","(10:32):"
277,0,0,0,1,2,"Snowdon, Warren, MP","IJ4","Lingiari","ALP","N/A",3918," Today I have the honour of congratulating and acknowledging two Northern Territory police officers who jointly received the National Bravery Award from the Police Federation of Australia at a ceremony in Canberra last month, during our last sittings. The joint award was presented to negotiators, Senior Constable Mark Turner and Senior Constable Linda Farrand. The National Bravery Awards seek to recognise exceptional acts and exceptional circumstances undertaken by Australian police. An award for police by police, the awards also recognise those officers who have demonstrated bravery of the very highest order in the performance of their duty.As negotiators, Senior Constable Mark Turner and Senior Constable Linda Farrand were called upon to respond, in a very difficult set of circumstances, to a report of a man threatening self-harm on the Darwin Esplanade earlier this year. They located the distressed man and negotiated with him for seven hours—seven hours. After using extensive negotiating techniques, the man was coaxed up two metres from the edge of the cliff. These police were comforting the man when suddenly he turned towards the edge of cliff. Senior Constable Turner then grabbed him before he could jump over the edge. Together, Senior Constable Turner and Senior Constable Farrand restrained the man and escorted him to a safe distance from the ledge. These two constables showed exceptional bravery in an extremely perilous set of circumstances.These NT police officers embodied not just the highest values you can aspire to as police officers, but the highest values any of us can aspire to as human beings. I know these officers; I know they do not work for awards. Nonetheless, I think it is extremely important that we, as a parliament, recognise and congratulate them for winning this prestigious national award and, while doing so, also acknowledge the role of all police officers across this country in keeping us all safe. These are very important acknowledgements, and we need to make sure that they are recorded in our parliament.","Turner, Senior Constable Mark, Farrand, Senior Constable Linda","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[3]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SNOWDON (Lingiari) ","(10:35):"

Among them are the good folk at Vincent Industries. A few words sum up these people. Dedicated, reliable, respectful, welcoming, innovative and problem solving are just a few words that describe these particular workers in my region. Recently I spent time with the good folk at Vincent Industries in Wynyard and let me tell you, every one of those words describes the team there. As a business, Vincent Industries ticks some really important boxes—things that Im incredibly passionate about. The organisation provides work and training opportunities for those with a disability on the north-west coast of Tasmania. And I think they have got it right. Every workplace in Australia should take a leaf out of their book.The good people of Vincent Industries focus on ability rather than disability, on maximising the potential of every one of their employees, and they do so in a supportive, harmonious and inclusive way. And, from what I saw the other day, they throw a bit of fun in as well. The business is doing great work in the area of recycling. How we manage our clothing waste is an ongoing issue. These guys play an important part in our environment by recycling second-hand clothing, footwear and handbags and exporting them to India and Malaysia for reuse. The clothes not suitable for export are turned into rags and cleaning cloths—and I, for one, couldnt do without those cleaning cloths on my farm in Tasmania.Congratulations to Nellie McKenna, the general manager, for the tireless positive contribution that you make each and every day to your team at Vincent Industries, and to everyone else I met. To Gloria Connelly: congratulations on your 40 years of service to the business. You care and do an amazing job looking after the other workers, and I know that they love you for that. To Natalie Williams: congratulations on being a finalist in the trade training awards. To Gavin Sutton: thanks for showing me around your particular worksite and reminding me how great a singer Charley Pride is.

Just over three million Australians are living in poverty, including one in six Australian children. The highest rates of poverty are unsurprisingly among people trying to get by on Newstart allowance. Its unsurprising, because the rate of Newstart allowance leaves someone well short of the poverty line. How do we expect people to pay rent and survive on around $280 per week with costs as they are at the moment?Living in poverty means much more than simply falling below a certain level on the income distribution. As someone I met at the Early Morning Centre here in Canberra once put it to me, poverty is having to choose between food for your baby and tampons. Poverty is missing out on the things most in our wealthy society take for granted. Poverty is being excluded from things because you simply cant afford them. And there is a lot we can do to address poverty in this country. The most powerful thing the government could do is to increase Newstart allowance, and I call on them again today to do so with urgency.My electorate of Canberra is a wealthy community and, therefore, a particularly difficult place to be poor. Almost 7,000 Canberrans are trying to get by on Newstart or youth allowance. That includes an estimated 1,000 families with 1,600 children, and the majority of these are sole-parent families. Homelessness is on the rise. We need to do so much better for these families, for our nations children. A poll commissioned by Anglicare shows that around 80 per cent of Australians believe the government has a responsibility to ensure that everyone can afford to put a roof over their head and food on their table, and I call on them to do just that—to ensure that all Australians truly get a go.In Canberra, we have incredible community organisations that assist Canberrans living in poverty: the Early Morning Centre, St Vinnies Night Patrol, St Johns Care in Reid, Community Services #1 in Narrabundah, OzHarvest, the Holy Cross Tuckerbox in Hackett, the YWCA, Havelock Housing, all the crisis accommodation services, and many others I havent named. I thank you for all you do for our community. These organisations and their volunteers do amazing work and make a huge difference in peoples lives. But ultimately its not their responsibility and they cant do it on their own. We simply cannot address poverty in this country while Newstart is so woefully inadequate. I call on the government to recognise and address poverty in this country, and raising Newstart is the first step.","Poverty","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[5]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms PAYNE (Canberra) ","(10:41):"

Increasingly now, whether Im at a regional show, a listening stand or other places, people come to me and complain that its no longer their ABC.So last week it came as no surprise to me when I heard Gaven Morris, who is the director of news analysis and investigations at the ABC, concede effectively that the ABC has lost touch. Id go further and suggest that the public broadcaster no longer has a clue about what Australians think. Indeed, theyve commissioned a survey to do just that, to find out what Australians think—think of that: our national broadcaster employing tens of thousands of Australians across the country, an organisation that should be so connected with the Australian people that others should be going to the broadcaster to ask what Australians think. No. We now have an Australian broadcaster that needs to out-service that and undertake a survey, the Australia Talks National Survey of 55,000 people with 500 questions, as they concede, to find out what Australians think. Theyve partnered with the Canadian operation Vox Pop Labs, which, of course, is responsible for the Vote Compass that we see at election times, and which, I note in passing, was hopelessly wrong in predicting the outcome of the May 2019 election.How can it be that we now have a national broadcaster thats so out of touch with the Australian people? I will tell you why it is—and maybe theyll get this from their survey, albeit that their survey is a survey of Australians who consume the ABC, which I suggest to you will be biased because a number of conservative-leaning Australians, large swathes of them, sadly, have turned off the ABC. The answer is because they have a lack of political diversity in terms of their commentary. Thats what they need to hear. This survey shouldnt be about Australia talking. This survey should be about the ABC listening, because, quite frankly, they have stopped doing that. They stopped doing that a long time ago. If they were listening, then the people they employ—the editors, the producers and the presenters—would be much more representative of the political views of all Australians, and wed be better served if that were the case.","Australian Broadcasting Corporation","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[6]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PASIN (Barker) ","(10:44):"
281,0,0,0,1,2,"Shorten, Bill, MP","00ATG","Maribyrnong","ALP","N/A",3921," I think the best way to see how the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme is going is to move beyond the government press releases and instead get out and talk to participants and people working within the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Thats what I have been doing. Ive visited six states and territories, and held 20 disability forums and events. Ive met people for whom the scheme was a success, but Ive met many who are doing it very tough—theyre stressed out, unable to get wheelchairs and basic equipment. The severely disabled arent able to get occupational therapists or physiotherapists. There are mums and dads trying to do the best for their children, but theyre stressed out and at the end of their tethers.This is a good scheme, the NDIS, but it needs rescuing. At the moment, the people its designed to help are being crushed by red tape and bureaucracy. At Hallett Cove in the seat of Kingston, with the member Amanda Rishworth, I met little five-year-old Ava. Shes in a wheelchair and she has profound disabilities. Her mum, Jessica, told me that since moving to Adelaide two years ago the NDIS had provided no new equipment, despite repeated requests. Jessica said that her daughter is in pain every day and she cant spend more than an hour in her chair. Jessica said: The paperwork for a chair took me more than a year because we couldnt find a qualified therapist. And, when we did, they just kept sending the request back. All specifications need to be justified, and some were rejected, such as having wheels that could be used on grass, because her mum thinks that kids should be allowed to go on grass. After two years they were still waiting. After our visit and a story in Adelaides TheAdvertiser, the NDIA immediately contacted Jessica to approve her funding, and have set up a meeting to organise a new wheelchair and install the home equipment she needs.The same story was heard in Corangamite—where Libby Coker rescued the seat from the Liberals—in the shadow of the NDIA headquarters, where the headless agency has been without a CEO for more than 160 days. We were in a small room at the Grovedale community centre. It was full to bursting with people who, in the NDISs home town, cannot get the scheme to work for them. Amongst others, I met 60-plus-years-old Colin Watson—vision impaired and, since October 2014, on an NDIS plan. But for 11 weeks hes had no money coming in: When we attempted to drop off a claim on 26 July, we were informed we were now required to produce all receipts with our claim. With the help of his wife, Mary, he did that and resubmitted—still nothing. His wife visited the NDIA in Geelong and was told processing could take more than a fortnight. Mr Watson then rang the NDIA, and they could find no trace of his claim. A week later he rang again and was told it would be seven weeks. After our forum and Mr Watsons story appearing in the Geelong Advertiser, the NDIA miraculously fixed the issue. As reported in the Addy, the NDIA spokesman acknowledged Mr Watson not being correctly paid.There are success stories, such as that of the great David Carey, who is in a wheelchair due to a stroke. NDIS has got him out of a nursing home. We need more results like Davids.

Veterans Health Week is held each year to promote good health and wellbeing in the veteran and ex-service community. It is an opportunity to acknowledge and signal our appreciation for all current and past service personnel and to recognise that the burdens of their duty are not only borne by our service personnel during their years of active service but continue to be carried by them for many years afterwards.The theme of Veterans Health Week this year is mental wellness. Veterans Health Week is an important opportunity for the veteran community to connect and further their understanding of the support that is available through the Department of Veterans Affairs. The government is committed to improving the care provided to veterans and their families, investing more than $200 million a year towards supporting the mental health and wellbeing of our veterans.In my electorate of Wentworth, the charity Kids Giving Back is doing its part to support the mental wellness of veterans. Kids Giving Back offers programs for children aged six to 18 years old to undertake practical and meaningful activities and to embrace the concept of volunteering and giving back. Kids Giving Back was recently awarded a $5,000 grant, as part of the Veteran and Community Grants program, to host the intergenerational high-tea events, bringing together young people with the elderly and recognising that such interactions are beneficial for both age groups. Programs like these help to reduce social isolation amongst veterans and their families and encourage them to remain independent, healthy and active. I commend the work of CEO Ms Robyn Monro Miller in this area.The Department of Veterans Affairs also provides funding for current and ex-serving ADF personnel to access free and confidential counselling and group treatment programs, as well as resources to help deal with depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicide, behavioural issues and addiction.In my electorate we have four RSL club sub-branches—located in North Bondi, Bondi Junction, Rose Bay and Paddington. I recently attended Rose Bay RSL sub-branchs 100th anniversary, where we listened to a 94-year-old veteran of the Papua New Guinea and Borneo World War II campaigns deliver the ode. I would like to acknowledge the sub-branch presidents—Robert de Graaf, Bill Harrigan, Lee Stockley and Terry Farley—for their strong leadership and for doing a great job in fostering a strong sense of community for our veterans.I will be holding a morning tea in my office and inviting our local RSL sub-branches, veterans and their families to join me during Veterans Health Week. I encourage everyone to get involved in their local Veterans Health Week event and rally behind our veterans, who have served our country so well. Additionally I wish to thank all current and ex-serving ADF personnel for their service and sacrifice.","Veterans Health Week","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[8]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SHARMA (Wentworth) ","(10:50):"

As I say so many times every sitting week, this is an area that has the some of the most dramatic and sustained growth in the country, and we need infrastructure now. In fact, weve needed it for six years. You can imagine my surprise when I picked up the newspaper on Friday to see that the Treasurer is urging the states to come up with an infrastructure wish list. Well, Treasurer, you only need to read Hansard to know how important infrastructure is in my electorate. Ive got some shovel-ready things for you to get to work on straightaway. I have suggestions from my community, which represents one of the most dramatic growth areas in the country. Before this election, the Labor opposition committed to co-funding 400 car parks at Tarneit station with the state government. Theres a shovel-ready thing that could get going straight away, Treasurer. Perhaps youd like to speak to your minister for infrastructure, because Im sure hes across these details.Labor also committed to $50 million to co-fund the Wyndham West Link, which links the suburb of Wyndham Vale to the M1 and Tarneit. Step 1 in this project is the Ison Road overpass. Heres a congestion-busting project that you could get on with straight away. You could bring down that infrastructure spending that we need so much for our economy by getting started in the electorate of Lalor.A further project that has absolute merit is the establishment of the Sayers Road railway station on the Regional Rail Link. Everyone in my electorate knows that the Regional Rail Link, funded by the former Gillard government, opened in 2015 and within weeks the Tarneit station became the second-busiest passenger V/Line station in Victoria. Our suburbs are bursting at the seams, and the growth is not slowing down. The second station for Tarneit is an absolute must. Its ready to go now, Treasurer. You could today decide to pick up the phone and talk to state government about the projects that we here have been telling you about now for six years.My community deserves this. My community, who come to live in the outer western suburbs of Melbourne, hope in their hearts and determined to work hard, deserve to be supported to get to work, to get home to their families and to get across our city to get their kids to sport. They deserve the best from this government. This government has been ignoring us for too long. The Treasurer has an opportunity here. I would suggest to the Treasurer that he take up these projects, getting them off the ground and running. The people of Wyndham and of Lalor will say thank you if this government turns it around and starts to listen.","Lalor Electorate: Infrastructure","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[9]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms RYAN (Lalor—Opposition Whip) ","(10:53):"

In recent decades, shows have been under siege somewhat, but I am seeing a regeneration at the moment. There are new committees, younger committees and new people coming in with new ideas, and theyre adapting shows to be more relevant to the 21st century. I think were seeing the crowds come back.On the weekend, I attended Cummins Show, a show that a few years ago looked as though it may be on its last legs. The crowds were good and the new marquees fabulous, and it gave me great pleasure to open the renovations on the Cummins Show pavilion, with $38½ thousand coming from the BBRF. They are very pleased with the result, and I am sure that facility will get used for other things throughout the year.Ive also attended the Jamestown Show—a show that is going so well it has had to go from one day of operation to two days. There, of course, the federal government has also invested in a new shearing facility—one that will be used year round to train shearers. There were big crowds at the Jamestown Show.I attended the Wudinna show, where in fact they have a new permanent marquee courtesy of the Drought Communities Program.But right across the region we are seeing this rejuvenation, which is very encouraging. I had a friend say to me not that long ago: Shows are dead. Why would you put money into it? I said: Youre wrong, and the reason you dont understand is that its too long since youve been to one. If you get to the show and see whats going on, you will see this new energy. Thats why the federal government has put $20 million on the line for show infrastructure. That grant line is open at the moment. It closes in November. Im really encouraging my show societies—my AH&F—societies to look around their ground, see what it is they really need and get some bids in. I suspect there will be a lot of demand on the money, but good projects will find a way to get funded. Of course, if they dont get funds through the shows programs, they are, of course, good things to put up for the BBRF programs or even the community support programs.So all of those things are seeing the federal government re-investing in the regions at a time when a lot of Australia is under drought stress. I understand that. And so, once again, shows play that important part. They bring people together to talk about the season and talk about the good things that are going on in their lives like the improvement in the genetics in the sheep flock across Australia. All those things are good, positive things. It makes me proud to be part of those communities. Im really pleased to attend those shows. I wont get to 19, but Ill do my best.","Grey Electorate: Agricultural Shows","CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[1]/subdebate.1[10]/speech/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RAMSEY (Grey—Government Whip) ","(10:56):"

Every year around 150,000 women in this country experience some form of pregnancy, miscarriage, stillbirth, infant or neonatal loss. Each one of those 150,000 losses represents to families what might have been. The number of little lives lost each year tells the stories of families affected. It is estimated that one in four pregnancies result in miscarriage. In 2016, 2,849 lives were lost to stillbirth or within the first four weeks of life.The issue is even more prolific amongst First Australians. Theyre almost twice as likely to experience the loss of a baby due to stillbirth or neonatal death than the Australian population at large, and that rate has not moved in the last two decades. Furthermore, culturally and linguistically diverse Australians also experience stillbirth and neonatal loss at a higher rate than the general population. In 2013-14 nearly 35 per cent of stillbirths that occurred in Australia were to women who were born in countries other than Australia.While the loss of someone creates the same intense grief, the loss of a baby does not leave the shared memories that are often found when someone older dies. Every single day after the loss of a baby, families, mums, dads, grandparents, siblings and friends grieve for the loss of what could have been—the memories that were so eagerly and excitedly anticipated—their first words, their first steps, their first day at school, hugs for birthdays and holidays, their first jobs, graduations and their promising futures.Every single day for the rest of a parents life they are aware of the promise of what could have been. Thats why groups such as Red Nose, Sands, and Miracle Babies, which was founded in 2005 by Melinda Cruz at Liverpool Hospitals Newborn Intensive Care Unit, are so crucially important to support families grieving the loss of their babies. These groups help and support mothers and fathers negotiate not just the first few weeks and months after the loss but through subsequent pregnancies, which are difficult and bring back so many negative memories. Those memories can vastly affect what should have been the most exciting time in a parents life. Stress, anxiety and constant worry never leave a family that has experienced the loss of a pregnancy.We know that having a conversation around regular infant movement dramatically reduces the risk of stillbirth. We know that taking womens anxieties during pregnancy seriously has a positive effect on live births. We know that naming stillbirths as a risk to women between 18 and 24 weeks dramatically increases awareness, vigilance and ultimately prevention.Tomorrow many families will remember, celebrate and grieve together in their own way what could have been. Many of those lost babies have names that, apart from the pregnancy, are the only memories these families have.I recognise the workers of the amazing organisations who help families through the different emotional responses and the doctors, nurses and social workers at hospitals who also assist. Your dedication and the stability and comfort that you provide to families are indeed nothing short of a miracle. You provide the critical support that families need at the most trying times of their life. Your work spans not just pregnancy loss but the extremely difficult times when families find themselves in foreign environments such as neonatal intensive care units. All of these situations are overwhelming for families, and you are there to provide the comfort, support and information to help them get through. Thank you for your work and dedication.To the mothers, fathers and families who grieve every day: tomorrow on this very special day I grieve with you. Tomorrow is a day shared to remember in your own way what could have been. Your pain, your grief and your loss is known, and you are not alone. My family will also remember Michael and Meaghan.","Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STANLEY (Werriwa—Opposition Whip) ","(10:59):"

292,0,0,0,1,2,"Webster, Elizabeth, MP",281688,"Mallee","Nats","N/A",3926," I rise today in support of this motion before the chamber on International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day, when bereaved parents, families, friends and healthcare workers pause to remember the babies that have been lost through miscarriage, stillbirth and infant death.Infant loss is something that is all too common in our country and around the world, and the pain that this causes is felt by thousands every day. Sadly, three in every 1,000 babies born each year in Australia die before they reach 12 months of age. In addition to this, six babies are stillborn every day and one in four pregnancies ends in a miscarriage.The Australian government recognises the devastation that pregnancy and infant loss has on families. I also have a personal interest in rising to support this motion today, due to my personal experience in pregnancy loss. My husband and I experienced a miscarriage after five years of infertility. The pain and heartbreak I felt was immense. I want to make sure that we as a nation provide the level of support and assistance that families need at this difficult time.The issue of pregnancy and infant loss is one that my government is taking seriously. We want to see fewer families experience pregnancy and infant loss in the future. But when they do, we want to provide support to those families who experience this pain. That is why this government is investing $52.4 million in perinatal services and support, with the aim of ensuring that families are supported effectively and appropriately. This funding has different parts, and is aimed at providing support across a range of areas. It includes $43.9 million for a new perinatal mental health program which will help support the mental health of expectant and new parents in Australia and will provide support for families experiencing grief following stillbirth, miscarriage or infant death.This investment is because we have heard from families that current support is not adequate. We also know that good mental health support is important to those who are experiencing this, not just for parents but also for other members of the family. We must never forget that the loss of a child, whether born or not, is one of the most traumatic times in a persons life; we need to provide as much support for the families as we possibly can.While Australia is among the safest countries in the world to give birth in, there are still six babies that are stillborn every day. Stillbirth affects over 2,000 Australian families each year. That is why, as announced in December 2018, a further $7.2 million has been invested to support those families who experience stillbirth. Funding for support and education in this space is essential. Data shows that for every 137 women who reach 20 weeks pregnancy, one will experience the devastation of a stillbirth. Stillbirth is one of the most devastating events that any family could experience. The rate of stillbirth, according to the Centre of Research Excellence in Stillbirth, is 30 times higher than that of sudden infant death syndrome. We often hear that stillbirth is shrouded in mystery and silence, and we know that it receives far less public attention than other infant and childhood deaths. The number of stillbirths is still too high, and we in this House are committed to raising the profile of and eliminating the stigma around stillbirth.As a response to the fact that despite medical advances in care of pregnant women and unborn babies the rate of stillbirth in Australia has not fallen over the last 20 years, the government is investing $3 million for stillbirth education and awareness programs to ensure that mothers, fathers and healthcare professionals are all educated about the risks that lead to stillbirth. A further $1.2 million is for the University of Melbourne, for a research project to minimise preventable stillbirth through the use of biomarkers and ultrasound in late pregnancy. Three million dollars has been allocated through the Medical Research Future Fund to enable the Safer Baby Bundle project, a vital project to be extended to all states and territories. And there is $1.3 million for Sands Australia to deliver an intensive support service for families following miscarriage and stillbirth.I commend this motion to the chamber, and thank the member for Werriwa for bringing this important issue to the attention of parliament.","Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr WEBSTER (Mallee) ","(11:04):"
293,0,0,0,1,2,"Wells, Anika, MP",264121,"Lilley","ALP","N/A",3927," Tomorrow, 15 October, marks International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day. Tomorrow six Australian babies will be stillborn, as six will be today, as six have been, day after day, for the past 20 years, and probably well beyond that. Tomorrow six Australian families will have their worlds changed unspeakably, as six will be today, and as six have been, day after day, for the past 20 years. Whichever way you put it, this number—one baby every four hours; six babies a day; 2,200 babies a year—has stayed unchanged since records began around 20 years ago. That is some 44,000 Australian babies lost. That is some 44,000 Australian families suffering unspeakable grief. And that is the problem: in this country their grief is truly unspeakable.As Senator Keneally has explained, collectively as a country we have considered stillbirth too sad a problem to talk about. We have viewed stillbirth as a private tragedy rather than a public health problem. However, Im sure we can all agree that it is more sad and more tragic if we continue on as we have been, unchanged, in denying the 2,200 Australian babies lost every year the awareness that that they and their families deserve and the hope that things will get better.In light of International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day, I thank the member for Werriwa for her dedication to this cause and for moving this motion in the House today, and I ask that we have courage to break this silence and make stillbirth a national health priority, to follow on from the Senate inquiry into the stillbirth research and education and to act with haste on the recommendations it suggests. These recommendations are relatively simple and inexpensive. They are things such as small changes in clinical care and in the education required that would reduce the stillbirth rate by approximately 30 per cent alone, some of which were mentioned by the previous speaker, the member for Mallee.What is particularly tragic—and I acknowledge this was just raised by the good member for Mallee—is that this average birthrate is skewed. It is skewed against rural communities and it is skewed against First Nations communities, like so many other health statistics in our country. The further away a woman is from a city, the more likely she is to have a stillbirth. For First Nations mothers, the stillbirth rate is double the national average. These inequalities do not just extend to perinatal health and do not have a quick fix, but they are worthy of our time, our efforts and our priority all the same.Miscarriages are another tragedy that Australian women are at risk of during pregnancy but, unlike stillbirths, they are, to a greater extent, unavoidable. They are also much more common, affecting one in four Australian women. Yet, like stillbirths, the taboo surrounding miscarriages forces parents into silent suffering and without enough access to the support services that they need. As their elected representatives we must end the silence on lost pregnancies and infant loss in this country and provide the policy direction, the research funding and the support needed to reduce these rates for all of our families once and for all.Our communities lead the way in this vital work. In my electorate of Lilley we have the Peach Tree Perinatal Wellness centre, led by the inspiring Susannah Holmes and her dedicated and vivacious gang of women. They work day in, day out to support and educate expecting and new parents. In Brisbane we are also lucky enough to host the Australian Centre of Research Excellence in Stillbirth—the CRE—led by Vicki and her wonderful, dedicated, clever team who have done so much, and who I look forward to seeing tomorrow for the launch of the Safer Baby Bundle. With their assistance and their dedicated work, we have it in our power to reduce the terrible rates of lost pregnancies in this country, especially those that are stillbirths.We must make haste in doing so because for every day that passes there are another six babies lives lost that could have been saved. Australian parents who live with lost pregnancies and stillborn babies show some of the greatest resilience in our communities, and this parliament should honour them by doing the same and by making the reduction of stillbirths a public health priority. For the families who live with this loss every day I reiterate my commitment to doing as much as I can and pledging my support, and tomorrow I will grieve and remember with you all.","Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms WELLS (Lilley) ","(11:09):"
294,0,0,0,1,2,"Archer, Bridget, MP",282237,"Bass","LP","N/A",3928," This is not an easy topic to talk about. Tomorrow, 15 October, is International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day. This day provides an opportunity for everyone affected by infant loss—the families, healthcare workers and friends—to commemorate their shared loss. Today, I particularly acknowledge my friend Isabella Brown and her family for the recent loss of their beautiful Lenny Lawrence. As mentioned by the member for Werriwa, around 150,000 women in Australia experience some form of pregnancy or infant loss each year, which is an astounding number and doesnt include all of those who would feel this profound loss, including fathers, aunts, uncles, grandparents and siblings, to name a few.I think all of us here would remember the public education campaign Back to Sleep by Red Nose Australia, designed to drive awareness of sudden infant death syndrome in the 1980s and 1990s. The tireless work of the organisations founders was one of Australias most successful public health campaigns and resulted in an incredible 85 per cent reduction in SIDS and saved the lives of over 10,000 babies.Sadly, there is still a growing club that no parent ever wants to belong to, a club of heartbroken, devastated parents who have suffered from pregnancy and infant loss. In Australia alone, more than 2,000 babies are stillborn each year, with the cause unknown in approximately 40 per cent of these cases. Thats six much-wanted babies every day, as we heard from the previous speaker. Thats more than double the national road toll. Incredibly, this number hasnt changed in 20 years, but there has been a shift in focusing on this issue, both at a federal government level and by organisations including Red Nose and SANDS Australia.On 27 March 2018, the Senate established the Select Committee on Stillbirth Research and Education to inquire and report on the future of stillbirth research and education in Australia. The committee tabled its report on 4 December 2018. As a result of the report, the federal Minister for Health, the Hon. Greg Hunt, convened a national round table to address the rate of stillbirth in Australia and pledged a commitment of $7.2 million for medical research and education programs, which includes the development of a national action and implementation plan in collaboration with clinicians, researchers and advocacy groups. As weve heard, $3 million of this funding will go towards addressing awareness and programs for women and medical practitioners across Australia. Another $3 million will fund stillbirth research through the Medical Research Future Fund, with research priorities to be guided by the national round table, and $1.2 million is being granted to the University of Melbourne for research to minimise preventable stillbirth through the use of biomarkers and ultrasound in late pregnancy.In addition, the Morrison government has committed $43.9 million for a new perinatal mental health program, which will help to support the mental health of expectant and new parents in Australia and provide support for families experiencing grief following stillbirth, miscarriage or infant death, and $1.3 million for SANDS Australia to deliver an intensive support service for families following miscarriage and stillbirth.We can often get caught up in the facts and figures, but we need to remind ourselves that there are real mums and dads behind the statistics who leave the hospital empty-handed. Its these bereaved parents, who are left bewildered, devastated and often without answers, that drives the governments response. We want to ensure that these numbers become obsolete and that no parent has to suffer the loss of their beautiful baby.Finally, Id like to acknowledge a number of wonderful organisations that provide assistance and guidance during a time of infant loss, including SANDS Australia, who offer an incredible volunteer peer-to-peer support service for bereaved parents face-to-face and over the phone, including dads, who are often overlooked when we talk about stillbirth; Heartfelt, a volunteer organisation of photographers who capture beautiful images of parents with their stillborn babies and give families a chance to create some cherished memories; Bears of Hope, who provide cuddle cots, a cooling system that lies beneath the baby, to allow families to extend the brief time that they are together with their babies and reduce the distress of separation; and Stillbirth Foundation Australia, who provide research and education in this area, while also providing information around bereavement support. To all the parents and families who have suffered from infant loss, we remember you and your precious babies on this day.","Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ARCHER (Bass) ","(11:14):"

Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day is observed tomorrow, as weve heard, and the day is observed with remembrance ceremonies and candle-lighting vigils, concluding with the Lights of Love International Wave of Light being conducted around the world—circumnavigating the globe, in fact—beginning at 7 pm in each respective time zone, so at 7 pm here in Canberra, and, just to remind the good folk of Darwin where its still 5.30, its an hour and a half later. I know that, an hour and a half later, the community members will be out lighting candles there in the Top End. They will be parents, family members, friends, healthcare workers. They will come together to remember babies who have been lost through miscarriage, stillbirth and infant death. It is a terrible event for families to go through, but we always remember that the loss is shared by the friends of those who experience it and the health workers who work with them.Its a day for us to come together to create a greater awareness around the issues of infant loss and pregnancy loss. I am told that there are about 410 losses per day, which is staggering. Thats a really devastating blow to families across this country. Its a blow to small communities and tight-knit friendship groups around the country. I just want to thank everyone out there who is working to support someone today who is in that position. Its an incredibly difficult time. Theres no more terrible thing than the loss of the child, and the suffering can continue afterwards as further issues are faced. There is often depression and even post-traumatic stress because it is such a traumatic event. Ive been close to it and I know that its incredibly important that friends and family dont just give space to the people coping with that profound loss but rather wrap their arms around them. Tomorrow is a great day to remind us all about the support thats needed and to build awareness. As the motion states, greater research and understanding are required to aid in the establishment of programs, resources and services that support people in that time of need. That is incredibly important.Id like to acknowledge the great work done in my electorate of Solomon by Sarah Roberts and the team at SIDS and Kids NT, and the wider team at Bereaved Parent Support NT. Statistics show that in the past five years the Northern Territory has experienced the highest number of child deaths per capita occurring during the first year of life. In particular areas of the Northern Territory, as many as one in three pregnancies may be lost. The reason the figure could be that high is that its often the case that some mothers dont report an early miscarriage. With the very transient population we have in the Northern Territory, we have shocking rates of loss of pregnancy and infant loss. I just want to commend everyone who is working so hard in that area.","Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GOSLING (Solomon) ","(11:19):"
296,0,0,0,1,2,"Allen, Katrina, MP",282986,"Higgins","LP","N/A",3930," Throughout my career as a paediatrician, I have seen firsthand the experiences of parents and parents-to-be and how varied those experiences can be. Some people are lucky enough to have a baby that is happy, safe, thriving. Others are not so fortunate. For some, the hope and expectation of the impending delivery are dashed when things go terribly wrong. For those who suffer infant loss, either in pregnancy or soon after, the physical and emotional tolls are painful and traumatic.In Australia these experiences are, unfortunately, all too common, experienced by 150,000 women each year, of which 147,000 are miscarriages. There are 1,750 stillbirths each year. Thats six families affected each and every day. Each year, 850 babies die in the first 28 days after birth. Sadly, each year, three out of every 1,000 babies born in Australia die before they reach 12 months of age. Whats more, the deep and ongoing emotional effects bought on by these tragic events are often underestimated and overlooked. They include depression, anxiety, changes in relationships, development of unhealthy coping strategies and post-traumatic stress disorders.While the subsequent grief associated with pregnancy and infancy loss is common, it is often a private grief. Between my third and fourth child, I experienced a miscarriage. The loss was devastating. As I highlighted in my first speech, words like widow and orphan describe loss, but there are no words to describe the loss of an infant. Every parent has the right to hope for a child, and we must undertake every effort to ensure that our systems provide compassionate, individualised and skilled levels of support both during and after loss.Tomorrow, 15 October, is international Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day. It marks an official occasion to acknowledge that pregnancy and infant loss is a shared loss. Together we take the opportunity to promote greater awareness, remembrance and support of the individuals, families and communities that are affected irrevocably by these terrible losses. Whilst this is the month when we talk about our great losses, Im also optimistic about the great strides in research into transformative technologies that help prevent infant loss—therapies that help to ensure premature babies actually survive and dont just survive but thrive.The Morrison government recognise the devastation that pregnancy and infant loss has on families, and that is why we are taking pragmatic steps to invest in supporting these families throughout our $52 million perinatal service and support package. This investment includes $43 million for a new perinatal mental health program to support the mental health of expectant and new parents in Australia and provide support for families experiencing grief following stillbirth, miscarriage or infant death. Further, it includes a $7 million investment for stillbirth measures, including a stillbirth education and awareness program, research to minimise preventable stillbirth and investment in the Safer Baby Bundle project, a new initiative to reduce Australias high rate of stillbirth. Lastly, the investment will provide an improved and targeted intensive support service for families during the vulnerable and challenging period following miscarriage and stillbirth. Additionally, the government has also tabled its response to the report of the 2018 Senate Select Committee on Stillbirth Research and Education and has agreed in principle to all recommendations made by the committee, including to the development of a national stillbirth action plan to reduce the rate of stillbirth and to improve quality of care in relation to stillbirth.Those affected by pregnancy and infant loss should not suffer alone. Today, we pause to remember the babies that have been lost. Every day we should work towards a future where this burden is reduced and all Australians are afforded the support they require, particularly when they are at their most vulnerable. I commend to the House the member for Werriwas private members motion.","Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALLEN (Higgins) ","(11:24):"

299,0,0,0,1,2,"Flint, Nicolle, MP",245550,"Boothby","LP","N/A",3932," I move:That this House:(1) notes the:(a) outstanding contribution women make to the Australian Defence Force; and(b) formation of the new Council for Women and Families United by Defence Service; and(2) acknowledges that Defence embraces the concept of diversity, valuing differences, demonstrating fair, respectful and inclusive behaviour and aims to effectively attract and retain women who can support Defence to better reflect the community it serves.Today I would like to recognise all of our Australian Defence Force personnel, past and present, for their service to and sacrifice for our nation. I note that many of my colleagues in this place, men and women from all sides of the parliament, have served in our ADF, and I thank them for their service. In fact, I note that I have two in the chamber with me right now. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the contribution of women in the Australian Defence Force who, like their male counterparts, have been deployed to combat zones, have supported peacekeeping missions, have helped communities devastated by natural disasters and have engaged in research and rescue operations. Our very own Minister for Defence, Senator the Hon. Linda Reynolds CSC, is an outstanding example of the valuable contribution women make to our Defence Force and an excellent role model for young women and girls considering a career in the defence forces or defence industry.Currently, there are almost 11,000 women in the Australian Defence Force, representing an increase from 17.9 per cent in 2018 to 18.6 per cent in 2019. This is as a result of the broad range of recruitment programs and flexible career pathways available to women seeking a career in the Australian Defence Force. I acknowledge the Department of Defence for the support they provide to our female Defence personnel and their families, and I note that the recently established Council for Women and Families United by Defence Service also recognises the role and contribution of women. The council will provide insight into the lived experiences of women and families of current and ex-serving Defence personnel and provide advice on direct input into the governments policies and available support.The Australian Defence Force rewards talent, effort and achievement through the advancement of our ADF men and women. A diverse Defence Force better reflects our community and ensures we can draw on different ideas to innovate and adapt to a rapidly evolving strategic environment. A diverse Defence Force means we have the very best capability at a time when national security is at the forefront of our national agenda. Our government is supporting all our men and women in the Australian Defence Force through our record investment of more than $200 billion in Australias defence capability.Our government is also doing a lot to support our veterans, with a particular focus on supporting veterans wellbeing, mental health, housing and postservice employment. Im particularly proud of our $30 million investment to establish a network of six new veterans wellbeing centres, which will bring together key services for veterans and their families. This includes a centre at the repat hospital site in the heart of my community, which has been reactivated thanks to the Morrison and Marshall Liberal governments.We also recognise civilian doctors and nurses who serve our nation, alongside our ADF personnel, during wartime. I note, of course, that nurses have taken a very active role in a range of combat zones throughout our history of military involvement in wars. I will reflect on a just few of those who have particular relevance to my electorate of Boothby. Boothby is home to the Womens Memorial Playing Fields, an eight-hectare site that was established by Liberal Premier Sir Thomas Playford in 1953 as a memorial to the 21 nurses who were massacred on Radji Beach during World War II. Every year we hold a ceremony to commemorate their service and remember their lives and their sacrifice. I am incredibly proud to have secured a $500,000 grant to upgrade the memorial so that we can continue to do so and so that we have a more fitting memorial for these very brave nurses who paid the ultimate sacrifice.I also want to make mention of one of my wonderful local constituents and community volunteers, Rosie Aust, whose great aunt, Nurse Blanche Atkinson, had quite an incredible story. Blanche Atkinson was born in South Australia in 1879, trained as a nurse at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and graduated in 1910. She wanted to enlist to serve the war effort but wasnt allowed to do so in Australia, so she sold all her possessions, got on a boat and sailed to England, where she was able to join the Royal British Nurses Association. She served for about a year, became very ill and passed away at the age of 36, but she was recognised by the king and queen for her service, which was quite remarkable.Finally, Id like to make mention of one of my local legends in the community, Mrs Joan Lorraine, who next week will turn 96. Joan served in World War II and is still a very active member of the Blackwood RSL. Joan, thank you for your national service and for everything you do for our community. You make us so proud.","Australian Servicewomen","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms FLINT (Boothby—Government Whip) ","(11:29):"

304,0,0,0,1,2,"Gosling, Luke, MP",245392,"Solomon","ALP","N/A",3933," I would like first to thank the member for Boothby for moving this motion and to thank all the honourable members who will be speaking in support of it. I want also to acknowledge all our service men and women, but particularly our women in service.This motion provides me an opportunity to acknowledge that I bumped into an old school friend the other day when I was at Victoria Barracks in Sydney, the home of the Australian Army. I want to acknowledge the professionalism of and the outstanding person that is Colonel Fiona Curtis. She reminded me that its our 30-year high school reunion coming up—which made me feel quite old, but she still looks absolutely marvellous and is doing a great job for Army.It is important that we take these moments to reflect on and give gratitude to those who have served and who continue to serve in our Defence Force. I am sure everyone remembers the proud moment we had in the last parliament when amendments were passed to remove all barriers for women performing all roles within the ADF. It was a step in the right direction for us, and I note that Defence, as the member for Boothby just mentioned, have targets they are aiming for for participation of Australian women in our defence forces. Were currently at 17.9 per cent for the whole of the ADF, but I certainly think we can reach those targets even before 2023.I would also like to note my support of the decision made by the government to form the Council for Women and Families United by Defence Service. The needs of women and families affected by defence service are not always understood or visible. Voices havent always been heard. Obviously, its vitally important that we seek to better understand the service and sacrifice of women who either have served in the ADF or have been impacted by the service of a loved one in the ADF.I know that one of the matters the council is looking into is the proposal to create a killed-in-service class—a KIS class. It would be awarded posthumously as recognition to defence service members who make the ultimate sacrifice for our country. The campaign to create the KIS class is an initiative of an amazing couple, Warrant Officer Kerry Danes CSM and Kay Danes OAM. The proposal has some support from both sides of the chamber. The idea of this initiative is that, with the loss of a family member, the family who are left to deal with that loss have something on the medals that they remember their loved one by.Close to my heart, obviously, are all the women that we recognise who served in World War II, in particular in the defence of Darwin in the Womens Auxiliary Australian Air Force, the Womens Royal Australian Naval Service and the nurses, as previously mentioned, on hospital ships like the Manunda, which was hit during the bombing of Darwin in 1942. In fact, in my electorate Ive established an award for an outstanding student showing courage at Manunda Terrace Primary School in Darwin. The award is named after Margaret de Mestre, who was wounded when the Manunda was struck but continued to say to her colleagues: Leave me. There are others more injured than me. Margaret passed away shortly after and is buried in the Top End. I always remember the courage of Margaret and of all the women who serve in our ADF as they go about doing what every member of the ADF does in the service of our nation.There are so many people we could acknowledge. I also want to mention Captain Angela Stokes from the Top End for her service.","Australian Servicewomen","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GOSLING (Solomon) ","(11:34):"
305,0,0,0,1,2,"Connelly, Vince, MP",282984,"Stirling","LP","N/A",3934," I also acknowledge other ex-servicemen and women, veterans, now serving in our federal parliament. Im extremely pleased to have this opportunity to speak about the incredible contribution made by women to our ADF. I would like to touch briefly also on some of the important women in my own life. In this way, I pay tribute to the collective value that women bring to the ADF as well as to our families and our society. There is a risk that, if we only focus on areas in our society where division and inequality exist, we run the risk of losing sight of incredible stories of success.I spoke in my maiden speech about the role that my own mother played in inspiring me to stand up for whats right, to make personal sacrifices and to have the courage to show others the way. As a mother of six kids, a pathologist, a local councillor and a political activist, my mum was an awe-inspiring example of community leadership. My sister Michelle has for two decades worked as a leading consultant to extractive industry clients. In recognition of her amazing work, Michelle was last year appointed to the board of the Institute of Quarrying Australia. Whilst she occasionally happens upon a social dinosaur, Michelle is humbly getting on with the job, working with both men and women to show them that a balance of both sexes in the industry isnt just a nicety but, rather, a necessity of peak performance.As Australians, we enjoy and appreciate the opportunity that we have to live in the best country in the world. This is why so many Australians feel compelled to serve in our ADF as protectors of the values and freedoms that underpin our wonderful society. When I arrived at the Australian Defence Force Academy, straight out of school at the age of 17, I entered an environment where young men and women were in junior leadership roles, guiding our professional development. One of the professional young women that I worked with was Vivian Law. Tracking through a year ahead of me, Viv got to boss me around a little bit but was always fair and approachable. Viv then had a distinguished military career, including service on operations in the Middle East. She raised a family of four beautiful daughters with her husband, Greg. Although Viv is now out of the Australian Defence Force, she is still serving. Viv recently took over the reins as the chief executive officer of Legacy in Western Australia. What an inspirational woman.Let me tell you about another great friend of mine: Amanda Williamson. Amanda also had a distinguished Army career, including being awarded the US Bronze Star for her service with special operations forces in Afghanistan. Amanda is now a senior manager with a global business and is also still volunteering her time to serve in the community, including as a board member of Soldier On.Finally, my own incredible wife, Peta: as well as putting up with me—which deserves its own medal—Peta also had a fantastic military career. As an intelligence corps officer, Petas very first posting was to the Special Air Service Regiment, almost 20 years ago. Here Peta demonstrated, as so many other women still do today, that, far from being shunned by Australias military elite, women are viewed as an indispensable component of the workforce.Throughout the country, women are integrated into Australias combat operations, peacekeeping missions and disaster relief operations. I actually believe that Defence leads within our society when it comes to equality of treatment and respect for women. Please dont misunderstand me, though: Defence is not perfect, as no workplace is. But my own experience and the experience of so many successful women that I know is that their contributions have been exceptional and have been noted as such. So today I pay tribute to the former, current and future women members of our Australian Defence Force. I thank them for the lessons that they have taught me, and I salute their service.","Australian Servicewomen","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CONNELLY (Stirling) ","(11:39):"
306,0,0,0,1,2,"Phillips, Fiona, MP",147140,"Gilmore","ALP","N/A",3935," I am pleased to have this opportunity today to talk about the wonderful women in defence on the New South Wales South Coast. My electorate of Gilmore has a strong defence presence. Im proud to say that the New South Wales South Coast is home to HMAS Albatross and HMAS Creswell. HMAS Albatross, based at Nowra, and where I worked proudly, is Australias largest operational naval establishment, and the Royal Australian Navys only air station, home to the Fleet Air Arm. HMAS Creswell is the Navys officer training school on the shores of Jervis Bay.HMAS Albatross has been an integral part of the Nowra community for over 70 years. With around 1,200 personnel on the base, its local importance cannot be overstated. When we talk about the outstanding contribution of women to the Australian Defence Force, I cant help but think of HMAS Albatross. In 2017, HMAS Albatross made history with its first-ever female commanding officer, Captain Fiona Sneath. With Captain Sneath as CO, the Albatross command, including the Executive Officer, First Lieutenant, Ships Warrant Officer, Coxswain, Command Staff Officer and Legal Officer were all women. It wouldnt be all that long ago that an all-female command team at a key Navy base would have been unheard of. This is an outstanding demonstration of the Navys support for women in the Defence Force and speaks to the strength and abilities of the women of HMAS Albatross.Captain Sneath has had an impressive career in defence, and she is a great example of a woman working her way right to the top. Captain Sneath joined the Royal Australian Navy in 1994 as a Direct Entry Legal Officer. She rose through the ranks with a wide range of postings as a Legal Officer, eventually becoming the Chief Legal Advisor Navy Headquarters. From 2011 to 2014, she was the Staff Legal Advisor to the Chief of the Defence Force, advising on the implementation of cultural reviews, such as the Australian Human Rights Commission Review into the Treatment of Women in the ADF; responses to sexual offences and allegations of abuse within Defence; combat deaths; complex personnel disputes; and reforms to the military justice system. Captain Sneath was awarded a Commander Joint Operations Gold Commendation for her performance as a legal officer in operations. Before she became CO of HMAS Albatross she was Director Military Law Centre/Deputy Director Asia Pacific Centre for Military Law. In that position she was responsible for managing and delivering legal training requirements for ADF legal officers.Ive had the pleasure of meeting Captain Sneath on many occasions, and she is an outstanding woman. But she is not alone: there are so many amazing women just like Captain Sneath in our Defence Force. Perhaps its easy to see why, if we take a look at HMAS Creswell. HMAS Creswell is home to the Royal Australian Naval College, the Navys officer training school, with over 100 defence personnel. Recently, I had the opportunity to attend two welcome events for new entry officers at Creswell. These were for new recruits in the Getting Division and the Clarkson Division. There are 140 new entry officers training right now who will graduate in November. Captain Warren Bairstow, the commanding officer of HMAS Creswell, put it so well in his address to new recruits: the aim of the welcome event was to learn soft skills—how we relate to people and how important and vital these soft skills will be for life as an officer in the Navy.What also struck me as extraordinary, as I entered and talked with many of the new officers and their trainers, was the diversity of backgrounds from which new recruits came. New recruits ranged from 18 years of age to around 50 or so years of age—many women as well as men. Some came from working atAlbatross, the local area, interstate, Army or Air Force, or overseas. New recruits came from civilian backgrounds such as working in hospitality or working as a personal trainer, in the trades or as a civilian pilot—the list goes on. This is an extraordinary mature-age pathway based on diversity and one which I have no doubt is having a significant impact on encouraging women into defence.The benefits of HMAS Albatross and HMASCreswellto the local community are profound. Defence personnel and their families and children are totally embedded in our community. We love our defence family, and I am committed to working with the government and the Navy to grow defence jobs in our local area. I commend the Navy and Defence for its support of women at HMAS Albatross, HMASCreswelland across Australia.","Australian Servicewomen","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs PHILLIPS (Gilmore) ","(11:44):"
307,0,0,0,1,2,"Simmonds, Julian, MP",282983,"Ryan","LNP","N/A",3936," Its a great pleasure to stand here today in support of the very timely and wonderfully worded motion of the member for Boothby. It is timely because I spent Saturday at Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera, when they had their open day. It was a tremendous opportunity to get to know the service personnel there. A lot of the Ryan community feel a great pride and connection with the Gallipoli Barracks, where some 7,000 service personnel currently serve. It was a great opportunity because very rarely do you get into the barracks itself, so it was a wonderful opportunity to go and talk to the serving personnel, in particular to talk to a number of female service personnel, who are doing a tremendous job.The women I met on Saturday, and previously, of course, play an active role in every aspect of operations. they are deployed to active combat zones, support peacekeeping missions, help communities devastated by natural disaster and engage in search and rescue operations. They take part in boarding parties to search suspect ships. They drive Australias armoured troop-carrying vehicles in operational areas. They are Australian pilots flying on tasks ranging from reconnaissance to rescue missions, disaster relief and combat support. There is no limit to what our servicewomen can achieve, and it is by their own potential, effort and achievement that they are advancing. With hard work, grit and determination, they are a wonderful example of the very best of our defence forces.The coalition government has maintained a strong focus on supporting and building the number of women serving in the ADF and supporting their families. On current figures, 10,834 women are serving defence. It is a number that continues to grow, year on year. Id particularly like to acknowledge the diversity of leadership at the ADFs most senior levels, as some other members have talked about today. As at June 2019, Defence boards had 44.9 per cent female representation. That contrasts very well with company boards. The Australian Institute of Company Directors reports female representation on ASX 200 boards at only 29.7 per cent. This achievement by Defence has, importantly, been made without quotas. It is the reward for talent and the individual efforts of our servicewomen, who are achieving great things. In fact, as the member for Stirling said, and a number of serving personnel reminded me on Saturday, Defence as an organisation is often at the forefront of social change in Australia. Even though it relies heavily on tradition and rigidity, it has been at the forefront of social progress. Indigenous Australians were servicemen long before they could vote, in 1962, and the ADF recognised and supported same-sex de facto couples long before the Marriage Act was amended in 2017. So too is it leading the way in making sure that servicewomen are supported to achieve great things.But there is always more to be done to build and support our servicewomen. I want to draw the chambers attention to a couple of initiatives. Women have the option of joining the Australian Defence Force with a shorter time commitment for certain roles. This enables them to assess whether a Navy, Army or Air Force career is right for them and those important to them, including their families. There is the very successful gap year program, which, personnel have said, has been a pathway for a number of new service personnel. Its a great option for 17- to 24-year-old women interested in experiencing the Navy, Army or Air Force. It enables them to gain leadership capabilities which will set them up for their future careers. In addition, parents are given support to manage their family commitments without detriment to their careers, including flexible working arrangements, maternity and paternity leave and the putting on hold of their career options while they have children. Defence also provides substantial housing subsidies to assist with child care, schooling requirements and additional health support for dependents in regional posting locations, as well as partner employment assistance and programs for settling into a new community. The member for Boothby spoke about the wellness centres which will be rolled out. They are part of an exciting initiative to support veterans and those transitioning into the workforce.I again congratulate all our servicewomen who are currently serving, particularly those at the Gallipoli Barracks at Enoggera. We are incredibly proud of what you are doing, as I hope you are incredibly proud of the work that you are doing on behalf of Australians. Thank you also to our veterans community, to those servicewomen who have served our nation and have now transitioned out of the defence forces. We look forward as a government to continuing to support you and your families.","Australian Servicewomen","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr SIMMONDS (Ryan) ","(11:49):"
308,0,0,0,1,2,"Neumann, Shayne, MP","HVO","Blair","ALP","N/A",3938," Im pleased to rise to support this motion. I want to thank the women in the Australian Defence Force, including those in Air Force and Army units based at RAAF Base Amberley, for their contribution to the defence of our nation and the contribution they make to the Ipswich community.Just as Labor celebrates the contribution of women to Australian society more broadly, we also acknowledge the outstanding contribution made by women in the Australian Defence Force, from the Air Force to the Army to the Navy, from those who serve on the front line to those who serve at the home front, and our defence partners and families in the wider defence community. Women have made an invaluable contribution to Australias military history: from conflicts in the First and Second World Wars through to contemporary service in Afghanistan and Iraq, on the front line in medical specialisations, and in critical support and non-combat roles where they ensure our fighting forces can be the best they can. They have served, and continue to serve, with distinction, courage and selfless dedication. They do us proud. While we need to acknowledge there have been issues around the treatment of women in the ADF over the years, we must also recognise the significant cultural change in recent years, such as through initiatives like the Pathway to Change reform program established by the former Labor government. Todays ADF is a much more diverse, inclusive and egalitarian organisation that aims to recruit and retain women who can support Defence to better reflect the community it serves. Just as in other spheres of society, it is pleasing to see that women today are participating more and more in defence life and getting the recognition they so deserve. Women represent about 18 per cent of the ADF, up from 13 per cent in the early 2000s. While historically women were excluded from most military roles outside of nursing, theres been expansion of the role of women in all aspects of service, so that now females can serve in any capacity. These are great achievements and we have made tremendous progress in this country.We know Defence is having trouble sustaining this growth and meeting its female recruitment targets, so we cant afford to be complacent. Labor is calling on the government to do more to boost the number of women in the ranks, so that the ADF can attract the widest available talent and be more representative of Australian society.We know service in the defence of our country touches the lives of many—not only those who serve but those who know them: their family, friends and colleagues. We should recognise the particular burden faced by Australian women who, for more than 100 years, maintained families while their partners have been deployed and who have supported the health of those partners when they have returned and have suffered from their loss, whether as partners, mothers or sisters. Its important to acknowledge the nature of military service and the sacrifice demanded of all who commit to serve in the ADF and their partners and families. To that end, I welcome the establishment of a new Council for Women and Families United by Defence Service and chaired by BAE Systems Australia Chief Executive Officer and Army veteran Gabby Costigan.Labor knows well that the needs of women and families that are affected by defence service are not always understood or visible to the community and that their voices are not always heard when it comes to discussions about support and assistance. Thats why we took to the last election a policy for a national family engagement and support strategy to better engage and support families who experience mental health and other issues both pre- and post-military service. We need to better understand the service and sacrifice of women who have either served in the ADF themselves or been impacted by the service of a loved one. This is something the Productivity Commission highlighted in its recent inquiry into veteran support systems, and its something Labor fully supports. In addition to the council, related initiatives—such as the Honouring Women United by Defence Service event, which I was delighted to attend here in Parliament House in August—are another way to celebrate and pay tribute to the wonderful women who have given their all for their country for over a century.Labor wants to work together with the government and adopt a bipartisan approach and, with other groups, help deliver better outcomes for women in the ADF. And Labor wants to deliver better services and support for women and families impacted by defence service.I want to take this opportunity to congratulate, honour and acknowledge all women who have contributed to the defence of Australia and whose lives have been impacted by defence service. I thank the member for the motion and commend it to the chamber. I want to particularly thank Lieutenant Colonel Meegan Olding, who heads the Joint Logistics Unit at the South Queensland RAAF Base Amberley, who leads that unit with distinction, and who helped host me at the ADF Parliamentary Program in July this year.","Australian Servicewomen","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr NEUMANN (Blair) ","(11:54):"
309,0,0,0,1,2,"Claydon, Sharon, MP",248181,"Newcastle","ALP","N/A",3939," I do thank the member for bringing this motion before the House today. I want to associate myself with previous comments made in terms of the importance of womens role and service in the Australian Defence Force, acknowledging the pressures that that has brought to bear for many women and their families, and the great strides that Defence has made in trying to redress what has been a pretty horrific gender inequity that has existed in ADF services over many, many decades. I know from my time with the Joint Standing Committee on Defence, Foreign Affairs and Trade that whenever I saw the chiefs, the first question I had for each of them was their enrolment and recruitment figures for women. Air Force was always the one that came out on top, followed by Navy and then Army—which is, I think, the first to acknowledge that they have a hard road ahead of them in terms of trying to recruit increased numbers of women, and more importantly, retain them in the Defence Force.I did want to take this opportunity to talk about one example of just how far we are going with making the Australian Defence Force more inclusive. I had the great fortune to recently launch an exhibition in Newcastle during Pride Week that was called Serving In Silence. At that exhibition I met a really remarkable woman by the name of Anna Van Netten. Anna had a really horrific story of when she was a young private in the army. She was based at Singleton barracks, in my neighbouring electorate of Hunter, back in the 1980s. She was told she wouldnt be able to keep her job in the army in the 1980s if she wasnt prepared to give up all of the women that she knew and associated with in the army that were lesbians or that shed had a relationship with. You can imagine that this was pretty devastating for a young private in the Army. Her girlfriend at the time was interviewed by the military police in Singleton. If I recall correctly, Anna was taken down to Victoria Barracks in Sydney and interrogated and had multiple—I think four—military police escorting her everywhere and asking her very deep, personal questions. It was a pretty horrific experience for her and a very intimidating one.The reason I tell this story is not to just reflect on the very poor basis from which we started in order to build an inclusive Australian Defence Force, but to say it was so remarkable that at same exhibition—where Anna told of her terrible experiences of being in the ADF in the 1980s—there was another truly remarkable woman, Bonnie Doyle, who is a very senior officer in the Air Force now. She was there that evening representing a group called DEFGLIS. This is a network that is now provided across all of the three services for LGBTIQ people within the defence forces to get support and information and to address issues quite early as they arise. Its a body thats doing some really remarkable work. It just showed what an extraordinary journey we have been on since the 1980s, when someone like Anna van Netten was intimidated and dragged down to Victoria Barracks as a result of her sexual identity, to now having a network that is proudly working alongside LGBTIQ members of the ADF.I would like to acknowledge the work of the Air Force chaplains in my region, who have always been nothing short of remarkable in terms of their willingness to reach out to each and every member of the ADF to embrace them. Indeed, I know our Australian chaplains have played an important role with the American defence forces, who do not have the same fortunate position of being able to reach out and service LGBTIQ members of their defence forces.","Australian Servicewomen","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CLAYDON (Newcastle) ","(11:59):"
310,0,0,0,1,2,"Gee, Andrew, MP",261393,"Calare","Nats","N/A",3940," Im very appreciative of the opportunity to recognise the outstanding contribution that women make to the Australian Defence Force. In acknowledging that important and vital contribution to our Defence Force, I want to bring to the attention of the House the contribution that some in my electorate are making in this regard.A wonderful example of service personnel who are making that contribution include long-time Bathurst resident Sarah Patterson, who is an Army lieutenant and has been deployed to Iraq as a radiographer to take X-rays and ultrasounds at the Taji military complex near Baghdad, where Australian and coalition soldiers help train the Iraqi army. Im told that Sarah, being from the Bathurst area, loves her car racing. Even though she is a Holden supporter and might not have been too happy with yesterdays results, Im told that she did make arrangements so that race week could be telecast at the base. She requested that four days of V8s be shown on TV while she was on deployment. Thats commitment! She was willing to get up at 3 am to watch those races. I was at the track yesterday, and I can confirm that the race was a cracker.Sarah, who graduated from MacKillop College in 2003, works in Iraq treating Australian and coalition soldiers, along with some civilians, at the military complex. Her position saves people from having to fly somewhere else just for an X-ray, which saves a lot of time and money. During her deployment, Sarah has conducted over 60 X-rays and 40 ultrasounds. Ultrasound is a postgraduate qualification for radiographers. She completed long-term schooling through Defence and managed to pick up a deployment after she got back to the unit from her studies. She is just one of hundreds of active servicewomen doing amazing things in our defence forces, and I would like to acknowledge the great work of Sarah in this House today. Hopefully, shell be back trackside in the not-too-distant future.Locally, our reservists have been deployed to peacekeeping missions and help communities devastated by natural disasters. Theyve engaged in search and rescue activities through their deployment. That includes the men and women of the 1/19 Battalion stationed at Bathurst, Orange, Wagga and Dubbo. The 1/19 Battalion has a very proud history, and it can trace its lineage back to 1854. In 1996, the 1/19 Battalion was decentralised and moved from Ingleburn to its current four regional depots. Its currently led by Lieutenant Colonel Michael Buchanan, who is also the deputy principal of Cowra High while serving in his reservist role. There are seven women currently serving in an active capacity with the battalion. Theyve played vital roles, both domestically and overseas, including during the 2000 Olympics, and the 1/19th has also provided personnel for search tasks as part of the Australian Army security operations. In May 2010, 1/19 Battalion provided a platoon-sized element to Operation Anode Rotation 21 for service in Solomon Islands as part of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands. This force returned to Australia in August 2010, and I would like to acknowledge the important work of 1/19 Battalion.Id also like to acknowledge programs like Exercise Boss Lift, which has been a unique opportunity for businesspeople to experience reservist Defence Force life and provide an example to the general community. Id like to recognise two Bathurst women, Stacey Whittaker OAM and Abbey Barrett, who both recently took part in the exercise in Malaysia over five days. They were dropped deep into the jungles of Malaysia, given ration packs and sent on a mission with the Australian Army reservists. Ms Barrett works at Skillset in Bathurst, and she said that Exercise Boss Lift participants gain a deeper understanding of the training skills and capabilities that reservists can bring back to the civilian workforce.Stacey Whittaker has also taken an active role in the reserves in her role as the chair of the Central West Defence Reserves Support Council New South Wales. Id also like to mention the great work of our cadet units in our area, for example Kinross Wolaroi School in Orange, managed and led by teacher Gary Yeo. They have 350 students, many of them young women, who are coming up through the ranks and many of whom will no doubt serve in the ADF in future years. We acknowledge the wonderful contributions of our women wherever they may be in our defence forces and our cadets.","Australian Servicewomen","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GEE (Calare—Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister) ","(12:05):"

313,0,0,0,1,2,"Claydon, Sharon, MP",248181,"Newcastle","ALP","N/A",3941," I move:That this House:(1) notes that Australia has:(a) more than 59,000km of coastline;(b) around 85 per cent of the population living in coastal regions; and(c) nearly 39,000 buildings (as at 2011) and hundreds of coastal communities located within 100 metres of soft shorelines which are at risk from accelerated erosion;(2) acknowledges that:(a) coastal erosion presents a social, environmental, economic and existential threat to coastal communities;(b) human-induced climate change will accelerate erosion, putting many communities in grave danger; and(c) a number of communities are already starting to sustain serious damage from coastal erosion;(3) is deeply concerned that there is no national leadership on the issue of coastal erosion and all climate adaptation activities have been defunded under Governments led by Prime Ministers Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison; and(4) calls on the Government to take urgent action to support coastal communities seeking to restore their beaches and improve their resilience.I am very pleased to move this motion in the parliament today, to put the very important issue of coastal erosion back on the national agenda—just as it was under the former Labor government. Its time the Morrison Liberal government got serious about this threat, which is only going to get worse as it puts more homes, businesses, precious beaches and vital community assets in peril. Indeed, a 2011 survey found that there are nearly 39,000 buildings located within 100 metres of what we call soft shorelines that could be at risk from accelerated erosion. In New South Wales alone there are 16 identified coastal erosion hotspots, and one of these is in the community of Stockton in my electorate of Newcastle. Coastal erosion hotspots are an issue I brought to the attention of this House during the last sitting.The Stockton community has been facing the threat of coastal erosion for many years now, but in recent months the situation has deteriorated rapidly, with the most severe erosion recorded in 20 years. As a result, the childcare centre has been closed—in fact, it is being demolished; the iconic and dearly loved Stockton Beach has been declared unsafe and cordoned off from access; the council owned caravan park had to be evacuated; houses and roads had to be sandbagged; and the Stockton Surf Life Saving Club, which has stood proudly for 112 years, is on the precipice. And, as if all of that wasnt bad enough, Stockton residents are now facing exposure to tonnes of potentially carcinogenic industrial waste that was used to stabilise the foreshore back in the 1940s and is now being unearthed and exposed as the coast recedes.It has been profoundly distressing for the community to watch their precious beach wash away, living in fear that core community infrastructure and, indeed, their homes may soon follow. President of the Stockton Surf Life Saving Club Callan Nickerson has spoken of the heartbreak that the erosion crisis is causing, saying:As this preventable problem has tightened its grip on our beach, our community has suffered as a result.The ritual of many to come home from work and head to the beach to unwind is not a reality anymore. People head there now to have a look at just how much sand we have lost. Northside Boardriders president Simon Jones, who has long campaigned to save Stockton Beach, has called on the Berejiklian New South Wales state government to intervene, saying:What this is about is preserving something that should be taken for granted for future generations …Make no mistake, this is a community in crisis, but none of this should be a surprise. Indeed, the community has been calling for action on coastal erosion for many years but, regrettably, it has taken these catastrophic developments in recent months for the state government to finally declare Stockton a significant open coast location, which is a necessary prerequisite in order for our local government to even apply for some funding to address this situation.But this first step is not enough. The Berejiklian Liberal government needs to appoint a state recovery coordinator to manage the erosion crisis and to urgently direct agencies to assist with stabilisation, repairs and replenishment activities. It also needs to complete and adopt the coastal management plan. While these responsibilities sit firmly with the state government, the federal government also has a role to play. Just like drought, flood, fire and all forms of natural disaster, coastal erosion does not respect state borders. It is a truly national issue that needs national leadership, and it needs it now, especially given the increasing role climate change will play in the decline of our coast. While I dont want to diminish the impact that port infrastructure and other aspects have on the Stockton situation, extreme weather events, driven by climate change, are accelerating the process. Indeed, in just one five-hour stretch of wild weather and heavy surf, Stockton Beach lost 2.5 metres of sand height. Of course, with the inevitable sea-level rise, things are only going to get worse.Federal Labor went to the election with a comprehensive plan to address climate change and we had a coastal rehabilitation fund that would have helped communities like Stockton to address this crippling erosion. So today I ask this government: what are you doing to prepare for the inevitable and, in some cases, imminent dire impacts of coastal erosion?","Climate Change: Coastal Erosion","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CLAYDON (Newcastle) ","(12:10):"

318,0,0,0,1,2,"Falinski, Jason, MP","G86","Mackellar","LP","N/A",3943," I thank the member for Newcastle. I would like to join her in her condemnation of state government regulation that has made the management of our coastal areas so very difficult. What the Keneally government did, in the 2010-11 period, in absolutely destroying the capacity of local communities to protect their private land and community land from seas and coastal erosion is one of the great untold stories of government incompetence that we have seen in Australia.In my electorate of Mackellar we have a situation not unlike that described by the member for Newcastle, where you have impact zones that actually go as far back as major public roads. It is not allowed for the local community or private citizens to construct seawalls that protect not only community infrastructure and transport infrastructure but their own homes. It is absolutely incomprehensible that the Keneally government in 2010 would have allowed this to happen.My electorate of Mackellar, which is on the northern beaches and is a far prettier electorate than the member for Newcastles—but we can have that argument later; maybe we can move competing motions to that effect!—is an electorate which is home to some of the most exquisite beaches and coastline in Australia. Ive lived on the northern beaches all my life, and it is a privilege to represent the people who call this beautiful coastline home.I rise today to convey the concerns of my electorate surrounding coastal erosion and its relation to climate change. There are two pressing issues for the people of my electorate, but they can rest assured knowing that this government is taking those issues incredibly seriously. I remain confident that the Morrison governments policies will continue to protect the 59,000 kilometres that make up Australias splendid coastline. The challenge is constant, although our problems are continually changing as a result of coastal erosion.A stretch of coastline in my electorate that spans the sweeping beaches of Collaroy to Narrabeen has been officially identified as Australias third-most at-risk coastal area. The beaches there have become particularly vulnerable to extreme weather conditions, with sand drift and significantly receding shorelines compromising the safety of beachgoers and seafront property owners alike. The major road in my electorate is Pittwater Road, and the storms that we had in 2016 were literally only stopped from sweeping away large parts of this road because peoples houses—and swimming pools, in some cases—got in the way.As a result of a particularly destructive storm in 2016, several measures have been put in place to reduce erosion in the interests of ensuring our communitys safety. Seawalls, sand replenishment and beach nourishment are all now integrated in the coastal management plan. For this motion to state that there is no leadership on the issue of coastal erosion or climate change is just wrong. This government has a number of measures and practical policies to ensure that our coasts are secure, the climate is looked after and the integrity of our economy remains strong.A practical Morrison government climate change initiative has been the $2.5 billion investment in the Emissions Reduction Fund. The government has also announced a new $3.5 billion Climate Solutions Fund—another initiative that will not only ensure Australia meets its Paris 2030 commitment but will in turn slow the advance of erosion.The Climate Solutions Fund will contribute to the highly regarded Environment Restoration Fund, which will assist local communities to restore ecological damage. This fund, in addition to the billion dollars the coalition has invested in the next phase of the National Landcare Program, will help to protect and preserve Australias flora and fauna. Thankfully, our community has largely recovered from the devastating 2016 storm—yet many of my constituents remain understandably concerned, not least because they are so committed.Im very fortunate that my electorate office is just a stones throw from Narrabeen Beach, a refreshing yet soothing place to walk or think, or to go to with friends and family. My daughter too loves the beach. The residents care very much about our beaches, which is reflected in a marked absence of litter and marine debris that many other beaches and coastlines find too familiar.I shall continue to work with the federal and state government so I can remain confident that our government is making strides to halt coastal erosion and protect our exceptional coastline, a coastline that distinguishes us as— (Time expired)","Climate Change: Coastal Erosion","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr FALINSKI (Mackellar) ","(12:16):"

I thank him for doing that.I want to talk about my electorate in the Northern Territory and how we are experiencing effects, like other places in our country, and why its important that we combat coastal erosion to any extent that we can. The Northern Territory has an extensive coastline and a diverse marine environment. Our coastlines almost 11,000 kilometres, including 887 islands, and our coastal waters cover over 72,000 kilometres. Thats big. These relatively undisturbed environments are unique, both nationally and globally. When I mention those statistics, theyre in relation to Australia but, obviously, the Northern Territory has a large segment of that coastline. Its a long coastline, and it is relatively undisturbed for now—except for the seas rising, of course. Our Territory coastline is a great source of economic benefit and is important to the maintenance of customary practices and local Aboriginal livelihoods. As such, it is an integral part of our Top End identity and lifestyle.The science is clear: coastal erosion presents a social, environmental, economic and existential threat to our coastal communities. Human-induced climate change will accelerate erosion, putting many communities in grave danger. After six years, this government and the current Prime Minister must finally show some real leadership and take some real action to combat climate change because all of these things in relation to our environment and the climate are linked. Its so important because our coasts and seas provide so many benefits to many user groups.Ive mentioned some of the values in the Northern Territory community in relation to First Nations Territorians and their rights and interests in the coasts and seas. It must be understood that the coasts and seas provide an excellent opportunity for the realisation of the economic, cultural and social aspirations of these people. Industries such as fishing and aquaculture, oil and gas and tourism rely on our coasts and seas. There are a great many potential economic opportunities through careful, managed development of those environments. Commercial fishing activity occurs across 15 different wild harvest fisheries in both inshore and offshore areas. Cruise ships visit Darwin in my electorate and then go on to explore remote regions of the territory, including visiting First Nations communities. The majority of the Territorys population live in or near coastal areas, and about 80 per cent of recreational fishing activity occurs in marine waters, primarily estuaries and inshore and offshore waters. It brings a lot of people to the Territory. Rec fishing is incredibly important, but its only going to be able to continue to be sustainable if we look after our coastal environments.I could go on and on about why I think its important to protect the Territorys coastlines, but we basically want to see more effort—any effort—from the current federal government to help these coastal communities in their efforts to mitigate the effects of coastal erosion.

320,0,0,0,1,2,"Wilson, Tim, MP","IMW","Goldstein","LP","N/A",3945," Its a wonderful privilege to be able to get up and speak on this motion, because coastal erosion is one of the most important issues that we confront as a nation. Our waterways are critical for the future sustainability and health of our nation, as well as, of course, for the future health and sustainability of the planet. One of the things we often forget is that cities are based—as are all of Australias capital cities, of course—on major waterways for very good and logical reasons: because of the basis of their settlement, but also because of their connections to direct water supply.At the last election I went to the people of Goldstein and made it crystal clear that the health and wellbeing particularly of our main body of water, Port Phillip in the great state of Victoria, was something that I was going to fight for as part of improving the lifestyle, the sustainability and the health of our community. Too often the health of Port Phillip has fallen by the wayside through a tussle between local authorities, the state government and the federal government because of issues of ownership and responsibility and because of a lack of legal clarity. Critically, the only people who have suffered are the people who live by it, and the only body of water that suffers because of it is Port Phillip itself.Port Phillip is the jewel of Melbourne. It is central to our liveability; it is the greatest natural asset in our community; and it is critical. Goldstein faces many challenges directly around coastal erosion. In fact, Goldstein has almost all of the cliffs along Port Phillip from Melbourne on the easterly side—rising up around Brighton and going across Hampton, Sandringham and Black Rock, and then descending towards the end of Beaumaris and then to Mentone and Mentone Beach—until you get down to the federal electorate of DunkleySo coastal erosion is critical, and it is a critical part of the platform that I was elected on only a few months ago. As part of the last federal election we made commitments to provide up to $50,000 for the Black Rock Foreshore Masterplan. This involves three distinct proposals and projects, including removing coastal weed species and revegetating these areas with native plant species. It involves installing new fencing at existing informal lookout points—of course coastal erosion comes not just from the water, but also from the top, particularly as a consequence of run-off from Beach Road, as well as from the behaviour of well-meaning citizens enjoying the view but who need to be mindful of the impact and footprint they have on the local environment. It also involves developing ways to protect new plantings and to provide additional stability to the cliffs through a process of revegetation. We funded the City of Bayside to take responsibility for delivering those roles, and we look forward to them delivering them through the processes to come.We didnt provide just that $50,000 for the Black Rock Foreshore Masterplan. We also provided up to $50,000 for the Sandringham Beach and Gardens Masterplan, which involves increasing the amount of vegetation in consultation with local community groups—and there are many—who are concerned about the health of the foreshore. I would like to pay particular regard to the Sandringham Foreshore Association, among others, for their perseverance and diligence in taking care of our local community. They know that Im a good friend of their cause—and also of course of the Black Rock Sandringham Conservation Association. Were also installing new fencing to reduce the impact caused by off-track walking and to improve safety during future weed control and revegetation efforts in difficult-to-access areas, as well as developing detailed revegetation plans which aim to establish long-term sustainable and manageable planting in critical areas around Sandringham.Weve been able to do this because of the excellent work of community organisations, volunteers and the council, and also through working together with the re-elected Morrison government, which has given these commitments. Sadly and tragically, there were no such promises about the care, health and wellbeing of Port Phillip from the Labor Party at the last election. They made no commitment to the Sandringham community, they made no commitment to the Black Rock community and they made no commitments to Beaumaris, or Brighton, or Hampton or anywhere else. Ultimately, this is why they will always struggle to represent our community in Goldstein—they neither understand it nor fully appreciate the consequences. Thats why its so critically important that were a strong voice.Of course, this sits across the backdrop of many measures that this government is taking around the health and wellbeing of our water systems around the world. I know that when the Prime Minister was recently at the United Nations he extolled our specific virtues and focus in making sure we have healthy waterways for the future wellbeing of the planet.","Climate Change: Coastal Erosion","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) ","(12:26):"
321,0,0,0,1,2,"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",182468,"Kingsford Smith","ALP","N/A",3947," I congratulate the member for Newcastle for moving this important motion, which highlights perfectly this governments ineptitude and lack of action when it comes to being serious about climate change and the effects of climate change. We all know that rising sea levels are going to result, and are resulting, in coastal erosion, which is having a dramatic economic and social impact on many communities throughout Australia.The Australian coastline is of immense economic, social and environmental importance to our nation. We have more than 59,000 kilometres of coastline, with around 85 per cent of the population living in coastal regions. Nearly 40,000 buildings and hundreds of coastal communities are located within 100 metres of what are called soft shorelines, which are at risk from accelerated erosion. Coastal erosion presents a social, environmental and economic threat to coastal communities. The increasing concentration of wealth and population in coastal areas further exposes those communities and insurers to devastating losses. Many of those insurers are covering, at a loss, some parts of Australia that are considered disaster prone, and some communities are finding that they may soon be uninsurable. Ive recently travelled up to the north of Australia, particularly to northern Queensland, where communities in Townsville, Cairns and Mackay are having terrible trouble getting coverage through insurance for their homes and their small businesses.We know that human induced climate change will further accelerate erosion, putting many communities in grave danger; projected increases in sea levels have the potential to increase the risks from storm surges and high tides. While some general insurers offer partial coverage for erosion and seawater inundation due to storm surge, no insurers offer products that cover loss or damage due to gradual sea-level rise. A number of communities are already starting to sustain serious damage from coastal erosion, with a loss of dunes and inundation.In my electorate of Kingsford Smith weve had a recent glimpse of the damage that can be done by storm surges and coastal erosion. In 2016—it was actually during the election campaign—we had an east coast low that battered the coastline of Kingsford Smith and basically wiped out one of the walls of the Coogee surf club. The storm surge and the seas were so big that they came up and knocked over the wall to the gymnasium of Coogee surf club and did immense damage, not only to the surf club but also to the beach. That has an effect on the insurance policies of the council and the surf club in the future, and thats the cost of climate change. Thats what those on the opposite side dont understand—that people are bearing the cost of climate change through increased severe storm events and erosion as we speak. Coogee is one of the oldest surf clubs in Australia, but the severity of the east coast low that struck it hadnt been seen in its 110-year history.Weve already seen the all-too-real impacts on our Pacific neighbours. Pacific nations are having to move communities because of the effects of climate change, which is inundating infrastructure. Wells and crops are becoming salinised and therefore unproductive. These conditions, in areas such as the Solomon Islands, provide an insight into the future impacts of accelerated sea-level rise.Yet, although their leaders change, there remains no national leadership from this government on the issue of climate change and coastal erosion. All climate adaptation activities have been defunded under the Liberals. They didnt bother including climate change adaptation in their 2017 review of climate change policies, despite the fact that a 2013 Productivity Commission report, released when Labor was in government, highlighted the clear need for adaptation measures to reduce the risks associated with unavoidable climate change. More needs to be done to repair our coastlines, tackle coastal erosion and prepare our beaches for the impact of climate change.Australia is still without a national framework for building climate resilience, because the battle about whether or not climate change is real and its effects on Australia is still going on within the Liberal Party. After seven years they still doesnt have a national climate change policy and they still dont have a national energy policy. It is Australian communities that are bearing the full impact of that. This government needs to wake up and realise that Australian coastal communities are suffering because of its inaction, and develop a national coastal erosion policy.","Climate Change: Coastal Erosion","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr THISTLETHWAITE (Kingsford Smith) ","(12:31):"

One of the experts in this area, a Professor Ron Boyd from Newcastle university, has said that it is not sea-level rise that has caused the problem at Stockton Beach. He said, Its a man-made problem through artificially manufactured infrastructure. He said:Before Newcastle Harbour construction, sand moved … north along the coastline and a large sandbar existed off Stockton which saved it from the wrath of erosion which is decimating it today.He went on:After construction of long breakwaters—and a deepwater channel being cut in the harbour—its virtually impossible for new sand to enter the south Stockton compartment.People need to understand it is directly linked to the creation of the harbour and dredging, and extension of the break waters …That is what our scientists are telling us. Yet we have members of the Labor Party coming in here and exploiting what is happening up at Stockton Beach: Its all climate change. Its all climate change. What an outrage!

They dont want to know what the science says. They dont want to read the peer reviewed reports. They just want to go out and create mayhem and chaos and undue concern in our community. Let me read what the peer reviewed science says. This is an article published on 27 April 2018. It is a review of the beach shorelines of the world through a 33-year period, from 1984 to 2016. It found that 48 per cent of the worlds beaches are stable. It found that 28 per cent are actually enjoying accretion—they are growing in size—and that 24 per cent are declining and suffering erosion. Theyve also gone through and actually published a map of the world where you can go to your local beach and see if its suffering from erosion or if its enjoying accretion and growing bigger. I have gone to that map and had a look at all the beaches in my local electorate. I am pleased to report to my constituents that I went through a list of the local beaches in my electorate—Jibbon, Wattamolla, Garie, Marley and Era beaches—and also, not in my electorate but in the Sutherland Shire, looking at Boat Harbour, Greenhills, Wanda Beach, Elouera, North Cronulla, South Cronulla, Shelly Beach and Oak Park. For every single one of them, the peer-reviewed science says they have been stable over the last 33 years. Sure, when a big storm comes in they will suffer from periods of erosion from time to time, and then the sand comes back as an accretion. That is a natural process.As I go up through the other beaches in Sydney—Bondi, Tamarama, Bronte, Clovelly, Coogee, Maroubra, Malabar and Little Bay—all of them, according to the science, have been stable over a 30-year period. Yes, they suffer at times from major storm events, but those major storm events are not getting any worse. So I would encourage members of the Labor Party not to go out scaremongering and misrepresenting the science, and, when you see an event like we had at Stockton Beach, make up that somehow climate change is to blame when the science is absolutely clear that its not, because what we are hearing is stories of women aborting children because of undue fear of climate change—that is what that does. We are seeing maniacs gluing themselves to the streets. When members of parliament misrepresent the facts, when they see an incident like what happened at Stockton Beach and they blame climate change, they are only feeding that fear in our society.","Climate Change: Coastal Erosion","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[11]","N/A","N/A"
324,0,0,0,1,2,"Coker, Elizabeth, MP",263547,"Corangamite","ALP","N/A",3949," I rise to support this important and timely motion. I raised the issue of coastal erosion in my first speech when I called for a national strategy to address the coastal impacts of climate change. I witness these effects regularly in Corangamite. At Apollo Bay, over 30 metres of beach has been lost, and now the high tide is within a few metres of the Great Ocean Road. Toilets and camping grounds are under threat. At Anglesea, there is little beach left as the tide cuts into the dunes. This isnt just about recreation on the beach. The critically endangered hooded plover has been left with no breeding area. Erosion means the loss of infrastructure, recreation and habitat. Eventually it also means social disruption, a loss of business and a loss of jobs.The Surf Coast, the Otways and the Great Ocean Road are more than a home to many of my constituents; tourism is a driver of the local coastal economy in Victoria. Great Ocean Road tourism income in 2017-18 was said to be worth over $1.2 billion. Over two million visitors come to the Surf Coast Shire alone each year, and over five million visit the whole stretch of the Great Ocean Road.The five councils in my Corangamite care, and want to address these problems, but to properly map the coast—to engage the engineering expertise and develop a multimillion-dollar multiagency strategy—is well beyond their capacity. These councils, all with high-growth areas, simply cant find extra millions to also combat erosion caused by man-made climate change.But we do have some voices calling for action. In early August, before the meeting of COAG, WA became the first state to release a state-wide report on coastal erosion. Premier Mark McGowan called on the Commonwealth to work with state and local governments to manage coastal erosion across the country. It appears from the COAG communique that the issue didnt even make it onto the agenda. I hope it will next time. The WA report is built on five broad goals: environment, community, economy, infrastructure and governance. Under each goal, the report provides the objectives and strategies that will build healthy coastlines in each of the 55 identified coastal zones. The estimated cost for managing the 55 WA locations is up to $110 million over the next five years, with extra funding required in the long term.On the technical front, scientists from the University of New South Wales recently released a framework for guiding, building and managing coastal infrastructure. They say we need to totally rethink how we build on the coast. I know UNSW is not alone in doing research in this area. The point here is that no local government and no state government can do this on their own.Climate change is global, but its effects are local. All levels of government have a responsibility to deal with those effects, including the federal government. The first step is to take real action on climate change, to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees or less, which will stop ice cap melt and the rise in sea levels. The governments commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030 is a three-degrees strategy, not a below-two-degrees strategy. In any event, our coastlines cannot wait. We need real commitment right now to map our coastlines and to tackle coastal erosion nationally. We need to agree on new coastal planning and building standards. We need a new Commonwealth fund for climate adaptation activities. Remedial and adaptive activities have been defunded under successive coalition governments since 2014.In Corangamite, during the election campaign, $1.5 million was committed at the last minute by this government to deal with restoration of coastal dunes and beach erosion from Queenscliff to Cape Otway. It will fund small projects, and Im sure it will be used wisely by the Corangamite Catchment Management Authority, which is responsible for the funds. But it wont even begin to implement the required engineering solutions for the erosion, which is now threatening to undermine the Great Ocean Road itself, as well as many other parts of our beautiful coastline.This year is the 100th anniversary of that great road, built by the returning soldiers and the unemployed after World War I. I call on the Morrison government to lead by example and invest in our coastline. I call on them to cooperate with all levels of government, researchers and other agencies to make sure that all of our nations icons are here for the next hundred years.","Climate Change: Coastal Erosion","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms COKER (Corangamite) ","(12:41):"
325,0,0,0,1,2,"Flint, Nicolle, MP",245550,"Boothby","LP","N/A",3950," My electorate of Boothby is home to one of South Australias best stretches of coastline, particularly in Adelaide. From North Glenelg to Marino, I am fortunate to represent such a beautiful part of the world and the dedicated volunteers who work tirelessly to maintain and care for our beaches, our native vegetation and our coastline.Coastal erosion is an issue in South Australia—thankfully not so much within my electorate—and we also have other challenges along our coasts, including pollution, particularly plastics, and the impacts of a changing climate. Weve seen the issue of coastal erosion most seriously in South Australia from Semaphore to West Beach, which is just outside my electorate. The beaches in the southern part of Adelaides coastline, from Glenelg to Kingston Park, are generally very stable because of successful beach management which has been undertaken by our local and state governments, who bear responsibility for this issue. An existing sand-pumping system along this part of the coast uses pumping stations and underground pipelines to transfer a slurry of sand and seawater from beaches where sand is building up to beaches where sand is eroding. The pipeline currently pumps approximately 100,000 cubic metres of sand successfully every year. As I said, responsibility for this policy issue and for this area falls to our local and state governments, and I would like to acknowledge the work of my local councils who take in the beach-side parts of my electorate—particularly the City of Holdfast Bay and the City of Marion—for their work to protect our local beaches, whether it is sand, sand dunes or our native vegetation.South Australias Marshall Liberal government has also committed to protecting our coastline, and I would particularly like to recognise and thank my state colleague Minister David Speirs, who is the Minister for Environment and Water and whose electorate falls mainly within my electorate of Boothby, for the wonderful work that he is doing in his environment portfolio. David is very passionate about looking after our natural environment, especially our coastline, which we share together. The Marshall Liberal government is investing $48.4 million in the metropolitan coastline over the next four years. This consists of $20 million for additional sand, including approximately 500,000 cubic metres of newly sourced sand. This investment also includes $28.4 million for the completion of a new sand-recycling pipeline from Semaphore to West Beach, similar to the one that operates between Glenelg and Kingston Park, as well as sand dune restoration and revegetation, in partnership with local councils and coastal community groups.The Morrison Liberal government is doing a range of things in the environmental area to look after our waters, our coastal waters and our oceans. Were restoring coastal environments. Were dealing with the problem of plastics and waste along our coastlines and in our oceans. Our Environment Restoration Fund totals $100 million and includes a $16 million investment in our rivers, waterways and coasts to help clean up these habitats and improve water quality.I feel I should pay tribute to my incredible local volunteers who do operate along the coastline, given that over the weekend it was the opening of the surf lifesaving season and these wonderful volunteers will be working very hard over the coming months to keep everyone safe on the beach. I would like to acknowledge President Georgina Cole, who looks after the Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club; President Warwick Holland, who looks after Somerton Surf Life Saving Club; President Chris Parsons of the Brighton Surf Life Saving Club; and Dr Glen Patten OAM of the Seacliff Surf Live Saving Club.It was also over the course of the weekend the season opening for my yacht clubs, and we had our very first female commodore, Lisa Brock, elected to the Brighton and Seacliff Yacht Club. I want to again congratulate Lisa, whom I saw on Saturday. It is also the 100th anniversary of the Brighton and Seacliff Yacht Club this year. I attended the Somerton Yacht Club opening day, and it was wonderful the see new Commodore Paul Townsend presiding over his first season opening. Finally, I will recognise David Bagshaw, who runs 5049 Coastal Community, who do so much wonderful environmental work around the Marino and Seacliff area.","Climate Change: Coastal Erosion","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms FLINT (Boothby—Government Whip) ","(12:46):"

That trip took on average about 10 hours, not the mention the psychological damage to my parents. These days the trip takes about 4½ hours, thanks to a vision and commitment by both sides of government since the 1970s. Similarly, the train trip from Kempsey on the Rattler would take 14 to 16 hours; thankfully, now on the XPT it takes approximately six to seven hours.From 1993 to 2012 I lived in various parts of Sydney before returning home to the mid-north coast. In 1993 Sydneys population was 3.7 million. By 2012 it had grown to 4.5 million. Just under two-thirds of New South Waless state population resides in Greater Sydney. The population growth accounted for 78 per cent of the states total growth. From personal experience, whether it was by public transport or private vehicle, it was not uncommon to travel up to and sometimes over two hours a day travelling to and from work. This equates to 20 days per year simply travelling—unproductive time that has had an effect on economic output but also an indirect impact on mental health, families and communities.According to a study held by the Australia Institute, commuting has negative impacts on at least three dimensions of Australian life: peoples psychological, emotional and physiological wellbeing; their relationships and interactions with their families, neighbourhoods, communities and work places; and the physical and social environment. These impacts are at the worst when commuting journeys are lengthy, unpredictable or congested. Lengthy and unpredictable commuting journeys take a toll on individuals both physically and emotionally.Employees whose journeys to and from work are longer show greater levels of bodily stress and perceived stress. Commuting strain is associated with feelings of nervousness, tension, pain and stiffness and with poorer performance and satisfaction at work.Commuters travelling by car in some Australian cities are travelling for longer periods than they did a decade ago. Australias roads are becoming more crowded. Commuters are becoming more stressed and they are increasingly likely to suffer road rage. Therefore this governments $100 billion infrastructure investment for critical road and rail projects aimed at busting congesting, better connecting our regions and improving safety on our roads should be commended. So too should its additional funding across urban and regional Australia, and in particular the additional $3 billion to the Urban Congestion Fund, so that $4 billion is now available through the fund to target pinch points in major cities to reduce congestion in urban areas. This includes $3 billion of additional funding committed in the 2019-20 budget, which will support upgrades to urban road networks to reduce congestion and ensure commuters get home sooner and safer by reducing travel times, reducing vehicle operating costs, delivering more reliable road networks for commuters and freight, and addressing local bottlenecks.Through the 2019-20 budget, the government has committed to over 30 additional major projects to address the needs of our regional areas and major cities. This includes $1 billion for the Princes Highway between Wollongong and Port Augusta, through Victoria; $400 million for the Newell Highway upgrades; $1.6 million for the M1 Pacific Motorway; and $1.5 million towards Raymond Terrace in New South Wales.On top of these significant commitments by the Morrison-McCormack government is a significant one to my electorate of Cowper in the form of the Coffs Harbour bypass—a commitment for the long-awaited bypass for the residents of Coffs Harbour—a 14-kilometre bypass, containing three tunnels and reduced road gradient, improving safety, reducing noise and returning the streets of Coffs Harbour back to its residents, whilst at the same time reducing commute time for tourists passing through and those travelling into town.It is not just the responsibility of the federal government to commit to congestion busting throughout urban and regional Australia; however, I note the significant contribution and commend them for doing so.","Infrastructure","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr CONAGHAN (Cowper) ","(12:52):"
329,0,0,0,1,2,"Payne, Alicia, MP",144732,"Canberra","ALP","N/A",3953," It is vital to bust congestion, most importantly because of the impact on our environment. The best way to do this and reduce our environmental impact is by investing in public transport. Aside from the lake and its towering jet of water, the iconic national institutions and the countless roundabouts, Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffins original plan for this beautiful city also included trams. Over 100 years later, the ACT Labor government has delivered on the Griffins vision. Stage 1 of the Canberra light rail has now been completed. Running 12 kilometres from Civic to Gungahlin, it has transformed how people get around our city.Canberra is getting bigger and, with a population of almost 400,000, that means more people getting to work, more people driving cars and more people relying on the public transport system in Canberra, which currently mainly comprises buses. The ACT government, under the leadership of Chief Minister Andrew Barr and transport minister Chris Steel, is planning for the future of Canberra and working to avoid the congestion issues of other capital cities before they escalate. Despite opposition from the old-school Canberra Liberals, the Barr Labor government persevered and, in less than four years from ground being broken, delivered to Canberra world-class light rail. This is quite staggering when you think about it, especially when compared to Sydneys and Newcastles light rail, which have both seen delays and cost overruns. I might also add that the ACT government has not been sued by the contractors tasked with building the system and instead was able to deliver the project $32 million under budget.Since it opened in April, over 3.1 million people have utilised the system, and journeys on the whole of the public transport network have increased by 8.5 per cent compared to the same period in 2018. Light-rail trips now make up 20 per cent of all public transport use in our city. The system is having a transformative impact on how people access our great city. More people are getting out of their cars and onto our trams and buses, reducing congestion and its impacts on the environment. Canberrans are jumping on board with light rail.Stage 2B is about to commence, extending the current line through City West to New Acton and terminating at Commonwealth Avenue Bridge. This section of the light rail will open up the west side of the city and improve access for major events, such as Floriade, which just finished up at the weekend. The ACT government is not finished. Stage 2B of the light rail, which will travel from Civic to Woden, will bring the network to the south and extend access to even more Canberrans. In the future, the light rail network will continue to expand, with lines to Belconnen, Tuggeranong and the airport.One of the most exciting aspects of stage 2 is the game-changing impact it will have on the Parliamentary Triangle. No longer will public servants be stuck in the morning traffic along Commonwealth Avenue. When stage 2 is delivered, perhaps members of this place will even opt for the light rail instead of COMCAR for their daily commute to represent their community. For tourists travelling to our national institutions, getting from the hotels in the city to Old Parliament House, the High Court and Questacon will become a far simpler exercise.On the member for Fordes motion, I too express concern about congestion in our cities. There is a need for government at every level to invest in congestion-busting infrastructure, particularly public transport, to improve the lives of our citizens and reduce our environmental impact. That is exactly what the ACT government is doing. The Morrison government failed to spend a dollar from the Urban Congestion Fund in 2019-20, but they did spend $11.6 million on taxpayer funded congestion-busting advertising in the lead-up to the election. Minister Tudge confirmed in September that not one Urban Congestion Fund project had commenced construction and promised that some would start by Christmas. Which ones? Where?I call on the federal government to join with the ACT government to push forward on stage 2B of light rail. The ACT needs the approval of this parliament to enable the light rail to travel through the Parliamentary Triangle. I call on the government to expedite approval of this project. It will bring congestion-busting infrastructure to Canberrans, it will stimulate the economy and it will improve the amenity of the Parliamentary Triangle for the many thousands of Australians and international visitors who visit each year. Our city is growing, and its vital we provide the infrastructure necessary to ensure that it does so in a sustainable way. As we move forward we must ensure that our urban centres operate as efficiently as possible, and congestion-busting light rail is one way we can accomplish it. At the May election, the federal Labor Party committed $200 million towards the funding of stage 2 of Canberra light rail, and I call on the government to match this commitment.","Infrastructure","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms PAYNE (Canberra) ","(12:57):"

As our cities grow and develop and our suburbs transform, our roads inevitably feel the toll of our growing population as the epidemic of congestion spreads across the country. Each moment that is spent in traffic at a traffic light or on a gridlocked highway is time spent away from our families, our jobs and the things that make us all happy and proud to live in this beautiful country. Congestion-busting infrastructure is not only an investment in improving our lives today but an investment in our future as a country.Constituents in my electorate of Higgins have spoken to me of the daily challenges they face with regard to congestion. Its a common topic for anyone who lives in Melbourne. The Morrison government has committed to a record $100 billion infrastructure investment program to help bust congestion across Australia. This includes a $3 billion Victorian congestion package. Im proud to say that locally, in my electorate of Higgins, there will be a $260 million investment to fund the removal of the Glenferrie Road level crossing at Kooyong station. In a 2013 VicRoads study, the Glenferrie Road level crossing in my electorate of Higgins was listed as one of the 20 high-priority level crossings to be removed. In the Victorian Auditor-Generals December 2017 report on managing the level crossing removal program, this crossing was noted to be one of the most dangerous and congested level crossings. It is the last one in Melbourne that has the dangerous mix of rail, road, pedestrians and trams at one crossing. Simply put, it is an accident waiting to happen. Despite recommendations by experts over many years, this level crossing has not been included in the Victorian state governments Level Crossing Removal Project. Im proud to have fought for the removal of this dangerous crossing and even prouder that the Morrison government has stepped up to help decongest a road that services tens of thousands of motorists across southern Melbourne each and every day. Weve also committed $10 million to a business plan to assess the removal of level crossings across the Glen Waverley Line, and that includes Kooyong station. Such lifestyle-changing projects are only made possible because of our governments strong economic management.However, in order to improve the flow of our cities and better the lives of all Australians, governments at every level need to invest in congestion-busting infrastructure to provide the best outcomes for our citizens. It is disappointing to see, time and again, that not all levels of government have made such projects a priority. Politics should play no part in working towards an improved way of life for all our constituents. I call on the state government to accept our federal funding with goodwill and to work with us for the best outcome for the people of Higgins and Victoria more broadly. When roads are congested the cost of transporting goods and the price for all employees to get to work increases. Congestion is not just a commuter frustration, its also an economic burden to our country.Australians deserve a pragmatic and strategic approach to ensure that the transport pressures on our roads are eased, and congestion busting is just one of those. Since coming to government, the Morrison government has committed more than $27 billion to support transport infrastructure projects in my state of Victoria alone. We have led the way in Victoria by putting funding on the table to kickstart key public transport projects like the Melbourne Airport Rail Link; the fast rail between Melbourne and Geelong; Monash Rail; and numerous level crossings. The Morrison government has made a promise to Australians to get people home sooner and safer, and that is what were doing. Thats why I rise to support this motion on congestion-busting infrastructure made by the member for Forde.","Infrastructure","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALLEN (Higgins) ","(13:02):"
331,0,0,0,1,2,"Mitchell, Rob, MP","M3E","McEwen","ALP","N/A",3955," As a Victorian, I have to say that its a pleasant surprise to hear the government talking about infrastructure! I say surprise because, like so much of this governments agenda, infrastructure investment has been completely missing in action. What else can explain why Victoria, which constitutes 25 per cent of the population, has received only about seven per cent of federal infrastructure funding under the Abbott-Turnbull and now Morrison governments? Weve seen them announce $1 billion of funding but not seen one cent spent, because the government is all talk and no action.The member for Forde may not be aware of this, but we Victorians know all too well that our growing communities are feeling the burden of blown-out commuter times and the lack of federal government investment in infrastructure. It only makes us less productive as workers as we spend more hours on the road, making it harder to come home and spend time with our families and participate in community life.The government has been starving our communities of the funds we desperately need to address the massive growth of our population and the impacts on our economy and quality of life. This is the reality of what weve had to deal with over the past six years. Areas of regional Victoria, like my electorate of McEwen, are bursting at the seams with thousands of new residents escaping unaffordable city house prices and searching for a better place for their families to grow and thrive in. But instead of being met with the infrastructure they should rightly expect in new and emerging suburbs and towns, they are met with congested roads and shockingly absent federal investment in transport infrastructure. That should, and must, change.I welcome the idea that the key to successfully addressing this congestion is an all-of-the-above approach, with, most importantly, all levels of government actually committing the funds to make it happen. I must say, though, that were left scratching our heads about why this very sensible idea doesnt seem to translate into policy or commitments from the Morrison government. Take the vital project at the Wallan diamond interchange in the seat of McEwen, for example. Its a perfect example of government doublespeak. At the 2019 election, Labor committed to provide the funds needed to get this project over the line. It is a key priority for the Mitchell shire, VicRoads and the wider community. It sounds exactly like the sort of project that this motion is about, doesnt it? So why has the Morrison government refused to invest in this project or, for that matter, any other projects associated with addressing the needs of our region? The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development needs to answer those questions. Even my Liberal opponent at the last election agreed with Labors position, but after the election had passed, unfortunately. What are we hearing now? Were hearing whispers that this government is thinking about ripping money from the Hume Highway and Calder Highway upgrades—projects that had bipartisan support before the election—ripping that money away from the major backbone of transport, freight and commuter movement in Victoria and the eastern states and rehashing it as part of their city deals, yet again leaving Victorians worse off.What I would really like to see from the government, rather than self-congratulation and the headline figures, is for them to actually deliver proper infrastructure for our communities. Deliver the Wallan diamond interchange; deliver the Watson Street upgrade and the works that need to be done on the Northern Highway; and deliver the extra lanes needed on the Hume and Calder freeways. These projects are vital. Why? Because traffic is banked up along the Hume Freeway, causing massive commuter headaches and, much more importantly, presenting major safety hazards for all road users. Very few drivers motoring down the freeway would expect a traffic jam that stretches for kilometres, but that is what happens on this stretch of the Hume Freeway every day. Clearly, when youre getting traffic jams on a freeway, something has gone dramatically wrong. This is the sort of problem that not only costs us time and money but is likely to cost lives.So while its very good to pat yourselves on the back for a new buzz phrase, how about you actually commit the actions to match those words? Its not just a political debate. The toing and froing in the battle of ideas is deadly serious. With critical lack of federal investment in Victorias roads our death toll has risen. Im sure that the few sensible members on the government benches would agree that the number were seeing is too high and that we should do everything to bring it down. Thats why government support for this critical $50 million diamond interchange and $90 million dollar investment in the Northern Highway and Watson Street would be so important for communities.So I say again to the government: dont scrap the money from the Hume Highway and rob Peter to pay Paul; invest in both projects. The time is now to act on congestion-busting infrastructure. Lets hope that it results in shovels in the ground, not buzz words and rehashing of current funding arrangements.","Infrastructure","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr ROB MITCHELL (McEwen—Second Deputy Speaker) ","(13:06):"

When you think about the $100 billion of committed projects that we are funding and financing, you understand that the Morrison government has got every Australians back. We know that as part of building the strength of this great nation we need the roads, the rail and all the social and support infrastructure for people to be able to live happy and successful lives. Under the minister we have a very clear plan to make sure that, no matter where you are in the country, we are providing the infrastructure that you need.This was a critical issue and a critical test at the last federal election. If you look at the great state of Victoria, the coalition government was promising to build major pieces of infrastructure of national importance like the East West Link. The East West Link is a plan that we have put forward at election after election, and very every time that we have put it forward the people have voted for it, particularly in the electorates along that corridor. They vote Liberal for a reason. They know that only we understand the importance of the East West Link to their communities to get the freight trucks off suburban streets, to connect to the ports and to build the strength and prosperity of our economy.What do Labor do every time? They oppose it. They block it. At the state level, the Andrews government even went so far as to hit the hip pockets of millions of Victorians by handing over their hard earned tax dollars and giving it to a private company to not build a road. It was perhaps the most despicable and disgraceful behaviour from a state government that one could ever see. People understand that projects are critical. Victorians have been sold out by the Andrews Labor government. And there has been not one peep of criticism from the Labor members in this place, because in the end they agree with him. In a choice between backing Victorians or backing their Labor mates, they always choose Labor mates and dont stand up for the people that theyre elected to represent. In particular, the conspicuous silence of Labor senators from the great state of Victoria should be condemned.By comparison, the coalition government has made a clear commitment to invest in communities to build the strength of our country. At the last election we went to the people of Goldstein and said, We understand the challenges of an established community in making sure that we reduce the congestion that you experience on your streets. We understand the importance of people having transport options so they can go about living their lives. Do you know what promise the Labor Party made in return? Nothing. Nada. Zip. Zilch. They had nothing to say to the people of Goldstein about the concerns and the issues those people face on a daily basis.But what did we do? We turned around and gave a series of commitments, which we are now honouring, around investing in new parking spaces at local railway stations so that people who want to catch a train can do so. They can get there; theyre able to park throughout the day and theyre able to get home. Were providing mass commuter options for an established community: 97 new parking spaces at Sandringham station, with an investment of $3.1 million; 136 new car-parking spaces at Brighton Beach, with an investment of $4.3 million; 84 new parking spaces at North Brighton station, with an investment of $2.66 million; 130 new parking spaces at Hampton station, with an investment of $4 million. Working with the City of Bayside, we are giving them the grants and funding for the projects that theyve come to us about and said, This is what our community needs. We have heard them and we are responding.The same is true in the City of Glen Eira, with 203 new parking spaces at Elsternwick station for $6.4 million and 143 new parking spaces at Bentleigh station for $4 million. On each proposal and each project, were working with the councils. And what is the biggest barrier theyre facing to delivering this important congestion-busting infrastructure? The state Labor government, which has never seen a project funded by Canberra to support a local community that it doesnt like, that it doesnt want to block and that it doesnt want to undermine because somehow it might provide a pathway to improve the lives of Victorians.

They are late home after being crammed, at the start of the day, on trains that go from Western Sydney into the city, and they will stand for extended periods of time, crammed like sardines on that rail line.And what is the solution? What has been the thinking of the state government or the federal government to alleviate that type of problem? When the federal government eventually got round to asking state governments, Tell us what your projects are, the state government nominated two projects: (1) the $20 billion Sydney Metro West project from the CBD to Parramatta and (2) the rail line from St Marys to the airport, which will also cost an incredible amount of money—probably around $10 billion—on top of that. But there is nothing, absolutely nothing, about federal and state governments working on investing on the western expressway or getting rid of congestion on that rail line by opening it up.Previous Labor governments have suggested that by making some investment in that T1 line, opening up corridors there, you could actually free up transport or train travel for people going into the city. At that point in time it didnt cost $20 billion or $10 billion—it wasnt even $1 billion; at that point in time it would cost $500 million to invest in freeing up congested rail lines for Western Sydney residents, particularly those travelling from Penrith, through Mount Druitt, through Blacktown and on into the city. It was going to cost $500 million to create the western expressway. Weve seen nothing about that. In fact, all we have seen is this focus on the Sydney Metro West. While I get that some people will champion that, that will not alleviate the travel time and the congestion that are being experienced by people from electorates like the one I represent who are travelling from Penrith through to Parramatta.If people dont want to use a rail line and want to use a roadway, theyll have to fork out. Ive estimated that people who use tollways to travel from my part of Western Sydney through to the city, if theyre travelling by road every single day, will pay on average $9,000 a year, just to get to the city, because theyre using tolls. Sydney is the most tolled city in the country. Every time you put an announcement or an idea forward for another motorway in Sydney, its got to have a toll fixture on it. Most people in Western Sydney are tolled to their back teeth and they cannot afford another one.The next big motorway that should be built is the M9, running parallel to the M7, but theres no planning on that. Why? Because the state government is more concerned about the politics of how it has upset its own voters in north-western Sydney as opposed to thinking longer term about whats needed to improve travel in Western Sydney. If you are driving from Mount Druitt to Parramatta in the morning and you go on to Google Maps, youll just see a red line—congestion. Its estimated there is an extra 30 minutes on top of travel time from Mount Druitt to Parramatta because theres been no investment in the roadway. When there was investment, as part of WestConnex, the coalition put tolls back on that road, which had been paid off. So now people try to get off at Parramatta to avoid paying the toll, and this creates a massive congestion headache.We need serious, long-term investment being made to move people either on roads or on rail or on buses. We arent going to get it with advertising campaigns or political spin. It takes the hard yards—the financing and the thinking about whats required to make life easier for people in Western Sydney.","Infrastructure","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr HUSIC (Chifley) ","(13:17):"
334,0,0,0,1,2,"Pitt, Keith, MP",148150,"Hinkler","LNP","N/A",3959," Weve heard a lot about congestion and roads and cities. I note the member for McEwens contribution, about how people are moving out of the cities and into cheaper regional areas. Hear, hear to that! I know that for you, Mr Deputy Speaker Rick Wilson—and for the member for Barker, who is here in the chamber as well—and me its really not about the train where we have to wait half an hour to get a connection back to our suburb. We simply dont have the train. We dont have those connections. Its not about congestion; its about connection. What are we doing in regional areas to continue to connect our communities, to ensure that they have the opportunities that others, in the cities, may well have?In my area, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, weve committed $173 million to the Hinkler Regional Deal, the majority of which is delivered into critical and connecting infrastructure, things that help to grow our economy, connect our local communities and ensure that people in our communities have an opportunity to escape from where they live in times of inclement weather, whether that is cyclone, flood or fire. We need to ensure that those connections are there. One thing that is incredibly important is the flood-proofing of the Torbanlea to Pialba connecting road. This road links the city of Hervey Bay back to the Bruce Highway. With the other link, which runs up to Maryborough, quite simply it is technically unfeasible to make it flood-proof. This is the opportunity. As part of the regional deal, weve committed $24 million, and, in some sort of miracle, the Queensland Labor government have committed their 20 per cent, which was a great surprise to me. In fact, I think it might have been a surprise to some of their ministers that it was on the approved list. They werent quite aware. That is a $30 million road upgrade which will ensure that we can connect the people of Hervey Bay to the Bruce Highway in times of difficult and inclement weather.Were also committing money to the redevelopment of the Hervey Bay CBD. Whats that about? Hervey Bay is, quite simply, a group of seaside villages that grew into a seaside town and then a seaside city. They dont actually have what they consider to be a town centre. I congratulate the Fraser Coast Regional Council on their vision in establishing one in the city of Hervey Bay. To assist in that, we have committed $40 million from the Hinkler Regional Deal to help council achieve that aim. I think that is incredibly important.We need to look back not just at congestion busting but connection—connecting those infrastructure pieces that are critical to our people. As I said earlier, the member for McEwen is on our side: he wants people moving into the regions. But what are the critical elements to ensure that we can provide for people that want to move to our areas? The first one is jobs. As Ive said many times in this place, the unemployment rate in my electorate had been, quite simply, unacceptable. It had a 9 in front of it. In the last 12 months, it has now reached the point where it has a 7 in front of it, a substantial improvement. Thats happened through a range of issues, most importantly through this governments investment into the regions through funds like the Regional Jobs and Investment program and the Regional Growth Fund—very substantial injections of cash not only into local governments and councils but also, in some cases, into businesses, which have expanded and created jobs and provided opportunity. Every single time we provide a permanent job in our region, the flow-through effect helps everyone in our community, and that includes our schools, our volunteer organisations and our rural fire services. It ensures that we have teaching staff and facilities.As Im sure you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, we need to continue to drive jobs into regional areas. We simply cant sustain the type of growth that weve seen in some locations, predominantly, I have to say, from immigration. We know that in 2017 some 170,000 individuals chose to make Australia their home, and I say, Good on you. But those 170,000 individuals moved into the east coast cities of Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney in just 12 months. I think there are opportunities in regional Australia for them and for us. So I think we need to ensure that we continue to provide those opportunities where we can for long-term jobs, to drive prosperity in our regional economies.As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, right now there is nothing more important than water and water infrastructure. We cant provide a solution to the current drought. It is well established. But we can ensure that there is a reliable water supply which is available for a much longer period of time if we simply commit to that infrastructure. Right now, we have a Queensland Labor government that is, would you believe, knocking down the dam wall at the Paradise Dam. They are going to take five metres off the Paradise wall—that is, 85,000 megalitres of storage—for an unspecified and yet to be stated safety issue. If there is a safety issue for our community, the Queensland Labor government should tell them what it is. What action do you plan to take? When will it be done? And give us back our water, because water is wealth.","Infrastructure","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PITT (Hinkler) ","(13:22):"
335,0,0,0,1,2,"Mitchell, Brian, MP",129164,"Lyons","ALP","N/A",3961," Im sure the previous member would like to pass on his thanks to the Premier of Queensland, Premier Palaszczuk, for helping him get that unemployment rate down in Queensland from a 9 to a 7. I thank the member for Forde for the opportunity to speak on this motion, because I agree with him that congestion is a problem across both urban and regional Australia. Its a problem thats grown worse under six years of Liberal-National government because of a chronic, ongoing failure to invest in infrastructure. Those opposite seem to have come late to the party. Theyve underinvested in national infrastructure. Now theyve woken up to growing congestion and thought perhaps they ought to do something about it.Of course, Labor were dealing with it when last in government. We were more interested in practical solutions than in developing buzzwords, so we didnt attach the groovy name of congestion busting to everything we did, but we did build and invest in roads, we did build and invest in rail, and we did build and invest in ports and in airstrips. Labors approach to infrastructure investment was stable and consistent—perhaps boring even. But it was dependable. Indeed, when now opposition leader Mr Albanese was infrastructure minister in the previous Labor government, he was so highly regarded by the sector he was named Infrastructure Minister of the Year. Under the member for Grayndler, infrastructure investment in this country was targeted not at pork-barrelling or shoring up marginal seats but at areas of need, guided by independent expert advice. We built stuff where experts said it needed to go. States and territories were properly consulted. Local governments were listened to. When Labor left office in 2013, a healthy pipeline of infrastructure projects was bequeathed to those opposite. Unfortunately, for six long years of laziness and incompetence, the Liberals and Nationals have allowed the pipeline to rust away.We often hear those opposite bang the drum about their so-called $100 billion infrastructure pipeline. A cursory examination of the budget papers shows less than one-third of it is allocated to the next four years. Thats $70 billion on the never-never. Its a pipedream of a pipeline. And theres an old saying, Dont listen to what people say; look at what they do. What this government has done is chronically underinvest in infrastructure.Since 2014 this government has failed to meet even its own infrastructure commitments. A $5 billion underspend on transport projects over five budgets tells us all we need to know about the priority that those opposite have placed on congestion busting. What did they do with the Building Australia Fund, a reserve fund set aside specifically to provide stable, consistent revenue for national infrastructure? They killed it. It must come as cold comfort to those millions of Australians stuck in peak-hour gridlock on their way to and from work that this government has now apparently woken up and recognised the importance of infrastructure. Theyve at least recognised the political importance of being seen to talk about it. However, $5 billion of underspend demonstrates they are yet to learn the importance of actually doing the work.A recent report from Infrastructure Australia—Urban transport, crowding and congestion—found that by 2031 drivers will spend 60 per cent of their commute stuck in congestion. The latest Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey found that over the past decade the average commute rose from 3.7 hours to 4.5 hours. One in six Australians spends more than two hours going to and from work every day. Its insanity! Its a waste of human capital and its robbing Australian workers of time with their family.The Royal Automobile Club of Tasmania estimates that Hobart traffic congestion costs taxpayers $100 million a year—and thats today. Hobarts projected to have another 100,000 residents by 2050. Hobart has the highest percentage of vehicle use in Australia. Its the nations fourth most congested city, and only six per cent of our commuters use public transport.The state government and the federal government have failed Tasmania on infrastructure. Labor went to the last election with a billion dollars of infrastructure for our state. It would have been a great achievement under Labor. Sadly, the Liberals were elected and they are failing infrastructure in Tasmania. Theyre failing Tasmanian commuters—we are one of the most congested places in the country—and its a crying shame. This government needs to do better.","Infrastructure","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[2]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) ","(13:27):"

338,0,0,0,1,2,"Wilkie, Andrew, MP","C2T","Clark","IND","N/A",3962," Theres no doubt that the unrestrained conversion of Hobart homes into short-stay accommodation, like Airbnb, is contributing directly to our housing crisis. Indeed, The Mercury newspaperrevealed just today that Airbnb has 5,500 Tasmanian listings, including a remarkable 1,300 in Hobart. This wont surprise the many people who are couch surfing or who are sleeping in cars or on the streets and who feel theyre going nowhere on the public housing waiting list. It wont surprise people who are trying to rent and who join the queue at a rare open home, knowing that they have a snowflakes chance in hell. Quite recently, Ive been contacted by a family who are scared they would become homeless—even though both adults work—because their lease was not going to be renewed and they couldnt find anywhere else to live. Ive also heard from a woman with cancer who is couch surfing while she waits for suitable public housing, and a grandmother doing her best to accommodate her son and grandson because they can no longer afford their rent. Its no wonder Hobart has the lowest vacancy rate of any capital city. Part of the problem is the Tasmanian governments hands-off approach to Airbnb. What it really should be doing instead is returning Airbnb to its original model, where locals could make some extra money from spare rooms and granny flats. That way, tourists could enjoy an authentic experience, without Tasmanians being squeezed out of their own communities.","Housing","STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[3]/subdebate.1[1]/speech/talk.text/body/p","Mr WILKIE (Clark) ","(16:00):"

I would like to put on the record my congratulations to the organisers, the vice-president of the Sutherland Shire Orchid Society and event chairman, Frank Daniel, and the president of the Sutherland Shire Orchid Society, Jan Robinson, for organising such a highly successful event. Over the three days the event attracted around 2,300 people, making it the premier orchid show in New South Wales. I also congratulate the many exhibitors that took so much time and effort in creating such wonderful displays. I know that transporting your stock in, setting it up and planting it is a lot of work. I would also like to congratulate the many vendors who turned up. I understand they also had a very successful show. Many of them sold out. When I was there I met Phil Thompson, a vendor that had come all the way from Townsville, in the member for Herberts electorate. He had brought all his stock down, and Im sure he had a very successful show.When you look at the orchids, its easy to see how people become addicted to collecting them. They are grown in the wild and propagated around the world, and their beauty is something to be seen.

They arent just annoying; they are relentless, they are an assault and they are an invasion of privacy. If they are successful, scams are very damaging and very costly. Australians are frustrated that more progress has not been made by this government to stop the scammers. There is no magic solution, but there must be a greater sense of urgency to stop the scammers than shown by this government.Around the world governments are trying out different systems and technologies to stop the scammers. The United Kingdom has introduced a free service combining network intelligence and user feedback to prevent calls from numbers on a scam blacklist getting through. Two million households signed up in the first three months, and nuisance calls are down 65 per cent. The United Kingdom has also tried handset technology to help the most vulnerable. In New Zealand the telecommunications industry has established a scam prevention code. The US is implementing technical standards to verify caller ID integrity. In that country, stopping scam calls is one of their top priorities. But what is the Australian government doing?We are still waiting on a report from the Australian Communications and Media Authority as part of the Scam Technology Project it has led since 2017. This report must be delivered, two years after it was initiated. It must lay out a plan that is capable of delivering real protections and noticeable improvements.

In my home city, we were trying to build a road. The federal government funded the first road in 10 years and we built 1.2 kilometres for $27 million. So the Labor Party, pressed into action, came up with marking down the distance of the road—800 metres of road—for 50 per cent more at $37 million. Thats for 50 per cent less road. Where is this money going? We want to know whose pockets its disappearing into. Its an absolutely reasonable question.The Master Builders have lifted the lid on the ACT, but I want to lift the lid on Queensland. Its little better there.

While this happened a few weeks ago, it was an act of great kindness and practicality that requires recognition here in the Australian parliament.As we heard in question time today, the town of Stanthorpe in Queensland is in dire straits. Its actually in the electorate of the minister for water resources, the member for Maranoa. The dams are dry, theres been very little rain and, to top it off, the town was surrounded by raging fires last month. Troubled by the effect the drought is having on many Queenslanders, a number of local Muslim organisations, including Muslim Aid Australia, the Muslim Charitable Foundation, the Islamic Council of Queensland and the Islamic College of Brisbane, decided to do something practical about it—not just prayer but practical. They fundraised throughout the community until they raised over $100,000—theyre mainly from my electorate or around it. With that, they bought drinkable water for the people of Stanthorpe.Stanthorpe is three hours from my electorate office in Sunnybank, so the Deen family, a well-known family in Brisbane—well-known Liberal supporters, actually, but great people—came on board with 10 semitrailers and helped dispatch around 200,000 litres of water to Stanthorpe. The water was targeted to those affected by severe water shortages and distributed by Granite Belt Drought Assist.But this isnt a one-off. In the past these charity groups have donated three truckloads of hay to farmers as well as food hampers.

Sophie and I have spoken today about what practical steps can be taken to increase the number of women in this place and, more broadly, at higher levels in workplaces across Australia, and she is concerned about the use of quotas to increase representation.Sophie and I discussed the importance of equal opportunity and merit based selection, rather than using two different standards for evaluating men and women. Sophie believes that employers should use the same standards. As a young woman in her final year of school, Sophie believes quotas drive a greater divide between male and female candidates instead of promoting equality. This can also be applied to other areas, including education. We discussed a decision by the University of Technology Sydney to apply different ATAR requirements for men and women candidates. In Sophies words, through equal opportunities and merit we are capable of achieving just as much as men.Thank you to Sophie for joining my team today and for her passion for politics.

Women, of course, continue to be underrepresented in our parliament. Only 31 per cent of all parliamentary seats are filled by women. We have responded to this by setting targets, and, because we have set targets, in the lower house weve seen an increase in female representation from 11 per cent in 1993 to 41 per cent in 2019. Sadly, in contrast, the Liberal Party representation is still at only 21 per cent in the lower house.

The theme for this year is Girlforce: unscripted and unstoppable, celebrating the achievements we have made since the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.I remember as a teenager in 1995 listening to Hillary Rodham Clintons speech in Beijing, where she declared human rights are womens rights and womens rights are human rights. It was a message that carried and resonated with women and girls across the world. The Beijing declaration provided a framework to advance and measure the rights of women and girls globally. It called for women to be able to realise all of their human rights and to be able to live without violence, to be able to attend school and complete education, to earn equal pay for work and to be able to choose when and where they marry. Almost 25 years later, we do have progress to celebrate. We are seeing more girls attending and completing school, fewer girls being forced into marriage and more girls speaking out and leading movements for change across the world. Figures from UNICEF show that in the past decade the proportion of girls married as children has decreased by 15 per cent. From 2000 to 2016, the number of girls out of school at a primary level fell from 58 million to 34 million. Young girls today can look around them and see other girls who are unstoppable as powerful agents of change—girls such Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, who has fought for girls education, and Greta Thunberg, who has inspired a global movement for climate change action.The number of women elected to this place has been increasing and we are inching closer to equal representation. We have more women than ever before as representatives here in this parliament. To mark International Day of the Girl Child, many of us have had girls or young women shadowing us as part of the Girls Takeover Parliament program. I really hope that this experience helps these young women to see a door open for them to be a voice in parliament. I also hope that it holds all of us already here to account, to remember that we have to speak up on their behalf.Also marking this important day, Plan International have released their latest research report, She has a plan: the unique power of girls to lead change, in which almost 1,500 girls and young women from around Australia shared their hopes, dreams and concerns for the future, along with the people who inspire them. The Plan International report found that, overwhelmingly, girls and young women are eager to lead change on the social issues facing their generation. In fact, a whopping 91 per cent of those surveyed expressed exactly this. These girls and young women look up to fierce, determined and unapologetic female leaders for their inspiration, and I am so pleased to hear this.A division having been called in the House of Representatives—Sitting suspended from 16 : 50 to 17 : 05","International Day of the Girl Child","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms THWAITES (Jagajaga) ","(16:47):"

Importantly, they often cite their mothers as a main source of support in their lives—a responsibility that, as the mother of a very young daughter, Im very conscious of and very privileged to hold. Of course we are not there yet, and our government must do its part in making sure all young women can reach their full potential and live out their dreams and hopes for the future.Too many girls still face barriers such as violence and sexism and are prevented from gaining an education. Education does bring power and it does bring change. Some estimates show that, for every year of secondary schooling a girl receives, her earning ability is boosted by as much as 25 per cent. Thats why it is particularly concerning that Australias foreign aid budget for education decreased from almost $800 million in 2014-15 to just over $600 million in 2019-20.Girl force truly is unstoppable, but we all have a responsibility to be active in recognising and addressing the systemic disadvantage and discrimination against girls in Australia and globally.

378,0,0,0,1,2,"Allen, Katrina, MP",282986,"Higgins","LP","N/A",3977," Last week, 11 October marked the International Day of the Girl Child, a day to highlight and address the unique needs and challenges that girls face around the world. I take this opportunity to acknowledge all of the women sitting in this room, who were once girls themselves, and all those girls of now and the future who may be watching this speech, including my own two daughters.We can rightly take pride in the milestones achieved for girls all around the world to date. We can celebrate the fact that, in the 25 years since the Beijing World Conference on Women, more girls today are attending and completing school and fewer are getting married or becoming mothers while still children. We can celebrate the fact that girls are breaking boundaries and stereotypes across all walks of life all around the world by translating their dreams to reality.Most importantly, we can celebrate the fact that girls are creating a world that is relevant for them and for future generations. However, these milestones are hardly representative of the lived experiences of all girls in our world. In fact, the reality is that every 10 minutes an adolescent girl dies as a result of violence. In humanitarian emergencies, gender based violence often increases, and such perpetration occurs when male caregivers subject girls to sexual and physical violence, child marriage, exploitation and trafficking.I visited our nearest neighbour, PNG, earlier this year. This visit reinforced the stark differences that remain across the experiences of girls, and indeed boys, in even our closest neighbouring countries and that we cannot take for granted the enormous strides we have made here in Australia. In PNG the prevalence of intergenerational abuse, and especially gender based and sexual violence, completely shocked me. Over two-thirds of women had experienced forms of physical and sexual violence in their lifetime—thats two-thirds. Over 50 per cent of the sexual violence cases reported to clinics were against children. Shockingly, 41 per cent of men had admitted to perpetrating rape. This form of inequality is simply unacceptable and cannot continue. This is a critical time for the girls of our world, a time for collective responsibility—especially so in light of the warm winds of change occurring globally with respect to their rights and opportunities.The Morrison government is serious about ensuring an equitable future in providing opportunities for women and girls. Our priority in this area begins with our regional Indonesia-Pacific efforts directed in empowering girls and women. As the former Minister for Women Kelly ODwyer emphasised, our ability to seriously tackle these issues depends on a shared commitment to gender equality and womens participation in this space.Currently, many of the disadvantages faced by women and girls in our neighbouring countries are entrenched via poverty and amplified by the effects of natural disaster and war. We can take the first step in minimising the resulting conflict and instability by involving women as negotiators, as first responders and as leaders at the decision-making table. Im proud of our governments investment in local programs in PNG aiming to reduce domestic violence and to improve education for girls. A key priority of our government is to help women, both here and overseas, to improve their independent economic security. We know that when women do well their families do well, and that our economy and nation prosper.In November last year, the first-ever Womens Economic Security Statement was delivered, with more than $100 million dedicated to practical measures to help give women greater life choices, to build financial security and to grow the Australian economy. Additionally, the coalition government has invested the single-largest-ever Commonwealth funding of $328 million in prevention and frontline services to support the fourth action plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children.There is of course always more that can be, and should be, done. I want my daughters and the girls of both today and tomorrow to grow up in a world full of hope and opportunity. We must continue, as a government and as a nation, to provide pragmatic policies and solutions to ensure that every Australian girl has the opportunity to live her life free from discrimination and to achieve her potential. That is why I stand in support of this motion by the member for Jagajaga.","International Day of the Girl Child","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr ALLEN (Higgins) ","(17:07):"
379,0,0,0,1,2,"Ryan, Joanne, MP",249224,"Lalor","ALP","N/A",3978," I rise today, a privileged girl cum woman from a First World country—an MP from Melbournes west who has seen her first female Prime Minister in this country. She was from a party that lives affirmative action, with 48 per cent female representation in our federal parliament as we stand here today. I stand to mark the International Day of the Girl Child, and I do so with my 2019 Labor colleagues. I thank the member for Jagajaga and Im pleased to second the motion.Like all Australian children, Im lucky to have been born in a country with compulsory education; a country where females make up 51 per cent of tertiary students. But this is not the story around the world. On the International Day of the Girl Child, it is important that we look at what we can do globally to improve the lives of girls and women around the globe—and that begins with education.We know that more than 130 million girls between the ages of six and 17 are not attending school, and that 15 million girls of primary school age—half of them in sub-Saharan Africa—will never enter a classroom. We know that violence negatively impacts access to education and a safe environment for learning for girls. We know that more than 41,000 girls under the age of 18 marry every day. Child brides are much more likely to drop out of school, and this affects the education and health of themselves and their children, as well as their ability to earn a living. We know that every day girls face barriers to education caused by poverty, cultural norms and practices, poor infrastructure, violence and fragility.The world is now talking about the need for education for girls and the transformative power education provides. I want to remind the members in this place that it is our duty not just to continue the work in our own forums but to influence and support the work in developing nations. Lets speed up this journey in developing countries; the best way to do that is through education. The answer is ensuring access to classrooms in communities across the globe. As our own former Prime Minister Gillard, board chair of the Global Partnerships for Education, has said:If you want to change a nation, to change our planet, educate a girl.I draw the Houses attention to the work of contemporary women who champion gender equality and who are making considerable contributions to national and international debates about gender equality.I commend our own historian—our very own history chick—Clare Wright, author of Beyond the Ladies Lounge, The Forgotten Rebels of Eureka and You Daughters of Freedom. In her work, Clare researches, celebrates and populates our history with the women missing from that history. She outlines for us how women were publicans across Melbourne and Victoria in the earliest settlements in our country. She outlines the women involved in our seminal historic moment: the rebellion at Eureka. And, in You Daughters of Freedom, she outlines the history of our suffragettes, the suffragist movement, and how our Australian women were leaders internationally in ensuring that women got the vote.I also commend the work of Caroline Criado-Perez. Her groundbreaking book Invisible Women describes a female-shaped absent presence that is the gender data gap. Her research is prompting new conversations about how data bereft of representation from half the population is driving decisions in health, education, infrastructure, and, in fact, every facet of modern life. And it cannot do so without taking into consideration the 50 per cent of the population which today is so very pleasingly represented in this chamber.I commend to the House the contemporary women leading work in gender equity. I count among them our own Julia Gillard, who is working tirelessly for womens representation and leadership for women as well as girls education. I call upon members of this House to commit to a restoration of our aid budget so that we can assist in funding, planning and building systems to ensure that the basic human right to an education becomes a reality for girls in every community in every country across our globe.","International Day of the Girl Child","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms RYAN (Lalor—Opposition Whip) ","(17:12):"
380,0,0,0,1,2,"Martin, Fiona, MP",282982,"Reid","LP","N/A",3980," On 11 October, we marked the International Day of the Girl Child. It is a day to advocate for girls and young women around the world, particularly in regard to access to education, medical care, legal rights, and protection from discrimination and gender based violence. In 2019, the theme for the day is Girlforce: Unscripted and Unstoppable, celebrating significant progress in the rights of women and girls since the United Nations Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action was adopted almost 25 years ago. This visionary blueprint has allowed for global and local mobilisation for the rights of girls and young women. As a result, more girls have access to education and reproductive health rights, and there are fewer child marriages.While this progress is a great cause for celebration, girls across the globe are unfortunately still facing significant disadvantages. In developing countries, girls are often denied basic rights as a result of sex and gender based discrimination. The International Day of the Girl Child aims to draw attention to preventing child marriage. It is estimated by World Vision that 700 million women are married before they are adults and one-third of those are married before the age of 15. The experience of child marriage is often linked with domestic and sexual abuse and often leads to girls becoming mothers while still children.One of the key ways to address such inequality is through education. However, 130 million girls around the world have never even set foot in a classroom. Of these, 15 million young women will never learn to read or write. Many girls will never complete their education or are more likely to drop out of school than their male counterparts. Again, this is often due to sex and gender based discrimination which is prevalent across many cultures and countries. Education is crucial to breaking this intergenerational cycle of inequality as it offers the possibility of employment and financial independence. Girls who have received secondary schooling are six times less likely to become child brides, and educated mothers are twice as likely to send their children to school. While girls in Australia enjoy many freedoms that have been hard fought for, we still have to encourage girls to combat the social challenges they face in our society.The Morrison government has made the largest-ever Commonwealth investment of $328 million for combatting violence against women and children. It is why our government is legislating for tougher sentences for child-sex offenders. All children should be safe online and offline, and we need to address the ways that girls can be vulnerable to violence and sexual exploitation.Another area I am passionate about is the role that sport can play in the lives of young girls. This is an arena where girls and young women continue to exceed the expectations of all Australians, and we are so proud of the strides being made by girls across all levels of sport. The coalition has provided $150 million to support the development of female change-room facilities at sporting grounds and community swimming facilities across Australia. My electorate of Reid has been fortunate to have a number of sporting amenity upgrades so that the increasing number of girls playing sport can be provided for. And, of course, girls are increasingly proving to be valuable leaders in all aspects of Australian life. As a mother of two daughters, I hope that their desire to lead with conviction on matters that they are passionate about is never curbed by gender and sex based stereotypes.We know that young girls can be incredible forces of dynamic empowerment. Around the world, adolescent girls are leading movements for change. As a government, we will continue to support their efforts, whether it is through our international commitments or through supporting the grassroots work of girls in our own communities.","International Day of the Girl Child","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr MARTIN (Reid) ","(17:16):"
381,0,0,0,1,2,"Murphy, Peta, MP",133646,"Dunkley","ALP","N/A",3981," I rise today to speak in support of a motion acknowledging the International Day of the Girl Child. Im very proud to do so to support my friend and colleague the member for Jagajaga and the seconder, the member for Lalor, because Im part of a party that is absolutely committed to gender equality. I am extremely proud to be standing here today as the first woman to represent an electorate named after Louisa Dunkley, a pioneering unionist and feminist who, at the turn of the last century, not only led a successful campaign for an equal pay for women provision in the Commonwealth Public Service Act but was known to be one of the leading forces internationally for feminism and for equality within the union movement and the suffragette movement.It is somewhat surprising, then, that its taken so long for a woman to represent the electorate named after Louisa Dunkley, but I can tell this House that people in my community are very proud to live in an electorate named after a woman who fought for equality for everyone, because, as she said, equal pay is not just about the equality for the women who work day by day, side by side with the men. Its also about properly valuing the work that both men and women do, and that is something that we continue to strive for.In the short time since I have been the member for Dunkley, I have come across so many amazing young women and girls who are already leaders in their community—young women and girls who sometimes have been facing what others might see as insurmountable barriers to success, but it is actually those barriers that are encouraging them and inspiring them to make their voices heard.In my community we are honouring International Day of the Girl Child not just today but every day by trying to support those girls who want to be leaders of the future. Plan Internationals research has shown that 91 per cent of girls and young women express a strong desire to be leaders to tackle the biggest challenges of our time. We all know, or most of us know, that one of the biggest challenges of our time is climate change. One only has to talk to school children to understand that they know that thats the biggest challenge of their time and the future. So its probably no surprise that the Plan International research also talks about young people wanting to have their voices heard on climate change. We have a parliamentary friends of tackling climate change group, which today heard from experts about the impact of climate change on health. All of those experts, who coincidentally were all women, which was a terrific thing to see, spoke about young people and young girls desire to have their voices heard to have the future protected. Thats what International Day of the Girl Child wants to do.The United Nations Girls Education Initiative talks about the inspiration for unscripted and unstoppable, the theme of the day, being to:… equip girls with the power, knowledge and space to voice their passions and concerns. The global community must create more opportunity for girls voices to be heard and safe spaces for their participation in decision-making. Leading change for girls is our collective responsibility.No-one in this place could put it any better. It is our collective responsibility. We must all work together.In my electorate, Tegan Crynes, who I met at Elisabeth Murdoch College and then again at a fundraiser for cancer, is a survivor of childhood leukaemia. She is 16 years old. Her ambition is to be the captain of the Australian cricket team. Chloe Kopec is a young woman from my electorate, also 16 years old, who contacted me to say: Can I please come and do work experience in your office and come to Canberra, because I want to be the Prime Minister of Australia. I want my voice to be heard. These are young girls who are so inspiring, and they deserve to have their names and their voices heard in this parliament.Over the weekend I took the children of friends of mine on tours of Parliament House, and the girls were all inspired, standing in front of Julia Gillards portrait. I found myself saying, Thats the first woman to ever be the Prime Minister of Australia and so far the only woman. The young girls looked at me in surprise. I know that, with their support and our support for them, there are going to be female prime ministers in the future and there are going to be female leaders. Im very confident that a number of them are going to come from Dunkley.","International Day of the Girl Child","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms MURPHY (Dunkley) ","(17:21):"
382,0,0,0,1,2,"McIntosh, Melissa, MP",281513,"Lindsay","LP","N/A",3982," My passion to empower young women and girls didnt just start when I entered this building. I worked at the US Studies Centre at the University of Sydney. At the centre I started my own think tank program because I wanted to look at what we were doing in Australia and the United States for women and girls as they progress through their career from entry to leadership positions. So I established W21—The 21st Century Global Womens Initiative. This allowed me to explore important issues around women and work, and to work with the worlds best academics in this space, particularly in Australia and the United States.I launched W21 at the G20 in 2014. We looked at how we could decrease the gender gap by 25 per cent by 2025. Why were we doing this? For sustainable economic growth, not just in Australia but around the world. I also looked at the business case for gender equality and worked with a wonderful academic called Iris Bohnet from Harvard University. Here we discussed creating a pathway for women right through from early career to leadership. In this work we discovered that mentorship and sponsorship played such a role for a womans success throughout her career. I also worked with Sydney Universitys Business School and commissioned a report called Women at work: Australia and the United States. Here, one of the key areas that we looked at was women in directorship roles and how we were doing in Australia and the US.I dont think anyone would be surprised to know that weve still got a lot of work to do. A lot of young women aspire to be women in leadership roles, and women who do reach the top have an obligation, in some part, to support women coming up through the ranks. The reason I did this is that we still do have a lot of work to do in both countries and we can learn from each other about supporting women.This led me to establish, at a local level—because not all things are grand; we can translate this work locally—a not-for-profit that looked at how to help support women in social housing to transition out of social housing, after intergenerational welfare or being in domestic violence situations, into housing independence and financial independence. Here I ran a program that partnered women in the community—mentors, successful businesswomen and successful community women and men who wanted to support these women out of social housing. There are a lot of barriers for everyone in social housing to transition to independence, which is what we all want—jobs and independence from social housing.We have other work to do locally, and Im very committed to this. With the establishment of the Nancy Bird Walton international airport, the aerotropolis and science park will deliver thousands of jobs. Ill be focusing very much on local jobs for women, in particular, because here it is about activating our full workforces potential for success. This is allowing young girls and women to be interested in STEM—in science, technology, maths and even space industry.Recently, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology joined me to launch the Girls in STEM Toolkit at Jamison High School. We joined students from years 8 to 10 to launch the kit, which aims to build female students confidence about taking STEM subjects at school. The minister and I were able to view other STEM activity, such as drones that the girls were building and four-wheel drive challenges. Girls as young as 12 are leading the way with innovation. They are our young pioneers. These girls are our future, and I want to create as many opportunities as possible for them.We have appointed Australias first Women in STEM Ambassador, Professor Lisa Harvey-Smith. She is a strong advocate for gender equality and is raising awareness of issues and prosecuting the case for change. We have also launched the Advancing Women in STEM Strategy. As someone who ran a think tank program in an academic institution that focused on gender equality, I think it is pleasing to see more women having opportunities in our higher education sector. Its great that Western Sydney Universitys Professor Belinda Medlyn has received an ARC award. Belinda is one of only 19 Australian Laureate Fellows in 2019 who will share in $53.8 million to lead research projects over five years. We need to foster the potential of more women in research and STEM fields.The Morrison government is committed to implementing policies that ensure Australian girls have every opportunity to live free from discrimination and to achieve their full potential.","International Day of the Girl Child","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[1]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs McINTOSH (Lindsay) ","(17:26):"

The commitment will ensure that our nations workforce is well equipped for the demands of Australias evolving economy. In particular, I welcome the implementation of our federal governments skills package. The suite of measures contained in the package is great for Australia. In my own electorate of Braddon the implementation will help maximise the existing opportunities that are ahead of us.If youre about to enter the workforce for the first time or youre a bit older and looking for a career change or a sea change then the choice is clear: you should be heading straight to Braddon, which covers the north-west and west coasts of Tasmania, including King Island. Braddon has what the rest of Australia and the world really need. Braddon is, indeed, the place for a lifestyle. It is the envy of all. We are blessed with an abundance of picturesque scenery, natural resources and affordable housing. We also have an abundance of renewable energy. Its one of our most exciting competitive advantages. Thanks to the visionary, collaborative Liberal governments at federal and state levels, Tasmania is well on track to be 100 per cent clean, green, renewable and self-sufficient by 2022. Thats a remarkable achievement. We are streets ahead of the rest of Australia at achieving 100 per cent clean energy generation.Its exciting for me that Braddon is the region taking the lead in the provision of the nations future energy needs through Project Marinus, the second Bass Strait interconnector, which will connect Tasmania with the mainland, and the Battery of the Nation project, which will deliver the dispatchable energy. Both projects are expected to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs during the construction phase, and up to $5 billion is expected to be injected into our economy in the next decade. These jobs are going to be located predominantly across my electorate of Braddon. As well as these opportunities on the mainland of Tasmania, the government has injected $4 million of investment into wave energy technology on King Island, which is another job-creating opportunity, and the region is looking forward to that. This project harnesses the rise and fall of water levels to generate electricity. Wave generation is at its early demonstrational stages but has the potential to be used in remote coastal and island locations. Therefore, its perfect for my electorate of Braddon.This investment in King Island wave technology is another great example of our region leveraging its natural assets. Im excited to see the benefits of this funding and what it will mean for King Island. To make sure that the benefits are maximised within our communities, we must prioritise the development of our workforces skills. Energising Tasmania forms an important part of the governments Skills Package and the partnership between the Morrison government and the Tasmanian Liberal government, and the project will program and train skilled workforces to meet the needs of the jobs created in this pumped hydro and renewable energy sector. The focus is on priority occupations such as project management, civil construction, electrotechnology, resource management, building and construction, the water industry, and operations and engineering. Im proud to be part of a government which is prioritising skills development within my region and ensuring that our workforce gains the necessary skills to keep people living in their local communities and working in interesting and successful professions, now and into the future. The federal government continues to demonstrate its commitment to the north-west of Tasmania by announcing that Burnie will be one of 10 trial sites for an industry training hub. These hubs will strengthen partnerships between local schools, employers and industry, and will ensure that vocational education and programs are tailored to meet local workforce needs. The first two hubs will be rolled out early next year. In my view, Burnie is the obvious choice for the first hub.Tasmanias business confidence is amongst the highest in the nation. The agricultural industry is already increasingly upbeat, and we are in the midst of a renewable energy boom.

390,0,0,0,1,2,"Kearney, Ged, MP","LTU","Cooper","ALP","N/A",3985," I am pleased to rise on this motion and Im pleased that the member for Braddon has raised the issues that young people are facing in gaining employment. I do find it rather interesting, however, that the member for Braddon would paint such a rosy picture of the employment and vocational education systems that this government has left young people to navigate.Young people have been clear with what they need. They need a skills training sector that is properly funded, properly resourced, and has educators who are properly trained and able to skill these kids up as a pathway to meaningful employment. This government hasnt delivered on a single element of those requests. Day after day, I hear of young people who are doing their best. Theyre trying to skill up and theyre trying to get a job, but theyre up against a system which is actively pushing them away. Theyre up against funding cuts and a government that is actually hostile towards vocational education and, by extension, a government that is dismantling the already limited pathways for young people to gain employment.This government is not adequately tackling youth unemployment. The latest statistics from the ABS showed that we have a youth unemployment rate of 11.8 per cent. Thats 295,000 young people who are actively searching for work but are coming up short. Interestingly, Ive been meeting with employers in my electorate and around Victoria who are crying out for workers, yet they cant seem to find anyone skilled enough and are willing to take up positions. This isnt because nobody wants these jobs. This is symptomatic of a skills shortage crisis gripping Australia and, particularly, our young people. Maybe—and Im just speculating here—young people arent gaining the skills needed to take up these jobs because this government has cut $3.6 billion from vocational education. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that this $525 million Skills Package that the member for Braddon speaks of includes only $54.5 million of new funding. Maybe it has something to do with the continued funding cuts, the closure of TAFE campuses around Australia or the governments refusal to listen to the sector, to young people and to educators.The member for Braddon mentioned the governments reform of the vocational education system. What reform is he speaking of? Im sure the TAFE educators Ive been meeting with would be shocked to hear of the reforms the government has implemented in the VET system. Perhaps the reform the member speaks of is their recent announcement—and this really is an innovative measure—that theyve hired Scott Cam. Scott Cam has been snapped up by the government to promote trades to Australias young people. Dont get me wrong: Im sure he is a good bloke, and I take no offence at the promotion of trades. Young people should be taking up trades, and we should be promoting secure, decent jobs in trades. I do, however, find it shocking that the government is paying a national careers ambassador while they cut $3.6 billion from the sector; while they see fit to cut from VET and training, to cut from group training, to cut TAFE and to put educators out of work; and when their policies have caused the number of apprentices and trainees to fall by 150,000 and have let apprentices in this country be more likely to drop out than finish their apprenticeship. Even when all of this is true, when all of this is happening right around them, the governments solution to the skills shortages and youth unemployment were seeing across this country is to hire a celebrity.I will say at least this announcement provided some comic relief from the reality of this governments plan for employment and skills training in Australia, because the situation we are currently faced with is an indictment of this government. We are simultaneously experiencing a crisis of youth unemployment and a crisis of skills shortages. One of these is bad enough to be faced with but both of them at the same time is hard to imagine. But here we are confronted with both.While businesses are struggling to fill the skilled positions they have on offer, we have young people desperate for work who cant fill those positions because they havent been given the chance to gain the skills that the roles require. And, even though this is the case—and its plainly obvious that it is—the government refuses to properly fund the sector. It refuses to give it the proper reform that it so desperately needs. Instead, it wheels out members, like the good member for Braddon, week after week to reannounce funding which already exists, to slap a new label on it and to take a whole lot of praise. I intend to give them all the praise they deserve, and thats not much. They might rise to spin their tales and their dreams of an economy and a government who are putting people into work, but I will continue to remind them of the crisis in youth unemployment and the crisis in skills shortages.","Vocational Education and Training","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms KEARNEY (Cooper) ","(17:37):"
391,0,0,0,1,2,"Pitt, Keith, MP",148150,"Hinkler","LNP","N/A",3986," Thank you very much. Can I say to all those who are out there listening, who might be thinking about a trade: a trade is about a journey. Im an electrician by trade. I commenced my apprenticeship on 13 January 1987. But the story I want to tell today is quite simply not about me; its about some of the people that I came across as an apprentice, a tradesperson, a supervisor, a manager and an engineer. First is Gavin Hunt. Gavin started at a similar time to me at the Fairymead Sugar Mill as a fitter and turner. For those of you who are unaware of what sort of work that is, it tends to be dirty work, greasy work and heavy work. I recall very clearly finding Gavin in what was then called the loco maintenance shop where his job was to grease the locomotive wheels. As a first-year apprentice, I could see Gavin was struggling. I went past a couple of times and he was still struggling. The third time I went past he looked terrified. I thought Id better stop and say gday. I said, Mate, whats up? And hed just had a fair blast from one of his mentors, a man by the name of Fergal—well call him Fergal because that was his name. He was one of those scary individuals, Mr Deputy Speaker Zimmerman, that Im sure youve come across: big, gruff, angry, knew his stuff and wanted you to get on with it. As it turned out, Gavin was pulling the grease nipples out of the locomotive wheels rather than actually attaching the grease gun to them so that he could do what he had to do.The reason I raise this is that in his first year Gavin passed away from a very short illness. Those individuals then passed the hat around. They raised enough money for the Gavin Hunt memorial award. One of the first winners was Scott Collins, an outstanding first-year apprentice and a good mate of mine. Ive got to say: as a fitter, hes been pretty damn good. Scott went on to work in the mines. Hes worked in the industry for years. Unfortunately, the mills that we grew up in, that we did our time in, are now gone. However, he did return to the sugar industry. He is now a shift supervisor.To those individuals who are listening out there, who are looking to do an apprenticeship: your journey can take you anywhere. I mean, Im here as a member of parliament. I started my first career as an electrician. For Scott, he went through and won the Gavin Hunt memorial award. He went on as a maintenance fitter and worked his way into a position where he is now the supervisor of a factory that looks after any number of people and that has a throughput of 1½ million tonnes when they actually get cane, so he has a very substantial position. He supports his family and he supports a lot of individuals, and I think this is the story that we need to get across to those looking for a vocational education. It is an opportunity for a career. It is not just about being an apprentice or not choosing university. You quite simply can go anywhere because the skills that you are taught are life skills. They are not only technical and trade skills; they are skills which you can transfer into pretty much any career that you choose.I know there are a number of MPs in the parliament who started their career as tradespeople. I will acknowledge Joel Fitzgibbon. I know Joel was an auto electrician before he came into other areas. But what weve got to say to these individuals is: You need to stick it out, because my understanding is that our biggest loss for those who sign up as apprentices and trainees is in their second year. Quite simply, it gets much more difficult in terms of the technical training and we tend to lose them. So those individuals need help, and we are providing that support.The Australian Apprentice Wage Subsidy scheme is an incredibly supportive scheme from the government. In the Hinkler electorate, in the first round 20 businesses were able to take on an apprentice earlier this year. I know one of those businesses actually hired two at the time when they were only going to hire one, quite simply because of this scheme. We know that round 2 is available. It is due, and we expect that therell be more into regional economies because small business is what drives our economy and we need to provide these individuals with skills for the future. We need to transfer the skills from those older tradespeople who are coming to the end of their time who will retire, because otherwise they are lost, and some of these roles are incredibly technical and difficult and take years and years to develop—in fact, some decades—before they are across all of their industries.Ive heard some commentary about Scott Cam being appointed as the Australias first National Careers Ambassador. I say to opposition, So what? If Scott Cam can deliver more apprentices into the vocational training scheme, good on him. Im happy to support whatever it is that he does because those individuals need that support and, as a nation, we need them to have those skills. We need those kids to decide they want to have a trade. We need them to be electricians and plumbers and engineers and everything else that we need as a nation, because, quite simply, we need them to add to our economy and to provide skills, particularly in the regions where we dont have them already. I say to those opposite that you should be applauding this motion and the person who put it forward. You should be supporting the fact that the government is doing everything it can to provide more opportunities for apprentices, because without them we are lost.","Vocational Education and Training","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PITT (Hinkler) ","(17:42):"
392,0,0,0,1,2,"Steggall, Zali, MP",175696,"Warringah","IND","N/A",3988," I rise to speak on the member for Braddons motion. The report of the independent review of Australias vocational education and training, the Joyce review, was delivered in March this year, and the government responded to the report with its Delivering Skills for Today and Tomorrow package just prior to the May election.Whilst I welcome all the governments efforts, including the recent announcement of Scott Cam as a TV personality, in relation to vocational education and training and improvement of youth employment the flipside is that we have a long way to go to achieve a better future for young people. By 2020, 99,000 jobs will be created, and just 70,000 will only require a senior secondary level education. Many schools spend less than a cup of coffee on career guidance per student. By the age of 24, only 59 per cent of young Australians from disadvantaged backgrounds are in education, training or work compared to 83 per cent of those from high socioeconomic backgrounds. And, although the programs the government has announced are an important step in the right direction, there are questions that need to be asked.In the 2017 budget, the government announced $1.5 billion in funding for the Skilling Australians Fund. The government estimated the fund would assist an additional 300,000 apprentices, trainees and higher-level skilled Australians over four years. Since then, at least $400 million has been redirected from the Skilling Australians Fund, and the fund ends in 2022, so there is no ongoing commitment. And, in the 2019 budget announcement of $525 million over five years to upgrade the VET sector, there is no single mention of TAFE. In my electorate of Warringah, many young people are not aware of their options and many find it very difficult to get to job locations. Some young people travel for over three hours each way to get to an apprenticeship scheme. Others talk about the difficulty they have navigating the system itself, struggling to figure out what they can do because of all the red tape. I think we all agree that the various education and employment schemes need to work for young people. Removing barriers to get young people into work means working with young people to design the responses, looking at the future of work and planning training courses appropriately. In Warringah, local businesses have said to me that they often find it hard to find apprentices.The Business Education Network, which helps youth in Warringah transition through school to education, training and active community participation through vocational programs, mentoring, personal development resources, and case worker support, has said that the focus should be about getting young people to understand where opportunities lie. There is a big assumption that young people know what they are going to do. As a mother of teenagers, I can guarantee you, they do not all know what they are going to do. When you dont have career advisers in schools, you dont have the capacity to link students with opportunities.Package incentives should take into account apprentices living costs and transport, so that the package can support them through their traineeship. The governments approach should be about helping businesses to retain and support apprentices. This should include a tiered level of information sharing for local output, as it was under Career Advice Australia, which had national industry career specialists who would identify, at the national level, the need of large industries and developments in that space. This would then feed down to regional industry career advisers, who would then feed down to local facilitators to develop local connections. This approach was more holistic, but the program, sadly, was stopped five years ago.Under federal funding, there used to be professional development of teachers, for example. The BEN used to take teachers to visit organisations to understand their employment approaches and bring that back to school in order to build a pathway for students. We need to be focused on creating opportunity for our youth, to make sure they have those choices—whether it is entering into trades or pursuing their education—but it needs to be done in a holistic way. There is a correlation between business and vocational training, so there needs to be a focus on educating our young people, while they are at school, about the possibilities and opportunities outside school and what pathways they can take. Its important to support apprentice trainees through the incentives so that they are keen to work in particular professions and stay in those professions in the long term. We need to make sure that it is affordable to become an apprentice.","Vocational Education and Training","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STEGGALL (Warringah) ","(17:47):"
393,0,0,0,1,2,"Leeser, Julian, MP",109556,"Berowra","LP","N/A",3989," Id like to thank the Member for Braddon for this motion and acknowledge the contribution hes making around this place and in particular to thank him for the opportunity to talk about the governments work and achievements in the vocational education and training sector. The VET sector is a hothouse for skills development in this country and plays a very important role in job creation. Families and businesses rely on the VET sector to equip Australians with the skills they will need for the jobs of today and into the future. Im proud to be part of a government thats taking this part of the education system very seriously.Since 2013, our governments created over 1.4 million jobs. We havent created these jobs by dreaming up new positions that serve no purpose, but instead by equipping businesses to create the opportunities that are most needed. Lower taxes and other tax relief allow businesses to employ more people. The other part of the picture is job creation and making sure Australians are well equipped to fill the roles that businesses need through vocational education reform.Were investing in vocational education and training to fill skills gaps and help employers pass on their knowledge to the next generation. The first part of our vocational education and training reform is reaffirming and building confidence in the vocational education and training sector. For too long, vocational education has been seen as the second cousin—the poor option—for young people compared with university pathways, which have tended to have a higher status position in the minds of many families. We used to rank schools based on the number of university graduates they produced. It became so normal that we didnt really think about how false that measure was. Our governments turning that mindset around. For a person who is soon to begin a career, there are big decisions they need to make.People need to look at what they love, what they are good at, where they can best contribute in the long term, what will enable them to support themselves and any family that they may have, and what will allow them to be productive and offer skills and services to fulfil community needs. For many people, VET pathways are the right pathways to take. The skills learnt are incredibly important for the whole community, and we would be lost without those people who take this pathway. Of course we need university educated thinkers, doctors, lawyers engineers and the like, but we also need people who can drive the economy forward to produce the goods we need, to work in resources and manufacturing, and keep our communities powered, watered and safe.Our government is restoring confidence in the VET sector by significantly investing in it. In 2019-20 we will spend over $3 billion on VET to support people to gain skills and to reskill throughout their lives for jobs that industries need. Were saying to people who are wondering about what their career future might hold: this is the pathway you should be taking. When a person choses a VET pathway they can often earn good money, support their family and make an important contribution to the Australian economy. In fact, 31 out of the top 50 earning occupations require a VET pathway.Our skills package helps employers and employees take the first risky step of starting on a new career pathway. We want to see Australians investing in their own future by developing skills that will allow them to adapt to the changing workforce. If we dont do this now we will find ourselves on the back foot for years to come. In areas where we have national skills shortages, there are payments to encourage the formation of new apprenticeships. This will generate up to 80,000 new apprenticeships over the next five years.The other part of restoring confidence is making sure that the training people receive is up to scratch. Were improving the regulation of training providers. People need to know that the training they receive will actually make them job ready and employers need to know that when a person comes to them with a certificate, that the certificate represents a whole lot of competence, skill and knowledge. The Joyce and Braithwaite reviews found that reform was needed in this regard, so were acting on bringing changes to the Australian Skills Quality Authority. Employers need to be able to count on training providers to get their future employees ready for the jobs theyre needed to do. They need to know that people can walk into their businesses, do a job and add value. With technology rapidly adjusting, thats not always an easy task. Training providers need to be able to quickly evolve, and the reforms we are making will focus on helping training providers to fulfil their duties to a high standard. The Australian Skills Quality Authority will be reformed to make sure its keeping those standards high for those training providers.Last week, as others in this debate have mentioned, we announced the new National Careers Ambassador, Scott Cam. His remarkable career began with an apprenticeship. In my community, as in so many other communities right across our country, we have our own Scott Cams, people who, many years ago, chose a vocational education pathway and whove contributed an enormous amount to the economy and to their communities. Many of these people have become not only successful masters of their own trade but also very successful business people. I look forward to seeing vocational education grow in quality and reputation, with many people taking advantage of it in the years to come.","Vocational Education and Training","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr LEESER (Berowra) ","(17:52):"
394,0,0,0,1,2,"Phillips, Fiona, MP",147140,"Gilmore","ALP","N/A",3991," As a former TAFE teacher and work placement coordinator, I know how vital TAFE is to providing Australia with a skilled workforce. I know how valuable apprenticeships are to the future of young people, helping to address youth unemployment and providing us with the tradies of the future. I went out into communities such as Sanctuary Point and East Nowra to help students on the path to training and work. I taught students who had faced challenges in their lives but were working to improve the future for themselves and their families—young mums, young dads, mature-aged people. I have seen how hard they have tried to change the cycle of disadvantage. I have heard their calls for help when they couldnt get the support they so desperately needed from their employment providers. I spent many years working with them, trying to help them and seeing the challenges they faced. So when I hear, like we did last week, that the government thinks the solution is a celebrity, I cant help but shake my head. When I hear that the Prime Minister wants to end job snobbery by asking young people to give up on university and try a trade instead, I despair. I do agree with the Prime Minister on one thing: we are facing shortages in vital blue-collar jobs. I agree with the Prime Minister that we do need more tradies, but Scott Cam is not the answer.The motion that I rise on today praises the governments strong commitment to reform the vocational education and training sector. It talks about incentivising apprenticeships and trainees to address skills shortages. It even mentions addressing youth unemployment in regional areas. There is only one thing I can say to that: this government is now facing a mess of its own making. Because of the coalition governments cuts, my electorate has the highest youth unemployment rate in New South Wales. Between September 2013 when this government took office and March 2018, my electorate lost 30 per cent of its apprentices—810 apprentices, a huge number on the New South Wales South Coast, where we are really struggling. There are 150,000 fewer apprentices and trainees nationally. More people are dropping out than finishing apprenticeships and there are fewer apprentices and trainees than 10 years ago. The $3 billion in cuts to vocational education and training will do that. All pre-apprenticeships at local TAFE campuses on the New South Wales South Coast were axed by this government. I know how popular these courses were, because I used to teach them. These courses help people to start a trades career. Employers loved them and students loved them. Why wouldnt they? These courses gave students a foot in the door and helped them to gain the valuable trade skills to make them real assets to local businesses. I helped students get ready for industry accredited work placements through the pre-apprenticeship welding class I taught, and I know it worked.Instead of reinvesting the money this government has ripped from TAFE, they think that spending taxpayer dollars on a celebrity endorsement is going to do the trick. I feel confident when I say that no matter how popular he may be, and Im sure Scott Cam is a nice enough chap, this has nothing to do with Scott Cam. He cannot make up for a funding black hole this government has created. The government has turned its back on the people of the South Coast. This motion from the member for Braddon welcomes support workers by improving literacy and numeracy, and digital literacy. But I am reminded about the Adult Migrant English Program. This TAFE program provided literacy and numeracy skills to new migrants. In 2017, this government decided to outsource it. They privatised it. What happened? The new provider decided that people in Batemans Bay didnt need to have access to this program anymore. They decided that people could travel to Nowra instead, a 90-minute drive away. This cruel decision hurt our local TAFE campuses. It led to fewer enrolments. It led to teachers positions being axed and a reduction in literacy programs. Thats all this government knows how to do—cut, cut, cut. We dont need celebrity endorsements and we dont need motions like this that attempt to hide the reality of this governments actions in the skills sector. We need our TAFEs to be properly funded. We need apprentices to be properly supported. We need help for the people of the New South Wales South Coast who desperately want to help fill this skills shortage the coalition government has created.","Vocational Education and Training","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs PHILLIPS (Gilmore) ","(17:57):"
395,0,0,0,1,2,"Bell, Angie, MP",282981,"Moncrieff","LNP","N/A",3992," What a pleasure it is to second the motion on employment, education and training moved by the member for Braddon. I want to talk about the creation of the coalitions 1.4 million jobs since we came to government. With over 70,000 small businesses on the Gold Coast, we are known as the small business capital of Australia. I want to highlight the achievements and immense contribution small business makes to the Gold Coast economy and the creation of thousands of local jobs. Since the LNP came to government, the Gold Coast unemployment rate has dropped from 5.73 per cent to 4.65 per cent. This is because of the hard work of businesses who are creating the opportunity for full-time employment. The Morrison government want to do even more to get people off welfare and into a job.As said by the member for Berowra, 31 out of 50 top earning occupations now require a VET pathway. Every day, our VET sector is delivering real skills for real careers, whether its your local hairdresser, butcher, mechanic, pilot, plumber or carer, VET has been a pathway of choice for many successful Gold Coasters. The Morrison government committed more than half a billion dollars to boost VET, with our skills package delivering skills for today and tomorrow. This investment will ensure Australians and Gold Coasters have the critical skills to meet emerging industry needs and keep the economy growing. It places us, workers, businesses, communities and the economy on the path to prosperity through a focus on skills development. Many businesses, the majority of them small, are the beneficiaries of the Apprentice Wage Subsidy Trial, with the second round of trials doubling the number of new apprenticeships to 3,200 created nationwide. Twenty-five businesses in my electorate of Moncrieff are currently taking advantage of this trial, helping small businesses and young Australians find work. Hospitality is a key industry on the Gold Coast, as we know. The Ridgeway Group is a catering company located in Ashmore. They own six restaurants across South-East Queensland, including one of my personal favourites, the Little Truffle, located in Mermaid Beach.Four months ago, Tommy began working on his commercial cookery certificate at the Ridgeway Group. So far hes had some great experiences, including working in the kitchen on the YOT Club, a superyacht entertainment venue which charters on the Gold Coast waterways. Kirsty from Ridgeway Group said that the program has given the head chefs the time and resources to give more one-on-one time to train Tommy. In turn, that has added value to their business by making him a key member of their team.Another example of a small business maximising this opportunity is Holt Constructions, based in Highland Park. Luke Holt was a one-man band in his small construction business, but this subsidy has enabled him to hire 18-year-old Ronan to help him with renovations, building decks and insurance work. Ronan is mainly labouring at the moment, but he has really enjoyed learning how to use power tools. Ronan hopes that one day hell be able to run his own business, just like Luke. The trial has allowed Luke to dedicate more time to his apprentice, Ronan, and this means hell be work ready by the time he has finished his apprenticeship.Another one is The End Hairdressing salon, also located in Mermaid Beach. It has a great success story with its apprentice, Tara. Tara has been described as absolute dynamite by the owner, Lisa. Tara is 22 years old, and Lisa said that the only way she was able to take on Tara as a mature-age apprentice was through the wage subsidy program. Lisa said that she is comfortably able to leave Tara with tasks that she wouldnt usually leave with a first-year apprentice because shes mature aged. Prior to starting the apprenticeship, Tara was working as a retail assistant. She had always loved hair and beauty, and decided to take the plunge into a hairdressing career—and she has never looked back. Tara loves her new apprenticeship; her favourite part is when she gets the opportunity to style updos on clients. I encourage everyone to take a look on Instagram to see some of her work. She said that after her apprenticeship she intends to stay on at the salon so she can continue to learn and grow.These are just a few examples of how the Morrison government is delivering apprenticeships and jobs for the central Gold Coast. Businesses want employees who are work ready from day one, and someone to add value to their business. The wage subsidy program is providing exactly that; with an amazing array of career paths available. Completing a VET course or an apprenticeship is a great first choice option for many Australians who are looking to gain the skills necessary for employment in the industry of their choice and the industries of the future.Finally, I want to commend the Morrison governments commitment to reform the education and training sector to better meet the demands of the modern Australian economy and the future of our country.","Vocational Education and Training","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms BELL (Moncrieff) ","(18:02):"
396,0,0,0,1,2,"Coker, Elizabeth, MP",263547,"Corangamite","ALP","N/A",3993," This government has no plan for the youth employment, education and skills crisis besetting this country. The glowing reference in the motion to 140,000 young people finding work is disingenuous. Right now, nearly 17 per cent of 15- to 19-year-olds, and 8½ per cent of 20- to 24-year-olds, are unemployed. That is 250,000 young people who are looking for work but who cant find it.During the last six years, these youth unemployment rates have been even higher. Certainly, they are higher than when the coalition took office. The 2019 budget does nothing to rectify the manifest failings of the VET system. The proposed skills package of $525 million in the budget, and lauded in this motion, has been picked over at Senate estimates; they found that only $55.4 million is actually new money. And if things are as good as this motion makes out, then why are the governments own mates starting to become so restless?It started in August, when Innis Willox, CEO of the Australian Industry Group, pleaded with the Prime Minister to fix the skills crisis. Mr Willox is right to be concerned, because the pipeline of infrastructure work over the next few years is slated to be bigger than the mining boom of 2012 to 2015. On 8 August, The Australian quoted research by Ai Group which found that 75 per cent of employers were having difficulty recruiting qualified or skilled workers to fill vacancies, with the biggest shortage amongst technicians and trades workers. Further, the article said that apprentice and trainee numbers had fallen from 450,000 in 2012 to 260,000 last year, which Mr Willox blamed on a number of policy changes, including the removal or reduction of many employer incentives.It is no wonder that, of the 259 businesses who responded to the New South Wales business workforce skills survey, 55 per cent said they were experiencing a skills shortage. New South Wales Business Chamber CEO, Stephen Cartwright, said in TheSydney Morning Herald on 26 August:More must be done to train the next generation to ensure the economy has the requisite skills to sustain existing and future economic activity.But its not just the drop in commencement rates that is worrying. Recent data from the National Council for Vocational Education Research reveals that completion rates for apprentices and trainees in all occupations have decreased to 56.7 per cent, and to 54.5 per cent in trade occupations. The coalition has had six years to improve the skills system but has failed to take action at every turn. Instead, it has taken $3 billion out of the system and reduced commencements by over 150,000 since 2013.If one cant believe the employers, then how about the CSIRO? In its June 2019 Australian National Outlook, the CSIRO said:Technological change … is transforming existing industries and changing the skills required for high-quality jobs. Unless Australia can reverse its recent declines in educational performance, its future workforce could be poorly prepared for the jobs—of the future. This is all the end result of cuts to school funding, a lack of focus on vocational pathways, closing TAFE campuses and allowing dodgy for-profit providers to gouge the system. Yet the minister, Senator Cash, boasted in a speech on 11 July: Our agenda is ambitious. Ambitious for what, I ask. The recent budget package will make hardly a dent in the crisis that we face. Ten new regional training hubs are important as a link between schools and technical education, but 10 across Australia is just over one per state and territory. We need one in each state, focused on areas of economic activity.This motion lauds the creation of 400 VET scholarships and the doubling of the Australian Apprentice Wage Subsidy Trial, but makes no mention of the drop of 150,000 commencements over the last six years. These feeble initiatives neither repair the damage done nor address the challenges ahead. So instead of patting itself on the back for doing very little, lets address the challenges ahead. The government must invest in high schools to encourage students to undertake VET. It must arrest the massive decline in apprenticeship and trainee commencement and completion rates. It must restore the role of TAFE in setting the skills agenda, rather than relying on a failed market system.This motion is false news for our young people and Australias businesses. As with all bad motions, it should be consigned to the dustbin of history.

397,0,0,0,1,2,"Young, Terry, MP",201906,"Longman","LNP","N/A",3995," The power of supporting and allowing all Australians to hone, develop and build their skills is one we cannot underestimate or ignore, for with great skills come a more-sustainable economy, a stronger workforce, happier and more-skilled employees and a better life for all Australians and their families who live and work in our beautiful country. We cannot deny them the opportunities that building and developing their skill sets will bring or employers a chance to have a workforce full of skilled, passionate and enthusiastic employees, thereby creating more jobs, apprenticeships and traineeships for jobseekers. That is what the Morrison governments $525 million skills package will make possible for all Australians, whether they are embarking on a new career or looking to reskill. It could allow a young man who has just started learning his trade to get onto the stepping stone he needs to forge a career path and unlock unlimited opportunities along the way, or it could help someone who has worked in their career for more than 40 years to develop new skills such as literacy, numeracy and digital literacy which would help them to continue to thrive at their job and to keep up with the evolving modern world and our economy. These skills are crucial to gaining and retaining a job or to understanding further education and training.It is our role as a government to help Australians embark on this journey, to help them find and retain employment, to give them the confidence and skills they need to excel at their job and to help ensure that Australian businesses gain the skilled staff that they need to grow, to be productive and to be competitive. We do this so that the everyday Australian has the support they need behind them to shape their futures and those of their families, because they deserve it.Learning new skills and building on skills that you already have creates confidence. It generates jobs and builds a stronger economy. It helps employees and employers to find new and innovative ways of thinking. It gives them passion and enthusiasm to do their jobs well. It will allow employers and industries to train a skilled workforce, and it will create countless apprenticeships and traineeships and jobs for many years to come. As a small business owner myself, Ive seen all of this firsthand. I have seen what skilled and trained employees can bring to a workplace. Ive seen businesses thrive with a great, enthusiastic team and workforce behind them.Australians can now expect a better future, a more sustainable economy, more jobs and a stronger workforce on the horizon because of the Morrison governments commitment to delivering more than $525 million to a range of vocational education and training, or VET, measures through the Delivering Skills for Today and Tomorrow package. We need to lay down the foundations that will help and support people to skill, reskill and upskill through their entire lives, for every Australian, young and older. This is what we will achieve through the Morrison governments skills package and further VET reforms. This package will allow the VET sector to continue to evolve and give everyday Australians the industry skills they need to prosper and flourish in their jobs and throughout their careers.Since the Morrison government was elected, 1.2 million jobs have been created and 140,000 young Australians have secured employment. The implementation of this skills package will allow us to achieve greater and better results for all Australians and to grow our economy while creating jobs. This is what we will keep fighting for—a better Australia for all. Im passionate about supporting the young Australians who live in the Longman electorate and about creating more opportunities for young people in regions with high youth unemployment to find work, build their skills, receive experience in the workplace and prosper in their career.The time has never been more critical to support and help young Australians to build their skills in the workplace, give them training opportunities in order to succeed in their chosen career and help them to find and retain employment. More than 80,000 new apprenticeships will be generated over the next five years thanks to the new additional identified skills shortage payment, which launched in July for eligible new apprentices and their employers in occupations experiencing a national skills shortage. I encourage all businesses in my electorate of Longman to contact my office to check their eligibility for this fantastic program. Through the Morrison governments skills package, let us keep generating jobs, create a sustainable economy and workforce, and help our fellow Australians plan for their future and support them on their journey to achieving skills beyond their wildest dreams.","Vocational Education and Training","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr YOUNG (Longman) ","(18:12):"
398,0,0,0,1,2,"Chesters, Lisa, MP",249710,"Bendigo","ALP","N/A",3996," I was actually quite surprised that a government member moved this motion, considering the shocking record this government has on skills and on skills in vocational education and training in this country. For six years those opposite have been in government, and weve seen nothing but cuts and attacks, particularly on our TAFE sector. I want to pull out a couple of points from the motion thats been moved. Theyre celebrating the creation of 1.2 million jobs since they came to government. What jobs are they talking about? These great gig economy jobs—all the Uber drivers we now have, all the Airtasker jobs we now have? Are these the kinds of great employment prospects this government is talking about? They dont talk about some of the full-time jobs being created. Is that because theyve finally realised the full-time jobs being created in states like Victoria and Queensland are the jobs created by those state Labor governments? That is something that is helping our national figures. In Victoria weve had a number of full-time jobs created by good government policy in that state. It is not the same in New South Wales and Tasmania, where those state governments are slashing funding to TAFE and skills.This motion talks about the 140,000 young Australians whove secured jobs in a six-year period. Again, what jobs are those opposite talking about? They celebrate when somebody gets an Uber job or an Airtasker job—these insecure gig economy jobs which exploit young workers. Today, if youre a young worker, you are more likely to be ripped off, underemployed and face risk at work than you are to have a good experience. That is the reality of being a young worker today. Gone are the days where you could have a job for life. The reason young people end up working in five to 10 jobs in their first three years is that, quite often, the employer phoenixes and the person has to go and work for someone else. They dont get enough hours. Theyre ripped off; theyre not paid properly. The fact that we have the term wage theft on this governments watch, which is a trending hashtag, demonstrates how this government is failing our young people.I also note in this motion that theyre no longer talking about the PaTH program, the touted program where they encouraged young people to work as interns for $4 extra an hour, and where they did these really cushy deals with big employers around the country and said, Great news: this will help young people find a job. But when they actually did the research and spoke to people whod been part of PaTH, nine times out of 10 they found their own job. Quite often, Coles and the big chains didnt employ that young person directly; they employed them through a PaTH program, taking away the job of another young person.They talk about how great the leadership of this government is for introducing the Joyce review. After six years of failure, theyre celebrating that they had a review. Im the deputy chair of the House Education and Employment Committee and I look forward to the briefing were going to receive this week about whether the government is going to implement the recommendations and where to forward, because were desperate to have a skills strategy in this country.Time and time again we are hearing from employers that they cannot get the skilled workers that they need. On this governments watch we have a skills crisis because of their funding cuts to TAFE and vocational education, and the blockages and the barriers theyve put in place, particularly when it comes to the regions. Time and time again were seeing skills on the skills shortage list and workers coming in on visas for skills that have been on it for over a decade. Clearly, that is a policy failure of this government. They put a skill on the short-term skills visa list, yet they havent trained enough workers to take it off the list; its still on there. Thats a failure and a demonstration of how this government has failed.Its not just Labor and its not just regional communities saying this. Its also the Australian Industry Group saying this: 75 per cent of businesses that they surveyed are struggling to find qualified workers—and thats one of their mates, not our mates, saying that theyve failed. Its hypocrisy by this government. They think they can come in here and present an alternative universe, put together little speeches that they can show in their electorates and that people in their communities will believe them. You cannot change reality. We have a skills crisis in this country, and for six years the government have done nothing to reverse it. Theyve made it harder for young people in the regions. Theyve made it harder for people in business to employ the people they need. It is broken. Nothing in this motion suggests that the governments got any plan to fix it.","Vocational Education and Training","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[10]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms CHESTERS (Bendigo) ","(18:17):"
399,0,0,0,1,2,"Joyce, Barnaby, MP","E5D","New England","Nats","N/A",3997," I want to talk briefly about the alternative universe of the Labor Party and its a long, long time ago—thats because theyre not very good at their job and keep on never winning an election. The greatest example of a Labor disaster was their VET FEE-HELP policy. Students were systematically exploited, signed up to accumulate huge debts for training packages that were never delivered. Since 2016 nearly 38,000 students have had VET FEE-HELP loan debts that have been re-credited by the Commonwealth. In 2009-10, Labor cut the Apprenticeship Training (Fee) Voucher program and shared competitive incentive. In 2009-10, they cut the Commonwealth Trade Learning Scholarship and apprentice wage top-up. In 2011-12, they cut incentives for employers for Australian apprenticeships undertaking their apprenticeships or traineeships at the certificate II level. In 2012-13, the Labor Party cut the commencement payment from the standard employer incentives for Australian apprentices. In 2012, Labors MYEFO cut the commencement payments to employers of existing workers and Australian apprentices. They also cut the commencement and the recommencement of payments for Australian apprentices undertaking their apprenticeship at the diploma and the advanced diploma level.The Labor Party also removed the completion payment from this incentive, including for any apprentices already enrolled who did not complete their apprenticeships by a certain date. They removed the support for adult Australian apprentices payment. They removed the commencement and recommencement payments for part-time and casual apprentices. In their final economic statement, the Labor Party cut the completion payment for employers of existing apprenticeships in non-skills shortage areas. This was a cumulative quarter of a billion dollar cut.In the alternative universe, its not sounding too good. What we acknowledge is that, in the program going forward, places such as the Namoi brickworks in Gunnedah will have the capacity to take on a new bricklayer. Therell be a payment to the bricklayer and a payment back to those training them in that trade. This is vitally important. The current apprenticeship process for bricklayers is incredibly low, but you cant build a house without the people who have the capacity to build houses.The reality of the economy were in—always remember—is that if its done on a computer, if its done on a keyboard, it can be done anywhere in the world; it does not have to be done in Australia. But the one thing that does have to be done here, and will always have to be done here, is the work of tradespeople. Whether its a plumber, whether its a plasterer, whether its a bricklayer or whether its a carpenter, everybody here is going to need local tradespeople. I can tell you right now that I saw this years ago as an accountant. When parents came in with their children, Id ask, As your son or you daughter gets close to year 12, what are they going to do? In the past they would have said, I want them to go to university because I believe they will make more money. Those days are over, I can assure you. Become an electrician, become a sparky, and you will make a lot of money; you will employ people; you will have your own business. If you go through an area, the people who are truly wealthy are the ones who had the plant, had the material, were property developers, were builders. Even in Tamworth thats where the money is, and thats the area to do that.If youre going to open up new subdivisions, youre going to need tradespeople, and smart tradespeople become smart business people—and that is what were about. It was the coalition who understood this and stood behind things such as ABNs to make employees into businesspeople so that they can be their own boss, work for themselves and have their own careers. Politically that made a huge difference, especially in places such as the western suburbs of Sydney. Employees who were reliant on somebody else, were beneficiaries of someone else, became benefactors to their own families. They became the source of the wealth. By the sweat of their own brow and their own intuition they transcended through the economic and social stratification of life to their highest level, limited only by their innate ability. And why can we trot out a line like that? Because its the National Party ethos; thats where it comes from. We acknowledge that a person of lesser education, born in a harder area, probably without the adornments that you might get in the inner suburbs—that person, their life, overwhelmingly comes good by the sweat of their own brow, and one of the most vital ways you can do that, advance in this great nation of Australia, is via a trade.","Vocational Education and Training","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[2]/speech[11]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JOYCE (New England) ","(18:22):"

Today Im calling on the government to take real action and secure the future of agriculture in this hotter and drier Australia.As we stand here, Australia is in the grip of an immense and devastating drought. Last week, fruitgrowers in the lower Darling turned off their taps for the last time. Theyre leaving the land because it can no longer support their crops. Australia has always faced droughts, and this drought, like always, will pass—but others will follow. What we face now is something more profound than what weve seen before. What we face now is a world in which our patterns of rainfall, sun, frost and heat are shifting. What we face now is a breakdown in the climate which has sustained people in this place for millennia.The government yesterday announced funding for dams in New South Wales. I applaud this investment, but water infrastructure is only one part of the answer for one part of the country. This is not enough to futureproof Australian agriculture in a changing climate. As a country, weve set ourselves a lofty goal of growing agriculture to a $100 billion industry by 2030. I wholeheartedly support that goal, but we wont achieve it without a plan to address our changing climate, a plan for agriculture that we all sign up to.Last week, the CSIRO released projections showing that in this century my home state of Victoria could warm by almost five degrees. The great rivers of the Victorian Alps in my electorate of Indi, rivers which feed the Murray-Darling Basin, will shrink, with spring rains declining by 35 per cent. What will we grow in a country that looks like this? How many more Australian farmers will end up like those fruit growers in the lower Darling because their world changed and we failed them? The answer depends on what we do now. Doing nothing means agricultural production will decline 17 per cent in the next 30 years. According to ANU climate scientist Will Steffen, that will mean losses of more than $200 billion. Doing nothing is not an option. Its not an option for agriculture and its not an option for rural communities or for the 93 per cent of us who are fed by the food produced by Australian farmers.Instead, this motion calls for a plan to change course in six concrete ways. First, such a plan must include significant and focused funding for research on how farming can thrive into the future. We need an Apollo program for farming. Second, we need to set targets for adaptations that drive investment in new crop varieties, in new livestock and in farming systems. Third, we need to support regional communities to adapt to our future climate, and that includes a health policy that recognises the impact of climate in rural Australia. If, as the Climate Council warns, 70 per cent of temperate wine regions will be unsuitable for grape growing within 30 years, then we need a plan for the 16,000 people employed in the wine industry. Fourth, we need a plan to roll out clean energy in regional Australia. Instead of being a country that pays foreign companies to pump oil, we could be one that pays farmers to harvest the sun and the wind. Fifth, we need to pay farmers for the ecosystem services that they already provide. The Emissions Reduction Funds last auction abated just 0.001 per cent of Australias carbon emissions. We need simpler ways for farmers to earn money from carbon farming. And its not just carbon: farmers who restore native vegetation and improve water quality do society a favour, and they should be rewarded for that. The NFF has called for a $1 billion ecosystem services fund, and thats a great place to start. Finally, we need a plan to accelerate global emissions reductions by exporting our technology and our expertise. If the rest of the world continues to emit unabated, it will spell the end of farming here. So, if we care about farming, we need to build a zero carbon future here and sell it to the world.In the past, Australia has shown that we can focus our efforts on great threats and move quickly and smartly to capture great opportunities. Were all custodians of this land. It is our common ground. And thats what we need to do in order to protect it. So I commend this motion to the House, and I urge all my colleagues to do the same.","Agriculture: Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr HAINES (Indi) ","(18:27):"

407,0,0,0,1,2,"Pitt, Keith, MP",148150,"Hinkler","LNP","N/A",4001," Im dressed up for dams, would you believe! Were here in the Federation Chamber, its late evening and we are talking about critical water infrastructure. Quite simply put, as the previous speaker has said, if we want Australian agriculture to reach $100 billion in gross product value, then we need to almost double our existing agricultural production. Right now, its around $60 billion, and obviously therell be changes into the future, given the current state of the nation in terms of drought. If you think about that, if we want to almost double what we have now, that means we need twice as many activities. That means we need to ensure we have a reliable water supply.I made a few notes earlier. As a former producer I thought about what it was that was important to me when I made decisions, and it was risk, reliability, confidence and wealth. I think they are the critical decisions that every businessperson, whether they are in agriculture or not, thinks about before they make an investment and before they determine how much risk they want to take with their money, their assets and the future of their family. Right now, we need to ensure that that risk is as low as possible, and to do that you need reliable water supplies for agriculture and towns. We know that we are in a crisis state in a number of areas right across the country. We cant do anything about that—that is the position we are in. But we can provide hope and confidence to those individuals, those communities, those states and our nation if we continue to build big infrastructure projects. Whether that is water storage or connective infrastructure or irrigation projects, it doesnt really matter, because all of those things add into that decision matrix—risk, reliability, confidence and wealth. In Queensland right now, our growers—my local community—are struggling with all four aspects. I note the Prime Ministers announcements on the weekend of $1 billion for water infrastructure in New South Wales. The New South Wales government is willing to fast-track—not shortcut—approval processes in that state to make sure this infrastructure actually gets built. We have allowed bureaucracy to become the reason for inaction, and that simply cannot continue.In Queensland, my home state, we have a Labor government which is determined to build nothing. In fact, in recent weeks they have announced they will reduce the dam wall height of our youngest dam—it is just 10 years old or a little older—by five metres, reducing its storage capacity by 85,000 megalitres. To do that, they are letting out 110,000 megalitres of water in that storage down the river, and the political spin is that this is great news for drought-stricken farmers. As you know, Deputy Speaker Hogan, and I and others know, you quite simply cant take water at the time it runs past your gate and make efficient use of it. So this is complete spin. This weeks spin is that there is a safety issue, but it is unstated and unsubstantiated. No-one will tell us what the issue is. Our community deserves an answer. This dam was built and opened in 2016 with great fanfare by former Premier Peter Beattie—300,000 megalitres of storage. Its a big capacity dam in our region. It provides over 90 per cent water reliability to the growers in my area. As a result of that infrastructure, they have invested in tree crops—macadamia and avocado; long-term, high-level, high production, high-value products—because they had a reliable water supply.After these changes are made and if we end up with less water and less reliability, that will mean less wealth for our local community and fewer opportunities in the future. That dam had 100,000 megalitres of unallocated water. That is the future wealth of our community. I say again to the state Labor government in Queensland, if there is a safety issue with the Paradise Dam, tell us what it is. Be up-front. Our community accepts that there are challenges and that things change all the time. If you are in agriculture, you get it. One of the things you learn in agriculture is resilience. Tell us what the safety issue is. Be up-front, walk up to a camera, tell us what it is that needs to be addressed and how you are going to fix it and give us a commitment to return that storage capacity to that facility so we can continue to have confidence in our local community. Without it, I have had reports already of a fall in the value of our local agriculture land. That is unacceptable. Quite simply, the state is taking away our wealth. Right now, if you look at the Rookwood Weir, if you look at the announcements made in the western part of the state and if you look at what they are doing in Paradise, the taxpayer will be spending almost half a billion dollars to have less water storage than they do today. I think that is unacceptable, that is criminal and that is disgraceful—$500 million of taxpayers money to give us less storage than we have right now.","Agriculture: Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[2]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr PITT (Hinkler) ","(18:33):"
408,0,0,0,1,2,"Sharkie, Rebekha, MP",265980,"Mayo","CA","N/A",4002," I rise in the strongest of support for the member for Indis motion. Australian farmers are on the frontline of the war against climate change and primary producers are the most dependent of all Australians on the weather for their livelihoods. Droughts, floods and fires ravage our land, and more frequently than ever before. Repeated disasters and prolonged high temperatures are sapping the remaining environmental and agricultural resilience from our landscapes. If the current predictions come to pass, soon the entire length and breadth of the River Murray and the Murray-Darling Basin, the agricultural lifeline of four states and one territory, will be in the grips of a severe drought. Already most of the basin is the Bureau of Meteorologys severe deficiency category or worse. Yet the government has no coherent plan to address the medium- to long-term impacts of climate change on Australias agriculture. While immediate drought relief is desperately needed, throwing buckets of money at short-term solutions with no view to medium- or long-term climate change mitigation or adaptation is an abandonment of Australian farmers to a blinkered ideology of climate change denialism.The government should make no mistake: rural Australians are waking up to the hotter, dryer, harsher future that awaits them. I would say, in fact, that it doesnt just await them but is here now. If the government refuse to minimise Australias contribution to climate change, they can at least minimise its impact by properly preparing our frontline farmers for the hotter, dryer, harsher future it will bring. In practical terms, this means the government must design and implement the national strategy on agriculture and climate change that the member for Indi has just argued for in persuasive detail. We do not need bandaids; we need a comprehensive plan of attack. I join the member for Indi in championing a better future for our farmers.As a matter of urgency, the government needs to instruct the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to conduct a comprehensive review of the climate change risks in the Murray-Darling Basin to complement a national strategy on agriculture and climate change. It beggars belief that the impact of climate change has yet to be taken into account in the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and that the governments only plan to do so appears to be at the next required review, in 2026, which is still another seven years away. Another six-plus years of inaction cannot be defended. In my electorate of Mayo, our apple, pear and cherry growers are facing the new normal, which is severe hailstorms and hotter seasons with lower rainfall. Support for horticulture netting to protect our crops is an excellent example of a climate change mitigation measure, and its desperately needed. Ive spoken in this place repeatedly about the urgent needs of our growers. If we had netting, it would mean that we would use less water. There would be around 30 per cent less waste. We talk about growing to a $100 billion agricultural industry. Well, that is a real and very easy way that we can do it. And that netting needs to be right across the nation.Something that needs to be part of any national agriculture and climate change strategy is a floor for recurrent funding support for community environmental organisations. These groups are dedicated to their local environment because they love the country they live on and want to see it thrive and prosper. In Mayo, the Coorong, Lower Lakes and Murray Mouth Recovery Project, known as CLLMM, is an excellent example of how modest funds can really mobilise our communities to great effect. Their work has achieved so much to safeguard the Lower Lakes and the Murray from further devastation. The lack of government commitment to even the most modest of recurrent floor funding switches off the life support for these organisations. When disaster comes around again, as it always does in Australias landscape—and I have the most vulnerable part of the river; the mouth of the river flows through Mayo—the capacity to re-form these groups across the river is incredibly limited. We really need to make sure that we can provide longevity to these groups.The new environmental program that the government has announced is a step in the right direction. I urge the government in the strongest of terms to continue with significant expansion and increased longevity of these programs. If we want our kids to continue to eat Australian food, we need to invest in and support agriculture and the environment that surrounds it.","Agriculture: Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms SHARKIE (Mayo) ","(18:38):"
409,0,0,0,1,2,"Webster, Elizabeth, MP",281688,"Mallee","Nats","N/A",4003," The issue of climate change is one this government is taking seriously. Climate change is a global issue that requires a global solution. The Australian government is intentional in playing its part to reduce emissions, but it will not endorse targets which risk our industries, including agriculture. We have a clear plan to achieve reductions, evidenced by the $3.5 billion Climate Solutions Package, which will assist a range of industries to meet emissions targets. At the centre of the Climate Solutions Package is the Climate Solutions Fund, which will build on the success of the Emissions Reduction Fund. It is a strategy that is delivering results. The government is on track to meet its commitment under the Paris Agreement of 26 to 28 per cent reductions by 2030.The current crippling drought across eastern Australia has resulted in our farmers facing increased costs for feed for stock, watching crops fail or paying unsustainable prices for water. Farmers in these conditions are under increased financial and mental stress. That is why farmers need solutions to assist with these pressures. Investments need to be made in things such as energy storage and batteries, building insulation, pump upgrades and solar panels. Investments such as these can increase on-farm productivity by reducing energy consumption, which in turn helps our environment.It is important that we help farmers to make changes to their business, and that is why our government is launching a $50 million grants program called the Energy Efficient Communities Program. These grants will help eligible farmers make changes to their business, improving environmental and productivity outcomes, as they invest in energy efficient practices and technologies. Dairy farmers in Mallee are struggling to remain viable through the combination of drought, high water prices, low milk prices and high electricity prices. These farmers will have access to a $10 million pool in a grant set aside for the dairy industry in the Energy Efficient Communities Program.The Morrison-McCormack government is focused on practical help for families as they face rising costs of energy and for primary producers as they manage extreme weather events, exacerbated by ongoing drought conditions. We do this by taking action on climate change while growing our economy. The government has a clear goal for the agriculture industry to reach $100 billion by 2030. This goal supports the National Farmers Federation ambition. The government is committed to supporting farmers to get through this drought and thrive again.In communities across Mallee and Australia, the governments drought strategy is seeing great success. As Minister Littleproud has said, this strategy has three components: in the here and now, in the community, and into the future. In the here and now for farmers, in direct support to farming families provided with the farm household allowance, concessional loans are available through the Regional Investment Corporation. The RIC includes options such as $200,000 for restocking and replanting, as well as the drought loans and farm investment loans. In the community, the Drought Communities Program provides funding directly to local councils to assist their communities through building and upgrading facilities. This work, through the use of local trades and suppliers, ensures that money is being spent in the community and through local businesses. Our government knows that, when farmers are struggling, the community is struggling.The third step of our drought strategy is through the Future Drought Fund. We know in Australia that droughts are part of our history and will be with us in the future. We want to see investment in communities to recover from drought and prepare for future droughts. The Future Drought Fund will allow for $100 million to be drawn down from the $5 billion investment that has been made by the government to ensure future drought preparedness and resilience. This will mean sustainability for our farmers, farming communities and the natural resources on which our farmers depend.Our government has a stairway approach to managing drought. Until this drought has broken, and as this drought goes on, we will step up our support for farming families and their communities.","Agriculture: Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr WEBSTER (Mallee) ","(18:43):"
410,0,0,0,1,2,"Phillips, Fiona, MP",147140,"Gilmore","ALP","N/A",4004," I thank the member for Indi for the opportunity to speak on this motion today. Im sure it will surprise no-one that the relationship between agriculture and climate change is something I am very passionate about. Farmers on the New South Wales South Coast know a fair bit about the impacts of climate change on agriculture and farming. Farmers in my electorate have been suffering under this drought for years now. They are suffering from a drought that many have acknowledged is being worsened by climate change. They have been selling their cattle in the thousands just to survive. I can tell you that for a dairy farmer to sell their cattle is no small thing. It can take years to recover from such a drastic and heart-wrenching decision. But this is a choice that dairy farmers have had to make. Im not sure that this government has truly been listening.I have said it before, but Im going to keep saying it until it sinks in for those opposite: our dairy industry is in crisis. But only recently Mr Morrison decided he would rub salt into the wound for South Coast farmers. The Prime Minister flew back into the country after his US tour—a tour where he refused to attend the UN Climate Action Summit even though he was in the right place at the right time. His absence from the summit wasnt unnoticed by the international community either, with, among others, the vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stating that Australias absence was misaligned with a vision of Australia as a smart, innovative, forward-looking and lucky country.Mr Morrison flew back into the country to much fanfare. He was going to announce a new drought package. Farmers in my electorate felt a small flicker of hope. I felt it with them. Perhaps finally, the government had started listening and was going to provide some long-awaited relief. The announcement came—an extension to the Drought Communities Program of a further $100 million for drought affected farmers. While $100 million might not be as much as farmers had hoped for, at least it was something. But any hope local farmers in my electorate had was soon dashed. Eurobodalla Shire Council was not on the list of eligible council areas. Shoalhaven city council was not on the list of eligible council areas. Kiama council was not on the list of eligible council areas. This was a huge slap in the face for local farmers struggling to get by. In one sweep, the Morrison government effectively told South Coast farmers they are not suffering under the drought. He told South Coast farmers that they dont deserve help to deal with the real impacts of climate change on their livelihoods. He told South Coast farmers that he has, in fact, not been listening to their concerns. Well, I want to tell South Coast farmers I have been listening. I have heard you. I will not give up the fight.I have seen firsthand what happens when farmers give up hope. In my first speech in this place, I spoke about my dad, a dairy farmer. I still remember visibly his distress when he thought he might have to sell the family farm. My family was lucky—that farm is still going. But I hear from so many today who are facing these same struggles, from farmers who are paid less for their milk than it costs to produce it, from farmers who have to make the choice about feeding their families or feeding their cattle. These are choices no-one should have to make.What we need is a comprehensive and effective drought policy from this government. The coalition government has had six years to address the drought. It has had six years to help farmers struggling under the weight of Australias worst drought on record. After creating every drought body you can think of—a drought coordinator, a drought envoy, a drought task force—still we have no drought policy from the government. The National Farmers Federation got so fed up waiting for the government to draft a long-term drought policy it decided to draft one instead. The Morrison government have refused to release the drought coordinators report, claiming it to be cabinet-in-confidence. Why? What are they hiding? What dont they want our farmers to know? All we get from this government is words. They are all talk and no action. South Coast dairy farmers are sick and tired of words from this government. We want action. Summer is coming, Prime Minister. What about your drought policy?","Agriculture: Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[5]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs PHILLIPS (Gilmore) ","(18:48):"
411,0,0,0,1,2,"Archer, Bridget, MP",282237,"Bass","LP","N/A",4005," I would like to thank the member for Indi for moving this very measured and reasonable motion. This can be a very emotive and shrill topic that at times is saturating the media space with blame and division. There is a danger that we will see activism take the place of action, so I welcome a calm and collaborative approach to the issue. Thank you also for recognising the Morrison governments commitment to future-proofing Australian agriculture, including the Future Drought Fund and the Morrison governments commitment to climate change. Dr Haines and I share some common views and we see eye to eye on a number of these issues. Im sure that our discussions will continue into the future.Climate change is real and the effect of climate change is one that I see every day affecting farmers across Australia. As the spouse of a fourth-generation Tasmanian farmer, Im all too aware of what climate change means for those of us on the land. Climate change is a real and present threat to those in the agriculture sector. Beyond my own farming family, I frequently speak to farmers across my electorate who care about these issues. Farmers care about conservation and the environment—indeed, their very survival depends on how they care for their land.While there are always additional measures that I believe could be pursued, I would like to take the time to discuss what the government currently is doing in this space, as I do think much of positive action and strategies that are being implemented by the Morrison government are often overlooked. As mentioned by the member for Mallee, the Morrison government is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, in line with our Paris target. That is a credible, fair, responsible and, importantly, achievable response to global climate change, while also representing one of the most ambitious reductions in per capita emissions and emissions per unit. Our $3.5 billion Climate Solutions Package details how we will achieve the final 328 million tonnes of abatement needed to meet our 2030 Paris target, down to the last tonne. This includes the $2 billion Climate Solutions Fund, which will build on the success of the Emissions Reduction Fund and which has contracted 193 million tonnes in emissions reductions. That is the largest amount of emissions reductions in Australias history.Under this fund, farmers will be supported to revegetate degraded land and drought-proof farms. This issue has been discussed with me time and time again in my discussions with local farmers. During a recent visit to Bass, my colleague and Minister for the Environment, Sussan Ley, joined me in hosting a roundtable with representatives from our states peak farming body, the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association. During this meeting, and in subsequent meetings with the TFGA, there were significant discussions about further ideas that the association have for future actions. I endorse their proactive approach and will look to have further constructive conversations about how to effectively build on their ideas with my colleagues. This will help us to address the issues facing farmers.In the same way, I commend the Farmers for Climate Action organisation for their advocacy in the area of agriculture and climate change. I look forward to meeting with them again soon to discuss their call to create a national strategy on climate change and agriculture that is based on a consultative, co-design process involving government, industry, science research bodies, Australian farmers and regional and rural communities.I believe that it is by working collaboratively that we will make the greatest headway. One area where the government is making significant and lasting change is through the delivery of critical water infrastructure projects. There is vital investment in building our nations dams, including over $25 million in funding towards the construction of the Camden Rivulet Dam in my electorate of Bass as part of the Scottsdale Irrigation Scheme.I was very pleased to welcome the Deputy Prime Minister, Michael McCormack, in his capacity as Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development just a few weeks ago to inspect the progress on the Scottsdale dam. The dam is already half full and, when completed in February next year, will hold 9,300 megalitres of water. It will benefit more than 80 irrigators across more than 100 properties. It is critical investment such as this, along with a collaborative approach, that will address climate change and help to futureproof our nations agriculture.","Agriculture: Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[6]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mrs ARCHER (Bass) ","(18:52):"
412,0,0,0,1,2,"Steggall, Zali, MP",175696,"Warringah","IND","N/A",4007," I thank the member for Indi for raising such an important matter. The people of Warringah and I stand in solidarity with those in the bush and regional Australia who are doing it tough, experiencing record drought and the threat of bushfires this coming season. In recent weeks, Ive had the privilege of talking to farmers from across Australia, who are deeply concerned about their land and their futures. What these farmers are calling for is a comprehensive plan to address climate change mitigation, adaptation and resilience in the agricultural sector. This plan must sit within a broader national climate strategy across all sectors.According to the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility, agriculture is the sector that is most exposed to change in climate in Australia. Domestic agriculture accounts for 93 per cent of Australias food supply, $30 billion in exports and the jobs and livelihoods of workers employed in Australias 85,000 farm businesses. These statistics hide the human side. Many of these families are generational farmers—I have dairy farmers in my own family—with deep connection to the land. These are small tight-knit communities who all know each other, have shared weddings, triumphs and crop failures together. They are amazingly resilient, but they are watching the land change before their very eyes. Many have already been uprooted. We simply cannot afford, as a nation, to sit on our hands.Unless we equip the agricultural sector with the tools and goals to adapt to climate change, and unless we as a country, united, make urgent attempts to mitigate the risk, we risk losses in agricultural production, job losses and loss of export revenue, farm profits declining, food insecurity, increases in food prices and impacts on rural health. Increasing climate volatility and variability are already devastating parts of Australia. Indeed, the drought devastating the eastern seaboard can be seen as a prelude of things to come. To quote the Treasurer on his recent visit to the bush, it must be seen to be believed. If we accept the science, that we need to decarbonise and act, then this is only going to get worse. This is not a problem that is going away. If the very science that we accept on the need to change is telling us we need to do more than we are currently doing, then that is the collaboration we need to find in this place. So we must act.Farmers for Climate Action are calling for all Australian governments to commit to a long-term bipartisan national strategy on climate change and agriculture to 2050. The goals of such a strategy must be to minimise the risk to agriculture, food security and rural communities from climate change; help agriculture to realise opportunities to build value, make efficiency gains and diversify as the world shifts to low-carbon technologies; strengthen agricultural research, development and extension, which I note the drought fund bill goes some way to doing; build a clean energy sector with the benefits shared with the rural communities that host new renewable developments; realise the long-term potential of working landscapes to capture and store carbon; and identify the gaps in the current policies and programs, both federal and state, and fill them.Many of these steps have already been taken by individual farmers. We have farmers like Charlie Prell, who Ive had the pleasure to meet, who has 28 wind turbines on his land and is now benefiting from a diversified income stream. We also have Nic Charlian who has adopted land management practices that increase carbon sequestration and biodiversity and, as a result, while properties surrounding them are affected by drought, they have managed to remain productive.But we must broaden these practices to the whole sector, and that can only come through a national commitment. We need more than just individual action. So I thank the member for Indi for her motion, and I hope in this parliament we can find bipartisan solutions to climate change for our farmers and for our national prosperity. It is time for all MPs to stand up and be counted. To all government MPs: please, push for a conscience vote on this motion. Make sure you support it because words will not be enough.","Agriculture: Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[7]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Ms STEGGALL (Warringah) ","(18:57):"
413,0,0,0,1,2,"Mitchell, Brian, MP",129164,"Lyons","ALP","N/A",4008," I thank the member for Indi for presenting this opportunity for the parliament to discuss drought, agriculture and climate change. Many of us in this parliament do represent electorates affected at one time or another by drought, bushfires and floods. There would be few in this place who would say the events of recent years have not been the worst in living memory. History and science tell us that it is the worst not only in living memory but perhaps in recorded history.While farmers are by their nature a resilient and optimistic breed, the science, the data, the mapping and the research all point to hotter and drier times ahead, more extreme weather events and more unpredictability. While we may think of recent summers as the hottest in 100 years, we should start thinking of them as the coolest for the next 100. The rains will come again is a refrain I often hear from farmers in the midst of drought, but when was the last good season of downpour, the last winter of heavy snow, the last weeks of springtime showers? What evidence can we point to that can tell us with any certainty that the rains will indeed come again in anything like the measure that they used to and that they need to?Climate change should not now be and should never have been a tool for political pointscoring. That climate change has been fashioned into a weapon between the political Left and Right is to be deeply regretted. Science and facts know no ideology. All of us in this chamber and the parliaments, the congresses and the assemblies of the world must take collective global action, irrespective of our political colours, because climate change is undeniably the single most important area of public policy that confronts humanity today. We share one planet and one atmosphere. We are linked by the same oceans and skies. What we do in Australia affects our neighbours and, likewise, what they do affects us. We have a shared responsibility that transcends national borders.Climate change action may not be the most electorally appealing subject nor an area of policy that will garner the most media attention or, frankly, the most votes. But historically defence, national security and immigration are also areas that have generally flown under the electoral radar while remaining of critical policy importance. Elections are generally won and lost on economic arguments, but voters still expect us to deal maturely with other critical issues that dont get the same air time. You can be a coalminer and still want climate change action. We all drive cars and fly in aeroplanes. The challenge is to recognise that emissions are created and we must work to reduce them where we can.This parliament stands united in seeking to grow Australias agricultural output. Were currently inquiring into the opportunities and impediments to growing Australian agriculture to $100 billion by 2030. Climate change is one of those impediments. Agriculture is the most exposed sector in the country to climate change: I stood up in this parliament in the last sitting to draw attention to the Farmers For Climate Action report that calls for a national strategy on climate change, a transition to clean energy generation and the adoption of wider carbon capture and storage mechanisms. I am pleased that the member for Indi and the new Parliamentary Friends of Climate Change Action have taken up that call. Likewise, I support the National Farmers Federations call for a coherent national drought policy and a $1 billion ecoservices fund for farmers. They do incredibly important work and should be paid for it. The government could do much worse than take up the suggestion to implement these policy initiatives, which are drawn from people who have on-the-ground experience in our regions and who know firsthand the impacts of drought and climate change on agriculture.Australia has a great history of innovation, and we need to draw on that legacy now like never before. From restoring canopy to encourage rainfall to capturing carbon to improve our soil and from tackling desertification and salinity to implementing modern livestock management, aquaculture and clean energy generation, there is much we can and must do to diversify, enhance and promote Australian agriculture in the 21st century, and climate change action must be a part of it.","Agriculture: Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[8]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) ","(19:02):"
414,0,0,0,1,2,"Gillespie, David, MP",72184,"Lyne","Nats","N/A",4009," I rise to talk about this motion. One of the most important things to keeping agriculture sustainable is for our farmers to receive prices for their goods that allow them to make a profit. As you will appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan, living in an area with huge beef producers, sugar and all sorts of horticulture, the price farmers get is sometimes a result of the supply and demand curve. But in this country, paradoxically, because of the concentration of power in the hands of retailers, we often have the situation where it is not sustainable because there isnt a normal market operating. Instead of the regular supply and demand situation, retailers dictate the price and the processors or the raw producer have to fit the volumes and the price. It is unsustainable in so many areas. How ironic it is that the inaugural ACCC chairman, Allan Fels, the champion of free markets and competition policy, is now calling for a levy on fresh milk. That is very welcome, but how ironic it is. I assume that hes reached the conclusion that a lot of us on this side and some of those on the other side have reached, that the market is definitely not delivering for the dairy industry.Dairy farmers are the canary in the coalmine for many people out in the general community, but there are many primary producers, whether in horticulture or fruit and veg and in all sorts of processed goods, who have to meet price targets. Some of them even have to pay for the retailers advertising. They get a price but then they get told that they have to have rebates and they have to pay for advertising and they have to pay for shelf space. All this is under the radar and not seen unless youre in the industry.Dairy farmers have a very perishable product, like sugar, and they are price-takers, not price-makers. There is a huge bargaining imbalance between dairy farmers and their most common negotiator body, the processors, but there are some that deal directly with the retailers. Dollar-a-litre milk was the epitome. It was ruinous to many processors as much as it was to dairy farmers because there was a huge knock-on effect. The value of processors brand milks that theyd built up over generations was destroyed, was cut away with the switch in the milk volumes that they had to put into the no-brand milks. So they would get their premium brand price, but the volume switched. It was the old switcheroo, so then retailers could say, Okay, were giving processor X or processor Y their premium price, but next year were only buying 30 per cent of the volume that they sell us at that premium price and youll pay a different price. So, standard terms in these contracts are due to change.The long-awaited mandatory dairy code of conduct will address a lot of these egregious imbalances, but, as I see it, the problem starts at the top end in many instances. The prices negotiated between the major retailers with the processors are then passed on with unfavourable terms to the producer of the milk, the dairy farmer. All the risk is weighted at the bottom, onto the producer; they take the risk but they dont get the reward. Contract reform measures in the mandatory dairy code of conduct need to come in as a matter of urgency. The exposure draft is coming down the barrel of the legislative process. Its only a regulation. It cant come soon enough. Paradoxically, it is also hurting retailers, because many consumers use milk as a staple, as a benchmark for what other things cost, so they think everythings cheap.Milk is a very nutritious product. The whole processing industry relies on fresh milk, but the rate of departure from the dairy-producing workforce is scary, and its accelerating. We will all lose if this continues: the processors wont have enough fresh milk to process, the supermarkets wont have enough fresh product, and we will be losing industry as well as farmers and relying on imports.","Agriculture: Climate Change","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[3]/speech[9]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Dr GILLESPIE (Lyne) ","(19:07):"

It is a simple fact that Western Australias economy is at the heart of a successful national economy. But, sadly, when it comes to standing up for Western Australia it seems the true quiet Australians are the Western Australian members of the federal cabinet—Senators Cormann, Cash and Reynolds, not to mention the absence of the members for Pearce, Hasluck and Durack—when it comes to standing up for the multitude of things we need in Western Australia: investment in infrastructure, investment in housing, a fair national interest assessment on where we should maintain our submarines—just to name a few. We also have the member for Tangney, often referred to as the PM whisperer. Maybe, when it comes to standing up for Western Australia, he should speak just a little louder.It is unfortunate that Western Australia is left on the bottom of the priority pile when it comes to this government, because if it werent for the west then this governments economic narrative would be in absolute tatters. Western Australia accounted for some 16 per cent of Australias business investment in 2018-19. Western Australia accounted for some 51 per cent of the new mining capital in 2018-19. And when it comes to our merchandise exports, some 43 per cent of those exports come from Western Australia. In fact, if it werent for the Western Australian economy and the hard work of hundreds of thousands of Western Australians, there would have been negative economic growth in the 2019 April-June quarter—that is, we would potentially have been heading towards a recession. So the government does, as it says, want to get back in black this financial year. It wont just have Western Australian Bon Scott to thank for the fabulous song; it will also have thousands of Western Australians to thank for their hard work, their taxpayer dollars, their risk and their investment, which have actually delivered that surplus.For all that economic leadership, what does the west get in return? Im sure well have members from the government side come in and tell us about the things they did in the last term of government. When it comes to this term of government there has been only silence. This government has failed to invest properly in Western Australia. We only need to look at the desperate grab for Senator Patricks vote when assessing where our submarines should be maintained to see that. I have no doubt that the member for Fremantle will tell you about the $8.4 billion in investment that will be added to our gross domestic product if that work is given to Western Australia. He has been a strong advocate for his community; and, more importantly, a strong advocate for his state; and, more importantly again, a strong advocate for our national defence interests.Then, when it comes to one of the most important things for any family, health, again we see an absolute absence of investment in our public health services. We have the Royal Perth Hospital in desperate need of investment. Theres $22 million coming from the state government but, again, not a single dollar of capital investment funding from the federal government. There is nothing for the new womens and babies hospital that will make a huge difference to families across Western Australia and, as Ive spoken about many times, investment in homelessness services is sorely lacking.Western Australias housing debt, some $343 million at 30 June, is a debt that cannot be repaid; the federal government will not allow it to be repaid. Imagine if for once we actually worked together and had an agreement where they said, We will wipe the debt if you invest that money in homelessness and housing services. There are some 14,000 people on the housing waiting list in Western Australia and estimates of some 600 people sleeping rough in the Perth CBD in my electorate. Surely we can find the money and the common sense to invest properly in homelessness services?Then we get to the falsehood of the $100 billion infrastructure fund. No-one can tell me how much of that fund is going to Western Australia, but I do know that its less than 10 per cent and I do know that we have not yet seen any real action on the Perth City Deal.I will end, though, on a note of bipartisanship. Myself, the member for Fremantle and, I have no doubt, the members for OConnor and for Curtin will all be celebrating the new offices of The West Australian in a few moments time. It opened in 1833, but tonight, in 2019, The West Australian will open their new bureau here in Parliament House, and I commend them for that.The DEPUTY SPEAKER: Is the motion seconded?","Western Australia: Economy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[1]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr GORMAN (Perth) ","(19:12):"

419,0,0,0,1,2,"Hammond, Celia, MP",80072,"Curtin","LP","N/A",4012," I second the motion and I thank the member for Perth for his motion recognising the importance of Western Australia to the national economy.WAs importance to this country is greater than its contribution to the national economy, a point with which Im sure the member for Perth agrees, but time limits prevent us from waxing lyrical about our great state. Western Australia is the countrys largest state in physical size, covering the entire western third of the country and with a total land area of approximately 2.6 million square kilometres. Its surrounded by the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean, the Northern Territory and South Australia. There is over 20,000 kilometres of coastline.As we Western Australians know, Western Australia is far away from the rest of Australia. This is a fact that any sandgroper is well aware of every time they hop on a plane. That isolation and distance have some disadvantages but they also have enormous advantages, including how they shape our identity and our culture. Western Australians are a down-to-earth bunch of people—hardworking, innovative and entrepreneurial. Its a no-nonsense state, where people just want to get on with doing things. We are doers; there is no pretence.We are also enormously philanthropic and generous. Any doubt about that is put to rest every year by the Channel 7 telethon, an institution in WA for more than 50 years, raising in excess of $200 million in its lifetime. Its the highest-donating telethon per capita in the entire world.Approximately 2.6 million people live in WA, around 11 per cent of the national total, and I happen to agree with the member for Perth that WA punches above its weight in the national economy. Almost 50 per cent of Australias total overseas exports come from WA. We are a third of the land mass and only 11 per cent of the population, but almost 50 per cent of the exports come from WA. WA is the second-largest iron ore producer in the world.The Morrison government gets the importance of WA and, moreover, it gets the vibe of Western Australians as hardworking, can-do, get-it-done people. This government is investing in WA to continue to ensure it supports small business, creates jobs, fosters entrepreneurship and funds essential services like schools, hospitals and infrastructure; to ensure that our great state remains the best place in the world to live, work and raise a family. For the period of over 15 years from 2013-14 to 2028-29, over $13.5 billion is being sent to WA to fund land transport infrastructure projects. More than $5.5 billion was spent in WA between 1 July 2013 and 30 June 2019. A further commitment of $1.7 billion towards infrastructure projects in WA was made in the 2019-20 budget.The government has delivered tax relief to a projected 1.24 million Western Australians for the 2018-19 financial year. This includes 72,000 people living in my electorate of Curtin. This government is backing small businesses to help them get ahead and create jobs. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, particularly in my electorate of Curtin. There are over 26,000 small and medium businesses in Curtin which are benefiting from legislated tax relief and the governments instant asset write-off scheme.This government has been investing in industry and innovation in our state. For the period 1 July 2016 to June 2019 the government has supported and invested in our local industries and local innovators, including $8.5 million to the Square Kilometre Array, $74 million in total to 10 cooperative research centres, close to $20 million in funding to 417 businesses under the Entrepreneurs Program, and $2.4 million in funding from the Business Research and Innovation Initiative.Funding for health has increased. All local hospitals have had significant increases in funding. It has increased by approximately 70 per cent since this government came to office in 2013. Funding in education and skills has increased and will increase further, from $2 billion in 2019 to $3.2 billion in 2029. That is equivalent to a per student funding increase of 71 per cent for government schools and 43 per cent for non-government schools.As I said, I agree with the member for Perth that WA is a fantastic place. I will argue and advocate passionately and unashamedly for WA, but I also know that this government, the Morrison government, not only hears but listens and acts.

420,0,0,0,1,2,"Wilson, Josh, MP",265970,"Fremantle","ALP","N/A",4013," I think we can all agree that WA is a wonderful place. I thank the member for Perth for bringing the motion forward as a matter for discussion. I know he cares deeply about the community he represents and, more than that, hes working hard to advocate for Western Australia as a whole. We do need advocacy for our side of the country, especially from this side of the parliament, because in a number of key areas were not getting it from government members.WA is a remarkable and distinctive place, as others have noted. With only 11 per cent of the population, it accounts for 42 per cent of Australias merchandise exports, 15 per cent of GDP and an incredible array of arts, cultural and sporting output. We need and deserve funding and policy support thats specific to our circumstances. We need a fair look-in when it comes to infrastructure, jobs and services. But we arent getting it from this government. Ive made this argument a number of times over the last few years. Unfortunately, the song remains the same.In 2016 the coalition announced 78 road and rail projects Australia-wide. We got three—three out of 78. In 2017 the government announced the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages: $220 million; 10 projects. They were to help regions in Australia diversify their economies, stimulate long-term economic growth and deliver sustainable employment. How many of the 10 projects were in WA? Zero, even though some of the relevant WA regions had unemployment rates three times higher than those regions that were selected for funding.When it comes to the ABC, which this government has looked to chop at every turn, WA has taken a disproportionate hit as staff reductions across the board have seen jobs centralised in Sydney and Melbourne. In 1974, 8.3 per cent of a significantly larger ABC workforce was based in WA. By 2017 it was down to barely half that, 4.6 per cent, with no front-of-house staff, no general manager position at the time and no human resources or finance personnel. There was no outside broadcast van anymore. One had to come across the Nullarbor for special occasions. Altogether, that is a pretty bleak list of disappointments, but I want to touch on two further issues that have the potential to cast a long shadow over WAs economic and jobs outlook.The first is Defence shipbuilding. In 2018, the WA Liberals took out full-page ads in The West Australian newspaper saying that WA would be one of two Defence shipbuilding hubs. The ads said that the work split would be fifty-fifty between WA and South Australia, but that is not the reality. The reality is that, so far, we are getting $3.5 billion out of an $89 billion shipbuilding spend. That is less than four per cent. The opportunity to deliver a serious shipbuilding hub in WA now rests, as the member for Perth has said, on the question of whether the full cycle docking of the Collins submarines is moved to the Australian Marine Complex in my electorate of Fremantle. It makes sense to do so. Its in the national interest. It will ensure we have greater and more diversified infrastructure and workforce capability, but we wait to see whether the government keeps its promise or whether it will once again give WA the short end of the stick. I do remember—seeing that the member for Moore is here—that the member for Moore almost 12 months ago in a moment of brutal clarity said that one of his motivations for supporting the end of Malcolm Turnbull was the fact that WA was getting such a poor deal on Defence shipbuilding. But Im not too sure, Member for Moore, that that has changed in the 12 months since then.The NBN story for Western Australia is even more disappointing because, in many ways, the damage has been done. We have received the worst allocation of broadband technology under the disastrous multitechnology mix of all of the states. We have nearly half as much again of the 19th century copper line rubbish than the other states, in the form of fibre to the node. Its no surprise that, as a result, were bottom of the pile when it comes to broadband performance. The ACCCs Measuring Broadband Australia report says we have the worst broadband of any state, with the highest proportion of underperforming broadband services and the slowest average busy hour download speeds. In WA, more than one in seven households or businesses will not meet the national benchmark of 50 megabits per second. In New South Wales, its fewer than one in 10. It is more than one in seven for us and fewer than one in 10 for New South Wales. That is a serious digital divide in the largest and most remote state. When jobs are centralised elsewhere and people in WA are constantly told to get things done through a call centre or a website, we are lumped with much worse broadband than the big east coast cities.How does that occur? How do we get such a disappointing list of bleak outcomes, get short-changed or get the rough end of the pineapple? How does it happen? As with everything else Ive mentioned, it occurs because the Liberals take WA for granted. They have an embarrassment of riches when it comes to parliamentary representation, but theyre not embarrassed. And if they can get away with delivering very little for the west, they will— (Time expired)","Western Australia: Economy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[3]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr JOSH WILSON (Fremantle) ","(19:22):"
421,0,0,0,1,2,"Wilson, Rick, MP",198084,"OConnor","LP","N/A",4014," I commend the member for Perth for bringing forward this motion because it does give us the opportunity—as proud Western Australians, all of us here!—to talk about our great state. My colleague the member for Curtin has already touched on the fact that 50 per cent of the nations mercantile exports emanate from WA. We certainly do punch above our weight on the economy. My electorate of OConnor, of course, is one of the main electorates that produces that wealth, not just in gold, nickel, lithium and cobalt, and some of those products that are very important for the move into more batteries, but also in agriculture, where grain, wool and, of course, meat, both chilled and alive, are very important contributors to our nations exports.I know weve all got very short memories, Member for Perth, but there is one thing that hasnt been mentioned—three letters: GST. The Western Australian government is currently enjoying, in this 2019-20 year, an additional $814 million in its budget, which it can spend on any infrastructure projects and health projects that it chooses. We need to be reminded that it was the Western Australian members—my colleague the member for Moore will remember—who met many times with Treasurer Morrison, now the Prime Minister, to thrash out the details of the GST fix. In the couple of minutes while I was waiting, I went onto Google and I searched for Labor WA GST just to see what it threw up. Perth Now, on 4 November 2017 had the headline Bill Shorten admits Labor would not change GST carve-up system to appease Queensland. This was just prior to the Queensland election. It goes on to say:Bill Shortens Labor has slammed the door shut on fixing WAs GST rip-off and opened a rift with Premier Mark McGowan.Ive got to commend the Premier for fighting very hard to fix the WA GST problem.","Western Australia: Economy","PRIVATE MEMBERS BUSINESS","/hansard/fedchamb.xscript/debate[4]/subdebate.1[4]/speech[4]/talk.text/body/p[1]","Mr RICK WILSON (OConnor) ","(19:27):"

Currently found in Mediterranean habitats, increasing aridity and shifting rainfall patterns are placing many populations at risk of extinction, particularly those in the north of its range. The project will secure the species ongoing future by undertaking translocations to: (i) establish new populations in areas of suitable future habitat, to reduce the probability of total extinction. (ii) introduce genetic material from northern populations into those of the south, to broaden the species evolutionary capacity to adapt to climatic shifts. (iii) increase local population size, to mitigate against extinction from stochastic catastrophes. The project will cover the entire range of the species and will use innovative techniques to target on-ground conservation actions in priority locations.2017-18 to 2018-19$249,780#National Environmental Science ProgramThreatened Species Recovery Hub/Charles Darwin UniversityProject 1.1.10: Responses of the threatened Kangaroo Island Dunnart (and other threatened species) to cat eradication program, Kangaroo IslandAs described in Australias Threatened Species Strategy, a high priority for conservation of Australias biodiversity is the control of feral cats, particularly on biodiversity-rich islands.

The project is the last part of nine years of work to control over 11 km of a valuable section of the river. Following initial professional control the Finniss Catchment Group maintains control and enhances with replanting of provenance species, using best practice harm minimisation strategies.2018-19$10,000National Landcare ProgramEnvironment Small GrantsRoberts, Sally AnneRiver Form and Function Educational MaterialProduce a community-education package about the physical processes of river systems to increase the success of on-ground restoration works. River restoration projects are carried out by various landcare groups, for example, revegetation of riparian zones and other erosion-control and water-quality measures. These activities can involve the use of a lot of money and effort for on-ground works. However, these groups often lack an understanding of the physical processes that influence river form and function - ie, the hydrology and geomorphology (including impacts from catchment land use), and related habitats and ecology. A lack of this expertise can significantly reduce the success of on-ground river restoration projects.2018-19$30,000National Landcare ProgramEnvironment Small GrantsClayton Bay Nursery and Environment GroupRevegetation andremnant vegetationprotection - ClaytonBay foreshoreControl weeds and revegetate sites along the length of the foreshore trail at Clayton Bay. This project builds onto areas of natural vegetation and important habitat remaining in the Clayton Bay area, representing the largest and most diverse remnant area of lake foreshore vegetation in public ownership. Targeted planting of ground-covers, grasses, lower and mid-story species where appropriate will reduce weed germination and increase habitat and diversity.

The Government tracks emissions from vehicles on Australias roads in the following ways:In 2014, the Government published the Australian Motor Vehicle Emission Inventory for the National Pollutant Inventory (NPI). The report presents a motor vehicle emissions inventory for each state in Australia and is published at: http://www.npi.gov.au/resource/australian-motor-vehicle-emission-inventory-national-pollutant-inventory-npi.The Australian National Greenhouse Accounts track national on-road transport greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 onwards, and are used to meet Australias reporting commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol. The Accounts are prepared in accordance with the international rules applicable to the UNFCCC and its Kyoto Protocol. On-road transport greenhouse gas emissions are published in the Australian Greenhouse Emissions Information System (AGEIS) at: http://ageis.climatechange.gov.au/.The Quarterly Update of Australias National Greenhouse Gas Inventory isa publication series that reports on the latest estimates of Australias national greenhouse gas inventory. The latest official Quarterly Update provides estimates of Australias national inventory of greenhouse gas emissions (including on-road transport) up to the December quarter of 2018 and is at: https://www.environment.gov.au/climate‑change/climate‑science‑data/greenhouse-gas-measurement/publications/quarterly-update-australias-nggi-dec-2018.3) Following the allegations that Volkswagen Group fitted vehicles with emissions control defeat devices, relevant Australian Government agencies provided support and technical advice for the investigation and resulting enforcement action.On 1 September 2016, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) instituted proceedings against Volkswagen for alleged contraventions of the Australian Consumer Law related to diesel vehicle emissions claims. The ACCC alleges that Volkswagen made false and misleading representations when seeking approval to import certain diesel vehicles, and in marketing those vehicles for sale. This matter remains before the Courts.4&5) The Government is considering the case for introducing the latest international noxious emission standards for light and heavy vehicles (Euro 6d and Euro VI respectively).

In 2013, Australia imported 29 million litres of apple juice concentrates from all over the world of which 23.3 million litres (80%) were imported from China. (1000 litres=1 tonne)2.

The department does not have any data on the change in dollar value per tonne of locally grown apples that are used to make cider or apple juice.4. The attached table provides an indication of the size and composition of the apple industry in Australia – values, production, no. of trees and no. of businesses (Attachment A). This data shows that the value of the apple industry has increased from $238m in 1993-94 to $491m in 2017-18. However, production has dropped from 301 kilotons in 1993-94 to 268 kilotons in 2017-18.Attachment A available from the Table Office.5. The Department of Agriculture is responsible for monitoring compliance of imported food with Australias food standards and country of origin requirements, at the border. Post border, food for sale is monitored by State and territory food enforcement agencies, with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and state and territory fair trading agencies enforcing country of origin requirements. The department can only comment on its area of responsibility.To regulate imported food, the department operates a risk based border inspection scheme. Under this scheme, apple juice is considered a food that is low risk to human health, and is referred for border testing at a rate of 5% of consignments. This inspection includes a label and visual assessment and a fruit and residue pesticide screen.There have been five label fails recorded against apple juice products in the period 1 Jan 2009 – 31 Dec 2018. Each fail was against a different importer. A label assessment is carried out to monitor compliance with the relevant standards within the Food Standards Code. Of the five fails, four failed because importer details were either incomplete or missing and one failed because there was no country of origin declared on the labelling.Importers are penalised through increased inspection rates, which remain in place until a history of compliance is established. Under recent amendments to the Imported Food Control Act 1992, the department can also now issue infringement notices to non-compliant importers.6. Australian food laws require food for sale to comply with the compositional and labelling requirements in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code (the Code), including a specific standard for fruit and vegetable juice. Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ) develops and maintains the Code. State and territory authorities are responsible for compliance and enforcement of the Code.Country of origin labelling is regulated by a mandatory information standard administered and enforced by the ACCC.","Imports (Question No. 113)","QUESTIONS IN WRITING","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[20]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","N/A","N/A"

In 2008, the age standardised imprisonment rate for Indigenous prisoners was 1,769 per 100,000 adult Indigenous population. In 2018, the rate was 2,481 prisoners per 100,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population. The Australian Institute of Criminology reported in 1999 that the Indigenous imprisonment rate in 1998 was 1,557.9 per 100,000 (Australian Institute of Criminology, Australian Corrections: The Imprisonment of Indigenous People, November 1999).(2) State and territory governments are responsible for operating the justice system in their jurisdictions including policing, jails and courts. In a December 2018 Statement on Closing the Gap, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) committed to finalising the Closing the Gap Refresh in genuine formal partnership with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The Statement included two draft targets, to be led by state and territory governments, to address the overrepresentation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the criminal justice system. These draft targets will inform ongoing discussions for a refreshed agenda, to be finalised through a Partnership Agreement between COAG and a Coalition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peak Organisations.The Australian Government is working with state and territory governments and communities to tackle the underlying causes and risk factors that can lead to contact with the justice system. The Australian Government provides funding for a range of activities which aim to:prevent young people from engaging in offending or antisocial behaviour and divert them away from the justice system,change offending and antisocial behaviour, including intensive support for people exiting detention,reduce alcohol and substance misuse, andimprove social and emotional wellbeing through connection to culture and community.Through the Attorney-Generals Department, the Australian Government also funds Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services throughout Australia to provide legal representation, advice and support to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to overcome their legal problems and fully exercise their legal rights.(3) & (4) The Australian Government is currently considering the Australian Law Reform Commission Report Pathways to Justice—Inquiry into the Incarceration Rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples.","Incarceration Rates (Question No. 189 and 190)","QUESTIONS IN WRITING","/hansard/answers.to.questions/debate/subdebate.1[31]/answer/talk.text/body/p[1]","N/A","N/A"
