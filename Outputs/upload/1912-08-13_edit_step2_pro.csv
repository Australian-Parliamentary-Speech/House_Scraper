100,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"FORREST, John","KFJ","Swan","N/A","N/A",2022,".- There is a general impression, which I hope as unfounded, though there appears to be good ground for it, that the military authorities have not much sympathy with rifle clubs. That opinion is held very strongly by riflemen in Western Australia. They have complained bitterly that they do not even receive the same consideration which is extended to members of rifle clubs in other States. They complain especially that in the matter of rifle ranges they are treated with scant consideration, and generally have to take what is left after all other branches of the Defence Force have been attended to. I think that these Estimates show that there is something which justifies this complaint. I hope the Minister of Defence will give his attention to the matter. It will, I think, be agreed that this very desirable and useful branch of our Defence Force, composed as it is of mature men who take an enthusiastic interest in accurate rifle shooting should be encouraged to the utmost extent. I notice that, taking the Estimates as a whole, last year ,£61,376 was voted for rifle ranges, and only £22,504 was expended ; £16,943 was voted for drill halls, and only £3,799 of this amount was expended. In connexion with these two items, no less that £52,016 was unexpended out of a total vote of £78,319. Referring especially to Western Australia, included in the subdivision now under consideration, £49,328 was voted last year, and only £18,780 spent. Honorable members will see that the votes for rifle ranges and drill halls count for a considerable proportion of last years vote. Under the subdivision, ;£3°>548 of the amount voted last year was unexpended. For rifle ranges, £11,665 was voted, and only £801 spent, leaving £10,864 unexpended. In the circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that riflemen should be discontented, and should feel that they are not receiving the consideration to which they are entitled. For drill halls last year there was £5,531 voted, and of this amount £5,156 was unexpended. I see that only £3,783 is asked for this year under this heading, or less than the amount which remained unexpended from the vote for last year. We pass Estimates in this House, and that seems to be about the end of the matter, for the Department apparently does nothing. Last year £2,700 was voted for three items - £1,300 for a boatshed, £800 for medical field equipment, and £600 for a port war-signal, and not a penny of this money was spent. Then there was an item of £1,409 for command telephones at Fremantle, and only £89 of this vote was spent. In spite of this fact, only £100 is asked for this purpose on these Estimates. It is evident that some one must have blundered. I see that £1,029 was voted last year for a storeroom at the Tammin Railway Reserve, and only £28 of this vote was spent. The Departments ask for money, and do not spend it when it is voted. They then ask for much smaller votes for the same purposes in the next year, and this shows that those concerned really do not understand what they are about. They do not appear to know what is wanted. I was told the other day that it is intended that all the rifle clubs in Australia shall be treated in the same way. All I can say is that they have not been treated in the same way up to the present. In some States members of rifle clubs receive railway passes, while in my own State of Western Australia they do not. A good deal is done to make provision for rifle ranges in some places, and very little in others. I ask the Minister of Home Affairs to see that money is spent when it is voted. Nothing is so unsatisfactory as to induce people to believe that they are going to be given something and then not to give it to them. Rifle clubs should be treated with great consideration. They represent a branch of our Defence Force capable of great expansion and usefulness. Our defence system . is a system for the youth of the country up to the age of twenty-one, and to a smaller degree up to the age of twenty-five; the mature manhood of the country has no obligation for any service except in time of emergency. The mature manhood of the country must, therefore, be encouraged to take up the rifle club system and practice shooting. We know, however, that the riflemen are enthusiastic, and enthusiasm should be encouraged wherever and whenever found - in rifle clubs or in any other direction which tends to the good of the country. The Boy Scouts, for instance, are looked at askance by the military authorities; but those boys are enthusiastic, and will, I hope, eventually merge into the military system. I urge the Minister to take into consideration the matters to which I have drawn attention, and to see whether he cannot to a greater extent than in the past year see that the money voted for any year is expended in the directions intended during the year.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[1]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
101,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"GLYNN, Patrick","KCO","Angas","N/A","N/A",2023,". - I am glad that the honorable member for Swan has called attention to the question of rifle clubs. Some months ago an enthusiastic supporter of these clubs spoke to me about what he considered the damper that is. thrown upon them in South Australia by the military authorities, who do not seem to give the support that might be expected to what I think can be shown is a very good associated body in connexion with our Military Forces. I made a few notes on the matter at the time, though I do not intend to refer to them now except to say that it is somewhat significant that Major-General Hutton, when he went back to England, after telling us that 45,000 troops in time of war and 25,000 troops in time of peace were sufficient, expressed his belief in the compulsory training of cadets as likely to lead to voluntary enlistment. In a speech which he made at the Isle of Wight, and which was reported in the Times of 10th March, 1906, he recommended that the rifle club system should be encouraged as a means to the creation of a solid system of national defence. He believed that a national militia army provided the best means of defence under our Anglo-Saxon form of government ; and to this end he particularly recommended the encouragement of rifle clubs. I took the trouble at the time to consult the statistics relating to rifle clubs, and I found that in 1901, when we had a militia and volunteers of the total strength of 28,812, there was a rifle club membership of 32,833. We seem to have gone back by 1905, owing to the fact, if my memory serves me aright, that when we commenced our Fede1ral Defence Department with an expenditure of about ,£890,000, we struck off £196,000 the first year, without the slightest regard to the possible objective either of defence or offence, or to the proportion that should exist between the naval and land forces. In fact, we did this, as I mentioned at the time, in blind disregard of the fact that we had not settled on any definite policy. In 1903-4 we had almost reached the nadir in connexion with military matters, when the military expenditure was only £458,000. By 1906 there seems to have been a little encouragement given to/ the rifle clubs, because the membership then was 37,000. In 1907, the then Minister of Defence, who was, I believe, Sir Thomas Ewing, expressed the opinion that we ought to prepare for an army reserve of 800,000, to be reached in nine or ten years by the annual training of 200,000. Subsequently this estimate was: brought down by Lord Kitchener to about 120,000 men. I have my own opinion on this question of conscription, but I do not intend to enter into the matter now, though I may have an opportunity on a subsequent occasion. In that year, when the Deakin Government was in power, some encouragement was given to rifle clubs; and Sir Thomas Ewing stated that the total force, including .rifle clubs then amounted to 68,000 men, including a club membership of 48,000. My purpose is served if I call attention to the fact that there is an opinion abroad that the military authorities desire uniformity to the exclusion of everything else. This is characteristic of military men, though it does not follow that they will stick to the one line of development they have adopted, because none vary so much as they. Without speaking too strongly, we may say that the military authorities do not seem to be affording that enthusiastic encouragement to the youth of the country to join rifle clubs that ought to accompany the development of our Military Forces.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[2]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
102,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"KELLY, William","KEA","Wentworth","N/A","N/A",2024,".- The question of rifle clubs is one that should be earnestly grappled with by whatever Government may be in power. This is not a question of making grants to clubs in the general expectation that increased grants will bring increased political support. It is a question of what is owing to the country as well as to the rifle clubs - of how to properly encourage Australia to take an interest in rifle shooting, and, at the same time, to make the rifle club organization fit in with the general purposes of the Defence Department. My own view is that the riflemen of Australia are only too anxious to fit in harmoniously their skill and patriotism with the necessities of the Department; to help in the training, especially in the direction of musketry, of the levies that are being made under a system of compulsory training. But the Defence Department is not treating the rifle clubs well ; it is not even treating them fairly. The Department is, apparently, coquetting with them ; and, at the same time, ignoring them when they come half way to meet the Department. For instance, a week or two ago - since when I have been absent through ill health - I gave some information to which I once more direct the attention of the Minister. I cited instances where the Defence Department had been, on two separate occasions, in communication with rifle clubs ; and in one of these cases when the rifle clubs actually came forward and enthusiastically agreed to do what the Department desired, the whole matter was pigeon-holed and left in abeyance. That is not the way to encourage and bring within still more useful confines an invaluable movement like that of the rifle clubs - it is the way to kill it. The present Ministry is, in my opinion, deserving of a certain amount of censure, inasmuch as they have either permitted this state of affairs, or have not taken sufficient steps to prevent such things occurring. I suggest that the Minister take an early opportunity to go into the whole matter.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[3]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

104,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"KELLY, William","KEA","N/A","N/A","N/A",2024,"- As the honorable member knows, in Defence matters I have no regard for party. What I say is that, in this particular case, the Ministry is to blame for either one thing or the other ; either they have connived at the present state of affairs, or they have not been keen enough to prevent it arising. I hope it may be found to be merely a lack of keenness ; and that some real anxiety will now be shown by the Department to avail itself of the patriotism and skill contained in our rifle club organization.I take this opportunity to refer to a matter on which information has been, I am afraid, denied to me and the country. I refer to the item of £80,000, under the head of  Various States and Federal Territory, for the acquisition of sites for and the erection of mobilization store buildings and drill halls for the Defence Department. I think I may properly refer here to a piece of departmental maladministration during the course of the present year with regard to a proposal to transfer the Victoria Barracks from Paddington to Double Bay. For a long time the Paddington Municipal Council have wanted - and every honorable member who has studied their case must sympathize with ft - the Commonwealth either to shift the Victoria Barracks from the municipality or to make them some payment in lieu of the rates which the Commonwealth would have had to pay for municipal services rendered, but for its constitutional exemption from taxation. The Government said, in reply to the municipality, that if they could be given a site in some other place equally suitable for military purposes, and at equal cost, they would be delighted to make the desired transfer. The next thing we know is that General Gordon, whose opinion was asked on the matter, strongly resisted any proposal to leave the Victoria Barracks. He stated that the site was one of really very great value. His exact words appear in Hansard, and I do not wish to weary honorable members by quoting them again. He pointed out most clearly, and in the most unequivocal language, that, from the departmental view, it was absolutely essential to retain the Victoria Barracks at Paddington. Then there appears on the papers which I hold in my hand a minute from the Minister directing General Gordon to inquire about a site for barrack purposes in Double Bay. The Ministers direction was very vague. It gave no indication of how the matter originated. It simply directed General Gordon to make a report on this question. He took his orders from the Minister - he looked into the matter. It is very singular that on a matter of such importance, involving, according to those interested, an expenditure amounting to £120,000, but which, with proper estimates of depth of water, and so on, would have landed the Commonwealth in an outlay of at least £250,000, General Gordon, forgetting his previous report, with the greatest expedition recommended this new proposal. What are -its advantages? The Minister, who is taking upon his own shoulders now the whole responsibility in order to shield a man prominent in the Labour movement outside, says, and wishes the House to believe, that he had himself set before General Gordon the advantages of this proposal, and possibly that is why General Gordon changed his opinion with extraordinary speed - in a fortnight ! The alleged advantages beggar description they are ludicrous. Let me give some of the advantages for which the Minister wishes to take the fullest responsibility. He says that we will save rent. How shall we save rent if we incur a capital expenditure of £250,000? It means that the interest on this enormous charge is going to be the rent. The Minister says that offices and other places will be concentrated. _ They are already concentrated in the Victoria Barracks, far more so than the exigencies of the Department require, because it is decentralization more than concentration which is needed under the area system. The next alleged advantage of this proposal is that it will provide access to the forts by water. Why, every fort in Sydney already has access to the water ! An expenditure of ^£250,000 in Double Bay is not required to give access by water to the forts surrounding the heads in Sydney. Other alleged advantages of the proposal are said to be the saving of expense on cartage, wharfage, and handling, the better supervision of a number of things, and that all stores for camp can be lightered to the various places. Why can they not be lightered at the port in Sydney, instead of being lightered to Double Bay, handled, and put back on board a train in Sydney? Again, we are told that in the event of an expedition to the Northern Territory stores can be placed directly on board the steamer. Did any one ever hear anything so ridiculous as that ? The great city of Sydney, with a population of half-a-million, and the biggest shipping south of the line, is unable to provide sufficient wharf accommodation for ships bound to the Northern Territory, and it is, consequently, necessary for the Commonwealth to Buy private properties in Double Bay, and reclaim land at an expense of about £250,000. We are also told that drill grounds can be obtained at Double Bay, and that the site is handy to the forts. A number of places are handy to the forts, but we do not wish to obtain them. It is stated, too, that the site is equally close to Sydney as the Victoria Barracks. It is also claimed that it is safe from bombardment j so is Yass-Canberra. Now, that stamps the reply of the Minister as a piece of humbug - endeavouring to take the responsibility on his own shoulders, because we know that he is a sensible man. He would not, looking at the thing from the Commonwealth p6int of view, himself put forth anything so utterly ridiculous and silly on behalf of the site.The plans and estimates give this proposal a still more sinister appearance. In estimating the cost of reclamation, the depth of water is, of course, a matter of enormous importance. But what do we find here? The depths of water given in the plan are actually less than the depths of water shown on the Admiralty chart, and, to my knowledge, a great deal less than the depths of water in the bay. I was bred there, and, as a boy, I sailed boats there very often. The depths shown on the Admiralty chart are the low water depths. When a man thinks of reclaiming land, it is necessary to go some 5 feet above high-water mark in order to get an estimate of the amount of filling-in which will have to be undertaken. That item is grossly underestimated, and, remembering the secrecy with which the whole matter has been covered up, I consider this most sinister. The Committee is entitled to the fullest information as to how and why the proposal originated. Whoever got it carried into effect would have made a bit of money. The properties that were to be resumed are of great residential value, among them being one belonging to my own family. It was largely because a person - myself - interested in a place known to be for sale came to the Department of Home Affairs, and told them that the thing was a swindle, that it was stopped. That the Minister has practically admitted in this chamber, as reported in Hansard. Now, when a man has a large residential property for sale which cannot be sold easily, he is prepared to give a pretty high commission to any one selling it. For that reason I have asked - and I have been refused - -information as to the prices put upon these properties by their owners. If a property can be bought by a private individual for, say, £16,000, and is under offer to the Commonwealth for £30,000, it is a matter of considerable public importance that the fact should be made known. Why should Ministers keep these facts secret?","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[3]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The negotiations had actually gone to the extent of valuing the territory for the purpose of its acquisition. The Minister of Home Affairs told us that he was going to acquire the site, and the Prime Minister said that the Government were going to take it over. Then some of the owners of the land objected to its being taken from them, and their action assisted the Victorian section in an agitation against the selection of any site that was not in the Federal Territory. They urged that the College must not be established anywhere save in Federal Territory, and that was the plea on which the site at Burraneer Bay was turned down. At that time there was no talk about the Geelong site. It was urged that the College should be established in the Federal Territory, and a site was selected there, but that was not what the Victorian members wanted. Notwithstanding all their talk about  a broad national outlook, notwithstanding their contention that all Federal establishments should be erected in Federal Territory, they really desired that they should be established in and around Melbourne, and, after all, Geelong, figuratively speaking, is only a biscuits throw from this city.

Although that site was reported upon as the most suitable for the purpose, the Government, yielding to the various opinions expressed by some of their supporters, and the .pressure of Victorian criticism from some other quarters, turned it down, and said that they would establish the College at Jervis Bay. The last thing that these Victorians desired, however, was the provision of this, or any other Federal requirement, in Federal Territory. What they desired was the spending of money in Victoria. The present proposal was then brought forward. Certain influences were at work, the result of which was that Osborne House was ultimately selected on the plea that it was necessary to establish a temporary College. On that plea, the Geelong site was selected, and the Government now propose to spend more money on it. The Estimates do not show how much is to be spent.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[70]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Will he tell the Committee what is the estimated total cost of the acquisition of the site and the erection of the mills. The vote now under consideration is only a vote on account, and gives no hint of what will be the ultimate cost under this heading. These woollen mills, again, should be established in Federal territory. Why does not the honorable member for Corio, who views these matters from a broad national standpoint, raise his voice against the establishment of these mills at Geelong? Here is the honorable members opportunity. I should have expected him to say, in dealing with this vote,  I had not the slightest idea that this item \v.as on the Estimates. I am amazed to find that it is proposed to spend this money in my district. I am not a provincialist, but a nationalist. From the broad national point of view, therefore, I ask that this item should be struck out of the Estimates, and the money expended in the Federal Territory, in acordance with my previously expressed principles. If all the Victorians have a broad national outlook, surely the honorable member will not let that outlook be bounded by the confines of Corio Bay. I cannot believe that he belongs to that parish pump type of politician whose views are so circumscribed. Let us see whether there is that patriotism in his composition about which we have heard so much, and whether he is statesman enough to rise to the occasion, and demand that these works shall be placed in Federal Territory. I await with expectancy the speech of the honorable member, in order to learn how far his patriotism and nationalism extend, and how much sincerity there is behind this cry we have heard so frequently and so loudly from the Victorian section about taking a  broad national outlook in regard to this public expenditure. I have read the report submitted, and it seems to me that there has not been sufficient inspection of the Federal Territory by the expert, Mr. Smail ; that a number of districts within the Federal Territory which are suitable for woollen mills have net been visited by him. Before this money is expended, there ought to be more complete investigation, in order that we may have a more reliable report on which to form1 a judgment. The claim that there is not sufficient water in the Territory is absolutely discounted by the records of the gauges of the various rivers, which show an abundant supply for electric lighting, the domestic use of a large population, and all other purposes. There is not only one source of supply, but several, seeing that there are six or eight rivers and watercourses ; and to suggest that there is a scarcity is a view which cannot be substantiated by other reliable engineers reports in possession of the Committee. I move -That the item, Woollen Mills ... towards . cost, ^8,000, be left out.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[82]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We shall have to employ numbers of girls and youths who will have to be trained to the woollen industry. We could not get the necessary labour within the Capital area. I give the Government credit for their decision in this matter. They have determined that each of these Federal enterprises shall stand on its own basis. The manager has to show that he can manufacture woollen articles such as are required by the Defence Force, at a cost which is not in excess of that for which they can be manufactured by private firms. I believe the actual cost will be much lower, but the manager could not obtain such results if he has to overcome obstacles in the matter of labour and sanitation. Moreover, if the factory were established at the Federal Capital, there would be no facilities for conveying material to various portions of Australia when made up.

Would he not like to have the  opportunity of claiming that our so-called Socialistic schemes had proved a failure, as would be the case if the Woollen Mills were not established at a suitable site? The Minister of Home Affairs has shown sound business ability in adopting the experts report. No Minister, indeed, with such a report staring him in the face could conscientiously have acted otherwise. Evidently the expert - whom I do not know - is well fitted for his position. He has brought sound knowledge to bear upon the problem, and has reported to the best of his judgment. I am not acquainted with Geelong. I have never been there. I have no personal interest in this matter, because I am well aware that there is no suitable site in East Sydney. But I believe that the Government have come to a wise decision. I am glad to know that the Government are in earnest in reference to the barracks at Paddington. The late Government did nothing in the matter. I have earned credit as being the only live member who has ever represented East Sydney, and who has got anything for the constituency. I believe that the Government are with me in the matter, and that, at the earliest moment, the barracks will be shifted, and the present area turned into one for business or habitations. I regret the exhibition which the honorable member for Wentworth has made over this subject. Those who look at it calmly will realize that what is proposed is wise. The Redleaf site might be made into a splendid one for the purpose without great cost. I know the shores of Sydney Harbor, and know the property well. I am aware that the Woollahra Council are up in arms on the subject, as are also the Paddington Council. Both fear that the roads in their districts will be much injured through the removal of material from one place to another. I quite sympathize with them in that respect. A number of gentlemen who have palatial residences in the neighbourhood of Redleaf are also concerned. The site is one of the most beautiful places in Australia. It is one of the finest residential parts of Sydney, and house-owners there fear that the building of a barracks in the district will destroy the value of their property. They are quite justified in drawing attention to that aspect of the matter, and I am prepared, as I am sure every honorable member is, to assist them. But f cannot use language strong enough to condemn this attempt, on the part of the honorable member for Wentworth, to try to belittle a gentleman who believes that he is doing something in the interests of the country. Presuming that that gentleman believed that he would be doing something in the interests of the Defence Forces by causing the present barracks to be removed to another site, he had a right to take action, and slurs should not be cast at him. Innuendoes should not be made to the effect that he took this action because he thought it would be of some financial use to him. Public questions should not be treated in that way. We should take a broader view of public matters. 1 hope that, instead of casting slurs upon each other in this House, we shall all try to work in the best interests of the people, and that honorable members will deal with possibilities, and not suggest impossibilities, with a view of endeavouring to create the impression that there is something dirty involved in the action of the Government. I am satisfied that there is nothing dirty in this matter, and honorable members ought not to resort to such tactics. Suggestions of such a character should be treated with contempt. If an honorable member has not obtained a truthful statement concerning any public question, he should not set out on a fishing inquiry, with a view of casting aspersions on others who are doing that which they believe to be in the best interests of the community. Parliamentary life would be greatly improved if honorable members refrained from making imputations that have no foundation in fact - imputations the making of which show that they have diseased minds, and are not fit to represent the people of Australia.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[161]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The honorable member for East Sydney, according to his own statement, is so capable of looking after the affairs of his electorate that I do not propose to assist him in that work ; but I wish to point out the miserable failure of his attempt to whitewash his own action and that of the Government in connexion with the selection of a site for the Commonwealth Woollen Mills. Although he protests that he is acting in the best interests of the country, and that he does not view these matters from a parochial stand-point, the electors of, not only East Sydney, but New South Wales as a whole, will want to know why various sites in that S:ate. which were submitted to the expert, were not examined by him.

That is a very serious statement, especially when made by an honorable member supporting the Government. Are Ministers prepared to sit quietly under such a grave accusation coming as it does from one of their own members? The Government cannot allow to go by the board the charge made by one of their own supporters, that they nobbled this expert; that the whole matter was fixed up before he left Melbourne; that it was only a farce to send him on tour, and that he did not investigate sites which, in the opinion of many, are superior to that which has been selected. I support the honorable member in the view that it is a disgrace that the expert was not allowed to visit sites that were prominently brought before him. The Government have declared that their policy is to establish  all Commonwealth factories and Federal institutions within the Federal Territory itself. It was in accordance with that principle that a site for the Naval College was selected at Jervis Bay. But in this case the Government expert was not even sent to inspect the Federal Territory. It is ridiculous for the honorable member for East Sydney to say that in a territory comprising 900 square miles it is impossible to find a place where the refuse from a woollen mill could be discharged.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[162]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I cannot understand why the honorable member should do an injustice to his own State and to the policy of his party by declaring that there is not in the whole of the Federal Territory a spot where the refuse from a woollen mill could be properly drained. Such a statement will not bear investigation. The honorable member supports the statement of the expert that he visited the Federal Territory, but I say that he did not do so; he visited only one portion of it. It is true, as the honorable member has said, that the expert visited Yass-Canberra, but he did not go to that portion of the territory which the Commonwealth Government insisted on taking over, with full sovereign rights, from the Government of New South Wales. He did not go within 150 or 200 miles of it, and it is therefore begging the whole question to say that he went to the Federal Territory to look for a site for the Commonwealth Woollen Mills. The municipal authorities of Wollongong and the Progress Association at Port Kembla brought before the Minister the suitability of a site for the .woollen mills in that district, yet when the honorable member for Nepean and I saw the expert at the Commonwealth offices, Sydney - at a time when he could easily have inspected the proposed site there - he knew nothing about it. He did not even know that it had been brought before the Ministry. Why was that site overlooked? This fact appears to bear out the strong accusation made against the Government by the honorable member for Nepean, that the expert was  nobbled  before he left Melbourne. The honorable member for East Sydney referred to the difficulty in the way of securing workmen for the Woollen Mills at the Federal Territory, but if that line of argument is to be pursued we shall have no factories there whatever.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[166]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I repeat that if none of this money is to be spent on the permanent College at Jervis Bay that will be a gross breach of faith on the part of the Government. In connexion with these matters, Ministers would appear to be merely the creatures of their environment. They are influenced in every matter by the fact that the Parliament meets in Melbourne. In the first instance, Geelong was selected as the site of the Naval Training College, and it was only after the visit of the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Home Affairs to Jervis Bay That that place was selected. They had never seen the place before. They had opposed the establishment of the College at Jervis Bay in the previous Parliament, but after visiting the place they were delighted with it, and considered it the finest site they had seen for the purpose. They would not at the time give a definite answer as to whether the College would be established there. They came back to Melbourne, and a Cabinet meeting was held. I have the result of that meeting in a letter from the Minister of Defence to the effect that the Naval College, both temporary and permanent, should be established at Jervis Bay. But a movement was started again in Victoria, with the result that Victorian influence was sufficiently strong to secure the establishment of a temporary College at Geelong. So far as I can see, it is not the intention of the Government now to devote any of this money to the establishment of the permanent College at Jervis Bay.

Railway and shipping facilities. Condition of labour market. Geographical position as a distributing centre. Local conditions, re efficient and economical working.Keeping these instructions in mind, Mr. Smail visited some thirty-three centres, and many honorable members, in their places in the House, asked that he should be directed to inspect other places.

Mr. Smail proceeds - and I have no hesitation in saying that the idea of establishing a factory there is a long way in advance of the economic conditions that must prevail for its successful establishment.And his reasons are given in the following words -There is no definite lay-out plan of the city, no water supply, no drainage, no railway, no population ; in fact, everything is against the establishment of an isolated factory.Mr. Smail says further and I quote this particularly for the benefit of the honorable member for Illawarra, who, apparently, has not read the report -Presuming we did establish it there in spite of the present conditions, we should be up against abnormal cost on every preliminary item towards erection of buildings and fitting of plant and machinery.Mr. Smail goes on to state that a big population would be necessary; and this Government, as an economical Government, with a desire to save as much of the taxpayers money as possible, have taken their present action. Only the other day honorable members opposite were charging the Government with extravagance; and yet it would appear that the desire is to induce the Government to still greater expenditure by establishing the Woollen Mills in the Federal area. Would honorable members opposite establish the mills in Federal Territory ? Honorable members opposite are silent.

With regard to a site for the clothing factory we are told that the expert was  nobbled  before he left Victoria, and we know, as a matter of fact, that he did not visit many very suitable sites in New South Wales. Many of the arguments which have been brought forward against establishing the Woollen Mills at Yass-Canberra have been quite ridiculous. For instance, the honorable member for East Sydney said that it could not. possibly be established there because there was no drainage. If the plans and specifications are drawn out for the erection of a great city in the Federal Territory surely there must be plans drawn out too for sewerage, and drainage. We know, of course, that a sewerage and drainage scheme must be carried out before the Capital can be built. If we can carry out a scheme for the drainage of a large city there should be no difficulty in providing for the drainage of a woollen factory. With regard to the other expert who was employed, I assume at considerable expense to the Government, to report upon a site for the Naval College, what became of his advice? Was this report ever published, or put before the House? I confess that I have not seen or heard of the report. We do not know even now, and I am not aware whether honorable members opposite know, which site Captain Chambers recommended as a site for the Naval College. Experts are employed by the Government, and honorable members on the other side have told us that either they are  nobbled  or that their expert advice is absolutely disregarded We find that, although Captain Chambers is employed as an expert to report on the various sites, the Government were not satisfied with his report, and appointed a Committee to inquire into various sites, and they selected a site at Burraneer Bay.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[204]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Speaking here on 7th November, 1911, with regard to the establishment of the Naval College, Mr. Frazer, the Postmaster-General, said -Whether the college is established at Middle Head, in Sydney Harbor, or at some other site, the necessity for it is immediate. Its establishment is not dependent upon a view which might subsequently be held as to the suitability of Jervis Bay or any other place for the purpose. It must be undertaken at this particular time. The Government, under the advice of, I may be pardoned for saying, the most distinguished Minister of Defence, who has occupied that position in the Commonwealth, propose to establish the College at the site which has been chosen.He was referring to a site chosen by a Committee, and not by Captain Chambers. Continuing, he said -This is an urgent matter recommended by the distinguished Naval officer who was brought from the Old Country to advise the Commonwealth Government in the matter of Naval defence, and are we to refuse the generous offer of the subscribers to the Dreadnought fund because the proposed Naval College is not to be established in Federal Territory? What did we do in connexion with the Cordite Factory?It seems, from these remarks, that last year the Postmaster- Genera I was in favour of accepting the recommendation of Captain Chambers, namely, that the Naval College should be established on Federal Territory, in order that the Government should secure the Dreadnought fund. On the top of that we read of the appointment of a Committee. On this subject the Postmaster-General said, in a later speech -The Minister, to the best of my knowledge and belief, appointed a Committee to select the most suitable site on which to establish a Naval College to train the youth of Australia, who are ultimately to be drafted into the Australian Navy. The Committee selected a site, the sum of ?43,000 was made available, and we now submit an item to give effect to the proposal in order that we may have the officers and men necessary for our Navy.The Government met in caucus, I believe, and, in spite of the recommendations of experts or Committee, decided that, after all, the Naval College should be erected in Federal Territory at Jervis Bay. Why did they employ experts ; why did they appoint a Committee ; why did they go to all this trouble, if they did not intend to take the slightest notice of the recommendations? I take exception to the expenditure of this large sum, if some of it is not to be spent on the permanent site for the college, and that is at Jervis Bay.- These Estimates are very vague. \Ve are not told whether any portion of this money is to be spent on the permanent site for the college or not, but I believe that a considerable portion is to be allocated to Osborne House, at Geelong.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[204]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Another point to which I wish to draw attention is that as to every item in this subdivision, the amount that we are asked to vote is  towards cost. In only one instance are we given any idea of the expenditure to which we are finally committing ourselves. As to other votes we have not the faintest idea as to the ultimate sum that will have to be expended. I have gone through the Estimates pretty carefully, and I am inclined to think that the sum of £4,000,000, which we are asked to vote, will commit us finally to not less than £16,000,000. In every, case the Minister ought to give us a clear and detailed estimate as to the ultimate sum involved. There is at the present time a greater reason why this should be done than there has ever been before, because the Government are pledged to carry out the greater part of these works by day labour. We have no check whatever as to whether the works will be conducted on a reasonable basis, or whether they will be finished at a cost anywhere near the departmental Estimates. In every case where an amount is voted  towards cost  we should be supplied with an estimate showing the utmost expenditure contemplated.I should particularly like some information in regard to the sum to be voted for the Military College. Last year we expended £[68,454, and this year we are asked for another £45,000, making a total of £113,454. I should like to know how many of the permanent buildings of the Military College will be completed when this money is spent? I understand that the greater part of the expenditure, so .far, has been upon temporary buildings, which will eventually be supplanted. How much will the Military College cost when completed?","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[231]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

We ought to know definitely to how much expenditure we are to be committed. As he has observed, we have already spent £68,454, and we are now asked to vote another £45,000. There is no guarantee that even this will be the final expenditure on the College. I admit that it is necessary that the buildings should be erected. But at the same time our military expenditure is growing too rapidly altogether. While it is growing in one direction there are others in which there is not sufficient expenditure in the interests of those who are compelled to serve. It is not fair for honorable members to be expected to vote money for this purpose year after year without knowing whether next year and the year after another £[50,000 or £100,000 will not be required.

We ought to know the estimated cost of carrying out the complete plans. I enter my protest against this sort of thing, and hope that the Minister will be able to explain how much the Military College is expected to cost altogether. As to the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, I agree that, as far as possible, Federal works should be established in the Federal Territory. I have asked myself, however, whether it is possible at present to erect these mills upon a satisfactory basis in the Federal Capital, and I have come to the conclusion that it is not. It has been contended that if we do not establish Commonwealth works in the Territory, we shall never populate it. It is well known, however, that provision cannot be made to-day in the Territory for employes, and especially for the class of employes that would be required in a woollen mill. Boys and girls rather than adults are required, and where, I ask, should we be able to obtain them ? The Federal Capital has no railway communication. It is in its infancy. The formation of its streets has only just been commenced, and those who go there at the present time have to camp in tents. In such circumstances, what hope is there of establishing the Commonwealth Woollen Mills in the Territory.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[232]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

358,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"CHARLTON, Matthew","JXA","N/A","N/A","N/A",2046,"N.- The .question we have to consider is whether it would be profitable to delay these works for five, eight, or ten years, as the case might be, until we could obtain facilities to establish and carry them on profitably in the Capital. To my mind, we ought to be able now to provide the requirements of the military, and, in fact, of the whole Commonwealth service, so far as woollen goods are concerned. I therefore think that the Government are acting wisely in proposing to erect the Woollen Mills on the site recommended by the expert appointed to make a selection. The question with me is not whether they should be in this State or that, but whether they should be established, and whether the site chosen is the best for the purpose. I cannot say that it is, or is not. I have to be guided by the expert, who has no reason for recommending  any particular site, other than the belief that it is the most suitable for the purpose. After all, the main point to be considered is that we should establish these works where they can be carried on as profitably as possible. If we were to erect them, either this or next year, in the Federal Territory, I venture to say that they would be a failure. The* product of the mills would cost considerably more than it would, perhaps, in any other part of Australia, and the result would be that we should have the cry that a Commonwealth venture - something savouring of Socialism which had been taken in hand by a Labour Government - had proved a distinct failure. If we were to erect the Commonwealth Woollen Mills in the Federal Territory before the provision of the necessary facilities for carrying them on, they would be doomed to failure. For that reason, and believing, as I do, that it is necessary to establish them in the interests of the Commonwealth, I am going to support the Government proposal.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[234]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Sometimes a vote cannot be expended for the reason that an agreement cannot be arrived at in regard to the price asked for a particular site. In several places where I thought we should have no trouble in securing a site for a drill hall, the price asked was so high that it was impossible to go on unless we engaged in litigation, and made a lot of trouble. We do not wish to take citizens into the Law Courts in regard to every little question that may be raised, and, that being so, we have often to refrain from purchasing a site, with the result that work for which provision has been made has to be postponed. I desire to call the attention of the Committee to the fact that we have now decided to have in readiness a large sum on which we can draw without keeping people waiting when a drill hall needs to be erected. I agree with the honorable member for Richmond that we ought to spend this money in those parts of Australia where the rainfall is heavy, because in such districts it is often impossible for young men to drill at night time. On the west coast of Tasmania, I have seen young fellows take shelter under verandahs until a shower has passed, and then resume their drill. If we are going to make the compulsory training system a success, we must not be afraid of spending a few pounds. A few pounds for the defence of this great country is nothing.

But the Committee would like to know a great deal in connexion with some very important items in these Estimates which the Minister has not yet told us. One of the most important is the progress of the Federal Capital. We have heard a good deal about what ought to be established there, the plans of railways, and so on, but we have been given no idea of even the approximate time within which we may hope to see this Parliament settled there. Some six years ago the Government Architect of New South Wales .informed me that he was not only prepared to place before Parliament plans of all the Parliament Houses in the world, but to undertake to erect what he called the kernel of a Parliament House to accommodate the Senate and the House of Representatives, buildings for the public servants, and a residence for the Governor-General with- in two and a-half years, at a total expenditure of £250,000.

It is altogether impossible to start an enterprise of this kind in the Federal Territory under existing conditions. I want to know why the existing conditions are such as to prevent that? If the Government had made some attempt to carry out the designs upon which so much money has been spent, honorable members would not have been able to use as an argument against the establishment of the Woollen Mills in the Federal Territory that it is at present a wilderness, and that there is no provision made for the people who would be employed in connexion with them. It is on this account their establishment in Victoria, in temporary premises, at the cost of about £9,000 is justified. Two years ago I asked the present Government to take into consideration the suggestions of the Government Architect of New South Wales, and begin what that gentleman had called the kernel of the Parliament House. Directly that is commenced and occupied, habitations will spring up, notwithstanding that the land is leasehold ; and we shall immediately have the nucleus of a city which will enable us to place an enterprise of this sort within it.

Those barracks cover an area of, I should say, 5 to 8 acres, which represents an enormous property in the centre of one of the most populous neighbourhoods of Sydney - a neighbourhood as populous as Collingwood, in Melbourne. This area at present is devoted entirely to barracks purposes. If the Commonwealth Government are prepared to make some arrangement, I know that the municipal council of Paddington would be very glad to get rid of the barracks, for the simple reason that they would like to see the ground covered with houses, from which rates could be obtained. I do not agree with the honorable member for East Sydney as to the roads. The long road which runs on one side is the main road, and carries a tramway, and it is a road which will exist when the barracks are forgotten. The other two roads at the end are filled with terrace houses, and entail no more expense to keep in order than do the roads of an ordinary suburb. The lower road has not much traffic, because on one side is a reserve, and on the other side the barracks. However, the primary cause of the desire of the municipality to get rid of the barracks is that they may be able to obtain rates from the area. The proposed substituted land known as  Redleaf  is a private house on the margin of a beach, with Other private houses to the right and the left.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[280]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

In no other Parliament in Australia do honorable members consent to vote money away in chis reckless fashion and without having first submitted to them some plan of the proposed expenditure. Here, for instance, is an item of £80,000 towards an estimated expenditure of £300,000 for the acquisition of sites for the erection of mobilization store buildings, and drill halls. Where are these store buildings and drill halls to be erected? Surely there is some plan or purpose in the mind of the Minister when he asks for the expenditure of this huge sum ! Let it be remembered that in voting this item of £80,000 we shall commit ourselves to the expenditure of £300,000. I am not complaining of the amount of the expenditure, but of its purposelessness and its planlessness. In New South Wales, and I believe in Victoria, any public work involving an expenditure of £20,000 is first of all inquired into by a Public Works Committee, and the details of the -expenditure, together with plans and -almost specifications, have to be laid on the table of the House. But in this case we have the bald statement that a sum of £80,000 is wanted towards building mobilization store buildings and drill halls. Where are they to be placed, when are they to be built, and of what material ? Have we nothing to do with these matters ? Every other Parliament insists upon being furnished with information of this description. We have nothing of the kind here, but are asked to vote the money, and put our blind trust in the Government. It is a case of  Open your mouth and shut your eyes, and see what King OMalley will send you.  Pay up and look pleasant, and do not ask any questions  seems to be the idea dominating these Estimates. It is about time that honorable members awoke to a sense of their responsibility as trustees for the expenditure of the public money. I submit that we will not discharge our duty unless we get from the Government a broad plan of this expenditure indicating to us where, how, when, and under what conditions it is going to be incurred.

Wherever it has been decided to erect a drill hall, the site is named, and the estimated cost stated in separate items, as will be seen by a perusal of the Estimates. Having entered on the policy of constructing drill halls; that policy cannot be stayed in any one electorate. We cannot say that the little boys of Parramatta, the future electors of that constituency, shall have drill halls, but that money shall not be spent on drill halls elsewhere. But having embarked upon this policy, it follows as a matter of course that where drill halls are required, they will have to be erected. As the whole system is entirely new, and as we are quite unable to say where drill halls are needed, or how many of them are required, it is impossible for the Government to set down either the places at which they will be erected, or what will be their cost. But, in keeping with the general policy of this Parliament, and with the desire of the Government that our boys shall be provided with sufficient shelter to be drilled under, we have set down £80,000 upon these Estimates-","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[317]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

They can say how many bricks, how much mortar, how much timber, and what quantities of other materials will ba required. They can calculate the cost to a few pounds, even in a very large sum.

The Minister has not satisfied me with his explanation in connexion with the Military College. The sum of £68,454 _ has been expended, of which between £12,000 and £13,000 was spent on permanent buildings, leaving something like £56.,000 to be spent on temporary buildings. I go a long way with the honorable member for Parramatta in thinking that there should be some estimate of the cost of a building, showing also its size, the specific purposes for which it is required, and its character. These particulars should be laid before honorable members when they are asked to vote money. At present we do not know where we are. I object to voting money without knowing what the total expenditure on a particular work is going to be. The Government architects ought to draw up complete plans, and we should know the anticipated cost of every building. I do not say that they can estimate the cost to a pound, or even to a few hundreds, in the case of big buildings ; but we should have some guide. At the present time we drift along from year to year, and do not know what we are doing. This year it appears £45,000 is to be added to the £12,000 already expended on permanent buildings for the Military College. That makes £57,000, in addition to the £56,000 spent on temporary buildings. I think it is a fair thing that we should be informed whether the £56,000 ir likely to be sufficient for present requirements.

Their action is not taken in any spirit of antagonism. Their desire is to help both sides. That is generally the spirit in which the honorable member for Parramatta speaks, and the object of the criticism is generally to assist honorable members opposite. As to this, particular item, the point made by him is perfectly clear. . He says that we have here an item of £80,000, which purports to be a commitment for £300,000, and that neither the Minister of Home Affairs nor the Minister representing the Minister of Defence can mention one district in which it is intended to expend any of that money.

Apart from that matter, however, I think that this objection ought to be seriously entertained. We are asked to authorize an expenditure of £80,000 in respect of this item, yet the Minister has not given us the slightest hint as to what proportion of that sum will be required in respect of sites, how much will be required for mobilization stores, and how much for drill halls. The Minister ought to take it for granted that this Committee is prepared to vote all that is necessary to make the compulsory defence system absolutely efficient, but at the same time we want to know that we are working according to some definite plan and system. If we are to have these mobilization stores, surely they are to be built according to a definite system. Surely their location is not to be fixed in some haphazard way. Our contention is that before these proposed vor<-s are agreed to, the Minister should give the Committee some information as to the lines on which this expenditure will be made. That was the point made by the honorable member for Parramatta, but instead of being given the information for which he asked, he was subjected to extraordinary criticism. The Minister said with perfect frankness that he did not know what it would cost to put a piece of mortar here or a bit of timber there; but surely those who are advising him have before them a definite scheme. They must know the lines on which they intend to work. If they do not, there will be chaos in the Defence Department. I hope that the Minister will show us that the money is to be expended according to a definite system. The Committee, I am sure, is willing to vote all that is necessary for the Military College, but we ought to have from the Minister an assurance that these so-called temporary expenditures are to be limited in some way. As regards the College it is about time that we had some idea of the permanency of its design, so that we may know that the money now being expended in connexion with it will be devoted to the establishment of permanent buildings in accordance with a definite plan, even if the work is being carried out piecemeal. It will be a costly matter for the Federal City itself if the Government spend a lot of money upon temporary wooden buildings, which they will have to pull down later on. I believe that the Minister will keep his eye upon all expenditure on the Federal City so that what we are building now may become part of the permanent buildings of that city. Our desire is that the city, when completed, shall be something of which Australia can be proud ; but we certainly do not wish to see a large sum wasted there. As to the Commonwealth Woollen Mills I am not going to raise any question in reference to the site, but I should like to obtain some information.

Last year £5,800 was appropriated, and only £2,881 was expended. There seems to be almost a fatality about these wireless stations. For a year or two everything was almost in a matter of scare as to the urgency of these buildings, but somehow or other matters have fallen into a state of strange quietude during recent months. I think it is time that the Minister was able to tell the House that some of these buildings have been completed, and that soon we shall have them in working order.

When I saw it some time ago it seemed to me an excellent piece of work, well constructed, and in every way suitable for its purpose,, and I understood from those in charge that it was almost ready for use. That was four or five months ago, and only the other day I heard that it is possible to easily and satisfactorily communicate from the station with Sydney. In the meantime the people of Fremantle are unable to use it to communicate with the vessels of the Peninsular and Oriental, Orient, NorddeutscherLloyd, and other steam-ship companies trading with the port. The Pennant Hills station, near Sydney, is still unutilized ; and we are not told from what cause. If there are any legal difficulties making it inadvisable for Ministers to give us information, I do not wish to complicate the position, but if Ministers have information that they can give us, I should like to know for the satisfaction of the people of Western Australia when the station will be open.

It is not with any satisfaction that I criticise unfavorably the administration of this Department, because I recognise the magnitude of its work, the complexity of many of its problems, and the difficulty of keeping abreast with its vast business. It is the duty of honorable members to take an interest in this great, valuable, and important service, and to bring under the attention of the Postmaster-General matters of which he ought to be cognisant. By so doing, the public may be granted the increased postal facilities to which they are entitled, especially in view of the fact that we have now reached a period when no plea of insufficient funds can be put forward. The time was when Postmasters-General, upon being confronted with numerous demands, were obliged to give the stereotyped reply that, owing to lack of funds, those demands could not be granted. Today, however, there is an abundance of funds available in this connexion. Yet the Department scarcely keeps abreast of the improvements effected in other parts of the world. In view of the lateness of the hour, I shall endeavour to summarize my complaints as much as possible. In the first place, I wish to draw attention to certain suggestions which I made to the Postmaster-General on the 27th October last, shortly after my return from England. They were to the effect that the Department should institute inquiries into a number of improved and progressive telegraphic and telephonic instruments which are in use in London. As will be seen by reference to page 1950 of Hansard, I asked the Postmaster-General whether he would cause inquiries to be made and official reports obtained respecting the practicability and advisability of introducing, in connexion with the Commonwealth Telegraph Department, a number of telegraph instruments, said to embody the latest improvements in telegraphy. Among these were the Creed receiver and attachment, used to translate electrical signals sent by Wheatstone methods into printed messages ready for delivery. This Creed receiver is really a wonderful instrument, and it is strange that in a Department like our Post Office no attempt has been made to introduce such a time and labour-saving appliance, which would greatly add to the efficiency of the Wheatstone instrument. It is an appliance which actually prints the messages from the tape as it emerges from the Wheatstone instrument. I also asked the Postmaster-General whether he would inquire into the Hughes telegraph instrument. This appliance is fitted with keys corresponding to the letters of the alphabet, and these are worked like the keys of a piano. The instrument is capable of printing messages as they are received from the tape, and forms one of the marvels of the Central Telegraph Office in London. But an even more wonderful instrument is that to which the third paragraph of my question relates, namely, the Baudot instrument. This is fitted with five keys, and is capable of sending four messages each way at the same time along one and the same wire, and of printing each message as it is received. All these appliances have been demonstrated by experience in London, Paris, Berlin, Rome, and India, to be of great value, and ought, therefore, to be utilized in all great Departments, such as the Postal Department in Australia. Fancy an instrument which is so wonderfully constructed that eight messages can be sent over the same wire simultaneously, and these messages actually come out of the instrument printed ready for delivery. When I saw these marvellous demonstrations, it struck me that, despite all our boasted progress, we in Australia were not sufficiently up to date. I could not but wonder what our officers had been doing that they had not directed attention to these scientific devices, by which not merely time and labour, but money might actually be saved. I was informed that when the Baudot instrument was introduced into India, it resulted in the saving of thousands of pounds, which would otherwise have been absorbed in the construction of telegraph lines, because of the possibility of utilizing one wire to send four messages each way simultaneously.- I invited the attention of the Postmaster-General to these matters on 27th October last year, and I was informed that -No unnecessary delay will take place in the introduction of the system when a decision has been arrived at.Since then Mr. Hesketh has been to London. What he has done I do not know. But I invite the Postmaster-General to redirect his attention to these matters, in the hope that something will be done to hustle the Department, and to insist upon our officers bringing our telegraph and telephone services up to date. They cannot plead poverty or want of funds ; and, particularly in connexion with the building of new lines, such as the proposed transcontinental railway and other means of communication to our distant outposts, the Postmaster-General should insist on these new instruments and devices, which have been demonstrated to be successful in England, India, and on the Continent of Europe, having a fair trial. The reproach should be no longer laid against our Post and Telegraph Department that it is behindhand. I have not seen any reports from Mr. Hesketh as to those services.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[402]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

573,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"QUICK, John","KYJ","N/A","N/A","N/A",2062,"- I hope that the Postmaster-General will place himself in communication with Mr. Hesketh, and insist on something being done. The head man in the Central Office in London told me that there would be no difficulty in introducing these machines into Australia ; that if our Department required advice or assistance, or the loan of some of their experts to teach our officers to use these delicate and, it may be, complicated instruments, men would be lent on the same terms as they were lent to India, without any premium. I hope that the Postmaster- General will devote his best judgment to this matter. I shall be happy to place at his disposal the report which I have received from the Central Telegraph Office in London. I have no desire to worry or nag at him, but I do think that the time has now arrived when I might reasonably expect an answer to a question that I put last year. I think that if the Postmaster-General gives special attention to this subject, he will be forced to give these improved machines a fair trial, and not allow Australia to lag behind any longer. The result will be a saving in money, and also in working expenses, which will fully justify any extra expenditure incurred in procuring these instruments, and bringing them into action. I wish now to draw attention to a matter which requires explanation. Although Parliament last year placed at the disposal of the Postmaster-General a very liberal grant for erecting telephone and telegraph lines in various parts of Australia, the Department has not seemed to be able to avail itself of the money that it applied for. Upon referring to page 239 of these Estimates, honorable members will find that £700,000 was actually appropriated last year for new telephones and telegraphs. Below that sum is mentioned an amount of £600,000, which was ordered to be placed to the Trust Fund for telephones and telegraphs, constituting special works. It was pointed, out that that procedure might result in difficulties, and consequently the £600,000 was included in a special Appropriation Act. The Act is to be found on page 95 of the Volume of Statutes for 191 1. It contains a schedule, appropriating an amount to special works. So that this sum was set .aside under a special Act of Parliament in addition to the £700,000 contained in the Appropriation Act. I find by reference to the Prime Ministers Budget speech, Hansard, page 1575, the following passage -In addition to the amount of ,£830,000 provided this year for telegraphs and telephones and for wireless telegraphy, the Department will probably spend ,£429,460 the balance unexpended of the ,£600,000 specially provided last year and paid into a special Trust account.What I wish to draw attention t.o is that of the £600,000 paid into a special Trust Account for telephones and telegraphs, only the small sum of £171,000 was spent last year.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[402]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I had no desire to reflect on any one, and I made my request as polite as possible. The official statement as to the causes of the delay is set out in several paragraphs.

That would not have involved the employment of a large staff. Honorable members generally complain of the delay in carrying out these works, and one of the causes assigned is the want of material. This expenditure of £600,000 was authorized last year, and one would think that the Department could have obtained a supply of material from the Old Country within six months. I ask the Minister to inquire what orders for material have been sent to London since the Department have had money available for the purpose, and why this shortage of material has occurred. It seems to be to a large extent inexcusable. Even the occurrence of the shipping strike extending over three months is not a sufficient ground for the extraordinary delay that has taken place. A further cause of delay in constructing this line was stated as follows: -A further delay of three months and three weeks caused by failure on the part of certain officials at the General Post Office, Melbourne, to forward to Raywood the wire to be used in the construction of the line.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[426]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

These delays, which may be occurring in other directions, show the necessity for Ministerial scrutiny and vigilance. If these matters are not closely followed up by the Minister, the Department may get behind with its work, and there is sure to be a slackness which will lead to criticism. I offer this criticism with a view of placing before the Minister information that will give him a more commanding position in his Department. Unless he is informed of the facts, he cannot rectify a grievance. Something ought to be done to speed up the Department, and to induce it to obtain a ready stock of material for carrying out small works of the kind to which I have referred. If I were in office, I should insist upon an ample supply of such material being available. If the trouble were due to a lack of delicate telegraphic instruments, one could understand that there might be delay in securing them; but there cannot be any scarcity of wire»in the great markets of the world such as would justify the plea of the Department. I hope that as the result of these suggestions the Minister will be able before long to announce that the Telegraph Branch has been equipped with some of the up-to-date instruments that I have specified, and that the departmental resources have been brought up to the demands of the public. I could enumerate complaints of the character to which I have referred, which have come from various districts, but I do not desire to do so. Complaint as to delay in carrying out small works is general. Only to-day I received from a constituency which I do not represent, and shall not mention, a letter complaining of delay in carrying out ordinary telephonic extensions.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[428]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

Just before the close of last session the Postmaster-General was asked how many country telephone lines were approved, how many lines the Department expected to construct during the year, and how many were under consideration. Speaking from memory, I think that the answer was that ninety-six lines were approved, that forty-eight were expected to be constructed during the financial year, and that 132 were under consideration. The work of telephone construction has been going from bad to worse in the last twelve months. There is a gross lack of ordinary business management evident. If the Department were run on business lines, it would not be in the position in which it was placed in New South Wales, when it had not a coil of wire to carry on necessary telephone extensions.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[431]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

The first excuse given for delay in construction was that the Department could not get the necessary labour. After consultation with the mayor of Tenterfield, and some residents along the line, I had all the necessary labour promised, and expert labour at that. When I sent this information to the Department, they sent back word that they had no wire. I went to Sydney, and discovered not only that they had no wire, but that the quantity under order would not have kept them going for more than a fortnight. I believe that in due time some wire did come to hand, and when I made fresh application for the construction of this line, I got the reply that the Department had no insulators. So we get one excuse after another. The figures given by the Postmaster-General, in answer to the question put to him last session, were a sufficient indication that the Department were getting behind with their work. The Postmaster-General told me here, two days before the session closed, that he was ashamed to give the House such an answer to the question. But since that time matters have gone from bad to worse. Necessary work that has been approved is piling up, and people have been waiting for years for necessary telephone lines.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[431]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There are two centres in my electorate where butter factories have been established, and have applied for lines which have been approved. The population is increasing, and there is any amount of business waiting for the lines. Any one who knows anything about a butter factory will know that it must be in direct communication with a shipping centre, so that the managers may learn exactly when to ship their butter. This is particularly the case in the district to which I refer, where shipping is somewhat uncertain, owing to the state of the harbor. I hope the Government will endeavour to carry out these works expeditiously. They have the money, and all that is required is a little ordinary business management, to see that supplies of the necessary stores will be kept on hand.

There is another phase of telephone construction which requires reforming. I refer to the case where residents are prepared to contribute a certain proportion of a total cost of a line, either in material or cash, if the Department find that they are not justified in constructing the line under the guarantee system or as a public line. The Department declines to make any refund even when a line becomes payable, and earns full interest and working expenses ; and this seems to me to be an injustice.

The present Government have done much in the way of voting large sums of money, the bulk of which, I believe, has been properly expended in country districts ; but it is, perhaps, impossible for them to keep pace with growing requirements. Private telephone lines mean that money has not to be paid out of the Treasury, and that, in the future, so much money will not have to be borrowed as might otherwise be the case. I certainly think that, as the residents are prepared to take the risk to the extent of one-third or one-half of the cost of construction, there should be a refund in the case of the success of the line, for the Department derives the whole of the benefit of the revenue. There is no necessity for a subsidy from the people, for, in other cases, where a line shows an immediate prospect of paying, the Government bear the whole of the cost. Some time ago, when this matter was under discussion in connexion with some lines in Sydney, the Postmaster-General said, when I unsuccessfully moved an amendment, that he would like to look into the -matter, and try to liberalize the conditions. The amendment I then moved was to the effect that in the case of all those lines where a contribution had been made to the cost of erection by private persons or public bodies, and the lines had subsequently become paying lines, the Governor-General in Council should refund the full amount contributed. The request I make is a reasonable one, and I think it ought to be granted.Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta; [11.0]. - I notice that while the sum of £17,850 is proposed for the installation of metallic circuits in New South Wales, £98,500 is proposed for a similar purpose in Victoria ; and there was the same disproportion last year.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[438]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I want now to refer to the answer which was given to me this afternoon by the Prime Minister, when I sought information regarding what is now known everywhere as  the manonthejob. I, in common with other honorable members, was anxious to obtain from the right honorable gentleman information regarding this matter, which he considers as settled, simply because he read a report to the House, although he mentioned in a statement last week that it was the result of reports furnished by different inspectors. He takes it for granted, that because the report he read bears the signature of the Deputy Postmaster-General for Victoria that absolutely settles the matter. Surely we are entitled to know the names of the inspectors who made the reports on which that officer based his communication. I can easily understand that in diplomatic matters it might be advisable to suppress names in connexion with reports, but not where we are asked to vote the peoples money in this way. Although accusations of a very strong character had been made by one of the leading journals of Melbourne, and also by honorable members supporting the Government, yet the Prime Minister refused to give the House the information on a matter which he contends is settled. That is, I think, slighting Parliament, to say the least of it. Surely the representatives of the people are entitled to know the basis of the report of the Deputy Postmaster-General. I object very strongly to being treated in this fashion. I hope the Prime Minister will see that we are as much entitled to know these names as he is.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[447]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I have reason to know that the Department concerned has in its possession written statements by inspectors and officers responsible for the conduct of this work which justify the allegations that were made. On the first opportunity to-day I asked the Prime Minister that the written statements of inspectors and other responsible officers in the possession of the Department might be laid on the table. The honorable member for Parkes, and, I think, another honorable member, urged the same request, but the right honorable gentleman refused to lay the information on the table. During twenty years of parliamentary experience, I have never known a Government to refuse to lay on the table documents relating to a matter on all-fours with this. There may be papers respecting negotiations not completed, which a Government is justified in withholding temporarily, but I have never known a refusal on all-fours with that under discussion. It was stated in Saturdays Argus that a representative of that newspaper waited on a member of the Government, and asked to be allowed to see the papers, but was refused. The Prime Minister may plead justification for withholding the information from the press, though, in my view, his action was evidence of weakness ; but honorable members, in their representative capacity, have an absolute right to see these papers, and to know what complaints have been made, and how they have been dealt with. Why are Estimates submitted to Parliament if it is not for analysis and criticism, and how can the representatives of the people justify their election if Ministers will not inform them fully and clearly of the actual position of affairs when allegations are made such as have appeared in the press? What must be the result to the taxpayers of inefficiency in connexion with the public expenditure? We are asked to vote upwards of £4,000,000 on public works, and I protest against the action of the Government in refusing our requests for information, which is unprecedented in the history of British Parliaments.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[460]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

It shows that: our system of parliamentary government is being undermined, and that some other system unknown to responsible government, as the term is understood in the British Empire, is being substituted for it. I have never known or heard of an Opposition being treated as we are being treated by this uncouth Government. When an honorable member on this side of the House asks for information respecting any item of expenditure he is treated with contumely by Ministers, and is received with jeers by Ministerial supporters. How would honorable members opposite like to be treated in the same way if they were on this side of the House, and what sort of a time would a Government, no matter what its majority might be, have at their hands if they were in Opposition? I wish to institute a comparison between these items. The first item to which I refer reads,  Construction and extension of telephone lines, instruments, and material, including construction of conduit and placing wires underground - £234,600. We ask where these works are to be carried out, and we can get no reply. The next item is,  New trunk lines, for which £20,600 is asked, and no information is afforded as to where they are to be erected. Because we request this information we are treated with scorn, and as if we were guilty of gross impertinence in asking how the money we are; asked to vote is to be expended. There is another item,  Metallic circuits in existing single- wire networks - £[17,850. This is the amount asked for this service for New South Wales, but for the same service in Victoria no less than £98,500 is asked, although the population to be served in New South Wales is certainly very much greater than the population in Victoria. Surely it is reasonable that we should ask how this money is to be expended? We should be given some information also as to when the Government propose to establish silent telephones in New South Wales. The Minister who is supposed to be in charge of these Estimates is not paying the slightest attention to a word that is being said, and as a protest against this disgraceful way of dealing with, public expenditure I move -That the item  Metallic circuits in existing single-wire networks, ^98,500, be reduced by£*","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[527]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

At what period may we expect a big installation? The telephone system in Sydney gets worse every year ; it is more difficult now to get a satisfactory conversation than ever it was. I should be perfectly satisfied to hear that Ministers expect to bring about some radical alteration. Surely that is a matter on which we may very reasonably ask for an explanation of some sort or other. With what object are these huge sums being spent, and at what time may we expect a complete transformation of a system which is so unsatisfactory ? We are asked to vote £17,850 for metallic circuits in existing single-wire networks for New South Wales. In many of the other States I believe they have this system. InQueensland only a few pounds are to be spent in this direction ; a small amount is set down for South Australia, and a less amount for Tasmania; but in the worst place of all, so far as the utility of the telephone is concerned, there is practically nothing being spent to bring about the desired change. I should like to know from the Minister whether one of the bigger items in this subdivision is intended to achieve the result. There is nothing to indicate that that is the case, or what is being done by the Department in respect to making a reasonably silent system in Sydney in the near future.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[540]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

I do not think that in any other Parliament it could be possible. An honorable member informed me that he had reason to believe that a good deal of this expenditure, so far as Victoria is concerned, is intended to take place in the district of Wannon, whose representative sits behind the Minister perfectly silent, and who, I suppose, knows all about the matter. It was the honorable member for Bourke who gave me the information which I have imparted to the Committee. I do not think that he meant his communication to be regarded as confidential ; at any rate, he did not say so. I think that, if the honorable member for Wannon knows anything about the matter, he might come to the assistance of the Opposition, who are endeavouring to do their duty by the country, and give them the information which the Minister refuses to furnish, and, in order that he may have an opportunity to do so, I shall most cheerfully resume my seat and listen to his explanation.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[541]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

These miniature rifle ranges are very important, especially in view of the small amount of practice which our Junior Cadets are likely to get until they become older. As a matter of fact, nothing has been so neglected as the provision of facilities for rifle shooting. If our Cadets cannot shoot over the . big ranges, they must make the best possible use of the small ranges. Why is it that only £154 was expended last year out of the £4,090 appropriated, and is there this year a prospect of the whole amount of £6,100 being spent? I wish also to know what is the meaning of the item  Grants to rifle clubs for ranges. Are these private ranges which the Government subsidize ?

The Minister of Defence is distinctly sympathetic, and desires to assist them to the very best of his ability. The item  Grants to rifle clubs for ranges  relates more particularly to clubs formed in country districts, where members of the Military Forces do not engage in rifle practice, and where, for all practical purposes, the clubs control the whole business. Whilst last year only £4,259 was expended in this direction, we are asking this year for £8,200, and the Minister has assured me that he is hopeful that the whole amount will be spent. The honorable member for North Sydney knows that there are many thousands of cadets in the Commonwealth, all of whom have rifles, and it is necessary that we should provide racks for the reception of these weapons when they are not in use. The fact that the cadets are required to put them away in these racks is indicative of a certain amount of discipline and order, and reminds me of the saying of the old sailor who declared that there was a place for everything, and everything should be in its place. With the more accurate knowledge which we have gained since last year, we think that the expenditure of another £1,000 will fully equip the Forces in this particular direction. With regard to miniature rifles for cadets. I regret that only £154 was expended last year. The reason for that was that what were considered to be more important features in the development of the cadet movement were given first consideration. As to miniature rifle ranges, the Department was somewhat at a loss to know precisely where they should be placed, and how they should be controlled. Now it has been decided that they shall be at the schools, and the Minister is desirous that they shall be established at the earliest possible moment. The boys themselves are also keen.

Why not complete the immigrants depot if it is proposed to bring out immigrants for the Northern Territory during the year? If that is not the intention of the Minister, why does he ask for this vote? My own impression is that there will not be an immigrant for the Northern Territory during the present financial year. Much remains to be done before the Government attempt to invite immigrants to go into these tropical latitudes, and to begin to push them up there before we were ready to receive them would be to invite disaster.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[579]/continue/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"

There is practically no accommodation at present, because, although there are two or three hotels at Port Darwin, they are always full. Our idea is to erect a building where people - whether they come from the southern States or from any other part of the world - can be housed until they go inland. I think the work will cost more than £2,000, but I venture to say that we shall not be able to spend more than that amount during the present year. I should be very glad if we could, but I am afraid that, owing to the difficulties intimately associated with the Northern Territory, we shall not be able to spend more than the amount for which the item provides.","N/A","ADDITIONS, NEW WORKS, BUILDINGS, ETC","/hansard/chamber.xscript/debate[4]/speech[580]/talk.start/para","N/A","N/A"
